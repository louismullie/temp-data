## Question

Can you provide recommendations based on how alcohol will affect health

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how alcohol affects health and what recommendations can be made. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching epidemiology and whether there is a safe level of consumption. Then, I should verify dose–response relationships across major organ systems, especially cardiovascular, cancer, liver, brain, and blood pressure. Next, I will examine modifiers such as age, sex, genetics, and comorbidities. After that, I should review guideline evolution and current recommendations. Finally, I will translate this into practical, individualized clinical advice and highlight uncertainties and research gaps, ensuring I double-check conflicting evidence before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the big picture: alcohol is a leading global risk factor for death and disability, and the weight of contemporary evidence indicates there is no safe level of consumption when considering total health risk across the lifespan, with the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL) at zero standard drinks per week in many analyses, particularly for younger adults [^111sKK7R] [^1131Z5th] [^113mXxQz]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude: the Global Burden of Disease analyses attribute millions of deaths and DALYs to alcohol, and WHO classifies alcoholic beverages as a Group 1 carcinogen, reinforcing that risk begins at low levels and rises with dose [^111sKK7R] [^114jupR4].

> Wait, let me verify the dose–response patterns across systems before drawing conclusions. For cancer, the relationship is consistently linear without a threshold; even light intake increases risk for several cancers, including female breast, upper aerodigestive tract, liver, and colorectum, and cessation or reduction lowers risk, which argues against any "protective window" for malignancy [^114jupR4] [^1174qZzS] [^1124NjYF]. For cardiovascular disease, I initially thought there was a clear J-shaped curve with benefit at 1–2 drinks/day, but hold on, I should double-check newer causal methods: large-scale mendelian randomization and updated cohorts increasingly show that while observational studies suggest lower risk at low intake, genetic and bias-adjusted analyses indicate no cardiovascular benefit and possibly increased risk even at modest levels, especially for hypertension and atrial fibrillation, so I need to be cautious about inferring causality from observational J-curves [^1156yzrJ] [^112QP3Bi] [^111yVaVc]. For liver disease, risk rises steeply with increasing consumption, and for brain health, even moderate intake is associated with adverse structural and cognitive effects, with risk escalating beyond about 14 units/week, so I should not understate neurocognitive harm at "social" drinking levels [^111gM2ff].

> I need to check blood pressure effects carefully because patients often cite transient BP lowering after a drink. Acute biphasic effects show early BP reduction followed by rebound elevation after about 12 hours, and sustained intake is associated with higher hypertension prevalence. Importantly, reducing alcohol intake lowers BP in a dose-dependent fashion, particularly in those consuming more than two drinks per day, which supports advising reduction even for light-to-moderate drinkers with hypertension risk [^116siVqb] [^114t1DXx] [^111urW6L]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that light intake might lower long-term BP; that would be misleading — observational and interventional data converge on net harm to BP with regular use, and guidelines increasingly advise less alcohol or abstinence for optimal cardiovascular outcomes [^115kxFEN].

> Next, I should review modifiers that shift risk. Age is pivotal: for adults under 40, the TMREL is zero or near-zero in most regions due to injury risk, violence, and the lack of offsetting cardiovascular benefit, whereas in older adults, very small amounts may appear less harmful in some contexts, though cancer risk remains and absolute harm still rises with dose; thus, age-specific guidance is justified [^1131Z5th] [^113mXxQz]. Sex differences are nuanced; while many guidelines historically set higher limits for men, newer burden analyses suggest minimal sex variation in TMREL and NDE, and cancer risks like female breast cancer increase from the first drink, so I should avoid overstating sex-specific "safe" thresholds [^1131Z5th] [^1124NjYF]. Genetic susceptibility, particularly ALDH2 and ADH1B variants, modifies acetaldehyde exposure and cancer risk, and comorbidities such as liver disease, pregnancy, and alcohol use disorder warrant abstinence or very restrictive limits, so I need to individualize advice accordingly [^116CKXjQ] [^1136vprR] [^115xMKDi].

> I will now examine how guidelines have evolved, because this informs what we tell patients. Earlier guidance emphasized sex-specific daily limits and allowed for potential cardiovascular benefit, but recent updates increasingly adopt a "less is better" stance: the UK moved to 14 units/week for all adults with several drink-free days, Canada adopted risk zones with a continuum of harm and a TMREL of zero for many, and the American Cancer Society advises "it is best not to drink alcohol", with conditional limits if one drinks. The WHO has stated there is no safe amount that does not affect health, reflecting the cancer signal and broader burden data [^11521ewW] [^1165PBtZ] [^116kB7Uq] [^114tHrst]. Hold on, I should verify that these shifts align with the evidence base: yes, they mirror the convergence of linear cancer risk, diminishing cardiovascular benefit in causal analyses, and population-specific TMRELs near zero for younger adults [^111sKK7R] [^1131Z5th].

> Translating this into clinical recommendations, I need to ensure the advice is practical and risk-communicated clearly. For most adults, the healthiest choice is not to drink. If alcohol is used, stay within low-risk thresholds such as no more than 1 drink/day for women and 2 drinks/day for men, avoid binge drinking, spread intake over several days with drink-free days, and never drink and drive. Heavier drinkers benefit from cutting down, which lowers BP and cancer risk, and even modest reductions can improve health outcomes [^116kB7Uq] [^114t1DXx] [^114jupR4]. I should double-check that these limits align with current guidance: yes, they match ACS and USDA language while acknowledging that many authorities now frame any drinking as risk-additive rather than beneficial [^116kB7Uq] [^111sKK7R].

> But wait, what about patients with established cardiovascular disease or those at high cardiometabolic risk? Observational data in secondary prevention sometimes show lower mortality with light intake, yet these findings are vulnerable to confounding and reverse causation. Given potential harms from arrhythmias, hemorrhagic stroke, and medication interactions, I should generally advise minimizing or abstaining and prioritize proven therapies and lifestyle measures rather than prescribing alcohol [^112gumF5] [^111yVaVc]. I should confirm that this aligns with cardiology guidance: contemporary statements emphasize uncertainty about benefit and consistently warn against heavier use, reinforcing a conservative approach in CVD patients [^111yVaVc].

> For special populations, I need to be explicit. Pregnant or potentially pregnant patients should not drink at all given teratogenic risk and the absence of a demonstrated safe threshold. Patients with liver disease, including NAFLD with fibrosis, should abstain. Individuals with alcohol use disorder require screening, brief intervention, and consideration of pharmacotherapy. And older adults should generally reduce quantity due to altered pharmacokinetics and fall risk, even if frequency is lower [^115xMKDi] [^1136vprR] [^113ecBt4] [^115f7KeM]. Hold on, I should verify that these align with disease-specific guidance: yes, hepatology and addiction literature support abstinence in significant liver disease and endorse evidence-based AUD treatments, while geriatric sources caution about age-related vulnerability to alcohol [^1136vprR] [^113ecBt4] [^115f7KeM].

> I should also consider immediate and acute risks that patients may overlook. Even moderate intake acutely increases heart rate and can trigger arrhythmias, and in the hours after drinking there is a transient increase in cardiovascular event risk that attenuates within 24 hours, which complicates any narrative of short-term "protection" from a single drink. Counseling should include these time-dependent risks, especially in those with underlying disease [^116siVqb] [^114uFter]. Let me reconsider whether this contradicts the older observational J-curve: it does not negate it, but it underscores that apparent benefits are context- and time-dependent and may not translate into net clinical benefit when all outcomes are considered [^114m1AKs].

> Next, I should review uncertainties and evidence gaps so I do not overstate certainty. Large randomized trials of low-to-moderate alcohol consumption have been attempted but remain logistically and ethically challenging. Mendelian randomization reduces confounding but assumptions about linearity and genetic instruments can limit inference. And observational studies are persistently limited by exposure misclassification, reference group bias, and residual confounding, which collectively sustain the controversy despite converging public health conclusions [^112QP3Bi] [^111NJp48] [^116mEj9p]. I need to ensure my counseling communicates this uncertainty while emphasizing that the balance of contemporary evidence favors less alcohol or abstinence for most people [^114tHrst].

> Finally, I should integrate policy and behavior-change levers that patients can use. Evidence-based population strategies such as taxation, minimum unit pricing, reduced outlet density, and marketing restrictions reduce consumption and harms, and at the individual level, brief counseling, drink-tracking, and substitution with non-alcoholic beverages can support reduction; patients should be informed that even small downward shifts in intake confer measurable health gains, particularly for blood pressure, cancer risk, and injury prevention [^1145ZgTp] [^115YQyer] [^1165oqr5] [^114t1DXx]. Hold on, I should verify that these strategies have real-world impact: modeling and natural experiments show meaningful mortality and cost offsets from pricing and access policies, reinforcing the clinical message that drinking less is better and that supportive environments help sustain change [^115YQyer] [^112rA5z8].

> In summary, I need to ensure the core message is clear and actionable: no safe level of alcohol consumption is guaranteed for health, risk rises with dose, and the most defensible, evidence-aligned advice for most adults is to avoid alcohol or, if you drink, stay at or below 1 drink/day (women) or 2 drinks/day (men) without bingeing, with strong consideration of abstinence in youth, pregnancy, liver disease, and those with AUD. Any reduction from current intake lowers risk, and clinicians should personalize counseling to age, sex, genetics, comorbidities, and medications while communicating uncertainty transparently [^111sKK7R] [^1174qZzS] [^116kB7Uq] [^1131Z5th].

Alcohol use is a major preventable risk factor for disease and death [^111sKK7R], with **no safe level of intake** for cancer and a dose-dependent increase in risk for liver disease, hypertension, and injuries [^114jupR4] [^1174qZzS] [^1123ZqHK]. Light intake may lower ischemic heart disease risk in some older adults, but this is offset by cancer and other harms; **younger adults have no net benefit** [^1131Z5th] [^111oujPH]. For the lowest overall risk, **abstain or limit to ≤ 1 drink/day** (≤ 14 g/day), avoid binge drinking, and do not drink if pregnant, driving, or with liver disease [^116kB7Uq] [^115g8Yz3] [^1136vprR]. Reducing intake lowers blood pressure and cancer risk, and brief counseling improves outcomes [^114t1DXx] [^114jupR4] [^116gQ8Fe].

## Health risks associated with alcohol consumption

Alcohol is causally linked to **over 200 health conditions**, including:

- **Cancer**: At least 7 types, including breast, liver, and upper aerodigestive tract; no safe level for cancer [^114jupR4] [^1174qZzS].
- **Liver disease**: Steatosis, hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [^notfound].
- **Cardiovascular disease**: Hypertension, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and stroke [^111yVaVc] [^1123ZqHK].
- **Mental health**: Depression, anxiety, and alcohol use disorder [^113ecBt4].
- **Injuries**: Accidents, falls, and violence [^111sKK7R].

---

## Dose-response relationship

Health risks rise with intake; **even light drinking increases cancer risk** [^116kB7Uq] [^1174qZzS]. A J-shaped curve for cardiovascular outcomes reflects lower ischemic risk at low intake but higher overall harm from cancer and injuries, especially in younger adults [^116SeixE] [^111oujPH].

| **Health outcome** | **Risk at low intake** | **Risk at moderate intake** | **Risk at high intake** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Cancer | Increased risk | Higher risk | Highest risk |
| Cardiovascular disease | Possible slight reduction in ischemic events | Mixed effects | Increased risk |
| Liver disease | Minimal risk | Increased risk | Highest risk |
| Mental health | Minimal risk | Increased risk | Highest risk |
| Injuries | Minimal risk | Increased risk | Highest risk |

---

## Potential benefits of moderate alcohol consumption

Possible cardiovascular benefits are limited to **older adults** and are offset by cancer and other harms; younger adults have no net benefit [^1131Z5th] [^111oujPH]. Any benefits are modest and context dependent, so they should not guide recommendations [^111yVaVc].

---

## Vulnerable populations

Certain groups are at **higher risk** and should avoid alcohol:

- **Pregnant women**: No safe level; risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders [^115xMKDi].
- **Adolescents and young adults**: Higher injury and addiction risk [^113mXxQz].
- **Individuals with liver disease**: Increased risk of progression and complications [^1136vprR].
- **Individuals with alcohol use disorder**: Higher risk of relapse and harm [^113ecBt4].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines increasingly emphasize **less is better**:

- **General population**: ≤ 1 drink/day (≤ 14 g/day) for men and women [^notfound].
- **Pregnant women**: Abstain [^115xMKDi].
- **Young adults**: Abstain or minimize intake [^113mXxQz].
- **Individuals with liver disease**: Abstain [^notfound].

---

## Impact of reducing alcohol consumption

Reducing intake yields **immediate and long-term benefits**:

- **Blood pressure**: Dose-dependent reductions, especially in heavy drinkers [^114t1DXx].
- **Cancer risk**: Lower risk with reduced intake [^114jupR4].
- **Liver health**: Improved liver enzymes and reduced fibrosis risk.
- **Mental health**: Better mood, cognition, and lower depression risk [^notfound].

---

## Effective interventions for reducing alcohol consumption

Evidence-based interventions include:

- **Brief counseling**: Effective in primary care and emergency settings [^114heF7A].
- **Behavioral therapies**: Cognitive-behavioral and motivational approaches [^notfound].
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Naltrexone, acamprosate, and others [^notfound].
- **Policy measures**: Taxation, minimum pricing, and marketing restrictions [^1145ZgTp].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Alcohol poses **substantial health risks** with no safe level for cancer; light intake may benefit some older adults but increases overall harm, especially in younger populations. Abstain or limit to ≤ 1 drink/day, avoid binge drinking, and avoid alcohol in pregnancy, when driving, or with liver disease. Reducing intake lowers blood pressure and cancer risk, and brief counseling helps patients cut back.

### Female breast cancer and alcohol consumption: a review of the literature [^116oJK25]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Consumption of alcoholic beverages is one of the single most important known and modifiable risk factor for human cancer. Among women, breast cancer is the most common cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Consumption of alcoholic beverages is causally associated with female breast cancer and the association shows a linear dose-response relationship. The role of heavy drinking has been long recognized and even a moderate intake is associated with an increased risk for breast cancer. The present review is an update of the current evidence on the association between alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk. The aim is to gain further insight into this association and to improve our current understanding of the effects of the major modifying factors.

Evidence Acquisition

Epidemiologic and experimental studies published since the most recent International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monograph on alcoholic beverages were identified in PubMed using a combination of keywords such as alcohol, breast cancer, polymorphisms, menopausal status.

Evidence Synthesis

Cumulative lifetime consumption, drinking frequency, drinking patterns and timing of exposure each modulate the association between alcohol consumption and breast cancer. Hormonal status, genetic polymorphisms, and nutritional factors may interact with ethanol metabolism and further influence breast cancer risk.

Conclusions

Better standardization among experimental and epidemiologic designs in assessing alcohol intake and timing of exposure may improve our understanding of the heterogeneity observed across studies, possibly allowing the quantification of the effects of occasional heavy drinking and the identification of a window of higher susceptibility to breast cancer development.

### Alcohol use and cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111yVaVc]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Alcohol is one of the most commonly consumed substances in the world, exhibiting complex relationships with multiple aspects of cardiovascular health and disease. The majority of the research on the topic is observational and therefore prone to bias and confounding. The available evidence suggests no risk to possible risk reduction when alcohol is consumed in low amounts (such as no more than 1 to 2 drinks a day) in regard to coronary artery disease, stroke, sudden death, and possibly heart failure. The risk associated with consuming 1 to 2 drinks a day on atrial fibrillation remains unknown. More randomized trials of low to moderate alcohol consumption are needed for more definitive conclusions. In stark contrast, heavier alcohol consumption such as binge drinking or consuming on average ≥ 3 drinks/d is consistently associated with worse outcomes in every cardiovascular disease entity studied. Considering the level of evidence, it remains unknown whether drinking is part of a healthy lifestyle and therefore clinicians should reinforce healthy lifestyle behaviors such as regularly engaging in physical activity, avoiding tobacco use, and maintaining healthy body weight.

### Women's views on moderate and low alcohol consumption: stages of the subjective transition from pregnancy to postpartum [^115xMKDi]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Stopping alcohol consumption is one of the key health recommendations for expectant and breastfeeding mothers in many western countries and most women cease alcohol consumption when they become pregnant. Nevertheless, it is reported that about 10% of women worldwide consume alcohol during pregnancy and 16–25% of women in the European region, including Switzerland. During breastfeeding, results from international studies suggest that consumption is relatively common. Consequences of maternal alcoholism during pregnancy on the foetus's development have been well-documented since the late 1950s and recognised in research and clinical practice since the 1970s. Depending on the foetus's degree of maturity, the amount of alcohol consumed and individual disposition, high quantities of alcohol consumed during pregnancy can lead to a severe physical and cognitive developmental disorder named Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), the most severe form of Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Although the evidence is clear regarding high alcohol consumption and binge drinking and the severe consequences for child health, the evidence regarding low to moderate alcohol consumption in pregnant women is heterogeneous and leads to different conclusions. Flak et al. conducting a meta-analysis based on literature about the association between mild, moderate, and binge prenatal alcohol exposure and child neurodevelopment, conclude that there is no known safe amount of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Another systematic review conducted by Mamluk et al. focuses on studies of pregnant women estimating effects of low-to-moderate levels of alcohol consumption on pregnancy and longer term offspring outcomes. The authors highlight the paucity and poor quality of evidence and the limited evidence for a causal role of light drinking in pregnancy, compared with abstaining, on most of the outcomes examined. There is also limited evidence regarding the effects of low to moderate alcohol consumption by breastfeeding mothers on infant development. Some studies show that alcohol consumption may reduce lactation or disrupt infants' sleeping patterns, but there is no clear impact on developmental outcomes. As there is no definitive boundary between harmful and harmless alcohol consumption during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and FASD is still a prevalent alcohol development disability for many children, public health recommendations in Western countries are based on the precautionary principle. Pregnant and breastfeeding women are therefore advised to stop alcohol consumption no later than the onset of pregnancy to avoid any risk to the child. Generally speaking, pregnancy is perceived as an "at risk condition" where medical risks need to be monitored by health professionals all through the pregnancy. Health professionals offering antenatal and postnatal care are in a key position to ask women about their alcohol consumption and advise them that it is safest not to consume alcohol. In this rationale, it is the task of health professionals to increase women's compliance to be abstinent, because alcohol is teratogenic, and the subject is too complex to be able to predict any safe threshold of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Other scholars question the general recommendation for zero tolerance in official guidelines, especially due to the lack of evidence regarding the effects of light alcohol consumption. Mamluk et al. conclude that the unclear distinction between light drinking and abstinence is the biggest challenge for health professionals and pregnant women, leading to inconsistent recommendations and advice. Indeed, several studies indicate that health professionals give discordant advice to pregnant and breastfeeding women, from strict abstinence to tolerating low occasional consumption. Many authors therefore recommend consistent information about the effects of alcohol consumption on the developing baby as well as education for health care professionals to improve their counselling skills. Information and counselling about alcohol consumption seems to be widely accepted by pregnant and non-pregnant women and there is a clear need to address this topic in routine antenatal and postnatal care. Additionally, a high amount of responsibility is attributed to the women themselves, who in public discourse are seen as mainly responsible for the foetus's wellbeing and thus for risk minimisation. As alcohol consumption during pregnancy and breastfeeding is associated with taboos and fear of stigmatisation, a conversational approach based on a trusting relationship seems promising to increase women's readiness to talk about their habits. Furthermore, understanding the individual perspective of women and their social context is necessary for the design and successful implementation of women-centred health interventions.

### Towards new recommendations to reduce the burden of alcohol-induced hypertension in the European union [^115Z6TpU]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The evidence for alcohol interventions to reduce BP

Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that alcohol consumption and hypertension are linked in a dose-dependent fashion, although there may be a threshold level for alcohol consumption below which there are no effects, especially for women (for indirect evidence see). As indicated by the potential threshold, the dose-response relationship is not linear over the full range of alcohol consumption, but for both sexes there is a monotonic dose-response relationship for higher levels of consumption, and thus hazardous/harmful drinking and AUDs are closely associated with elevated BP and/or hypertension. The above described association between hazardous/harmful alcohol consumption and hypertension has been judged as causal, which means that a logical intervention to reduce BP is to reduce alcohol consumption.

Indeed, several studies support the efficacy and effectiveness of interventions to decrease alcohol consumption in reducing BP levels, with a clinically meaningful decline in BP occurring within a few weeks after reductions in alcohol intake among hypertensive patients. The most comprehensive systematic review and meta-analyses on the effect of alcohol consumption on BP in trials lasting at least 7 days (median duration: 4 weeks) found that, above a baseline drinking level of two drinks per day (drink size was assumed to be 12 g pure alcohol), reduction in alcohol intake was associated with BP reduction. The higher the alcohol consumption at baseline, the greater the reduction in alcohol consumption and in BP levels. The effect could also be shown for people with hypertension. The evidence supporting this intervention is of the highest possible grade, as it is based on a systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of interventions to reduce BP in both normotensives and hypertensives, with adequate control groups (for the importance of control groups specifically in the area of interventions for lowering BP see the paper by Patel et al.).

The available evidence has led to standard formulations in European and Canadian guidelines for the management of hypertension in the past decades to address lifestyle factors, including alcohol. In fact, most guidelines, including those from the NICE, stipulate that all patients undergoing assessment or treatment for hypertension should receive initial and periodic lifestyle advice, which includes ascertaining their alcohol consumption and encouraging a reduced intake if they drink hazardously.

The situation in the US is slightly different. Although American Society of Hypertension Community Guidelines briefly mention the contribution of alcohol to raised BP, the association between alcohol consumption and raised BP is not even mentioned in the main national hypertension guidelines or in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines regarding lifestyle management to reduce cardiovascular risk.

### Managing alcohol use disorder in primary health care [^111QCBMa]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Heavy drinking is a cause of ill-health and premature death. Even though heavy drinking can be prevented and managed, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has estimated that as many as four out of five heavy drinking individuals do not receive an offer of evidence-based advice and treatment. As a lifestyle risk factor, alcohol consumption is a leading cause of global ill-health and premature death, making action to prevent and treat heavy drinking a priority for policy and practice. In this overview, we critically evaluate recent literature on primary health care-based interventions for managing heavy drinking. We begin with a brief summary of the epidemiology of heavy drinking, including an examination of the relevancy and utility of the various definitions of problem drinking currently in use. We move on to summarise the findings of latest research on interventions for heavy drinking, with a specific focus on screening and brief alcohol advice. We conclude with some observations on the current challenges faced by the field, including thoughts on how the slow rate of implementation might be addressed.

### Association between patterns of alcohol consumption (beverage type, frequency and consumption with food) and risk of adverse health outcomes: a prospective cohort study [^114juRVS]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

However, none of the previous research studies have comprehensively investigated different dimensions of alcohol consumption patterns together and its potential effects on risk of adverse health outcomes. Secondly, most previous research has used non-drinkers as the reference category which makes the direct comparison of different patterns of alcohol consumption on health outcomes difficult. Hence, there is currently a lack of evidence to support recommendations about the frequency of alcohol consumption, whether alcohol is best consumed with or without food, and the type of alcoholic beverage.

The aim of this study is to examine the combined effect of various patterns of alcohol consumption on risk of adverse health outcomes among regular alcohol drinkers, adjusting for average amount of weekly alcohol consumption.

### American cancer society guideline for diet and physical activity for cancer prevention [^112RVv5J]. CA (2020). High credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) guideline — Alcohol consumption and cancer prevention — Alcohol consumption is identified as the third major modifiable cancer risk factor after tobacco use and excess body weight. A standard drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits, which contain approximately 14 grams of ethanol. Alcohol consumption is an established cause of at least 7 types of cancer, with IARC reports documenting sufficient evidence for cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) and liver and sufficient evidence for colorectal and female breast cancers; ethanol in alcoholic beverages is carcinogenic to humans, and both ethanol and acetaldehyde are a cause of cancers of the UADT. Alcohol also interacts synergistically with tobacco to increase the risk of UADT cancers considerably more than either exposure alone, and evidence shows that consumption of any amount of alcohol increases risk of some types of cancer, most notably breast cancer. The guideline states, "Recommendation: It is best not to drink alcohol", and for those who do drink, people should limit intake to no more than 1 drink per day for women and 2 drinks per day for men. In 2016, approximately 50.7% of the US population aged ≥ 12 years reported current alcohol consumption.

### Effects on alcohol consumption of announcing and implementing revised UK low-risk drinking guidelines: findings from an interrupted time series analysis [^11521ewW]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The UK's Chief Medical Officers updated their guidelines for low-risk alcohol consumption in 2016, following a review that was a key component of the Government's 2012 alcohol strategy. The new guidelines for men and women recommend that 'to keep health risks from alcohol to a low level, it is safest not to drink more than 14 units a week on a regular basis' (Department of Health, p4). One UK unit is 10 mL or 8 g of pure ethanol and 14 units is approximately 6 pints of average strength beer, a bottle and a half of wine or 14 single measures of spirits. The new guidelines also recommend limiting the amount consumed on any single occasion, having several drink-free days each week and spreading consumption over 3 or more days if drinking as much as 14 units a week.

The previous guidelines recommended that men should not regularly drink more than 3–4 units per day and women not more than 2–3 units per day. Therefore, the guidelines have changed in three main ways: by moving from a daily to a weekly guideline, by equalising the guideline for men and women and by reducing the guideline for men by approximately one-third.

Promotion of the revised guidelines has been limited. The UK Government announced and began implementing the guidelines in January 2016 via a press release that was titled 'New alcohol guidelines show increased risk of cancer' and which emphasised the risk of cancer for drinkers consuming only small amounts of alcohol. News and social media gave the announcement substantial attention, and most news coverage reported the guidelines in a factual manner. However, a minority of articles criticised the focus on cancer risks from moderate drinking and associated statements by the Chief Medical Officer for England, who suggested that drinkers must choose between wine and cancer. After the initial announcement, there was no mass media campaign or other large-scale activity to promote the guidelines by any organisation until two brief campaigns in September 2018 and March 2019, which are outside our study period. Alcohol producers also did not update the guidelines provided on product labels.

### Alcohol and genetic polymorphisms: effect on risk of alcohol-related cancer [^116CKXjQ]. The Lancet: Oncology (2009). Medium credibility.

Public health guidelines aim to limit the consumption of alcoholic beverages worldwide and the subsequent health burden. In particular, alcohol consumption is an avoidable risk factor for cancer. In human beings, ethanol in alcoholic drinks is mainly oxidised in the liver by alcohol dehydrogenases to acetaldehyde, and is further detoxified to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenases. Functional variants in genes involved in alcohol metabolism result in differences between individuals in exposure to carcinogenic acetaldehyde, suggesting a possible interaction of genetic susceptibility and alcohol exposure in cancer. We reviewed available studies of the combined effects of alcohol drinking and genetic polymorphisms on alcohol-related cancer risk. Most available data were for polymorphisms in alcohol and folate metabolism. We give an overview of published studies on the combined effects of alcohol drinking and polymorphisms in genes for alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), cytochrome P450 2E1, and methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase on the risk of alcohol-related cancer. Current data lend support to a role of polymorphisms ADH1B and ALDH2 combined with alcohol consumption in cancer. Other available data are insufficient or inconclusive, highlighting the need for additional studies.

### Health and cancer risks associated with low levels of alcohol consumption [^1124NjYF]. The Lancet: Public Health (2023). High credibility.

The overall risks and harms resulting from alcohol consumption have been systematically assessed and are well documented. According to the latest WHO estimates, alcohol consumption contributed to 3 million deaths in 2016 globally and was responsible for 5·1% of the global burden of disease and injury. Alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of many health conditions and is the main and sufficient cause for several disorders, including alcohol dependence, liver cirrhosis, and several other non-communicable diseases and mental health conditions. Alcohol use is among the leading risk factors for premature mortality and disability because of its causal relationship with multiple health conditions, which also include non-intentional injuries and suicides. Younger people are disproportionately affected by alcohol compared with older people, and 13·5% of all deaths among those aged 20–39 years are attributed to alcohol. Disadvantaged and vulnerable populations have increased rates of alcohol-related death and hospitalisation.

Alcohol, as classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, is a toxic, psychoactive, and dependence-producing substance and a Group 1 carcinogen that is causally linked to seven types of cancer, including oesophagus, liver, colorectal, and breast cancers. Alcohol consumptions is associated with 740 000 new cancer cases each year globally.

In the EU, light to moderate alcohol consumption (< 20 g of pure alcohol per day, which is equivalent to consumption of approximately < 1·5 L of wine [12% alcohol by volume; ABV], < 3·5 L of beer [5% ABV], or < 450 mL of spirits [40% ABV] per week) was associated with almost 23 000 new cancer cases in 2017, accounting for 13·3% of all alcohol-attributable cancers and for 2·3% of all cases of the seven alcohol-related cancer types. Almost half of these cancers (approximately 11 000 cases) were female breast cancers. Also, more than a third of the cancer cases attributed to light to moderate drinking (approximately 8500 cases) were associated with a light drinking level (< 10 g per day).

### Understanding the differential effect of alcohol consumption on the relation between socio-economic position and alcohol-related health problems: results from the stockholm public health cohort [^116w79df]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The results of this study show that consuming alcohol and engaging in HED appears to be more harmful to individuals with low SEP compared to individuals with high SEP in Stockholm, Sweden. The differential effects of average alcohol consumption were mainly explained by an equal distribution of HED. For the differential effects of HED, all factors included contributed a little towards explaining the SEP differences in alcohol‐related health problems.

### Alcohol consumption, drinking patterns, and ischemic heart disease: a narrative review of meta-analyses and a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of heavy drinking occasions on risk for moderate drinkers [^116SeixE]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol consumption is a major global risk factor for mortality and morbidity. Much discussion has revolved around the diverse findings on the complex relationship between alcohol consumption and the leading cause of death and disability, ischemic heart disease (IHD).

Methods

We conducted a systematic search of the literature up to August 2014 using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to identify meta-analyses and observational studies examining the relationship between alcohol drinking, drinking patterns, and IHD risk, in comparison to lifetime abstainers. In a narrative review we have summarized the many meta-analyses published in the last 10 years, discussing the role of confounding and experimental evidence. We also conducted meta-analyses examining episodic heavy drinking among on average moderate drinkers.

Results

The narrative review showed that the use of current abstainers as the reference group leads to systematic bias. With regard to average alcohol consumption in relation to lifetime abstainers, the relationship is clearly J-shaped, supported by short-term experimental evidence and similar associations within strata of potential confounders, except among smokers. Women experience slightly stronger beneficial associations and also a quicker upturn to a detrimental effect at lower levels of average alcohol consumption compared to men. There was no evidence that chronic or episodic heavy drinking confers a beneficial effect on IHD risk. People with alcohol use disorder have an elevated risk of IHD (1.5- to 2-fold). Results from our quantitative meta-analysis showed that drinkers with average intake of < 30 g/day and no episodic heavy drinking had the lowest IHD risk (relative risk = 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.53 to 0.71). Drinkers with episodic heavy drinking occasions had a risk similar to lifetime abstainers (relative risk = 1.12, 95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.37).

Conclusions

Epidemiological evidence for a beneficial effect of low alcohol consumption without heavy drinking episodes is strong, corroborated by experimental evidence. However, episodic and chronic heavy drinking do not provide any beneficial effect on IHD. Thus, average alcohol consumption is not sufficient to describe the risk relation between alcohol consumption and IHD. Alcohol policy should try to reduce heavy drinking patterns.

### Effect of provision of non-alcoholic beverages on alcohol consumption: a randomized controlled study [^114huyGr]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Excessive alcohol consumption is a global public health issue. In 2020, an estimated 1.34 billion people (1.03 billion males and 310 million females) consumed a harmful amount of alcohol, and more than 3 million people are dying from alcohol-related problems per year worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) claims that excessive drinking not only causes health problems, including alcoholism, but also leads to other serious issues, including domestic violence and traffic accidents due to drunk driving. Thus, it is recommending evidence-based measures such as price increases and taxation on alcohol beverages, permitting only certified stores to sell alcohol, and strengthening penalties for underage drinking and drunk driving. Japan is relatively permissive regarding drinking: for instance, there is an "all-you-can-drink" system in some restaurants, and alcoholic beverages are available for purchase 24 hours a day, every day throughout the year. The need for measures to improve this situation has been pointed out in an international report.

In Japan, efforts to reduce excessive drinking have been made through Health Japan 21, a program that constitutes Japan's primary prevention strategy, and the enforcement of the Basic Law on Measures to Prevent Damage to Health Due to Alcohol, but their effects have been insufficient. The "amount of alcohol that increases the risk of lifestyle diseases" is defined in Japan as pure alcohol consumption (hereinafter referred to as "alcohol consumption") of 40 g/day or more in men and 20 g/day or more in women. In 2019, it was reported that compared to 2010, the percentage of people who drank the above amounts did not increase or decrease in men and significantly increased in women. One of the critical goals of Health Japan 21 is to reduce the number of people who drink alcohol in amounts that increase the risk of lifestyle diseases, and since this has not been achieved, it is necessary to take additional measures.

### Extrahepatic health effects of alcohol use and alcohol-associated liver disease [^113Aemn2]. Clinical Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a growing public health concern and an important contributor to global morbidity and mortality. While the hepatotoxic effects of alcohol are well known, the adverse effects of alcohol are manifested in almost every organ system. With the growing public health impact of AUD, the aim of this narrative review is to highlight the epidemiology and burden of AUD and its association with extrahepatic diseases including malignancy and disorders of the gastrointestinal (GI), cardiovascular, immunologic, neurologic, endocrine, and hematologic systems.

Methods

A narrative review of the literature was performed to identify studies addressing the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and therapy of extrahepatic health manifestations of alcohol use.

Findings

In the United States, an estimated 14.5 million people have AUD and approximately 88,000 adults die yearly due to alcohol-related causes. The consumption of alcohol and AUD is associated with injuries, violence, cancers, nonmalignant conditions of the GI system, infections, effects on the cardiovascular system, and neurodegenerative diseases. These conditions contribute to the increased mortality associated with AUD and are burdensome to patients and caregivers.

Implications

Increased awareness of the extrahepatic manifestations of AUD, screening for AUD using validated screening tools, such as the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise (AUDIT-C) score, and offering evidence-based interventions to patients with AUD is imperative to reduce the public health burden of AUD. Although historically controversial, recent evidence suggests that any level of alcohol consumption can have negative health consequences. Further research is warranted to determine if any amount of alcohol is safe for consumption. Public health efforts are warranted to help curtail the growing burden of AUD.

### Epidemiology and alcohol policy in Europe [^1176cwBe]. Addiction (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

To describe three aspects of the epidemiology of alcohol-attributable deaths in Europe, dose, demography and place, and to illustrate how such knowledge can better be used to inform alcohol policy formulation and implementation.

Design

epidemiological and population health modeling.

Setting

Europe.

Participants

Based on country-specific aggregate statistics.

Exposure

country-specific adult per capita consumption triangulated with survey data; outcomes: mortality statistics.

Findings

The absolute risk of dying from an alcohol-attributable disease and injury (accounting for a protective effect for ischaemic diseases) increases with increasing daily alcohol consumption beyond 10 g alcohol per day, the first data point. Over 2/3 of all alcohol-attributable deaths occurring amongst the 20–64 year old population of the European Union (minus Cyprus and Malta) occur in the 45–64 year olds. About 25% of the difference in life expectancy between western and eastern Europe for men aged 20–64 years in 2002 can be attributed to alcohol, largely, but not exclusively, as a result of differences in heavy episodic drinking patterns.

Conclusions

Any reduction in the dose of alcohol consumed, at least down to 10 g/day, will reduce the annual and lifetime risk of an alcohol-related death. There is a need for alcohol policy to focus on measures in reducing alcohol consumption, throughout middle age, with immediacy of impact. Policy should strive to reduce alcohol-related health inequalities, with the specific recommendations for policy depending on the cost-effectiveness of interventions related to the epidemiological profile of the country or region under consideration. Fortunately, there are evidence-based policy options that reduce the amount of alcohol consumed and many alcohol-related harms with immediate effect, that reduce the risk of an alcohol-related death in middle age, and that would help to close the health gap between eastern and western Europe.

### Where is the science? A critical interrogation of how sex and gender are used to inform low-risk alcohol use guidelines [^114Vvxzb]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Across the globe, many countries publish low-risk alcohol guidelines which outline the recommended best practices for drinking limits to reduce the health risks and harms associated with excessive alcohol use. Frequently, low-risk drinking guidelines include different recommendations for cisgender men and women. As researchers working in the area of trans-inclusive substance use treatment and care, we are interested in the rationale for how gender-based low-risk drinking guidelines are determined, including the role of evidence and science. We argue that low-risk drinking guidelines based on sex and/or gender are highly insufficient and not engaging with a robust evidence base, and we further argue that it is important that we attend to these concepts correctly as we develop clinical and public health guidelines, which will undeniably have an impact on the individuals and societies who rely on them.

### The high harm score of alcohol. time for drug policy to be revisited? [^116uGEEL]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this paper is to create awareness of the negative health impact and economic burden and benefits associated to alcohol consumption. Worldwide about two billion people consume alcohol. Low intake of alcohol has a minor protective cardiovascular effect. On the other hand, even moderate alcohol consumption appears to be weakly, but significantly, associated to a limited number of chronic diseases. Alcohol causes a considerable economic burden to society due to the high absolute number of alcohol consumers. As such, alcohol abuse is more harmful for public health and society than illicit drug use. Some 3.7% of alcohol consumers (worldwide 76 million people) have an alcohol use disorder leading to 60–70% of the societal costs related to alcohol. Therefore, policy measures should, in addition to regulatory measures to reduce alcohol use, aim at closing the treatment gap and improving treatment effectiveness of people with an alcohol use disorder. The key message is that policy-makers unjustifiably focus on the harm of illicit drugs, whereas they underestimate the harm of alcohol use. Policy makers should therefore consider alcohol to be at least as harmful as illicit drugs and invest more in prevention and harm reduction strategies for alcohol abuse and dependence.

### Population-level risks of alcohol consumption by amount, geography, age, sex, and year: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2020 [^113mXxQz]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

We show that the estimation of the health effects associated with alcohol use requires consideration of both the relationship between alcohol consumption and disease outcomes, and the observed disease rates in each population. We found that the population-level health risks associated with low levels of alcohol consumption varied across regions and were greater for younger populations than for older populations. Although we did not find significant differences in the risks of ill health by sex or by year, we did find that males made up 76·9% (95% UI 73·0–81·3) of the population consuming harmful amounts of alcohol in 2020. Notably, 1·03 billion (0·851–1·19) males and 312 million (199–432) females drank harmful amounts of alcohol in excess of the NDE in 2020. Harmful use of alcohol was particularly concentrated in males aged 15–39 years, primarily in Australasia, western Europe, and central Europe. These findings highlight the need for tailored guidelines that discourage alcohol consumption among young people, as well as alcohol control policies and interventions that are targeted especially towards young males.

### Alcohol consumption in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: yes, or no? [^1133ccF4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Excessive alcohol intake is an established risk factor for chronic liver disease. At the same time, moderate alcohol intake appears to reduce cardiovascular morbidity. Accordingly, recommendations for alcohol intake in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), who are at increased risk for liver-related and cardiovascular events, are a point of debate. Some studies have shown beneficial effects of alcohol on cardiovascular and overall mortality in this specific subset of patients. Nonetheless, even light alcohol intake appears to aggravate liver disease and increase the risk of hepatocellular cancer. Therefore, patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or advanced fibrosis should be advised against consuming alcohol. On the other hand, only light alcohol consumption (< 10 g/day) might be permitted in patients without significant hepatic fibrosis, provided that they are carefully followed-up. As the research field focusing on NAFLD keeps widening, more prospective studies regarding this specific subject are expected, and may provide a basis for less ambiguous recommendations.

### Population-level risks of alcohol consumption by amount, geography, age, sex, and year: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2020 [^112vQosx]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol use accounted for 1·78 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1·39–2·27) deaths in 2020 and was the leading risk factor for mortality among males aged 15–49 years (Bryazka D, unpublished). The relationship between moderate alcohol use and health is complex, as shown in multiple previous studies. Alcohol consumption at any level is associated with health loss from several diseases, including liver cirrhosis, breast cancer, and tuberculosis, as well as injuries. At the same time, some studies have found that consumption of small amounts of alcohol lowers the risk of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. As a corollary, the amount of alcohol that minimises health loss is likely to depend on the distribution of underlying causes of disease burden in a given population. Since this distribution varies widely by geography, age, sex, and time, the level of alcohol consumption associated with the lowest risk to health would depend on the age structure and disease composition of that population.

Two quantities are crucially relevant when formulating effective, evidence-based guidelines and alcohol-control policies: the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), which represents the level of consumption that minimises health loss from alcohol for a population, and the non-drinker equivalence (NDE) level, which measures the level of alcohol consumption at which the risk of health loss for a drinker is equivalent to that of a non-drinker. The majority of studies to date consider one or a small subset of health outcomes associated with alcohol consumption at a time, although several broader systematic meta-analyses have been done. Findings from these studies vary in their estimates of the TMREL. Several studies have found evidence of a J-shaped relationship between alcohol use and all-cause mortality. However, others have reported that the all-cause or attributable cause burden weighted TMREL of alcohol is zero standard drinks per day. Uncertainty about the effect of alcohol on all-cause health loss results from differences in the relative disease composition between studies, conflicting studies on individual health outcomes, differences in study covariates and methods, estimation of drinking patterns, as well as issues relating to selection bias.

### Cardiovascular effects of alcohol consumption [^11647QT1]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Alcohol consumption has a major but complex impact on cardiovascular diseases. Both irregular and chronic heavy drinking occasions detrimentally impact on most major cardiovascular disease categories, whereas light to moderate drinking has been associated with beneficial effects on ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke. Both detrimental and beneficial effects of alcohol consumption have been corroborated by biochemical pathways. The impact of alcohol consumption on cardiovascular disease should be evaluated within the context of other effects of alcohol on health.

### Trajectories of alcohol consumption in relation to all-cause mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease: a 35-year prospective cohort study [^115K6d2A]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of premature mortality and a major contributor to disability. Globally, the number of prevalent CVD cases has increased rapidly since 1990, reaching 523 million in 2019. The association between moderate alcohol consumption and reduced risk of CVD is well‐documented and heatedly debated. However, relatively few studies have focused on patients who have already experienced a CVD event and the effects that alcohol drinking may have on their subsequent health. A recent meta‐analysis suggests that drinking up to 105 g of ethanol per week is associated with lower risks of mortality and subsequent cardiovascular events than non‐drinking in those with established CVD. It is noteworthy that this threshold is lower than the upper limits of drinking recommended in most current guidelines.

Similar to the critiques of studies on general populations, the evidence among CVD patients is far from robust for several important reasons. First, most studies (11 of 14) included in the meta‐analysis only looked at the association cross‐sectionally, despite evidence that drinking behaviours change over time and that misclassification of alcohol intake has the potential to bias the risk estimates. Longitudinal prospective assessment of intake is needed to accurately measure long‐term exposure to alcohol, and this is particularly relevant when studying biological processes that cause chronic effects on health. Secondly, in those few studies of CVD patients that did include longitudinal assessment of alcohol and subsequent health risks, the methodology used can be questioned. In most cases these studies categorized the patients into different drinking groups according to each patient's average intake during follow‐up, with no accounting for intra‐individual variation in drinking levels over time. Failure to capture such variation may result in over‐simplistic interpretation of alcohol use and consequent outcomes, as there is evidence from general population samples that unstable drinking patterns confer increased risks for coronary heart disease (CHD) and total mortality independent of average intake. Thirdly, these studies often included former drinkers (who might have quit in response to ill health) in the non‐drinking group, which could erroneously lead to a suggested protective effect of drinking compared to non‐drinking. Indeed, when former drinkers were excluded from the meta‐analysis, the protective effect of moderate drinking on all‐cause mortality among CVD patients was eliminated. Fourthly, most studies also had a heterogeneous group of patients with incident or recurrent CVD events and did not adequately account for concurrent changes in other life‐style and health factors, such as smoking, which is associated both with levels of drinking and with mortality and thus might confound the results.

### Health and cancer risks associated with low levels of alcohol consumption [^1174qZzS]. The Lancet: Public Health (2023). High credibility.

Increasing levels of alcohol use are associated with increasing levels of risk of illness and mortality, leading to the question of whether a safe level of alcohol consumption that is associated with zero risk of health consequences can be defined. To identify a safe level of alcohol consumption, scientific evidence is required to show the absence of increased risk of illness or injury associated with alcohol consumption at and below that level. Some, but not all, studies have suggested that light alcohol consumption could have a small protective effect, as measured by the risk of some cardiovascular diseases or type 2 diabetes. Some studies show the existence of such effects on certain types of cardiovascular diseases in middle-aged and older people. However, several reviews also found that the protective effects of moderate consumption disappear with heavy episodic drinking, which increases the risk of any cardiovascular diseases.

No studies have shown that the potential existence of a protective effect for cardiovascular diseases or type 2 diabetes also reduces the risk of cancer for an individual consumer. Evidence does not indicate the existence of a particular threshold at which the carcinogenic effects of alcohol start to manifest in the human body. As such, no safe amount of alcohol consumption for cancers and health can be established. Alcohol consumers should be objectively informed about the risks of cancer and other health conditions associated with alcohol consumption.

### Alcohol and ideal cardiovascular health: the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis [^115gfiUY]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Globally, heavy alcohol consumption is responsible for considerable socioeconomic burden causing 3.3 million deaths in 2012. 1, 2 In the United States, an estimated 62 000 men and 26 000 women die annually from alcohol‐related causes 1, 3 which makes alcohol the third leading preventable cause of death, behind tobacco use, and poor dietary habits/physical inactivity. 1, 4 Alcohol misuse in the United States cost approximately $250 billion in 2010 and 3/4 of this was attributable to binge drinking. 1, 5 However, literature is replete with research suggesting an inverse relationship between light to moderate alcohol consumption and cardiovascular disease (CVD), as well as all‐cause mortality. 6, 7 For example, a review of 84 studies reported that alcohol consumption of 1 drink or less per day was consistently associated with a 14% to 25% reduction in the risk of all the health outcomes evaluated, which included CVD, compared to those who abstained from alcohol. 7 Although the effects of alcohol on CVD has been well researched and documented, 8, 9 research exploring the association between alcohol consumption and intermediate measures of cardiovascular health (CVH), assessed using the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 (LS7) metrics, 10, 11 is sparse. 12 Even less is known about sex, age, and race/ethnic differences in these associations. The LS7 metrics were introduced to measure and monitor the CVH of individuals and populations where ideal CVH is defined as the presence of both ideal health behaviors (non‐smoking, body mass index [BMI] < 25 kg/m², physical activity at goal levels and diet consistent with guidelines) and ideal health factors (untreated total cholesterol ≤ 200 mg/dL, untreated blood pressure < 120/mg and untreated fasting blood glucose < 100 mg/dL). 10, 11 We examined the cross‐sectional associations between alcohol consumption and ideal CVH using data from the Multi‐Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large multi‐center prospective cohort study. We hypothesized that heavy alcohol consumption will be associated with worse CVH independent of sociodemographic factors, which include age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, and health insurance status.

### Screening and behavioral counseling interventions to reduce unhealthy alcohol use in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116gQ8Fe]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Terminology for unhealthy alcohol use from ASAM and WHO clarifies levels and consequences. Low-risk use/lower-risk use is consumption of alcohol below the amount identified as hazardous and in situations not defined as hazardous. Unhealthy use is any alcohol use that increases the risk or likelihood of health consequences or has already led to health consequences. Hazardous use is a pattern of substance use that increases the risk of harmful consequences and is of public health significance despite the absence of a current alcohol use disorder. Harmful use is a pattern of drinking that is already causing damage to health, either physical (eg, liver damage from chronic drinking) or mental (eg, depressive episodes secondary to heavy alcohol use).

### Association of alcohol consumption with selected cardiovascular disease outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114D4ZiD]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Our review also highlights other important aspects of the relation between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular disease. Firstly, the lower risk of coronary heart disease associated with alcohol consumption was at least as strong for women as for men. Limited evidence suggests that the risk of stroke related to alcohol is lower for women than men, but this may only reflect lower alcohol intake among women. Secondly, inclusion of former drinkers did not seem to bias the association of alcohol consumption with cardiovascular disease. Thirdly, when studies were summarised chronologically, we found that the overall association between drinking and cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease became apparent at least a decade ago, and ongoing studies have done little to revise the estimated associations.

An argument for causation

From the extensive body of literature summarised here, the association between alcohol consumption and decreased cardiovascular risk is not in question, as additional research has not changed this conclusion. Rather, the lingering question is whether this association is causal. Clearly, observational studies cannot establish causation. However, when the present results are coupled with those from our companion review paper summarising interventional mechanistic studies focusing on biomarkers associated with cardiovascular disease, the argument for causation becomes more compelling. Indeed, the mechanistic biomarker review shows biological plausibility for a causal association by showing favourable changes in pathophysiologically relevant molecules.

Therefore, we can now examine the argument for causation based on Hill's criteria. Beyond the biological plausibility argument discussed above, there is an appropriate temporal relation with alcohol use preventing cardiovascular disease. Secondly, we have observed a greater protective association with increasing dose, except that it seems to be offset somewhat by negative associations with the risk of haemorrhagic stroke. Thirdly, the protective association of alcohol has been consistently observed in diverse patient populations and in both women and men. Fourthly, the association is specific: moderate drinking (up to 1 drink or 12.5 g alcohol per day for women and 2 drinks or 25 g alcohol per day for men) is associated with lower rates of cardiovascular disease but is not uniformly protective for other conditions, such as cancer. Lastly, the reduction in risk is notable even when controlling for known confounders (such as smoking, diet, and exercise). Any potential unmeasured confounder would need to be very strong to explain away the apparently protective association.

### Chronic heavy drinking and ischaemic heart disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115vekBG]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

For some time the alcohol-heart relationship has been a controversial topic in heart disease epidemiology. The relationship between average alcohol consumption and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) is usually described as a J-shaped curve in epidemiological studies. Several meta-analyses have shown a protective association of some form of average alcohol consumption on IHD outcomes, with short-term experimental studies showing support for an effect on several surrogate biomarkers for elevated IHD risk; these protective associations were quite strong and comparable to preventive measures for IHD, such as physical activity. The protective association seems to be not only relatively strong in magnitude, but also to include a wide range of average alcohol consumption. In particular, one meta-analysisconcluded that there was an inverse relation with no detrimental effect on IHD from alcohol consumption even among chronic heavy drinkers (∼25% risk reduction). However, another meta-analysisreached a very different conclusion with regard to IHD mortality among chronic heavy drinkers (no beneficial effect), and a similar conclusion with a risk reduction for IHD morbidity (beneficial effect). This underlines the importance of stratifying analyses by IHD outcome when examining evidence for the relationship between alcohol consumption and IHD. Additionally, using current abstainers as the referent (ie, the inclusion of former drinkers in the reference group) might lead to overestimation of any potential protective effects, and adjustment for potential confounding has not been optimal in many studies. The specific risk of chronic heavy drinking in comparison to abstainers taking into account these important conceptual and study design issues has not been systematically examined before and it is currently unclear whether chronic heavy drinking has a protective, neutral, or detrimental association with IHD. Furthermore, population studies often times miss many chronic heavy drinkers in order to maximise follow-up or because of other sampling issues. A good example of optimisation for follow-up availability is the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Inadvertently, these samples mostly contain more favourable drinking behaviour, such as low and regular alcohol consumption within a certain stratum of the socioeconomic continuum in high-income countries. However, as is increasingly evident in middle-income countries, this is not the drinking pattern observed globally, which is characterised by more heavy drinking occasions. Among participants missed in typical cohort studies is a subgroup of chronic heavy drinkers, namely people with alcohol use disorders (AUD), who may drink considerably more than the threshold for chronic heavy drinking we use in this meta-analysis (≥ 60 g of pure alcohol per day). Several studies conducted among patients in treatment for AUD showed a relatively strong elevated IHD risk.

### Alcohol and immediate risk of cardiovascular events: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^114uFter]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although considerable research describes the cardiovascular effects of habitual moderate and heavy alcohol consumption, the immediate risks following alcohol intake have not been well characterized. Based on its physiological effects, alcohol may have markedly different effects on immediate and long-term risk.

Methods and Results

We searched CINAHL, Embase, and PubMed from inception to March 12, 2015, supplemented with manual screening for observational studies assessing the association between alcohol intake and cardiovascular events in the following hours and days. We calculated pooled relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for the association between alcohol intake and myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke using DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models to model any alcohol intake or dose-response relationships of alcohol intake and cardiovascular events. Among 1056 citations and 37 full-text articles reviewed, 23 studies (29 457 participants) were included. Moderate alcohol consumption was associated with an immediately higher cardiovascular risk that was attenuated after 24 hours, and even protective for myocardial infarction and hemorrhagic stroke (≈2–4 drinks: relative risk = 30% lower risk) and protective against ischemic stroke within 1 week (≈6 drinks: 19% lower risk). In contrast, heavy alcohol drinking was associated with higher cardiovascular risk in the following day (≈6–9 drinks: relative risk = 1.3–2.3) and week (≈19–30 drinks: relative risk = 2.25–6.2).

Conclusions

There appears to be a consistent finding of an immediately higher cardiovascular risk following any alcohol consumption, but, by 24 hours, only heavy alcohol intake conferred continued risk.

### Hazardous drinking and alcohol use disorders [^113ecBt4]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2022). High credibility.

Alcohol is one of the most widely consumed psychoactive drugs globally. Hazardous drinking, defined by quantity and frequency of consumption, is associated with acute and chronic morbidity. Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are psychiatric syndromes characterized by impaired control over drinking and other symptoms. Contemporary aetiological perspectives on AUDs apply a biopsychosocial framework that emphasizes the interplay of genetics, neurobiology, psychology, and an individual's social and societal context. There is strong evidence that AUDs are genetically influenced, but with a complex polygenic architecture. Likewise, there is robust evidence for environmental influences, such as adverse childhood exposures and maladaptive developmental trajectories. Well-established biological and psychological determinants of AUDs include neuroadaptive changes following persistent use, differences in brain structure and function, and motivational determinants including overvaluation of alcohol reinforcement, acute effects of environmental triggers and stress, elevations in multiple facets of impulsivity, and lack of alternative reinforcers. Social factors include bidirectional roles of social networks and sociocultural influences, such as public health control strategies and social determinants of health. An array of evidence-based approaches for reducing alcohol harms are available, including screening, pharmacotherapies, psychological interventions and policy strategies, but are substantially underused. Priorities for the field include translating advances in basic biobehavioural research into novel clinical applications and, in turn, promoting widespread implementation of evidence-based clinical approaches in practice and health-care systems.

### Medical comorbidity and alcohol dependence [^111rVt69]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Alcohol dependence (AD) and, more generally, alcohol use disorders (AUDs) predispose individuals to adverse consequences that extend beyond the expected damage from alcohol-direct toxicity. Research has shown that the relationship of alcohol use to health outcomes is complex, as is the etiology of AD, and that the individual and social costs of alcohol-related problems are increasing. We review advances in alcohol science that explore the role of alcohol consumption and patterns of drinking in a range of medically comorbid conditions. Although new knowledge can assist in the development of appropriate medical management strategies, AUDs account for an important percentage of the global burden of disease and require approaches that are not uniquely focused on the identification and treatment of AD.

### Alcohol consumption and brain health [^111gM2ff]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Existing on a spectrum of severity, alcohol related brain damage typically involves relatively young people, often in their 40s or 50s, meaning the more severely affected require decades of institutional care. While alcohol related brain damage generally afflicts malnourished drinkers consuming very high levels of alcohol, some degree of potentially reversible cognitive impairment is detectable in most people starting treatment for alcohol dependence. Alcohol can be the primary cause of cognitive impairment in some individuals, but it is a likely contributor to cognitive decline in many more.

The chief medical officer recently changed guidance for low risk drinking in men, reducing the recommended maximum intake from 21 to 14 units a week. This was because of accumulating evidence that even light drinking increases the risk of various malignancies. The relation between alcohol and brain health is more complex than the relation between alcohol and cancer. While there is almost universal agreement that heavy drinking is associated with cognitive impairment, numerous observational studies do report that light to moderate consumption is associated with a reduced risk of all cause dementia.

While concerns about confounding and inconsistencies between studies make it difficult to define what level of intake is "optimal" for cognition, it seems to be low; in these studies around a unit a day is associated with the lowest risk of dementia, with risk for drinkers clearly exceeding abstainers by 4 units a day. Topiwala and colleagues' report of adverse effects at even lower levels of intake, coupled with the finding that drinking more than 14 units a week was associated with both brain pathology and cognitive decline, provides further support for the chief medical officer's recent decision.

How should this paper inform discussions with patients? It certainly strengthens the view that if alcohol does confer beneficial effects on health, the link is probably confined to low intakes of no more than a unit a day. Even this level of consumption carries risk relative to abstinence for conditions such as breast cancer, and the evidence of benefit is certainly not strong enough to justify advising abstainers to drink.

As intake increases, so does the risk to health, probably in a dose dependent manner. Heavy consumption is associated with potentially severe impairments in memory and executive function, even when other obvious risk factors are absent. Topiwala and colleagues' findings strengthen the argument that drinking habits many regard as normal have adverse consequences for health. This is important. We all use rationalisations to justify persistence with behaviours not in our long term interest. With publication of this paper, justification of "moderate" drinking on the grounds of brain health becomes a little harder.

### A safe level of alcohol consumption: the right answer demands the right question [^1167FaQ1]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Alcohol has been produced by humans for nearly ten millennia, but gold-standard evidence by which to judge the health effects of limited alcohol consumption remains elusive, introducing serious difficulty in considering the safety of alcohol consumption. To do so, physicians and policymakers must consider the population, dose and context of alcohol consumption and the end-point, preferably a holistic composite, of interest. The limitations of new research trends, such as mega-cohorts, genetic instrumental variable analysis and modelling studies, must also be viewed against the much larger backdrop of existing evidence. Some existing guidelines, such as the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, succeed remarkably in this task. Nonetheless, large-scale randomized trials are urgently needed if future generations are to enjoy any greater insight into the health effects of population-wide alcohol consumption than the current one has.

### Alcohol consumption, hypertension, and cardiovascular health across the life course: there is No such thing as a one-size-fits-all approach [^112Rq3eK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

It is important to remember that people consume alcohol for pleasure and most do so responsibly. The majority of researchers do not actively advocate that people stop drinking but merely seek to emphasize that reductions in consumption can reduce one's overall risk of prematurely developing disease and/or dying. However, this subtle point can occasionally be lost in translation when findings from studies are communicated to the public via the media (sometimes without the involvement of the researchers themselves in this process). As such, public health professionals can quickly be branded as enemies of the people 17 for being perceived as trying to push a temperance agenda upon people who are perfectly content with their current level of consumption. Nevertheless, it is clear that a substantial proportion of the population are not fully aware of the risks associated with (even minimal) alcohol consumption, 18 and there is evidence that those who believe alcohol confers cardioprotective effects tend to drink more on average than those who do not. 19 As such, it is important that the evidence base for alcohol consumption and health continues to be debated in public (including the strengths, limitations, sources of bias, and degree of uncertainty of the collective pool of knowledge). But perhaps rather than messages simply re‐stating that drinking alcohol (or not drinking as it may be) is associated with an increased risk of disorder X, that can sometimes be perceived as condescending (and may lead to people disengaging), 20 they might instead be packaged in a way that is easily interpretable and/or tailored to an individual, such as absolute differences in risk for someone of their age with otherwise similar characteristics.

It is also important to remember that health is dynamic and there is no such thing as a one‐size‐fits‐all approach to managing risk. An individual's decision to drink, and at what level, should be motivated by their own personal circumstances. 3 Population‐level initiatives, such as recommended drinking limits, can only go so far, after which individual‐level approaches are needed. Therefore, it is vital that an open and honest dialogue about alcohol consumption be initiated and maintained. 18 What level of alcohol consumption might be considered acceptable for 1 individual may not be for another; equally, an individual might wish to consider changing their drinking habits if their situation changes. Ultimately, our job boils down to empowering an individual to make an informed decision about their level of alcohol intake and how this may influence their long‐ and short‐term health through transparent communication.

### Alcohol use and burden for 195 countries and territories, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2016 [^111sKK7R]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Alcohol use is a leading risk factor for death and disability, but its overall association with health remains complex given the possible protective effects of moderate alcohol consumption on some conditions. With our comprehensive approach to health accounting within the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016, we generated improved estimates of alcohol use and alcohol-attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 195 locations from 1990 to 2016, for both sexes and for 5-year age groups between the ages of 15 years and 95 years and older.

Methods

Using 694 data sources of individual and population-level alcohol consumption, along with 592 prospective and retrospective studies on the risk of alcohol use, we produced estimates of the prevalence of current drinking, abstention, the distribution of alcohol consumption among current drinkers in standard drinks daily (defined as 10 g of pure ethyl alcohol), and alcohol-attributable deaths and DALYs. We made several methodological improvements compared with previous estimates: first, we adjusted alcohol sales estimates to take into account tourist and unrecorded consumption; second, we did a new meta-analysis of relative risks for 23 health outcomes associated with alcohol use; and third, we developed a new method to quantify the level of alcohol consumption that minimises the overall risk to individual health.

Findings

Globally, alcohol use was the seventh leading risk factor for both deaths and DALYs in 2016, accounting for 2·2% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1·5–3·0) of age-standardised female deaths and 6·8% (5·8–8·0) of age-standardised male deaths. Among the population aged 15–49 years, alcohol use was the leading risk factor globally in 2016, with 3·8% (95% UI 3·2–4·3) of female deaths and 12·2% (10·8–13·6) of male deaths attributable to alcohol use. For the population aged 15–49 years, female attributable DALYs were 2·3% (95% UI 2·0–2·6) and male attributable DALYs were 8·9% (7·8–9·9). The three leading causes of attributable deaths in this age group were tuberculosis (1·4% [95% UI 1·0–1·7] of total deaths), road injuries (1·2% [0·7–1·9]), and self-harm (1·1% [0·6–1·5]). For populations aged 50 years and older, cancers accounted for a large proportion of total alcohol-attributable deaths in 2016, constituting 27·1% (95% UI 21·2–33·3) of total alcohol-attributable female deaths and 18·9% (15·3–22·6) of male deaths. The level of alcohol consumption that minimised harm across health outcomes was zero (95% UI 0·0–0·8) standard drinks per week.

Interpretation

Alcohol use is a leading risk factor for global disease burden and causes substantial health loss. We found that the risk of all-cause mortality, and of cancers specifically, rises with increasing levels of consumption, and the level of consumption that minimises health loss is zero. These results suggest that alcohol control policies might need to be revised worldwide, refocusing on efforts to lower overall population-level consumption.

### Population-level risks of alcohol consumption by amount, geography, age, sex, and year: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2020 [^117ARHzH]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

In conclusion, the relationship between moderate alcohol use and health is complex and has raised a great deal of controversy in the scientific literature. Given that the available evidence suggests that low levels of alcohol consumption are associated with a lower risk of some disease outcomes and an increased risk of others, alcohol consumption recommendations should take into account the full epidemiological profile that includes the background rates of disease within populations. The findings of this study support the development of tailored guidelines and recommendations on alcohol consumption by age and across regions and highlight that existing low consumption thresholds are too high for younger populations in all regions. Additionally, our results suggest that guidelines should not incorporate sex-specific recommendations, given the absence of variation in TMREL and NDE by sex across geographies and locations. Finally, recognising that the majority of the world's population consuming harmful amounts of alcohol are young adults and predominantly young males, in order to minimise health loss due to alcohol consumption it is important to prioritise interventions targeted at these demographic groups.

### Alcohol consumption, hypertension, and cardiovascular health across the life course: there is No such thing as a one-size-fits-all approach [^111hyuWF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Elevated blood pressure is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and related disability worldwide. 1 It is a largely preventable condition influenced by a range of lifestyle behaviors, including but not limited to level of physical activity, poor diet, and alcohol consumption. In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), 2 articles make important incremental contributions in extending the evidence base of the latter.

Roerecke and colleagues 2 carried out a systematic review and dose–response meta‐analysis of the association between alcohol consumption, defined using average number of drinks consumed per day, and incident hypertension separately in men and women. They found that no level of alcohol intake was associated with a lower risk of developing hypertension in either sex, which is in contrast to previous systematic reviews of this topic as well as observational studies of alcohol consumption and some cardiovascular outcomes. 3, 4

Piano and co‐workers 5 provide complementary findings, focusing on the cross‐sectional association of episodic heavy drinking (often referred to as "binge drinking" as the authors chose to, defined as men or women consuming 5 or 4 or more drinks in a single day, respectively) and indicators of cardiometabolic health, including blood pressure, in younger people. They found that frequency of binge drinking was associated with elevated levels of systolic blood pressure in men but not women. This result is in some ways supported by the work of Roerecke et al, 2 who similarly found a less pronounced effect of average alcohol intake on risk of developing hypertension in women. However, this study regrettably falls short of "completing the puzzle" of whether this difference in association with blood pressure by sex is driven by variation in drinking pattern (ie, episodes of heavy drinking being more common in men) through having not included either adjustment for, or the formal testing of an interaction with, overall volume of alcohol consumed.

### Alcohol consumption and health among elders [^111FKN1C]. The Gerontologist (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

This article estimates the effects of alcohol consumption on self-reported overall health status, injuries, heart problems, emergency room use, and hospitalizations among persons older than the age of 65.

Design and Methods

We analyzed data from the first wave of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, a nationally representative study. We used multivariate regression and instrumental variables methods to study the associations between alcohol consumption (current drinking, binge drinking, and average number of drinks consumed) and several indicators of health status and health care utilization.

Results

Alcohol consumption by women was associated with better self-perceived health status, improved cardiovascular health, and lower rates of hospitalizations. We detected no significant negative or positive associations for older men.

Implications

These findings suggest that light to moderate alcohol use by older women may have beneficial health effects. Experimental trials, however, are needed to more rigorously assess the potential benefits of alcohol use by elders due to the inherent biases of observational studies.

### Alcohol drinking and head and neck cancer risk: the joint effect of intensity and duration [^116pMZQC]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Worldwide, harmful alcohol consumption causes 3 million deaths each year (5% of all deaths), and it is responsible for ~5% of the global burden of disease and injury. In particular, alcohol consumption has been consistently associated with cancer risk at several sites. Together with tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking is one the major risk factors for head and neck cancer (HNC), and it is responsible for approximately one third of the cases worldwide.

Epidemiological studies firmly established a clear dose-response relationship between ethanol intake and HNC risk. However, alcohol drinking has two related dimensions impacting on health outcomes: besides the quantity of alcohol consumed, time-related patterns of consumption, such as age at starting and duration, have a relevant roleand they may modify the reported association between drinking intensity and cancer risk. Notably, a joint effect of intensity and duration on cancer risk has already been reported for tobacco smoking in HNC, and in other tobacco-related cancers. –

In a previous analysis from the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology (INHANCE) consortium including 15 studies, the independent contribution of drinking intensity and duration was estimated through the calculation of drink-years. Similarly to pack-years for tobacco smoking, drink-years represent the lifetime cumulative exposure to alcohol, and it was obtained by multiplying intensity (in drinks/day) by duration (in years). Then, the effect of duration on HNC risk was estimated analysing the risk for drink-years within fixed categories of intensity; this analysis reported an independent effect of drinking duration for all HNC subsites.

In the absence of a clear relationship between alcohol intensity and duration on the risk of HNC, we investigated their joint effect on the INHANCE database using an extension of the bivariate spline model presented in a previously published analysis on cigarette smoking. Differently from the previous INHANCE paper, this model allows risks to vary for different combinations of drinking intensity and duration, even when the cumulative drink-years exposure is the same. We will address the following research questions: (1) What are the relationships between intensity and duration of alcohol drinking and the risk of cancer at HNC subsites? (2) Do drinking intensity and duration have a similar impact on HNC risk? (3) Are there meaningful values of drinking intensity or duration where the risk pattern changes?

### Association of alcohol consumption with selected cardiovascular disease outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Vdpwa]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objective To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of studies assessing the effect of alcohol consumption on multiple cardiovascular outcomes.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources A search of Medline (1950 through September 2009) and Embase (1980 through September 2009) supplemented by manual searches of bibliographies and conference proceedings.

Inclusion criteria Prospective cohort studies on the association between alcohol consumption and overall mortality from cardiovascular disease, incidence of and mortality from coronary heart disease, and incidence of and mortality from stroke.

Studies reviewed Of 4235 studies reviewed for eligibility, quality, and data extraction, 84 were included in the final analysis.

Results The pooled adjusted relative risks for alcohol drinkers relative to non-drinkers in random effects models for the outcomes of interest were 0.75 (95% confidence interval 0.70 to 0.80) for cardiovascular disease mortality (21 studies), 0.71 (0.66 to 0.77) for incident coronary heart disease (29 studies), 0.75 (0.68 to 0.81) for coronary heart disease mortality (31 studies), 0.98 (0.91 to 1.06) for incident stroke (17 studies), and 1.06 (0.91 to 1.23) for stroke mortality (10 studies). Dose-response analysis revealed that the lowest risk of coronary heart disease mortality occurred with 1–2 drinks a day, but for stroke mortality it occurred with ≤ 1 drink per day. Secondary analysis of mortality from all causes showed lower risk for drinkers compared with non-drinkers (relative risk 0.87 (0.83 to 0.92)).

Conclusions Light to moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a reduced risk of multiple cardiovascular outcomes.

### Association of alcohol consumption with selected cardiovascular disease outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ZdWg2]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this review of 84 studies of alcohol consumption and cardiovascular disease, alcohol consumption at 2.5–14.9 g/day (about ≤ 1 drink a day) was consistently associated with a 14–25% reduction in the risk of all outcomes assessed compared with abstaining from alcohol. Such a reduction in risk is potentially of clinical importance, but consumption of larger amounts of alcohol was associated with higher risks for stroke incidence and mortality.

To our knowledge, this systematic review and meta-analysis is the most comprehensive to date. Although roughly similar estimates of lower risk were observed in previous meta-analyses of both coronary heart disease and stroke, our review extends the findings by assessing a broader array of relevant cardiovascular outcomes and adding several new important studies. Our review clarifies several discrepancies among prior reports. Corrao et al reported a J shaped relation between alcohol intake and coronary heart disease, whereas the review by Maclure described this relation as L shaped because he did not observe an increase in coronary heart disease risk associated with higher alcohol consumption. Our updated meta-analysis supports the latter association for coronary heart disease, with a 25–35% risk reduction for light to moderate drinkingthat also is present with heavier drinking.

Our analysis of multiple cardiovascular outcomes also shows the complexities inherent in the study of alcohol consumption. Modest alcohol intake was associated with lower stroke incidence and mortality, but the risk increased substantially with heavier drinking (that is, a J shaped relation). Furthermore, the association of alcohol consumption is complex and differs by stroke subtype, with a slightly lower risk of ischaemic stroke but higher risk of haemorrhagic stroke. These differential associations probably reflect the known antithrombotic effects of alcohol. Alcohol consumption, particularly at high doses, also seems to have an adverse association with blood pressure that may account, in part, for the higher risk of haemorrhagic stroke associated with heavier drinking. Additionally, our analysis does not consider other known detrimental effects of high alcohol consumption. Therefore, our findings lend further support for limits on alcohol consumption.

### Is there a safe limit for consumption of alcohol? [^115g8Yz3]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

In order to understand and curb the harms related to alcohol, it will be necessary to think beyond patterns of use that meet criteria for a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder or addiction. Current research suggests that regular daily alcohol use does not confer a health benefit, and, for many persons, even relatively low consumption is associated with a health risk. Determining a safe limit for alcohol consumption is challenging both for the individual person and for society. We conclude that excessive drinking is always risky. We provide a list of circumstances, such as chronic illness, driving a vehicle, or pregnancy where persons should be advised to abstain from alcohol. We recognise the need to encourage less consumption of alcohol, particularly in young adults and older adults with co-morbid conditions (especially if taking multiple medications). Finally, we offer the modest proposal that, for persons without the contributing negative influences described above, consumption which adheres to one drink per session, with interspersed abstinent days, does not constitute a meaningful risk to health.

### Association of habitual alcohol intake with risk of cardiovascular disease [^112QP3Bi]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Controversy has surrounded the association between alcohol intake and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which remains the leading global cause of death. Observational studies have repeatedly demonstrated a lower risk of CVD with light to moderate alcohol intake compared with either abstinence or heavy consumption, suggesting J- or U-shaped epidemiologic associations. However, the observed cardiac benefits of alcohol have been hypothesized to be the product of residual confounding because of favorable lifestyle, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors that tend to coincide with modest alcohol intake.

Efforts to address this complex association through a randomized clinical trial have been met with logistical and ethical challenges, culminating in the discontinuation of a trial of modest alcohol consumption led by the National Institutes of Health. In the absence of a randomized trial, a technique using human genetic data (ie, mendelian randomization [MR]) has enabled assessment for potential causal associations by leveraging naturally occurring genetic variants as unbiased proxies for an exposure (ie, alcohol intake). Given the random allocation of genetic variants at conception, MR obviates concerns of confounding and reverse causality, 2 key limitations of observational epidemiology.

Prior genetic analyses using an MR approach have provided evidence to suggest a causal link between alcohol consumption and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, traditional methods in MR often presume linearity and may therefore be limited in their assessments of relative risks across levels of alcohol intake, which have the potential to inform public health decisions around quantitative risk thresholds. Indeed, the paucity of quantitative data focused on the consequences of moderate alcohol consumption (ie, 1 vs 2 drinks per day) has contributed to variable public health recommendations on low-risk drinking around the world and to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) maintaining its long-standing, sex-specific recommendations of fewer than 15 drinks per week for men and fewer than 8 drinks per week for women in the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. More recently, emerging techniques in nonlinear MR (NLMR) have used large-scale, individual-level genetic data to enable simultaneous assessments of potential causality and association shape.,

To further explore the association between alcohol intake and CVD, we first reexamined how coincident lifestyle and behavioral factors affect the well-established J-shaped observational associations. Next, through traditional MR and NLMR approaches, we evaluated the association of alcohol consumption with CVD, with an emphasis on better understanding relative differences in risk across levels of intake.

### Effect of provision of non-alcoholic beverages on alcohol consumption: a randomized controlled study [^1165oqr5]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

One strategy that has been discussed is the use of low-alcohol or non-alcoholic beverages. Non-alcoholic beverages are alcohol-flavored beverages that contain no alcohol. They are alternatives to alcoholic beverages, and theoretically, if they replace alcoholic beverages, this may lead to public health benefits. In its Global Strategy to Reduce Harmful Use of Alcohol, the WHO requests that the alcohol industry contributes to decreasing the harmful use of alcohol, for example by reducing the alcohol content of its products. Rehm et al. identified the following three ways in which low-alcohol or non-alcoholic beverages may impact the harmful use of alcohol: (1) replacing standard alcoholic beverages with similar low-alcohol beverages may lead to the consumption of beverages with lower alcohol content without increasing the amount of liquid consumed; (2) replacing alcoholic beverages with non-alcoholic beverages for a certain period of time may allow drinkers to reduce their mean ethanol consumption; and (3) consumption of low-alcohol or non-alcoholic beverages may lead to the resumption of alcohol use by people who have been abstaining from alcohol. Thus, non-alcoholic beverages can be an effective tool for reduction of alcohol consumption among excessive drinkers.

There is currently limited evidence on the effect of non-alcoholic beverages, with insufficient research on whether providing non-alcoholic beverages directly affects alcohol consumption. We examined this question in a randomized controlled study in excessive drinkers, excluding those with alcoholism. It is extremely valuable to verify effective methods for reducing alcohol consumption, not only for developing interventions for individuals, but also for formulating global strategies and community approaches such as policymaking.

### National, regional, and global statistics on alcohol consumption and associated burden of disease 2000–20: a modelling study and comparative risk assessment [^1145L4DR]. The Lancet: Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol consumption has created, and continues to create, substantial health, social, and economic burdens, representing a barrier to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals globally. Although the negative effects of alcohol on health, social wellbeing, and economies have been well established and documented, alcohol remains the most widely consumed psychoactive substance of substantial public health importance. High consumption persists despite the inclusion of alcohol reduction as a key target within the Noncommunicable Disease Global Monitoring Framework and the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as the availability of numerous effective policies to reduce alcohol-attributable harms.

To prioritise the implementation of evidence-based alcohol control policies, including treatment strategies, it is important to understand which countries and regions experience relatively high levels of alcohol consumption and are disproportionately affected by its consequences. This study aimed to provide a regional and global overview of alcohol consumption as a risk factor for burden of disease from 2000 to 2020, by country, sex, and age. The consumption estimates encompass all relevant dimensions necessary to model the alcohol-related burden of disease, including: alcohol adult per capita consumption (APC) — measured in litres of pure alcohol consumed per adult (≥ 15 years) annually; drinking status (ie, prevalence of past-year drinkers, former drinkers, and lifetime abstainers); and the prevalence of heavy episodic drinking (HED), defined in this study as consuming 60 g or more of ethanol on at least one occasion in the past 30 days. We also aimed to examine the changes in APC from 2019 to 2020 to examine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated policies on APC. Furthermore, the study estimated the alcohol-attributable burden of disease from 2000 to 2019.

### The effect of exercise, alcohol or both combined on health and physical performance [^116rVkk2]. International Journal of Obesity (2008). Low credibility.

Alcohol (ethanol) is consumed on a daily basis by a large fraction of the population, and in many countries, light-to-moderate alcohol consumption is considered as an integral part of the diet. Although the relationship between alcohol intake and obesity is controversial, regular consumption of alcohol, through its effects in suppressing fat oxidation, is regarded as a risk factor for weight gain, increased abdominal obesity and hypertriglyceridemia. Indeed, alcohol taken with a meal leads to an increase in postprandial lipemia-an effect on postprandial metabolism that is opposite to that observed with exercise. Furthermore, although regular exercise training and/or a preprandial exercise session reduce postprandial lipemia independently of alcohol ingestion, the exercise-induced reduction in postprandial lipemia is nonetheless less pronounced when alcohol is also consumed with the meal. Whether or not alcohol influences exercise and sport performance remains contradictory. It is believed that alcohol has deleterious effects on the performance, although it may contribute to reduce pain and anxiety. The alcohol effects on sports performance depend on the type and dosage of alcohol, acute vs chronic administration, the alcohol elimination rate as well as the type of exercise.

### Access to alcohol and heart disease among patients in hospital: observational cohort study using differences in alcohol sales laws [^112rA5z8]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and policy implications

We have shown, for the first time, that laws limiting alcohol sales have measurable public health effects. Increased access to alcohol was consistently associated with more atrial fibrillation and less myocardial infarction. Given that this investigation of the most commonly consumed drug (alcohol) and the leading cause of death (heart disease) leverages a natural experiment to minimize confounding, we believe that our results have broadly applicable health implications relevant to people with and at risk for various types of cardiovascular disease. More broadly, this research shows that public laws limiting access to a commonly consumed substance have important health effects that may be both beneficial and harmful.

### Alcohol and public health [^117Y9vxM]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Alcoholic beverages, and the problems they engender, have been familiar fixtures in human societies since the beginning of recorded history. We review advances in alcohol science in terms of three topics: the epidemiology of alcohol's role in health and illness; the treatment of alcohol use disorders in a public health perspective; and policy research and options. Research has contributed substantially to our understanding of the relation of drinking to specific disorders, and has shown that the relation between alcohol consumption and health outcomes is complex and multidimensional. Alcohol is causally related to more than 60 different medical conditions. Overall, 4% of the global burden of disease is attributable to alcohol, which accounts for about as much death and disability globally as tobacco and hypertension. Treatment research shows that early intervention in primary care is feasible and effective, and a variety of behavioural and pharmacological interventions are available to treat alcohol dependence. This evidence suggests that treatment of alcohol-related problems should be incorporated into a public health response to alcohol problems. Additionally, evidence-based preventive measures are available at both the individual and population levels, with alcohol taxes, restrictions on alcohol availability, and drinking-driving countermeasures among the most effective policy options. Despite the scientific advances, alcohol problems continue to present a major challenge to medicine and public health, in part because population-based public health approaches have been neglected in favour of approaches oriented to the individual that tend to be more palliative than preventative.

### Estimating the effect of transitioning to a strength-based alcohol tax system on alcohol consumption and health outcomes: a modelling study of tax reform in england [^1166RsK8]. The Lancet: Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Background

Increasing the amount of alcohol taxation is among the most effective measures for addressing the rising global burden of alcohol harm. However, less is known about the effect of changing alcohol tax structures. Substantial reforms to UK alcohol taxation structures enacted in August, 2023, mean that all alcohol is taxed based on its ethanol content, beers and ciders sold in on-trade premises (eg, public houses) are taxed at a reduced rate (hereafter called draught relief), and beer and particularly cider remain taxed at lower rates than other alcohol of equivalent strength. We aimed to model the effect of these reforms on alcohol consumption and health and economic outcomes, and the effects of hypothetical alternative scenarios.

Methods

The Sheffield Tobacco and Alcohol Policy Model was used to estimate policy effects on alcohol consumption. The model is an individual-based microsimulation that uses data from the Health Survey for England, Living Costs and Food Survey, Hospital Episode Statistics, and the Office for National Statistics. Spending and revenues to retailers and the Government were estimated cumulatively for a 5-year period post-intervention. Policy effects on all-cause deaths, years of life lost, hospital admissions, and admissions costs were estimated cumulatively for a 20-year period post-intervention.

Findings

The reform was estimated to decrease mean weekly alcohol consumption per drinker by less than 0·05 (-0·34%) units (1 unit = 8 g/10 mL ethanol), and prevent 2307 deaths and 11510 hospital admissions during 20 years compared with no policy change. Removing draught relief was estimated to prevent 1441 further deaths and 14247 further admissions. Hypothetical scenarios showed that removing draught relief would only slightly improve public health outcomes, and increasing tax rates for beer and ciders to match other drinks of equivalent strength would reduce consumption by a further 2·5 units per week (-17%) and deaths by approximately 74465.

Interpretation

Alcohol tax structures based on alcohol strength enable tax policy to improve public health in a targeted way. However, the UK reforms are unlikely to substantially improve health outcomes as they do not raise taxes overall. Raising tax rates for the lowest taxed beer and ciders, which are favoured by those who consume harmful amounts of alcohol, could achieve substantially greater public health benefits and reduce health inequalities.

### Exploring the complex interplay between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular health: mechanisms, evidence, and future directions [^116CRdGJ]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This review article explores the intricate relationship between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular health, underscoring on both clinical outcomes and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. It examines the complex dose-response relationships for various cardiovascular disease (CVD) subtypes, including coronary heart disease, stroke, and atrial fibrillation, while categorizing pathophysiological mechanisms into three conceptual areas: primary initiating factors, secondary transmission pathways, and end-organ effects. Although mild-to-moderate alcohol consumption may confer some benefits for cardiovascular health and certain CVD subtypes, growing evidence highlights the importance of lifestyle modifications to reduce alcohol intake, particularly among heavy drinkers. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current knowledge, emphasizes the need for future research with robust methodologies, and advocates for incorporating updated scientific evidence into personalized approaches within international cardiovascular and national guidelines.

### Population-level risks of alcohol consumption by amount, geography, age, sex, and year: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2020 [^111oujPH]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

Our results are consistent with previous findings at the global level, and at the same time the more nuanced analysis done in this study strongly suggests that statements, guidelines, and recommendations on the optimal level of alcohol consumption need to take into consideration the background rates of diseases and injuries for each population. We provide clear evidence that the level of alcohol consumption that minimises health loss varies significantly across populations and remains zero or very close to zero for several population groups, particularly young adults. At the same time, small amounts of alcohol consumption are associated with improved health outcomes in populations that predominantly face a high burden of cardiovascular diseases, particularly older adults in many world regions. Given these findings, we recommend a modification of existing policy guidelines to focus on emphasising differential optimal consumption levels by age, rather than the current practice of recommending different consumption levels by sex. This study highlights the importance of prioritising interventions targeted at minimising alcohol consumption among young adults.

Importantly, no study to date has examined the variation in the theoretical minimum risk of alcohol consumption by geography, age, sex, and time, conditioned on background rates of disease. National dietary guidelines on low-risk drinking, such as those in the USA, UK, France, and Australia, base recommendations on studies of the risk of alcohol use on all-cause mortality and some cause-specific outcomes. This complicates interpretation of the risk of alcohol use on mortality, given three aspects of all-cause mortality. First, causal pathways between alcohol use and cause-specific outcomes can differ, creating multiple confounding structures that are not readily adjustable when embedded within models analysing the effects of alcohol use on all-cause mortality. Second, all-cause mortality includes non-causally related outcomes, further increasing the threat to internal validity for evidence produced from analysing the effects of alcohol use on all-cause mortality. Third, and most importantly for the present study, the composition of causes within all-cause mortality can differ substantially between populations, changing the proportional risk of mortality due to alcohol use across these populations. In tandem, these features limit the applicability of determining minimum risk exposures on the basis of observational data on alcohol use and all-cause mortality.

### Association between patterns of alcohol consumption (beverage type, frequency and consumption with food) and risk of adverse health outcomes: a prospective cohort study [^112F9CDh]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

This study has a number of key strengths and limitations. The study had a large sample size, detailed description of various patterns of alcohol consumption, which were studied concurrently. A wide spectrum of adverse health outcomes was examined, and results were adjusted for relevant demographic, lifestyle, health-related factors and average amount of alcohol consumed. The study sample was recruited from a community setting but there is evidence of participation bias with study participants being more affluent and healthier than the average UK population, and therefore, it is likely that the effect sizes reported here are conservative estimates. The other major limitation of this study is the possibility of residual confounding, which is a common limitation of observational studies of harmful health effects of alcohol consumption. A systematic review of 85 studies assessing alcohol consumption risk on ischaemic heart disease found that the median number of covariates adjustment in the included studies was 9 (interquartile range 5–12) and majority of included studies failed to acknowledge the possibility of residual confounding. In our study, all-cause mortality models were adjusted for 10 covariates, liver cirrhosis models were adjusted for 11 covariates and cardiovascular events models were adjusted for 14 covariates. The models in our study were adjusted for the effect of major determinants of health and well-being to minimise the risk of residual confounding; however, it still remains a possibility. We only had information of alcohol consumption patterns at baseline and these patterns may have changed over the follow-up duration. While we present the findings from analysis on repeated measurements of alcohol consumption pattern during the follow-up period, that analysis was limited as follow-up data were only available for a very small subset of the study sample. We classified the type of alcoholic beverage consumed as that comprising 50% or more of the total weekly units consumed by a participant on average and conducted a sensitivity analysis with classification based on the type of alcoholic beverage consumed in the highest volume in 1 week. However, these are arbitrary methods of classifying type of alcoholic beverages and there is a possibility of overestimating or underestimating the effects of alcoholic beverage type. Finally, under reporting of alcohol consumption is common for study participants, particularly among women and binge drinkers, which may have influenced the observed results.

### Alcohol use [^112For5z]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Unhealthy alcohol use-the consumption of alcohol at a level that has caused or has the potential to cause adverse physical, psychological, or social consequences-is common, underrecognized, and undertreated. For example, data from the 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health indicate that 7.0% of adults reported heavy alcohol use in the previous month, and only 4.2% of adults with alcohol use disorder received treatment. Primary care is an important setting for optimizing screening and treatment of unhealthy alcohol use to promote individual and public health.

### Association between daily alcohol intake and risk of all-cause mortality: a systematic review and meta-analyses [^116mEj9p]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

A previous meta-analysis of the association between alcohol use and all-cause mortality found no statistically significant reductions in mortality risk at low levels of consumption compared with lifetime nondrinkers. However, the risk estimates may have been affected by the number and quality of studies then available, especially those for women and younger cohorts.

Objective

To investigate the association between alcohol use and all-cause mortality, and how sources of bias may change results.

Data Sources

A systematic search of PubMed and Web of Science was performed to identify studies published between January 1980 and July 2021.

Study Selection

Cohort studies were identified by systematic review to facilitate comparisons of studies with and without some degree of controls for biases affecting distinctions between abstainers and drinkers. The review identified 107 studies of alcohol use and all-cause mortality published from 1980 to July 2021.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Mixed linear regression models were used to model relative risks, first pooled for all studies and then stratified by cohort median age (< 56 vs ≥ 56 years) and sex (male vs female). Data were analyzed from September 2021 to August 2022.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Relative risk estimates for the association between mean daily alcohol intake and all-cause mortality.

Results

There were 724 risk estimates of all-cause mortality due to alcohol intake from the 107 cohort studies (4 838 825 participants and 425 564 deaths available) for the analysis. In models adjusting for potential confounding effects of sampling variation, former drinker bias, and other prespecified study-level quality criteria, the meta-analysis of all 107 included studies found no significantly reduced risk of all-cause mortality among occasional (> 0 to < 1.3 g of ethanol per day; relative risk [RR], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.86–1.06; p = 0.41) or low-volume drinkers (1.3–24.0 g per day; RR, 0.93; p = 0.07) compared with lifetime nondrinkers. In the fully adjusted model, there was a nonsignificantly increased risk of all-cause mortality among drinkers who drank 25 to 44 g per day (RR, 1.05; p = 0.28) and significantly increased risk for drinkers who drank 45 to 64 and 65 or more grams per day (RR, 1.19 and 1.35; P < .001). There were significantly larger risks of mortality among female drinkers compared with female lifetime nondrinkers (RR, 1.22; p = 0.03).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this updated systematic review and meta-analysis, daily low or moderate alcohol intake was not significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk, while increased risk was evident at higher consumption levels, starting at lower levels for women than men.

### All cause mortality and the case for age specific alcohol consumption guidelines: pooled analyses of up to 10 population based cohorts [^115f7KeM]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Physiological changes to the aging body are understood to adversely affect the timely elimination of blood ethanol after consumption, with decreases in body water, hepatic function, and blood flow all implicated. Given the increased duration and peak concentration of blood ethanol that may be experienced by drinkers of advancing age, increasing consumption among older populations presents an area of potential public health concern. This is especially so given age related increases in morbidities known to be worsened in response to alcohol use, as well as age related increases in the use of prescription drugs potentially contraindicated with alcohol. Although potentially the product of a lag effect from drinking over the limits earlier in life, the number of alcohol related hospital admissions and wholly attributable deaths are greatest among older age groups.

Taken together, such factors suggest that older populations may benefit most from a reduction in alcohol consumption. In response, the UK Royal College of Psychiatrists recently advised a reduction in the recommended limits for those aged 65 years or more, from 21 units (about 165.9 g of ethanol) per week for men and 14 units (110.6 g) per week for women, to 11 units (86.9 g) per week or 1.5 units per day for both men and women aged 65 years or more. Evidence underpinning such an age specific threshold is, however, lacking.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for hypertension, more specifically with respect to alcohol restriction, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to advise patients to consume less alcohol than the upper limit (about 100 g/week of pure alcohol). Inform patients that the number of drinks depends on portion size (varies by country) with most drinks containing 8–14 g of alcohol. Advise avoiding alcohol to achieve the best health outcomes.

### Effect of alcohol label designs with different pictorial representations of alcohol content and health warnings on knowledge and understanding of low-risk drinking guidelines: a randomized controlled trial [^1114w6CD]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol consumption is associated with more than 200 diseases, injuries and conditions [1]. For all conditions there is a dose–response relationship — with increasing levels of alcohol consumption there is increasing risk [2]. For some conditions, such as liver disease, this relationship is exponential [3], whereas for other conditions, such as some cancers, it is linear [4]. The most effective way of reducing these risks is reducing individual‐ and population‐level consumption [5]. As such, many governments have developed low‐risk drinking guidelines (LRDGs), which commonly include a recommended daily or weekly maximum intake, expressed as numbers of 'standard drinks' or 'units of alcohol' [6, 7]. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a standard drink as 10 g of pure ethanol and advises people not to exceed two standard drinks per day [8]. Although widespread, LRDGs are not universal or uniform. A review of 37 government agency guidelines found that guidelines for low‐risk consumption ranged from 10 to 56 g of ethanol per day and that the standard drink sizes (which the guidelines were expressed in) ranged from 8 to 20 g of ethanol, with 10 g as the modal size [7].

The UK government published LRDGs in the 1990s [9, 10], which were updated by the UK Chief Medical Officers (CMOs) in 2016 [11]. The weekly drinking guidelines for both men and women state: 'to keep health risks from alcohol to a low level it is safest not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week on a regular basis' [11]. More than 10 million adults in the United Kingdom drink more than the LRDG of 14 units per week [12]. The Department of Health recommended that the CMOs' guidelines be communicated to the general public using visual prompts [13]. In 2011, the Government in England launched the Public Health Responsibility Deal involving voluntary agreements with industry, which included labelling at least 80% of alcohol products with unit content, low‐risk guidelines, pregnancy warnings and responsibility statements [14]. However, a market survey conducted in 2014 found that only 57% of labels met best practice as defined by the Portman Group [5].

### Cardiovascular risks and benefits of moderate and heavy alcohol consumption [^1133NX4V]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

The heart and vascular system are susceptible to the harmful effects of alcohol. Alcohol is an active toxin that undergoes widespread diffusion throughout the body, causing multiple synchronous and synergistic effects. Alcohol consumption decreases myocardial contractility and induces arrhythmias and dilated cardiomyopathy, resulting in progressive cardiovascular dysfunction and structural damage. Alcohol, whether at binge doses or a high cumulative lifetime consumption-both of which should be discouraged-is clearly deleterious for the cardiovascular system, increasing the incidence of total and cardiovascular mortality, coronary and peripheral artery disease, heart failure, stroke, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and diabetes mellitus. However, epidemiological, case-control studies and meta-analyses have shown a U-type bimodal relationship so that low-to-moderate alcohol consumption (particularly of wine or beer) is associated with a decrease in cardiovascular events and mortality, compared with abstention. Potential confounding influences-alcohol-dose quantification, tobacco use, diet, exercise, lifestyle, cancer risk, accidents, and dependence-can affect the results of studies of both low-dose and high-dose alcohol consumption. Mendelian methodological approaches have led to doubts regarding the beneficial cardiovascular effects of alcohol, and the overall balance of beneficial and detrimental effects should be considered when making individual and population-wide recommendations, as reductions in alcohol consumption should provide overall health benefits.

### Alcohol consumption, drinking patterns, and ischemic heart disease: a narrative review of meta-analyses and a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of heavy drinking occasions on risk for moderate drinkers [^114y1oLm]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of death and disease burden in the US, Europe, and globally, and alcohol consumption is one of the leading risk factors for mortality and morbidity. There are well-established risks from neuro-toxic, hepato-toxic, and carcinogenic effects caused by alcohol consumption (for example, the risk for cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract, injuries, and liver cirrhosis). However, there has been much debate about a beneficial effect of alcohol consumption on IHD. High prevalence of both exposure and disease make this question a frequent topic among general practitioners, researchers, media, and the public. Aside from numerous individual studies, several meta-analyses published in the last decade have summarized the association between alcohol consumption and IHD risk.

Most meta-analyses of epidemiological data have shown a mix between a beneficial and detrimental association from alcohol consumption on IHD that depends on the level of average consumption. This relationship is most often described as curvilinear, or 'J-shaped', but also sometimes as a flattened-out inverse association. The specific shape of the risk curve seems to depend at least on sex and IHD outcome (mortality versus morbidity). Findings of a beneficial effect are supported by a substantial number of short-term experimental studies on the effect of alcohol consumption on several surrogate biomarkers for IHD in a dose-dependent relationship, including improved lipid profiles, inhibition of platelet activation, reduction of fibrinogen levels, and anti-inflammatory effects. In particular, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels have a clear dose-response relationship with alcohol consumption, with the highest levels observed in people with the highest alcohol consumption. Many criticisms have arisen over the last three decades questioning the relationship found in epidemiological studies because of limited quality of alcohol assessment, the influence of drinking pattern, adjustment for confounding, or the inability for observational studies to determine causality. Although criteria for a causal relationship seem to be fulfilled (see also), a direct link for alcohol consumption on IHD risk from long-term randomized trials is currently, and for the foreseeable future, missing. Thus, epidemiological studies, as is the case for many other IHD risk factors, play an important role in assessing the role of alcohol consumption on disease risk. The objective of this review is to examine the evidence available to define the relationship between alcohol consumption and IHD based mainly on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, with a focus on the reference group (that is, the use of lifetime abstainers and not current abstainers as the reference group because of the 'sick-quitter' effect); the influence of drinking pattern (in particular episodic heavy drinking among on average moderate drinkers); and the influence of several other important risk factors for IHD, such as age, smoking status, physical activity, and body mass index (BMI), all of which might confound risk estimates for alcohol.

### Alcohol use and burden for 195 countries and territories, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2016 [^11755JQw]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In 2016, alcohol use led to 2·8 million deaths and was the leading risk factor for premature death and disability among people aged 15–49 years, with nearly 9% of all attributable DALYs for men and more than 2% for women. Our findings indicate that alcohol use was associated with far more health loss for males than for females, with the attributable burden for men around three times higher than that for women in 2016. By evaluating all associated relative risks for alcohol use, we found that consuming zero standard drinks daily minimises the overall risk to health.

Previous research has analysed all-cause risk due to alcohol use by either investigating all-cause risk in particular cohorts and survey series, or through meta-analyses of those studies. Past findings subsequently suggested a persistent protective effect for some low or moderate levels of alcohol consumption on all-cause mortality. However, these studies were limited by small sample sizes, inadequate control for confounders, and non-optimal choices of a reference category for calculating relative risks. More recent research, which has used methodologies such as mendelian randomisation, pooling cohort studies, and multivariable adjusted meta-analyses, increasingly shows either a non-significant or no protective effect of drinking on all-cause mortality or cardiovascular outcomes. Our results on the weighted attributable risk are consistent with this body of work. Taken together, these findings emphasise that alcohol use, regardless of amount, leads to health loss across populations. Although we found some protective effects for ischaemic heart disease and diabetes among women, these effects were offset when overall health risks were considered — especially because of the strong association between alcohol consumption and the risk of cancer, injuries, and communicable disease. These findings stress the importance of assessing how alcohol use affects population health across the lifespan.

### The IARC perspective on the effects of policies on reducing alcohol consumption [^1145ZgTp]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Alcoholic beverages are established human carcinogensand, compared with continuing consumption, reduction or cessation of alcoholic beverage consumption reduces oral cancer and esophageal cancer risk. Based on the evidence reviewed, the Working Group concluded that the following alcohol policy interventions lead to a reduction in alcohol consumption: interventions that increase taxes, minimum prices, minimum alcohol purchase or drinking age; interventions that reduce alcohol outlet density and days or hours of sale; strong alcohol marketing bans; total bans on sales; and government monopolies or other coordinated multiple alcohol policy interventions.

Several issues relevant to the evaluations must be considered. First, the studies of alcohol availability interventions and marketing bans are almost entirely based on data collected before the expansion of digital marketing and online purchasing, and their relevance to related interventions in the current digital era may have limits. Second, most studies were conducted in high-income countries, and the effectiveness of some interventions may differ in other settings. Third, the evaluations focused on the effectiveness of alcohol policy interventions; examining their potential unintended consequences might inform feasibility in specific contexts but should not detract from the proven public health benefits. Finally, to be more effective, any policy must be enacted, implemented, and enforced, which requires the involvement of many different governmental and non-governmental sectors.

In conclusion, a substantial body of evidence exists on the effects of alcohol policies in reducing alcohol-related harm. Our findings add to the available evidence on the potential for alcohol policy interventions to reduce the alcohol-attributable cancer burden. Furthermore, they support the recommended actions stated in the most recent WHO Global Alcohol Action Plan 2022–2030, which includes the "SAFER" initiative *, and emphasize high impact strategies and interventions to reduce alcohol-related harm worldwide.

### Association of habitual alcohol intake with risk of cardiovascular disease [^1156yzrJ]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the risk of cardiovascular disease associated with different amounts of habitual alcohol consumption?

Findings

In this cohort study of 371 463 individuals, genetic evidence supported a nonlinear, consistently risk-increasing association between all amounts of alcohol consumption and both hypertension and coronary artery disease, with modest increases in risk with light alcohol intake and exponentially greater risk increases at higher levels of consumption.

Meaning

In this study, alcohol consumption at all levels was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but clinical and public health guidance around habitual alcohol use should account for the considerable differences in cardiovascular risk across different levels of alcohol consumption, even those within current guideline-recommended limits.

### Alcohol consumption trajectories over the Australian life course [^115AQ7Ks]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Millions of deaths are attributable to alcohol globally each year, with 4186 in Australia alone in 2017. Alcohol consumption contributes to a range of health impacts, including injuries, accidents and longer‐term alcohol‐related diseases. In 2015, alcohol was a top 10 leading risk factor for burden of disease across the Australian population. For young people, ages 15–24, alcohol was the leading risk factor for burden of disease for men and the second leading risk factor for women. Young adult drinkers (18–24), are generally most likely to exceed single‐occasion drinking guidelines and put themselves at risk of intoxication or short‐term, alcohol‐related harms. In contrast, the tendency of older drinkers to drink more frequently may put them at greater risk of long‐term alcohol‐related, non‐communicable diseases such as cancer or heart or liver disease. This considerable burden of disease attributable to alcohol across the population makes alcohol a key public health concern in Australia and internationally.

Drinking is a dynamic behaviour that varies over the life course. Cross‐sectional, Australian analyses have shown alcohol consumption is greatest in early adulthood, following quick increases in adolescence. Consumption then declines with age, particularly risky single occasion drinking (RSOD). However, frequency of drinking appears to increase with age, with many older Australians drinking daily. These findings are broadly consistent with work in other countries, such as the United States and United Kingdom (UK). These age specific patterns are not fixed, however, with recent studies highlighting significant shifts in drinking trends internationally. In particular, younger drinkers are consuming significantly less and abstaining more over the last decade, whereas middle‐age drinkers have maintained, or in some cases increased, their consumption.

As a result, where research may have identified rising consumption during adolescence, peaking in emerging adulthood, middle‐age drinkers may now be the peak consumers of alcohol and most likely to exceed lifetime risk guidelines. These shifts raise concerns regarding how trajectories of drinking may have shifted from previously identified patterns. Possibly indicating that current health promotion efforts to reduce risk of alcohol‐related harms, often focused on youth drinking, could be better targeted. Work reassessing the prevalence of alcohol consumption and related behaviours across the life stages may help to identify trends in drinking and provide insight into potential stages of life of concern for use for policy or intervention implementation.

### Alcohol use and menopause [^1138zC32]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

Clinicians should periodically assess their menopausal patients' alcohol use. Specific health hazards from excessive alcohol consumption, as well as potential benefits of low-level consumption (for cardiovascular disease, bone health, and type 2 diabetes), should be discussed with their patients who drink. The information in this Practice Pearl can help clinicians provide evidence-based guidance about alcohol consumption and its relationship to common health concerns.

### Population-level risks of alcohol consumption by amount, geography, age, sex, and year: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2020 [^1131Z5th]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

The health risks associated with moderate alcohol consumption continue to be debated. Small amounts of alcohol might lower the risk of some health outcomes but increase the risk of others, suggesting that the overall risk depends, in part, on background disease rates, which vary by region, age, sex, and year.

Methods

For this analysis, we constructed burden-weighted dose-response relative risk curves across 22 health outcomes to estimate the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL) and non-drinker equivalence (NDE), the consumption level at which the health risk is equivalent to that of a non-drinker, using disease rates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2020 for 21 regions, including 204 countries and territories, by 5-year age group, sex, and year for individuals aged 15–95 years and older from 1990 to 2020. Based on the NDE, we quantified the population consuming harmful amounts of alcohol.

Findings

The burden-weighted relative risk curves for alcohol use varied by region and age. Among individuals aged 15–39 years in 2020, the TMREL varied between 0 (95% uncertainty interval 0–0) and 0·603 (0·400–1·00) standard drinks per day, and the NDE varied between 0·002 (0–0) and 1·75 (0·698–4·30) standard drinks per day. Among individuals aged 40 years and older, the burden-weighted relative risk curve was J-shaped for all regions, with a 2020 TMREL that ranged from 0·114 (0–0·403) to 1·87 (0·500–3·30) standard drinks per day and an NDE that ranged between 0·193 (0–0·900) and 6·94 (3·40–8·30) standard drinks per day. Among individuals consuming harmful amounts of alcohol in 2020, 59·1% (54·3–65·4) were aged 15–39 years and 76·9% (73·0–81·3) were male.

Interpretation

There is strong evidence to support recommendations on alcohol consumption varying by age and location. Stronger interventions, particularly those tailored towards younger individuals, are needed to reduce the substantial global health loss attributable to alcohol.

### Alcohol misuse [^115jMY2t]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol use is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity internationally, and is ranked by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the top five risk factors for disease burden. Without treatment, approximately 16% of hazardous or harmful alcohol users will progress to more dependent patterns of alcohol consumption. This review covers interventions in hazardous or harmful, but not dependent, alcohol users.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions in hazardous or harmful drinkers in the primary-care setting? What are the effects of interventions in hazardous or harmful drinkers in the emergency-department setting? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to February 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 18 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions in primary care and in emergency departments: brief intervention (single- or multiple-session); universal screening plus brief interventions; and targeted screening plus brief interventions.

### What should we recommend to our patients with NAFLD regarding alcohol use? [^1136vprR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

It is generally recommended that patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) not consume alcohol. However, because these patients are at increased cardiovascular risk, and light to moderate alcohol consumption may have hepatic benefits in people with or at risk for NAFLD, this recommendation may be ill-advised. We reviewed the literature on alcohol consumption and NAFLD and conclude that (i) heavy consumption has many harmful effects, including those on the liver, and should be discouraged whether a person has NAFLD or not; (ii) it is unknown whether cardiovascular and metabolic benefits of light to moderate consumption observed in the general population extend to those with NAFLD; (iii) epidemiological and cohort studies suggesting that light to moderate drinking may have hepatic benefits are largely cross-sectional and used surrogate end points; and (iv) until further data from rigorous prospective studies become available, people with NAFLD should avoid alcohol of any type or amount.

### How should we set consumption thresholds for low risk drinking guidelines? Achieving objectivity and transparency using evidence, expert judgement and pragmatism [^1125aMtQ]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Most high-income nations issue guidelines on low-risk drinking to inform individuals' decisions about alcohol consumption. However, leading scientists have criticized the processes for setting the consumption thresholds within these guidelines for a lack of objectivity and transparency. This paper examines how guideline developers should respond to such criticisms and focuses particularly on the balance between epidemiological evidence, expert judgement and pragmatic considerations. Although concerned primarily with alcohol, our discussion is also relevant to those developing guidelines for other health-related behaviours. We make eight recommendations across three areas. First, recommendations on the use of epidemiological evidence: (1) guideline developers should assess whether the available epidemiological evidence is communicated most appropriately as population-level messages (e.g. suggesting reduced drinking benefits populations rather than individuals); (2) research funders should prioritize commissioning studies on the acceptability of different alcohol-related risks (e.g. mortality, morbidity, harms to others) to the public and other stakeholders; and (3) guideline developers should request and consider statistical analyses of epidemiological uncertainty. Secondly, recommendations to improve objectivity and transparency when translating epidemiological evidence into guidelines: (4) guideline developers should specify and publish their analytical framework to promote clear, consistent and coherent judgements; and (5) guideline developers' decision-making should be supported by numerical and visual techniques which also increase the transparency of judgements to stakeholders. Thirdly, recommendations relating to the diverse use of guidelines: (6) guideline developers and their commissioners should give meaningful attention to how guidelines are used in settings such as advocacy, health promotion, clinical practice and wider health debates, as well as in risk communication; (7) guideline developers should make evidence-based judgements that balance epidemiological and pragmatic concerns to maximize the communicability, credibility and general effectiveness of guidelines; and (8) as with scientific judgements, pragmatic judgements should be reported transparently.

### Effect of alcohol label designs with different pictorial representations of alcohol content and health warnings on knowledge and understanding of low-risk drinking guidelines: a randomized controlled trial [^112d4e5M]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

The main aims of this trial were:
to compare the effectiveness of different label designs at conveying knowledge that the LRDG is 14 units; and
to compare the effectiveness of different label designs at conveying understanding of how many servings (bottle or can of beer, glass of wine or shot of spirits) or containers (the entire bottle being purchased) could be consumed while remaining within the LRDG.

to compare the effect of the designs on the perceived risk of alcohol consumption;
to compare the effect of the designs on the motivation to drink; and
to compare the effect of the designs on participants' perception of 'health‐damaging' drinking (how many units per week they personally thought it would take for a person to 'seriously damage' their health).

Secondary aims were: Finally, we wanted to see whether showing people a health warning alongside our label designs would have a further effect on our secondary outcomes, increasing the perceived risk of alcohol consumption, decreasing the motivation to drink and lowering the level of drinking which people believe to be health‐damaging. This was designed as a pilot study, because we were not well‐powered; in particular, we could not detect an interaction effect between the warning and the label designs, but we hoped to gain some idea as to whether this hypothesis was worth pursing in future trials.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective associations between alcohol consumption and incident frailty [^115XSzFW]. Age and Ageing (2018). Low credibility.

Background

light-to-moderate alcohol consumption is protective against all-cause mortality and cardiovascular diseases. There is limited evidence in the literature on how alcohol consumption is related to frailty.

Methods

five databases (Embase, Scopus, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO) were systematically searched in July 2016 for prospective studies published between 2000 and 2016 examining baseline alcohol consumption and subsequent frailty risk among middle-aged or older community-dwelling population. Odds ratios (ORs) for incident frailty were pooled using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity, methodological quality and publication bias were assessed.

Results

of 926 studies identified by the systematic search, four studies were included (total n = 44,051, ≥ 55 years, 66.2% alcohol users). OR of incident frailty for the highest (at least 24 g of alcohol/day for men, 12g of alcohol/day for women) or the most frequent (≥ 5 days of drinking/week) alcohol consumption compared with no drinking were used for a meta-analysis. Pooled OR among three studies measuring alcohol consumption quantitatively showed that the highest alcohol consumption was associated with lower frailty risk (3 studies:pooled OR = 0.44, 95%CI = 0.19–1.00, P = 0.05). Adding the other study measuring frequency of alcohol consumption made little change (4 studies:pooled OR = 0.61, 95%CI = 0.44–0.77, P < 0.001). Two of the included studies suggested a possible U-shaped association with lowest risks for moderate drinkers. Heterogeneity was moderate in both analyses (I² = 52–67%). There was no evidence of publication bias.

Conclusions

this systematic review and meta-analysis study provides the first pooled evidence suggesting that heavier alcohol consumption is associated with lower incident frailty compared with no alcohol consumption among community-dwelling middle-aged and older people. However, this association may be due to unadjusted effect measures, residual confounding, 'sick quitter' effect or survival bias.

### New perspectives on how to formulate alcohol drinking guidelines [^1165PBtZ]. Addiction (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines (LRDGs) aim to reduce the harms caused by alcohol. However, considerable discrepancies exist in the 'low-risk' thresholds employed by different countries.

Argument/Analysis

Drawing upon Canada's LRDGs update process, the current paper offers the following propositions for debate regarding the establishment of 'low-risk' thresholds in national guidelines: (1) as an indicator of health loss, years of life lost (YLL) has several advantages that could make it more suitable for setting guidelines than deaths, premature deaths or disability adjusted years of life (DALYs) lost. (2) Presenting age-specific guidelines may not be the most appropriate way of providing LRDGs. (3) Given past overemphasis on the so-called protective effects of alcohol on health, presenting cause-specific guidelines may not be appropriate compared with a 'whole health' effect derived from a weighted composite risk function comprising conditions that are causally related to alcohol consumption. (4) To help people reduce their alcohol use, presenting different risk zones associated with alcohol consumption instead of a single low risk threshold may be advantageous.

Conclusions

National LRDGs should be based on years of life lost and should be neither age-specific nor cause-specific. We recommend using risk zones rather than a single drinking threshold to help people assess their own risk and encourage the adoption of behaviours with positive health impacts across the alcohol use spectrum.

### The cost-effectiveness of increasing alcohol taxes: a modelling study [^1126HHYJ]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Table 1
Relative risks 1 of four different categories of alcohol consumption on disease incidence and all-cause mortality, both for men (upper row) and women (lower row)

1 For 95% confidence intervals for all relative risks, see Holman et al.

2 Definitions of alcohol consumption categories:

moderate: fewer than two standard drinks (< 20 g) per day for women, and fewer than four standard drinks (< 40 g) per day for men;

excessive: 2–4 standard drinks (20–40 g) per day for women, and 4–6 standard drinks (40–60 g) per day for men;

dangerous: more than four standard drinks (> 40 g) per day for women, and more than six standard drinks (> 60 g) per day for men.

Table 1 shows the challenge and difficulties of alcohol prevention policies, as moderate and even excessive consumption of alcohol not only has negative public health effects, but positive effects as well. It should be noted that oesophageal, laryngeal and oral cavity cancers have a low incidence compared with cardiovascular disease, stroke and breast cancer. On balance, excessive and dangerous levels of alcohol consumption have been shown to have an elevated mortality risk.

Scenarios

To evaluate the long-term effects of alcohol tax increases, the following two intervention scenarios were compared with the current practice scenario (excise taxes as implemented in 2007 in the Netherlands).

0 Current practice: in the Netherlands the taxes on alcohol are 8 cents per bottle of beer (0.3 litre), 44 cents per bottle of wine (0.75 litre), and 371 cents per bottle of spirit (0.7 litre).

1 'Dutch scenario': health effects and cost-effectiveness of the tax increase as currently planned for 2009 are estimated. The government has planned a tax increase on beer of 2.7 cents per bottle of beer (0.3 litre). As currently planned, excise taxes for spirits will remain unchanged compared with the current practice scenario. It is assumed that producers fully pass on the tax increase to consumers.

### Are the public health responsibility deal alcohol pledges likely to improve public health? An evidence synthesis [^11766uLM]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

The English Public Health Responsibility Deal (RD) is a public-private partnership involving voluntary pledges between industry, government and other actors in various areas including alcohol, and designed to improve public health. This paper reviews systematically the evidence underpinning four RD alcohol pledges.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of reviews of the evidence underpinning interventions proposed in four RD alcohol pledges, namely alcohol labelling, tackling underage alcohol sales, advertising and marketing alcohol, and alcohol unit reduction. In addition, we included relevant studies of interventions where these had not been covered by a recent review.

Results

We synthesized the evidence from 14 reviews published between 2002 and 2013. Overall, alcohol labelling is likely to be of limited effect on consumption: alcohol unit content labels can help consumers assess the alcohol content of drinks; however, labels promoting drinking guidelines and pregnancy warning labels are unlikely to influence drinking behaviour. Responsible drinking messages are found to be ambiguous, and industry-funded alcohol prevention campaigns can promote drinking instead of dissuading consumption. Removing advertising near schools can contribute to reducing underage drinking; however, community mobilization and law enforcement are most effective. Finally, reducing alcohol consumption is more likely to occur if there are incentives such as making lower-strength alcohol products cheaper.

Conclusions

The most effective evidence-based strategies to reduce alcohol-related harm are not reflected consistently in the RD alcohol pledges. The evidence is clear that an alcohol control strategy should support effective interventions to make alcohol less available and more expensive.

### A 42-year-old man considering whether to drink alcohol for his health [^111vreM5]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Alcohol consumption is widespread and, in excess, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. At the same time, a consistent body of observational evidence has found that individuals who consume alcohol within recommended limits have a lower risk of coronary heart disease than do abstainers. These observations have led many to consider small amounts of alcohol as a cardioprotective strategy. Mr Q, a 42-year-old man who has consistently sought ways to preserve his health, is at a crossroads in his discussions with his physicians about the health effects of his regular, limited alcohol intake. The discussion reviews the epidemiology of drinking in the United States, the established effects of moderate alcohol intake on key pathophysiological biomarkers and pathways, the strengths and limitations of observational evidence linking alcohol intake to lower risk of coronary heart disease, other chronic diseases linked to moderate alcohol intake, and a framework in which Mr Q can discuss the potential risks and benefits of alcohol consumption with his physicians.

### Estimated effect of alcohol pricing policies on health and health economic outcomes in england: an epidemiological model [^115YQyer]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Although pricing policies for alcohol are known to be effective, little is known about how specific interventions affect health-care costs and health-related quality-of-life outcomes for different types of drinkers. We assessed effects of alcohol pricing and promotion policy options in various population subgroups.

Methods

We built an epidemiological mathematical model to appraise 18 pricing policies, with English data from the Expenditure and Food Survey and the General Household Survey for average and peak alcohol consumption. We used results from econometric analyses (256 own-price and cross-price elasticity estimates) to estimate effects of policies on alcohol consumption. We applied risk functions from systemic reviews and meta-analyses, or derived from attributable fractions, to model the effect of consumption changes on mortality and disease prevalence for 47 illnesses.

Findings

General price increases were effective for reduction of consumption, health-care costs, and health-related quality of life losses in all population subgroups. Minimum pricing policies can maintain this level of effectiveness for harmful drinkers while reducing effects on consumer spending for moderate drinkers. Total bans of supermarket and off-license discounting are effective but banning only large discounts has little effect. Young adult drinkers aged 18–24 years are especially affected by policies that raise prices in pubs and bars.

Interpretation

Minimum pricing policies and discounting restrictions might warrant further consideration because both strategies are estimated to reduce alcohol consumption, and related health harms and costs, with drinker spending increases targeting those who incur most harm.

### Alcohol misuse [^114heF7A]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol use is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity internationally, and is ranked by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the top 5 risk factors for disease burden. Without treatment, approximately 16% of hazardous or harmful alcohol users will progress to more dependent patterns of alcohol consumption. This review covers interventions in hazardous or harmful, but not dependent, alcohol users.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions in hazardous or harmful drinkers in the primary-care setting? What are the effects of interventions in hazardous or harmful drinkers in the emergency-department setting? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 21 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions in primary care and in emergency departments: brief intervention (single or multiple session), universal screening plus brief interventions, and targeted screening plus brief interventions.

### Measuring alcohol consumption for genomic meta-analyses of alcohol intake: opportunities and challenges [^111NJp48]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Whereas moderate drinking may have health benefits, excessive alcohol consumption causes many important acute and chronic diseases and is the third leading contributor to preventable death in the United States. Twin studies suggest that alcohol-consumption patterns are heritable (50%); however, multiple genetic variants of modest effect size are likely to contribute to this heritable variation. Genome-wide association studies provide a tool for discovering genetic loci that contribute to variations in alcohol consumption. Opportunities exist to identify susceptibility loci with modest effect by meta-analyzing together multiple studies. However, existing studies assessed many different aspects of alcohol use, such as typical compared with heavy drinking, and these different assessments can be difficult to reconcile. In addition, many studies lack the ability to distinguish between lifetime and recent abstention or to assess the pattern of drinking during the week, and a variety of such concerns surround the appropriateness of developing a common summary measure of alcohol intake. Combining such measures of alcohol intake can cause heterogeneity and exposure misclassification, cause a reduction in power, and affect the magnitude of genetic association signals. In this review, we discuss the challenges associated with harmonizing alcohol-consumption data from studies with widely different assessment instruments, with a particular focus on large-scale genetic studies.

### Population-level risks of alcohol consumption by amount, geography, age, sex, and year: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2020 [^115zerQ8]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Understanding the variation in the level of alcohol consumption that minimises the risk of ill health for populations can aid in setting effective consumption guidelines, supporting alcohol control policies, monitoring progress in reducing harmful alcohol use, and designing public health risk messaging. Most alcohol consumption guidelines for the general population combine recommendations to avoid alcohol use with the definition of lower-risk alcohol consumption thresholds, which tend to vary between 8 g and 42 g of alcohol per day for females, and between 10 g and 52 g of alcohol per day for males. Generally, thresholds are one standard drink greater for men than for women, and some lower-risk thresholds are framed in units of weekly consumption that come with a recommendation to avoid alcohol entirely for several days of the week.

In our analysis, the population-specific TMRELs ranged between 0 (95% UI 0–0) and 0·603 (0·400–1·00) standard drinks per day among individuals aged 15–39 years across world regions, and the NDEs ranged between 0 (0–0) and 1·75 (0·698–4·30) standard drinks per day among individuals aged 15–39 years across world regions in 2020. Even if a conservative approach is taken and the lower bound of the uncertainty interval is used to set policy recommendations rather than the mean, this implies that the recommended level of alcohol consumption in existing low consumption recommendations is too high for younger populations. Our estimates, based on currently available evidence, also do not support low consumption guidelines that differ by sex. Given the known difficulties associated with translating evidence into changes in consumer behaviour, clear messaging around updates to drinking guidelines will be crucial to ensure the full improvements are realised.

### Alcohol consumption and cardiovascular health [^113q22SL]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies evaluating alcohol consumption and cardiovascular diseases have shown inconsistent results.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of peer-reviewed publications from an extensive query of Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Scopus, and Web of Science from database inception to March 2022 for all studies that reported the association between alcohol consumption in terms of quantity (daily or weekly amounts) and type of beverage (wine, beer or spirit) and cardiovascular disease events.

Results

The study population included a total of 1,579,435 individuals based on 56 cohorts from several countries. We found that moderate wine consumption defined as 1–4 drinks per week was associated with a reduction in risk for cardiovascular mortality when compared with beer or spirits. However, higher risk for cardiovascular disease mortality was typically seen with heavier daily or weekly alcohol consumption across all types of beverages.

Conclusions

It is possible that the observational studies may overestimate the benefits of alcohol for cardiovascular disease outcomes. Although moderate wine consumption is probably associated with low cardiovascular disease events, there are many confounding factors, in particular, lifestyle, genetic, and socioeconomic associations with wine drinking, which likely explain much of the association with wine and reduced cardiovascular disease events. Further prospective study of alcohol and all-cause mortality, including cancer, is needed.

### The IARC perspective on the effects of policies on reducing alcohol consumption [^114jupR4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified alcoholic beverages as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) based on sufficient evidence of causality for seven types of cancer (oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, liver, colorectum, female breast). Globally, an estimated 741,300 (4.1%) new cancer cases in 2020 were attributable to alcohol consumption. In addition to cancer, alcohol consumption is a risk factor for numerous other health conditions.

The IARC Handbooks of Cancer Prevention Program developed a two-part volume (20A and 20B) on the primary prevention of alcohol-related cancers (Figure 1).

There is sufficient evidence that, compared with continuing consumption, reduction or cessation of alcoholic beverage consumption reduces risk of oral and esophageal cancers, and sufficient evidence from mechanistic studies that cessation of alcohol consumption reduces alcohol-related carcinogenesis (volume 20A).

For Volume 20B, a Working Group reviewed and qualitatively evaluated the strength of the evidence on the potential for select alcohol policy interventions to reduce alcohol consumption (Figure). The interventions evaluated were selected because their implementation aims to reduce consumption at the national or subnational level, which has been shown to effectively reduce alcohol-attributable harms. In addition, the evidence on the effectiveness of healthcare-based interventions to reduce alcohol consumption is summarized but not evaluated, because they target individuals and their potential population-level effects on consumption are not usually measured. However, a robust body of evidence supports the use of screening, brief interventions, and longer-term psychosocial therapies, which may be combined with pharmacotherapy, to increase abstinence rates and improve other outcomes among individuals with alcohol use disorders. The key findings for Volume 20B are summarized herein.

### Effect of alcohol health warning labels on knowledge related to the ill effects of alcohol on cancer risk and their public perceptions in 14 European countries: an online survey experiment [^113Xj1Ca]. The Lancet: Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Our study reveals that Europeans across most of the demographic and alcohol consumption-related factors consistently perceive AHWLs as acceptable, relevant, and effective. Specifically, labels linking alcohol use to specific cancers increased the knowledge of participants and were perceived as being effective and relevant. Perceived impact, relevance, and acceptability were highest when the cancer message was accompanied by a warning symbol. Considering the effects of alcohol on health, low awareness of an alcohol–cancer link, and the relevance and acceptability of the cancer message, providing such information through product labelling would reach a large number of consumers at the points of purchase and consumption, and satisfy their right to know about the harms associated with the product they are consuming.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111urW6L]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — alcohol consumption — There is a long-established positive linear association between alcohol consumption, BP, the prevalence of hypertension, and CVD risk, and binge drinking can have a strong pressor effect; in PATHS, alcohol reduction produced a modest 1.2/ 0.7 mmHg lower BP than control. A Mendelian randomization meta-analysis of 56 epidemiological studies suggested that reduction of alcohol consumption, even for light-moderate drinkers, might be beneficial for CV health, and hypertensive men who drink alcohol should be advised to limit their consumption.

### The relationship between different dimensions of alcohol use and the burden of disease-an update [^1119oSd5]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

We would like to finish this review with a reminder that while the alcohol‐attributable burden of disease and mortality is large, it is only part of the harm of alcohol use. Social harm outside of health harm is impacted by similar dimensions of alcohol use (e.g. 90, 353), and should be included in any considerations of the overall impact of alcohol use in our societies.

### Association of alcohol consumption with morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease: original data and meta-analysis of 48, 423 men and women [^112gumF5]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lifestyle and dietary habits play an important role in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the impact of alcohol consumption on CVD patients' prognosis is unclear and recommendations for patients regarding upper limits of drinking vary substantially across different guidelines. While light-to-moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a lower risk of developing multiple cardiovascular outcomes in general population cohorts, it is difficult to extend the posited cardio-protective effects to CVD patients because of their typically older age and compromised vasculature as well as the medications they take to prevent secondary events. In addition, for CVD patients, there are concerns about the potential detrimental effects of alcohol on the circulatory system, such as hypertension, arrhythmias, and haemorrhagic stroke, which may exacerbate their existing pathological conditions.

The most recent meta-analysis to have explored the association between alcohol consumption and prognosis among CVD patients was undertaken by Costanzo et al. in 2010. Pooling data from eight observational studies published between 1998 and 2008, they identified a maximal 22% relative risk (RR) reduction at approximately 8 g/day for cardiovascular mortality and 18% at 7 g/day for all-cause mortality among patients with myocardial infarction (MI), angina, or stroke, relative to non-drinkers, with risk increasing in a dose dependent manner above these levels. However, their analysis was limited to studies only on mortality and did not consider any non-fatal outcomes. Understanding how alcohol consumption is related to cardiovascular morbidity is of great importance to CVD patients because this population is at high risk of recurring cardiovascular events which can significantly compromise the patients' quality of life. Including morbidity information will complement the existing evidence base to provide a more complete picture of how alcohol consumption can be managed for optimal secondary CVD prevention. Additionally, further studies have been published in the decade since the last meta-analysis. Given the growing debate on this topic, a more detailed and comprehensive reassessment of the evidence is warranted in the absence of long-term clinical trials.

We thus analysed individual data from three large-scale cohorts. In addition to estimating risk of mortality among CVD patients, we also examined the association between alcohol intake and subsequent cardiovascular events. To consolidate all available evidence on this topic, we conducted meta-analyses of our results with those from published studies identified through a systematic review.

### Association of alcohol consumption with selected cardiovascular disease outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116HDu7h]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Possible cardioprotective effects of alcohol consumption seen in observational studies continue to be hotly debated in the medical literature and popular media. In the absence of clinical trials, clinicians must interpret these data when answering patients' questions about taking alcohol to reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have addressed the association of alcohol consumption with cardiovascular disease outcomesbut have not uniformly addressed associations between alcohol use and mortality from cardiovascular disease, as well as the incidence and mortality from coronary heart disease and stroke. Additionally, further studies have been published since 2006, when the most recent reviews appeared. The continuing debate on this subject warrants an in depth reassessment of the evidence.

In this paper, we synthesise results from longitudinal cohort studies comparing alcohol drinkers with non-drinkers for the outcomes of overall mortality from cardiovascular disease, incident coronary heart disease, mortality from coronary heart disease, incident stroke, and mortality from stroke. Because of the many biological effects of alcohol consumption, we also examine the association of alcohol with mortality from all causes when this is reported in studies. We conducted meta-analyses for each of these outcomes and a sensitivity analysis with lifetime abstainers as the reference category to account for the heterogeneity within the reference group of non-drinkers. We also examined the effect of confounding on the strength of observed associations. In our companion paper, we link these cardiovascular outcomes with experimental trials of alcohol consumption on candidate causal molecular markers.

### Alcohol intake and risk of hypertension: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of nonexperimental cohort studies [^1123ZqHK]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

The association between alcohol consumption and hypertension is especially important because of the high prevalence of alcohol consumption above a light intake in many countries and the well-demonstrated association between hypertension and adverse effects, including risk of cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, and kidney damage. – Our findings have implications for public health and recommendations related to the safety of alcohol consumption, both for men (in whom, any consumption may be detrimental, but particularly a high consumption) and women (in whom 1–1.5 drinks a day may not to be related to an excess risk of hypertension). In a previous meta-analysis, a similar alcohol intake threshold for risk of hypertension was identified in women while no inflection point and therefore no safe range of intake was identified in men.

Our findings are in contrast with previous reports suggesting that light to moderate alcohol consumption does not adversely affect the risk of hypertension, and may even decrease it depending on sex and ethnicity, since the RR pattern we computed did not suggest any beneficial effect of low levels of alcohol consumption compared with no consumption and especially with a high consumption for risk of hypertension. In a previous meta-analysis, based on a smaller number of studies, there was a slight indication of an inverse association with the risk of hypertension in women consuming small amounts of alcohol, that is, 1 to 2 drinks/day (RR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.89–1.02]).

### Long-term alcohol consumption and incident health risk conditions related to cardiometabolic risk markers: a 20-year prospective cohort study [^111chQw8]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

As a potentially addictive substance, alcohol's global availability and accessibility have led to widespread social and personal consumption, resulting in significant population‐scale impacts on human health and extensive organ damage. Recent statistics from the European Society of Cardiology indicate that recommended upper limits for alcohol consumption vary significantly between countries, reflecting a lack of consensus on risk thresholds. In 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no amount of alcohol consumption is safe for health. Recent large‐scale studies and meta‐analyses have questioned the perceived relationship between low‐to‐moderate alcohol intake and lower cardiovascular risk. The mechanisms underlying the associations between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain unclear.

CVD development is closely related to cardiometabolic risks such as metabolic syndrome (MetS), dyslipidemia and chronic inflammation. For example, CVD risk is associated with cardiometabolic risk markers, including components of MetS, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) and C‐reactive protein (CRP). Alcohol diffuses extensively throughout the body, causing widespread organ damage, particularly to the liver. The liver plays a crucial role in cholesterol metabolism and the regulation of plasma cholesterol levels. Alcohol‐induced sensitization of liver macrophages to lipopolysaccharide is a key feature of alcoholic liver disease, leading to the activation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor‐κB and activator protein‐1 and resulting in increased production of inflammatory cytokines. MetS is characterized by low‐grade inflammation, involving both systemic inflammation and central abdominal fat inflammation. Taken together, alcohol, as an active toxin, may influence cardiometabolic risk markers.

### Reducing alcohol use to prevent cancer deaths: estimated effects among U.S. adults [^1177mbWZ]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025 recommends non-drinking or no more than 2 drinks for men or 1 drink for women in a day. However, even at lower levels, alcohol use increases the risk for certain cancers. This study estimated mean annual alcohol-attributable cancer deaths and the number of cancer deaths that could potentially be prevented if all U.S. adults who drank in excess of the Dietary Guidelines had instead consumed alcohol to correspond with typical consumption of those who drink within the recommended limits.

Methods

Among U.S. residents aged ≥ 20 years, mean annual alcohol-attributable cancer deaths during 2020–2021 that could have been prevented with hypothetical reductions in alcohol use were estimated. Mean daily alcohol consumption prevalence estimates from the 2020–2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, adjusted to per capita alcohol sales to address underreporting of drinking, were applied to relative risks to calculate population-attributable fractions for cancers that can occur from drinking alcohol. Analyses were conducted during February-April 2023.

Results

In the U.S., an estimated 20,216 cancer deaths were alcohol-attributable/year during 2020–2021 (men: 14,562 [72.0%]; women: 5,654 [28.0%]). Approximately 16,800 deaths (83% of alcohol-attributable cancer deaths, 2.8% of all cancer deaths) could have been prevented/year if adults who drank alcohol in excess of the Dietary Guidelines had instead reduced their consumption to ≤ 2 drinks/day for men or ≤ 1 drink/day for women. Approximately 650 additional deaths could have been prevented annually if men consumed 1 drink/day, instead of 2.

Conclusions

Implementing evidence-based alcohol policies (e.g., increasing alcohol taxes, regulating alcohol outlet density) to decrease drinking could reduce alcohol-attributable cancers, complementing clinical interventions.

### Effect of alcohol on blood pressure [^116siVqb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcohol is consumed by over 2 billion people worldwide. It is a common substance of abuse and its use can lead to more than 200 disorders including hypertension. Alcohol has both acute and chronic effects on blood pressure. This review aimed to quantify the acute effects of different doses of alcohol over time on blood pressure and heart rate in an adult population.

Objectives

Primary objective To determine short-term dose-related effects of alcohol versus placebo on systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure in healthy and hypertensive adults over 18 years of age. Secondary objective To determine short-term dose-related effects of alcohol versus placebo on heart rate in healthy and hypertensive adults over 18 years of age.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to March 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 2), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (from 1946); Embase (from 1974); the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant articles regarding further published and unpublished work. These searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing effects of a single dose of alcohol versus placebo on blood pressure (BP) or heart rate (HR) in adults (≥ 18 years of age).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (ST and CT) independently extracted data and assessed the quality of included studies. We also contacted trial authors for missing or unclear information. Mean difference (MD) from placebo with 95% confidence interval (CI) was the outcome measure, and a fixed-effect model was used to combine effect sizes across studies. MAIN RESULTS: We included 32 RCTs involving 767 participants. Most of the study participants were male (N = 642) and were healthy. The mean age of participants was 33 years, and mean body weight was 78 kilograms. Low-dose alcohol (< 14 g) within six hours (2 RCTs, N = 28) did not affect BP but did increase HR by 5.1 bpm (95% CI 1.9 to 8.2) (moderate-certainty evidence). Medium-dose alcohol (14 to 28 g) within six hours (10 RCTs, N = 149) decreased systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 5.6 mmHg (95% CI -8.3 to -3.0) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 4.0 mmHg (95% CI -6.0 to -2.0) and increased HR by 4.6 bpm (95% CI 3.1 to 6.1) (moderate-certainty evidence for all). Medium-dose alcohol within 7 to 12 hours (4 RCTs, N = 54) did not affect BP or HR. Medium-dose alcohol > 13 hours after consumption (4 RCTs, N = 66) did not affect BP or HR. High-dose alcohol (> 30 g) within six hours (16 RCTs, N = 418) decreased SBP by 3.5 mmHg (95% CI -6.0 to -1.0), decreased DBP by 1.9 mmHg (95% CI-3.9 to 0.04), and increased HR by 5.8 bpm (95% CI 4.0 to 7.5). The certainty of evidence was moderate for SBP and HR, and was low for DBP. High-dose alcohol within 7 to 12 hours of consumption (3 RCTs, N = 54) decreased SBP by 3.7 mmHg (95% CI -7.0 to -0.5) and DBP by 1.7 mmHg (95% CI -4.6 to 1.8) and increased HR by 6.2 bpm (95% CI 3.0 to 9.3). The certainty of evidence was moderate for SBP and HR, and low for DBP. High-dose alcohol ≥ 13 hours after consumption (4 RCTs, N = 154) increased SBP by 3.7 mmHg (95% CI 2.3 to 5.1), DBP by 2.4 mmHg (95% CI 0.2 to 4.5), and HR by 2.7 bpm (95% CI 0.8 to 4.6) (moderate-certainty evidence for all). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: High-dose alcohol has a biphasic effect on BP; it decreases BP up to 12 hours after consumption and increases BP > 13 hours after consumption. High-dose alcohol increases HR at all times up to 24 hours. Findings of this review are relevant mainly to healthy males, as only small numbers of women were included in the included trials.

### Association of alcohol consumption with selected cardiovascular disease outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114m1AKs]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of studies assessing the effect of alcohol consumption on multiple cardiovascular outcomes.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

A search of Medline (1950 through September 2009) and Embase (1980 through September 2009) supplemented by manual searches of bibliographies and conference proceedings. Inclusion criteria Prospective cohort studies on the association between alcohol consumption and overall mortality from cardiovascular disease, incidence of and mortality from coronary heart disease, and incidence of and mortality from stroke. Studies reviewed Of 4235 studies reviewed for eligibility, quality, and data extraction, 84 were included in the final analysis.

Results

The pooled adjusted relative risks for alcohol drinkers relative to non-drinkers in random effects models for the outcomes of interest were 0.75 (95% confidence interval 0.70 to 0.80) for cardiovascular disease mortality (21 studies), 0.71 (0.66 to 0.77) for incident coronary heart disease (29 studies), 0.75 (0.68 to 0.81) for coronary heart disease mortality (31 studies), 0.98 (0.91 to 1.06) for incident stroke (17 studies), and 1.06 (0.91 to 1.23) for stroke mortality (10 studies). Dose-response analysis revealed that the lowest risk of coronary heart disease mortality occurred with 1–2 drinks a day, but for stroke mortality it occurred with ≤ 1 drink per day. Secondary analysis of mortality from all causes showed lower risk for drinkers compared with non-drinkers (relative risk 0.87 (0.83 to 0.92)).

Conclusions

Light to moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a reduced risk of multiple cardiovascular outcomes.

### The effect of a reduction in alcohol consumption on blood pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114t1DXx]. The Lancet: Public Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Although it is well established that heavy alcohol consumption increases the risk of hypertension, little is known about the effect of a reduction of alcohol intake on blood pressure. We aimed to assess the effect of a reduction in alcohol consumption on change in blood pressure stratified by initial amount of alcohol consumption and sex in adults.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MedLine, Embase, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov from database inception up to July 13, 2016, for trials investigating the effect of a change of alcohol consumption on blood pressure in adults using keywords and MeSH terms related to alcohol consumption, blood pressure, and clinical trials, with no language restrictions. We also searched reference lists of identified articles and published meta-analyses and reviews. We included full-text articles with original human trial data for the effect of a change of alcohol consumption on blood pressure in adults, which reported a quantifiable change in average alcohol consumption that lasted at least 7 days and a corresponding change in blood pressure. We extracted data from published reports. We did random-effects meta-analyses stratified by amount of alcohol intake at baseline. All meta-analyses were done with Stata (version 14.1). For the UK, we modelled the effect of a reduction of alcohol consumption for 50% of the population drinking more than two standard drinks per day (ie, 12 g pure alcohol per drink).

Findings

36 trials with 2865 participants (2464 men and 401 women) were included. In people who drank two or fewer drinks per day, a reduction in alcohol was not associated with a significant reduction in blood pressure; however, in people who drank more than two drinks per day, a reduction in alcohol intake was associated with increased blood pressure reduction. Reduction in systolic blood pressure (mean difference -5·50 mm Hg, 95% CI -6·70 to -4·30) and diastolic blood pressure (-3·97, -4·70 to -3·25) was strongest in participants who drank six or more drinks per day if they reduced their intake by about 50%. For the UK, the results would translate into more than 7000 inpatient hospitalisations and 678 cardiovascular deaths prevented every year.

Interpretation

Reducing alcohol intake lowers blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner with an apparent threshold effect. Implementation of effective alcohol interventions in people who drink more than two drinks per day would reduce the disease burden from both alcohol consumption and hypertension, and should be prioritised in countries with substantial alcohol-attributable risk.

### Alcohol intake reduction for controlling hypertension [^113SdWQN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

High blood pressure constitutes one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity all over the world. At the same time, heavy drinking increases the risk for developing cardiovascular diseases, including cardiomyopathy, hypertension, atrial arrhythmias, or stroke. Several studies have already assessed specifically the relationship between alcohol intake and hypertension. However, the potential effect on blood pressure of alcohol intake reduction interventions is largely unknown.

Objectives

To assess the effect of any intervention to reduce alcohol intake in terms of blood pressure decrease in hypertensive people with alcohol consumption compared to a control intervention or no intervention at all. To determine additional effects related to mortality, major cardiovascular events, serious adverse events, or quality of life.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to June 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 5, 2020), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), MEDLINE Ovid Epub Ahead of Print, and MEDLINE Ovid In-Process, Embase Ovid (from 1974), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Trial authors were contacted when needed and no language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials with minimum 12 weeks duration and including 50 or more subjects per group with quantitative measurement of alcohol consumption and/or biological measurement of the outcomes of interest. Participants were adults (16 years of age or older) with systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 90 mmHg, and SBP ≥ 130 or DBP ≥ 80 mmHg in participants with diabetes. We included any intervention implemented to reduce their alcohol intake.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures adopted by Cochrane.

Main Results

A total of 1210 studies were screened. We included one randomised controlled trial involving a total of 269 participants with a two-year follow-up. Individual patient data for all participants were provided and used in this review. No differences were found between the cognitive-behavioural intervention group and the control group for overall mortality (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.17; low-certainty evidence), cardiovascular mortality (not estimable) and cardiovascular events (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.79; very low-certainty evidence). There was no statistical difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction (Mean Difference (MD) -0.92 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.66 to 3.82 mmHg; very low-certainty evidence) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decrease (MD 0.98 mmHg, 95% CI -1.69 to 3.65 mmHg; low-certainty evidence) between the cognitive-behavioural intervention group and the control group. We also did not find any differences in the proportion of subjects with SBP < 140 mmHg and DBP < 90 mmHg (Risk Ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.65; very low-certainty evidence). Concerning secondary outcomes, the alcohol intake was significantly reduced in the cognitive-behavioural intervention compared with the control group (MD 191.33 g, 95% CI 85.36 to 297.30 g). We found no differences between the active and control intervention in the proportion of subjects with lower-risk alcohol intake versus higher-risk and extreme drinkers at the end of the study (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.60). There were no estimable results for the quality of life outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

An intervention for decreasing alcohol intake consumption did not result in differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure when compared with a control intervention, although there was a reduction in alcohol intake favouring the active intervention. No differences were found either for overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular events. No data on serious adverse events or quality of life were available to assess. Adequate randomised controlled trials are needed to provide additional evidence on this specific question.

It is challenging to tease out the direct effects of alcohol consumption from these biases and confounding factors in observational studies. However, these inconsistent findings may be resolved by some methodological advancement. To address causal questions in observational studies, Mendelian randomization has been used, and it was found that it is not possible to draw conclusion on the causal role of moderate drinking and cardio-metabolic health. The same conclusion has been drawn from a genetic epidemiological study which shows that the apparently protective effects of moderate alcohol intake against stroke are largely non-causal. This year (2023), the World Health Organization (WHO) published a statement indicating that "when it comes to alcohol consumption, there is no safe amount that does not affect health" and alcohol is responsible for 3 million deaths in 2016 globally and 5.1% of the global burden of disease and injury estimated by the WHO. The updated guidance on alcohol health in Canada also presented a continuum of risk and stated that "Drinking less is better".
