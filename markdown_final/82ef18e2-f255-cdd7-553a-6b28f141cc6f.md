## Question

What are symptoms of copper deficiency in adults

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the symptoms of copper deficiency in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the major organ systems involved and the classic clinical syndromes. Then, I should verify the hematologic manifestations and how they mimic myelodysplastic syndrome. Next, I will examine the neurologic syndrome and its resemblance to subacute combined degeneration. After that, I need to check musculoskeletal and other systemic features. Finally, I will consider risk factors and the diagnostic implications that tie symptoms to causes, making sure I anchor each point to appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the overarching clinical picture. Copper deficiency in adults most consistently affects hematopoiesis and the nervous system, with additional musculoskeletal and systemic features, and the syndrome is often underrecognized because it can mimic vitamin B12 deficiency and myelodysplastic syndrome, so I need to keep those mimics in mind as I proceed [^117Dkbdz] [^113FS5NH].

> I will now examine the hematologic manifestations, since these are frequently the earliest and most readily detected. Anemia is common and can be microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, and importantly, it may be refractory to iron supplementation because iron can competitively inhibit copper absorption, so I should double-check for that interaction when anemia fails to respond to iron therapy [^117Dkbdz] [^115aUPfR]. Neutropenia is a hallmark and often coexists with anemia, while thrombocytopenia can occur in more severe cases, and the marrow may show dysplastic changes with vacuolated precursors that can mislead clinicians into diagnosing myelodysplastic syndrome, so I need to ensure copper studies are obtained when MDS is suspected, especially with neuropathy or GI disease [^113FS5NH] [^115YFVhh] [^114yk5NT].

> Wait, let me verify the neurologic syndrome because this is where delays in diagnosis cause irreversibility. The classic presentation is a myeloneuropathy with sensory ataxia, spastic gait, hyperreflexia, distal sensory loss, and impaired proprioception and vibration, often with a positive Romberg sign, which mirrors subacute combined degeneration from B12 deficiency; electrodiagnostics frequently show abnormal somatosensory evoked potentials reflecting central proprioceptive pathway impairment, and MRI may show dorsal column T2 hyperintensity in the cervical and thoracic cord, which can partially reverse with copper repletion if treated early [^114ky5Hx] [^1139Lsav] [^113a7jU1] [^112Xiv1k] [^111VcoYd]. Hold on, I should also note that lower motor neuron–like weakness and denervation have been reported, so motor neuron disease remains in the differential, but copper-responsive cases do occur and should be considered when risk factors are present [^111USMUy].

> Let me consider musculoskeletal and other systemic features so I don't miss them. Patients may have osteoporosis or skeletal demineralization, muscle weakness, and edema, and some reports describe fragile hair and skin changes, though these are less specific and may be confounded by coexisting nutritional deficits; I should confirm these findings in the context of overall malnutrition or malabsorption rather than attributing them solely to copper deficiency [^117Dkbdz] [^117N4ssg].

> Next, I should review the risk factors that make these symptoms more likely, because recognizing them should trigger copper testing. Excess zinc intake from supplements or denture adhesives is a major cause via competitive inhibition of copper absorption, and zinc product labels explicitly warn about copper deficiency with prolonged high-dose zinc, so I need to ask about zinc use carefully and correlate with copper and ceruloplasmin levels [^117Dkbdz] [^114t24Cs]. Bariatric surgery, especially Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and BPD/DS, carries a substantial long-term risk of copper deficiency due to altered GI anatomy, and guidelines recommend proactive supplementation and monitoring, so I should confirm surgical history and supplement details in any post-bariatric patient with cytopenias or neuropathy [^114THq5k] [^112MnYDk]. Malabsorption states such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and prior GI surgeries, as well as prolonged parenteral nutrition without adequate copper, also increase risk, and alcohol use has been implicated in case reports, so I should tailor the differential and testing to these contexts [^115eWZoG] [^1169kit2] [^115aUPfR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis without tying symptoms to labs. I should confirm that low serum copper and low ceruloplasmin support deficiency, while remembering ceruloplasmin is an acute-phase reactant and may be falsely normal or elevated in inflammation, and I should also check zinc, B12, methylmalonic acid, and iron studies to exclude mimics and competing deficiencies; in suspected MDS, copper deficiency must be excluded because it is reversible with supplementation, and marrow features like vacuolated precursors and hematogone hyperplasia can suggest copper deficiency rather than clonal disease [^113FS5NH] [^114yk5NT] [^116VEzqG].

> I should double-check the prognostic implications so counseling is accurate. Hematologic abnormalities typically resolve within weeks of copper repletion, but neurologic deficits often persist or only partially improve, particularly if diagnosis and treatment are delayed, which underscores the need for early recognition and intervention when copper deficiency is suspected [^111huJjz] [^1177zcHJ].

---

Copper deficiency in adults presents with **anemia, neutropenia, and myeloneuropathy** as the core triad [^117Dkbdz], with anemia often macrocytic or normocytic and neutropenia typically out of proportion to anemia [^115aUPfR]. Neurologic features include **sensory ataxia, spastic gait, hyperreflexia, distal sensory loss, and proprioceptive impairment** [^114ky5Hx], mimicking subacute combined degeneration and risking irreversibility if untreated [^111huJjz]. Additional findings may include pancytopenia, osteoporosis, skin/hair changes, and cardiomyopathy [^117Dkbdz] [^112MnYDk]. Early recognition and copper repletion can reverse hematologic abnormalities, but neurologic deficits may persist if therapy is delayed [^111huJjz] [^1177zcHJ].

---

## Hematologic manifestations

- **Anemia**: Typically macrocytic or normocytic, occasionally microcytic; often refractory to iron therapy due to impaired iron utilization [^117Dkbdz] [^115aUPfR].
- **Neutropenia**: Frequently isolated or disproportionate to anemia; a key early clue [^111WFhRq].
- **Thrombocytopenia**: Less common but may occur in severe deficiency [^114BQq5j].
- **Pancytopenia**: In advanced cases, mimicking myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) [^113FS5NH] [^115jehmG].

---

## Neurologic manifestations

- **Myeloneuropathy**: Sensory ataxia, spastic gait, hyperreflexia, distal sensory loss, proprioceptive impairment, and positive Romberg sign; resembles subacute combined degeneration from B12 deficiency [^114ky5Hx] [^1139Lsav].
- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Axonal sensorimotor neuropathy with distal weakness and sensory loss [^113a7jU1].
- **Visual impairment**: Rare optic neuropathy or vision loss has been reported [^115aUPfR].

---

## Musculoskeletal manifestations

Musculoskeletal manifestations include **osteoporosis** with increased fracture risk and bone demineralization [^117Dkbdz], and **muscle weakness** with hypotonia and difficulty walking, particularly after bariatric surgery [^112MnYDk].

---

## Dermatologic and other systemic manifestations

Dermatologic and systemic features include **skin and hair changes** — such as depigmentation, brittle hair, and hair loss — and **cardiomyopathy**, which is rare but reported, especially in malnourished or post-bariatric patients [^117Dkbdz] [^112MnYDk].

---

## Clinical context and risk factors

Copper deficiency is often **iatrogenic or secondary** to:

- **Excess zinc intake**: Supplements, denture creams, or zinc therapy for Wilson disease [^114BQq5j] [^114t24Cs].
- **Gastrointestinal surgery**: Bariatric surgery, gastrectomy, or malabsorption syndromes [^114THq5k] [^115eWZoG].
- **Parenteral nutrition**: Inadequate copper provision [^1169kit2].
- **Alcohol use**: May impair absorption and increase risk [^115aUPfR].

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Serum copper and ceruloplasmin**: Low levels support deficiency; interpret cautiously in inflammation [^117Dkbdz] [^116VEzqG].
- **Complete blood count**: Anemia and neutropenia are common [^111WFhRq].
- **Bone marrow examination**: May show dysplasia, vacuolated precursors, and hematogone hyperplasia, helping distinguish from MDS [^114yk5NT].
- **MRI**: Dorsal column T2 hyperintensity in the cervical/thoracic cord may be seen [^112Xiv1k].

---

## Prognosis and treatment

Hematologic abnormalities typically resolve with copper repletion, whereas **neurologic deficits may persist** if treatment is delayed [^111huJjz] [^1177zcHJ]. Early recognition and copper replacement (oral or IV) are essential to prevent irreversible damage [^114THq5k].

---

Copper deficiency in adults causes a **triad of anemia, neutropenia, and myeloneuropathy**, with additional features such as osteoporosis, skin/hair changes, and cardiomyopathy. Early diagnosis and copper repletion can reverse hematologic disease, but neurologic injury may be permanent if therapy is delayed.

### Relapsing hypocupraemic myelopathy requiring high-dose oral copper replacement [^111czs3D]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Adult-onset copper deficiency with neurological manifestations is a newly recognised syndrome. Long-term oral copper replacement therapy has been the mainstay of treatment in the literature. A case of relapsing hypocupraemic myelopathy responsive to increased doses of copper replacement is reported. Standard doses of copper may not be sufficient for all patients.

Implementation in clinical practice

Monitoring of Cu levels should be routine in patients at risk, and in PN (every 6–12 month) Cu repletion should be based on blood levels (Figure 2). Depletion may develop rapidly (within 2 weeks) as in the case of CRRT or major burns or slowly (months) after bariatric surgery or malabsorption, with deficiency demonstrated by blood levels < 12 µmol/L. Ceruloplasmin should be determined to confirm the diagnosis, and low values confirm deficiency and orient the route and dose of treatment. With Cu values < 8 µmol/L (and low ceruloplasmin), the repletion should be IV (6–8 mg/day for 7–10 days). With moderate deficiency, the oral route can be used with the same doses (as absorption is only approximately 30%–40% of ingested).

Figure 2
Treatment algorithm for copper deficiency or excess: Factors to consider are a depletion mechanism, the acute‐phase response reflected by CRP, and ceruloplasmin. Low ceruloplasmin (< 20 mg/L) orients the therapy: IV or oral repletion dose will be determined by the severity and presence or absence of clinical symptoms. Routine screening refers to home enteral nutrition or parenteral nutrition and bariatric surgery every 6–12 months. CRP, C‐reactive protein; IV, intravenous.

Iron

Main form and function

Iron is the most abundant micronutrient in humans (3–5 g in adults). Its role is linked to hemoproteins, redox equilibrium, inflammatory processes, and innate immune reactions against infections and cancer.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^113AAYBz]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients may also present with deficiencies in B12, folate, and other nutrients such as copper that may cause anemia, macrocytosis, dysplastic features on peripheral smear, and neurologic symptoms. In countries with folate supplementation, deficiencies are rare but should be suspected in those with severe malnourishment including severe alcohol overuse. Adults aged > 60 years are at highest risk for developing pernicious anemia (autoantibodies against intrinsic factor and parietal cells). A B12 level of < 300 pg/mL suggests B12 deficiency but does not necessarily indicate B12-deficient anemia. Elevated levels of serum methylmalonic acid suggest B12 deficiency and warrants a diagnostic trial of B12. Methylmalonic acid assays are not readily available in all laboratories and correction of borderline B12 deficiency does not always lead to hemoglobin improvement. In cases of borderline B12 deficiency (levels 200–300 pg/mL), we recommend a therapeutic trial of B12, considering the low cost and potential benefit of supplementation. Symptoms of B12 deficiency can be reversed with appropriate supplementation. Severe pernicious anemia should be corrected slowly to reduce the risk of sudden death related to shifts in potassium from extracellular fluid into maturing RBCs. Older adults with mild B12 deficiency with normal absorption usually respond to an oral B12 dose of 1000 μg, daily. Patients with impaired absorption often require parenteral B12 indefinitely.

Myelodysplastic syndromes — copper deficiency as a mimic and diagnostic consideration — Copper deficiency can mimic many peripheral blood and marrow findings seen in MDS and is an etiology of anemia, neutropenia, and bone marrow dysplasia that may be under-recognized; there are rare cases with MDS-like presentations in which copper supplementation may resolve hematologic abnormalities. Copper and ceruloplasmin level assessments should be considered as part of the initial diagnostic workup in patients suspected of having low-risk MDS, especially those with gastrointestinal disorders and neuropathy. Clinical features associated with copper deficiency include vacuolation of myeloid and/or erythroid precursors, prior GI surgery, a history of vitamin B12 deficiency, severe malnutrition, and a history of zinc supplementation.

### Copper deficiency [^115dKMeH]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Reports of the neurologic findings in adults with acquired copper deficiency as well as the development of novel models for Menkes disease have permitted a greater understanding of the role of copper in the central nervous system. A role of mitochondrial copper homeostasis in cellular energy metabolism suggests roles for this metal in cellular differentiation and biochemical adaptation.

Recent Findings

Acquired copper deficiency in adults is reported with increasing frequency, often without any identifiable cause. Chemical genetic studies identified a zebrafish model of Menkes disease that can be used for high-throughput therapeutics and revealed a hierarchy of copper distribution during development. Studies in mice reveal that the copper transport protein Ctr1 is essential for intestinal copper absorption and suggest a unique role for copper in axonal extension, excitotoxic cell death and synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system. Lastly, recent biochemical studies indicate a central role for the mitochondrial matrix in cellular copper metabolism.

Summary

The recent developments in our understanding of copper deficiency and copper homeostasis outlined in this review provide an exciting platform for future investigations intended to elucidate the role of copper in central nervous system development and disease.

Myelodysplastic syndromes — copper deficiency mimic and diagnostic workup: Copper deficiency can mimic many peripheral blood and marrow findings seen in MDS and is an etiology of anemia, neutropenia, and bone marrow dysplasia; rare cases resembling MDS may resolve hematologic abnormalities with copper supplementation. Copper and ceruloplasmin level assessments should be considered as part of the initial diagnostic workup in suspected low-risk MDS, especially with gastrointestinal disorders and neuropathy, and clinical features include vacuolation of myeloid and/or erythroid precursors, prior GI surgery, a history of vitamin B12 deficiency, severe malnutrition, and a history of zinc supplementation.

### Copper deficiency may be a leading cause of ischaemic heart disease [^117HVgUa]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Is copper deficiency common?

Plasma copper levels appear to be an inaccurate measure of copper status since ceruloplasmin is an acute-phase reactant that rises in illness and because plasma copper levels differ little between marginally copper-deficient and copper-sufficient subjects. Leucocyte copper may be the best measure of copper status, although this test is not commonly performed.

The RDA for copper is 0.9 mg/day for adults for both men and women. The tolerable upper intake level is much higher, at 10 mg/day for adults. In the 1980s, before a RDA was set, the suggested adequate intake range of copper was 2 to 3 mg/day, but was subsequently lowered when it appeared that few people reach this range without copper supplements. It appears that the decrease in recommended copper intake was largely based on only one study of 11 healthy men. Copper requirements may, however, vary widely depending on health status, pregnancy, age, sex and other factors. Some studies show a minimum requirement at 1.3 mg/d.

### Anemia and neutropenia associated with copper deficiency of unclear etiology [^116zjQVT]. American Journal of Hematology (2006). Low credibility.

Copper deficiency is rarely reported as a cause of neutropenia and anemia through mechanisms not clearly understood. Most cases have been found in malnourished infants or persons receiving total parenteral nutrition without adequate copper. We report on two otherwise healthy young adults with severe neutropenia and anemia secondary to copper deficiency of unclear etiology, which quickly resolved after supplementation with copper gluconate. Both women consumed excessive quantities of soft drinks, which may have contributed to the development of their copper deficiency. Two cases of an unexplained copper deficiency anemia and neutropenia in otherwise healthy young adults found at a single institution over a short period of time suggests that this problem may be more widespread than is currently realized.

### Exogenous copper exposure causing clinical Wilson disease in a patient with copper deficiency [^117XJEQe]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Copper is an essential trace mineral that acts as a cofactor for many enzymatic pathways in the human body. Its homeostasis is extremely delicate. There are two well-known inherited copper metabolic disorders — Menkes and Wilson disease. More recently, Human Swayback has been recognized as an acquired copper deficiency state in humans. Copper deficiency is known to cause myelopathy. In contrast, high copper concentrations can be cytotoxic causing a wide variety of symptoms including abdominal pain, liver failure and neurological disturbances. We present a rare case of Human Swayback disease and subsequent iatrogenic copper overload requiring liver transplantation. The aim of this case report is to provide an overview of copper deficiency, copper overload and its most common symptoms.

### Gastrointestinal symptoms and blood indicators of copper load in apparently healthy adults undergoing controlled copper exposure [^114ScLTw]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Mild and moderate effects of marginally low and marginally high copper exposure are poorly understood in humans.

Objective

The objective was to assess acute gastrointestinal effects and blood markers of copper status in apparently healthy adults who underwent controlled copper exposure for 2 mo.

Design

This was a 2-mo, randomized, controlled, double-blind study of 1365 apparently healthy adults in whom acute gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain) were assessed as responses to copper exposure (< 0.01, 2, 4, or 6 mg/L water). Blood markers were measured in 240 participants at the end of the survey. Subjects with anemia, inflammation, or infection were excluded. Serum and erythrocyte copper, peripheral mononuclear cell copper, serum ceruloplasmin, the nonceruloplasmin bound copper fraction, superoxide dismutase activity, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, serum ferritin, and liver enzyme activities were measured.

Results

The percentage of subjects reporting gastrointestinal symptoms was higher in the 6-mg Cu group than in the < 0.01-mg Cu group (P < 0.02). One hundred ninety-five subjects fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the blood studies. Although a significant relation between copper intake and total gastrointestinal symptoms was observed, no relation was found between copper intake or reported symptoms and copper-load variables.

Conclusions

Gastrointestinal symptoms increased significantly in response to 6 mg Cu/L water. No detectable changes were observed in indicators of copper status, which suggests competent homeostatic regulation. The results of liver function tests remained normal in all subjects. The lack of change in superoxide dismutase activity supports the Food and Nutrition Board's latest recommendation of 0.9 mg Cu/d for adults.

### Insights into the management of Wilson's disease [^114bpFvA]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Wilson's disease is a rare, inherited autosomal recessive disease of copper metabolism, in which the causative gene, ATP7B, results in absent or reduced function of the ATP7B transporter important for biliary excretion of copper and incorporation of copper into caeruloplasmin. Affected patients accumulate excessive copper within the liver, brain and other tissues. A disease mainly of children, adolescents and young adults; clinical features vary from the asymptomatic state to chronic liver disease, acute liver failure, and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and is based on a combination of clinical signs, biochemical tests, hepatic copper content assay and mutation analysis of the ATP7B gene; to date, there are more than 500 mutations of ATP7B in patients with Wilson's disease. Early recognition and treatment can result in an excellent prognosis whereas untreated disease is almost always fatal. Drug therapies include chelating agents, such as penicillamine or trientine, and zinc salts. Liver transplantation is curative correcting the underlying pathophysiology and is traditionally indicated in acute liver failure or end-stage liver disease refractory to medical therapy. This review provides an overview of various aspects of Wilson's disease including molecular basis of the disease, clinical features, diagnostic and management strategies with their current limitations.

### Progressive myeloneuropathy with symptomatic anaemia [^111huJjz]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Background

Copper deficiency is an uncommon nutritional deficiency since copper is needed in small quantities and can be easily obtained from most foods. However, certain conditions that may contribute to this nutritional deficiency have been identified. Malabsorption disorders (celiac disease, Crohn disease or as a result of gastrointestinal or bariatric surgeries), lack of supplementation from prolonged parenteral nutrition, copper chelation and zinc ingestion have all been implicated in causing hypocupremia. Given its rarity and similar presentation to B 12 deficiency, the diagnosis of hypocupremia can often be missed. A thorough history, coupled with appropriate serum analysis, can aid in developing the differential diagnosis of myeloneuropathy with cytopenia. With copper replacement, haematological abnormalities often reverse completely and promptly. However, neurological deficits often persist with residual symptoms. Prompt diagnosis is essential in preserving neurological functioning.

Copper

Pathophysiology and Presentation

Copper deficiency presents with fragile hair, muscle weakness, edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and osteoporosis. Patients may have myelopathy, neuropathy, and ataxia on exam similar to subacute combined degeneration. Laboratory studies can reveal a pancytopenia and bone marrow dysplasia that mimics myelodysplastic disease, making it standard to exclude copper deficiency when evaluating a patients with potential myelodysplastic syndrome. An anemia that is refractory or worsens with iron supplementation can occur as iron can prevent copper absorption.

Risk Factors

Risk factors for acquired copper deficiency include excess zinc intake, chronic malabsorptive states, dialysis, bariatric surgery, bowel resection, and total parenteral nutrition. Excess zinc intake from denture cream adhesive has been implicated in copper deficiency.

Diagnosis and Treatment

Low plasma copper, and ceruloplasmin are indicative of deficiency. Repletion dose is largely based on consensus and depends on the adequacy of absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Most regimens suggest 2mg of elemental copper a day for 1–3 weeks followed by 2mg of elemental copper if on-going deficiency is expected. Cessation of zinc supplementation is important in obtaining a clinical response.

### Parenteral trace element provision: recent clinical research and practical conclusions [^113GmCEX]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this systematic review (PubMed, and Cochrane; last entry 31 December 2014) was to present data from recent clinical studies investigating parenteral trace element provision in adult patients and to draw conclusions for clinical practice. Important physiological functions in human metabolism are known for nine trace elements: selenium, zinc, copper, manganese, chromium, iron, molybdenum, iodine and fluoride. Lack of, or an insufficient supply of, these trace elements in nutrition therapy over a prolonged period is associated with trace element deprivation, which may lead to a deterioration of existing clinical symptoms and/or the development of characteristic malnutrition syndromes. Therefore, all parenteral nutrition prescriptions should include a daily dose of trace elements. To avoid trace element deprivation or imbalances, physiological doses are recommended.

### Motor neuron disease associated with copper deficiency [^111USMUy]. Muscle & Nerve (2006). Low credibility.

Copper deficiency in humans is a rare cause of myeloneuropathy that usually presents with a spastic ataxic gait, hyperreflexia, and distal sensory loss similar to that seen in patients with subacute combined degeneration. We describe three copper-deficient patients, two of whom were referred with a presumptive diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, who had progressive asymmetric weakness or electrodiagnostic findings of proximal and distal denervation suggestive of lower motor neuron disease. Copper replacement resulted in stabilization or mild improvement in weakness. The clinical spectrum of human copper deficiency should include lower motor neuron disease in addition to a syndrome of spastic ataxia.

### Copper deficiency caused by excessive alcohol consumption [^115aUPfR]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first case report clinically, suggesting that excessive alcohol consumption can be a risk factor for copper deficiency.

Copper is an essential element in the body, absorbed from the jejunum to duodenum, and it spreads throughout the body via the liver. It acts as a coenzyme for many enzymes, and in particular, plays an important role in the bone marrow and nerve system. Therefore, copper deficiency can result in blood cell abnormalities such as various types of anaemia (microcytic, normocytic, macrocytic anemia) and leucopenia, and neurologic symptoms such as neuropathy, myelopathy, and vision loss. In particular, it is important to differentiate this from vitamin B12 deficiency because the phenotypes are similar. Copper supplementation recovers blood cell abnormalities favourably. For neurological symptoms, however, the recovery is partial, and it is thought that neurological symptoms will become irreversible if treatment is delayed. Therefore, it is important to diagnose copper deficiency and start treatment early.

### Copper in parenteral nutrition [^1169kit2]. Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Copper is an essential nutrient for humans. Copper is a component of numerous enzymes that affect a wide variety of metabolic processes. Copper deficiency can result in anemia, neutropenia, skeletal abnormalities, and other clinical manifestations. There is no well-established laboratory measurement of body copper status. Copper supplementation is essential in parenteral nutrition to prevent an adverse effect of deficiency. Balance studies indicate that copper requirements in total parenteral nutrition amount to 0.3 mg/day in the adult. For children and infants, the estimated requirement is 20 microg/kg body wt/day. These amounts may have to be decreased in patients with cholestasis.

### Parenteral trace element provision: recent clinical research and practical conclusions [^115KLnDP]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this systematic review (PubMed, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed and Cochrane, www.cochrane.org; last entry 31 December 2014) was to present data from recent clinical studies investigating parenteral trace element provision in adult patients and to draw conclusions for clinical practice. Important physiological functions in human metabolism are known for nine trace elements: selenium, zinc, copper, manganese, chromium, iron, molybdenum, iodine and fluoride. Lack of, or an insufficient supply of, these trace elements in nutrition therapy over a prolonged period is associated with trace element deprivation, which may lead to a deterioration of existing clinical symptoms and/or the development of characteristic malnutrition syndromes.

### Copper deficiency caused by excessive alcohol consumption [^113g2hpd]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Copper deficiency is a disease that causes blood cell abnormalities such as anaemia and leucopaenia, and neurological symptoms such as neuropathy, myelopathy and vision loss. It needs to be differentiated from vitamin B 12 deficiency. Although the precise frequency is unknown, primary copper deficiency is relatively rare because copper is universally included in the diet. Therefore, it should be suspected when the patient has a known risk factor. Current known risk factors include special nutritional conditions such as long-term tube feedingand long-term total parenteral nutrition, gastrointestinal problems such as postgastrectomyand postobesity surgeryand other conditions, such as ingestion of zinc. There are also several copper deficiency case reports of unknown causes, which suggests that there are other risk factors. Currently in the literature, there are no case reports of alcohol abuse as a risk for copper deficiency. We experienced a case of copper deficiency due to alcohol abuse without other known risk factors.

### Copper deficiency associated with severe neurological disorder – a genetic work-up of possible mutations in copper transport proteins [^113JaA61]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Copper deficiency has been described as resulting in severe neurological impairment. However, mechanisms underlying a copper deficiency are presently unknown.

Patients and Methods

We describe three patients suffering from severe spasticity, ataxia and hyperreflexia and had laboratory evidence of copper deficiency.

Results

Genetic analysis of six copper transporters/chaperones revealed no mutations, but two SNPs in one copper transporter protein and one copper chaperone.

Conclusions

Owing to the severity of the disease further research is required to elucidate the mechanisms leading to copper deficiency.

### Hypocupremia and bone marrow failure [^115jehmG]. Haematologica (2008). Low credibility.

Copper deficiency associated with neurological disorders is a well-documented condition. However, hypocupremia is less often recognized as a cause of cytopenias or bone marrow failure. We report an illustrative series of three new cases of bi-lineage cytopenia associated with copper deficiency. We have analyzed clinical features of current and historical cases to identify clues that could facilitate application of appropriate laboratory testing and heighten the level of clinical suspicion. By maintaining an appropriately high level of suspicion for potential copper deficiency and obtaining a serum copper level, bone marrow failure due to this condition can be correctly diagnosed and treated. We suggest that copper deficiency be included in the differential diagnosis of reversible causes of bone marrow failure syndromes including myelodysplastic syndrome.

### Copper deficiency myeloneuropathy and pancytopenia secondary to overuse of zinc supplementation [^115w4ZSV]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

The haematological complications of acquired copper deficiency have been well documented, but the neurological complications have only recently been reported. An illustrative case of copper deficiency myeloneuropathy with pancytopenia is presented and the potential aetiologies and neurological manifestations of this deficiency state discussed.

### Copper deficiency and excess in infancy: developing a research agenda [^112c7NXa]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Copper deficiency and excess have been recognized as potential health problems for infants and children worldwide. Clinical manifestations of copper deficiency and excess are well characterized but the precise sequence by which high copper intake interacts with genetic control systems, leading to liver damage in infants, is unknown. The possibility that genetic mutations or epigenetic factors related to the functional development of copper homeostasis, could make otherwise normal infants on normal copper intake more susceptible to copper toxicity has been an issue of concern. In January 2001 a group of pediatricians and researchers interested in this area met at Tegernsee, Bavaria, Germany, to reviewing the state of knowledge on the topic. They addressed six main issues: 1) The relevance of copper deficit and excess as health problems. 2) The appropriate biomarkers to identify and characterize copper status 3) The genetic variability in copper metabolism 4) The mechanisms of whole body copper homeostasis in early life and their changes with age 5) The development of experimental and animal models to address research questions on copper homeostasis in infants. 6) The safe upper and lower limits of copper intake/exposure from water and food. We present here the highlights of the discussions and the main conclusions of the meeting.

### The risk of copper deficiency in patients prescribed zinc supplements [^113eHPs1]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

In high doses zinc may cause copper deficiency, a diagnosis that is often missed resulting in anaemia, neutropenia and irreversible neurological symptoms. The aim of this study was to assess if zinc deficiency is erroneously diagnosed by misinterpretation of plasma zinc concentrations and whether copper deficiency is induced in patients prescribed zinc.

Methods

Casenotes of 70 patients prescribed zinc were scrutinised. Plasma concentrations of zinc, copper, C reactive protein and albumin were recorded from the laboratory database.

Results

62% of patients were prescribed zinc at doses sufficient to cause copper deficiency. In 48% of the patients, plasma zinc concentrations were low as a probable result of hypoalbuminaemia or the systemic inflammatory response rather than deficiency. Awareness of copper deficiency was lacking; it was only documented as a possible side effect in one patient and plasma copper was measured in only two patients prescribed zinc. 9% of patients developed unexplained anaemia and 7% developed neurological symptoms typical of copper deficiency.

Conclusions

Zinc deficiency is frequently misdiagnosed on the basis of low plasma zinc concentrations. The potential risk of copper deficiency developing in patients prescribed high doses of zinc is apparently infrequently considered. It is probable that a significant minority of patients prescribed with high doses of zinc develop iatrogenic copper deficiency.

Copper deficiency — clinical features and bariatric surgery considerations: Copper is a trace element absorbed from the small intestine, and copper deficiency (which may accompany iron deficiency) may clinically manifest in the form of anemia, an altered immune system, neuropathies, difficulty walking, hypotonia, and cardiomyopathy. Copper deficiency can occur after gastric sleeve and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and especially commonly after BPD-DS, can be mitigated with appropriate nutrition and a high-quality bariatric multivitamin/mineral/trace element supplement, and post-operative copper levels are usually monitored only if signs and symptoms of deficiency are present. Deficiencies of trace elements and minerals are often dependent on the type of bariatric procedure and the degree of postoperative replacement.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Wilson's disease, more specifically with respect to serum ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion, AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that basal 24-hour urinary excretion of copper in WD is typically > 100 mcg/24 hours in symptomatic patients, but a lower reference value of > 40 mcg/24 hours may indicate WD in asymptomatic patients or pediatric patients, and therefore requires clinical correlation and further investigation.

### Wilson's disease and other neurological copper disorders [^1147L3JA]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

The copper metabolism disorder Wilson's disease was first defined in 1912. Wilson's disease can present with hepatic and neurological deficits, including dystonia and parkinsonism. Early-onset presentations in infancy and late-onset manifestations in adults older than 70 years of age are now well recognised. Direct genetic testing for ATP7B mutations are increasingly available to confirm the clinical diagnosis of Wilson's disease, and results from biochemical and genetic prevalence studies suggest that Wilson's disease might be much more common than previously estimated. Early diagnosis of Wilson's disease is crucial to ensure that patients can be started on adequate treatment, but uncertainty remains about the best possible choice of medication. Furthermore, Wilson's disease needs to be differentiated from other conditions that also present clinically with hepatolenticular degeneration or share biochemical abnormalities with Wilson's disease, such as reduced serum ceruloplasmin concentrations. Disordered copper metabolism is also associated with other neurological conditions, including a subtype of axonal neuropathy due to ATP7A mutations and the late-onset neurodegenerative disorders Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

### Exogenous copper exposure causing clinical Wilson disease in a patient with copper deficiency [^116c7RbJ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

In contrast, copper overload is rare. Copper overload The daily copper recommended dietary allowance (RDA) is 900 mcg in adults. It is believed that copper injury is secondary to the interaction between the reduced form of copper and oxygen, leading to toxic oxygen species (TOS) production like superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals which have a potential of being extremely toxic to the cells and tissue. Acute copper intoxication (1,000 — 10,000 mg) may manifest with metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, heart failure, hepatic failure, renal failure, intravascular hemolysis and ultimately death. Chronic ingestion of copper above RDA can also lead to multi systemic involvement including neurological, ophthalmic, psychiatric, gastrointestinal manifestations as well as hemolytic anemia. In particular, the liver may develop acute apoptosis and necrosis due to high TOS concentrations and low glutathione, which impairs the hepatocyte reducing capacity. Chronically, copper overload will cause progressive liver injury which may progress to cirrhosis. Our patient presented with abdominal pain, hemolytic anemia, psychiatric symptoms, hepatic and renal failure all likely due to the copper overload. At the time of presentation effective medical options were limited. Therapy is based on cessation of copper intake, supportive management, low-copper diet and copper chelating agents such as D-penicillamine and trientine in patients with genetic Wilson disease. Zinc may be utilized as it interferes with the absorption of copper by induction of metallothionein in the enterocytes and the liver. Metallothionein has a high affinity for copper, inducing luminal copper binding, preventing its absorption. The copper is then excreted through feces. Patients should avoid food with high copper concentration like chocolate, organ meats, nuts, shellfish and well water. Our patient already had cirrhosis with decompensated liver disease making chelation therapy of limited benefit, though we used zinc to try to prevent further copper absorption and transplant was the ultimate effective treatment.

We present a rare case of human Swayback disease with long-term supratherapeutic copper supplementation, ultimately requiring liver transplantation due to decompensated cirrhosis. This case report highlights the diverse symptomatology of copper derangements. Abdominal pain is a common symptom seen in Copper overload — our patient had complete resolution of his pain after liver transplantation. Copper disorders are rare and worth awareness as its complications are preventable. Prompt diagnosis, treatment and close monitoring of copper levels and supplementation are imperative.

### Micronutrient deficiencies in inflammatory bowel disease: an incidence analysis [^117YNx1t]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Micronutrient deficiencies associated with malnutrition in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can lead to complications including anemia, coagulopathy, poor wound healing, and colorectal cancer. This study aimed to investigate micronutrient deficiencies (copper, vitamins A, B 9, E, and K) in IBD patients and highlight associated symptoms to aid in the recognition of micronutrient deficiencies.

Methods

A retrospective electronic chart review was performed on adults diagnosed with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis hospitalized at a tertiary care center for IBD flare between January 2013 and June 2017. Patients with serum or whole blood micronutrient levels were included. Pregnant and incarcerated patients were excluded.

Results

A total of 611 IBD patients (440 Crohn's disease, 171 ulcerative colitis) met the inclusion criteria. Micronutrients were assessed in a subset of IBD patients (copper: 12.3%, A: 10.1%, B 9 :95.9%, E: 10.3%, and K: 4.6%). Overall, 10.1% of patients had micronutrient deficiencies. The proportion of patients with copper, A, B 9, E, and K deficiencies were 25.4, 53.3, 1.9, 23.7, and 29.4% for Crohn's disease and 50, 52.9, 1.2, 43.8, and 18.2% for ulcerative colitis, respectively. The most common symptoms or historical features associated with micronutrient deficiency were anemia (copper, B 9), muscle weakness (copper, E) thrombocytopenia, fatigue (copper, B 9), diarrhea (B 9), dry skin, hyperkeratosis, pruritus, significant weight loss, elevated C-reactive protein (A), bleeding, and osteoporosis (K).

Conclusion

Micronutrient deficiencies are common in IBD patients, yet they are not routinely assessed. Copper, vitamins A, E, and K deficiencies are particularly underrecognized. Associated historical features should raise suspicion and prompt assessment and treatment.

### Copper deficiency myelopathy produces a clinical picture like subacute combined degeneration [^1139Lsav]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Copper deficiency in ruminants is known to cause an ataxic myelopathy. Copper deficiency as a cause of progressive myelopathy in adults is underrecognized.

Objective

To describe the clinical, biochemical, electrophysiologic, and imaging characteristics in 13 patients with myelopathy associated with copper deficiency.

Methods

The records of patients with a copper deficiency-associated myelopathy were reviewed. Clinical characteristics, laboratory investigations, and responses to therapeutic intervention were summarized.

Results

Thirteen such patients were found, 11 of them in a 15-month period. All patients presented with prominent gait difficulty, reflecting a sensory ataxia due to dorsal column dysfunction and lower limb spasticity. All patients had polyneuropathy. A high or high-normal serum zinc level was seen in 7 of the 11 patients for whom this information was available. Somatosensory evoked potential studies done in eight patients showed impaired conduction in central proprioceptive pathways. Dorsal column signal change on spine MRI was present in three patients. An initial clue to the diagnosis was a very low ceruloplasmin level; further tests of copper metabolism excluded Wilson disease. The cause remained unexplained in most patients. Oral copper supplementation restored normal or near-normal copper levels in 7 of the 12 patients in whom adequate follow-up data were available; parenteral supplementation restored normal level in 3 further patients. Copper supplementation prevented further neurologic deterioration, but the degree of actual improvement was variable.

Conclusions

Unrecognized copper deficiency appears to be a common cause of idiopathic myelopathy in adults. The clinical picture bears striking similarities to the syndrome of subacute combined degeneration associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. Early recognition and copper supplementation may prevent neurologic deterioration.

### EASL-ERN clinical practice guidelines on Wilson's disease [^114riHm4]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism which affects the liver, brain and other organs. Diagnosis is based on: clinical features; biochemical tests, including plasma ceruloplasmin concentration, 24-h urinary copper excretion, copper content in the liver; and molecular analysis. Leipzig score and additionally relative exchangeable copper determination are recommended for diagnosis. Pharmacological therapy comprises chelating agents (penicillamine, trientine) and zinc salts, while only chelators are recommended for significant liver disease. Monitoring is based on clinical symptoms, liver tests and copper metabolism (urinary copper excretion, exchangeable copper) to detect poor compliance and over/under-treatment. Acute liver failure is challenging as making a diagnosis is difficult and pharmacological therapy may not be sufficient to save life. Liver transplantation has a well-defined role in Wilsonian acute hepatic failure but may also be considered in neurological disease.

### The exposome and liver disease-how environmental factors affect liver health [^111F9b1r]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Dysregulation of copper homeostasis and Wilson disease

Dysregulation of copper homeostasis and Wilson disease is another relevant example of genome-exposome interactions. Copper is an essential metal required for the function of many metalloproteins that serve numerous metabolic needs of liver cells, including building of nascent ceruloplasmin, which carries more than 95% of the total copper in plasma. Copper compounds are also active plant protection products, and it is likely that certain populations are exposed to high levels of copper. As excess hepatic copper is excreted via the biliary pathway into faeces, cholestasis is responsible for both hepatic retention and increased circulating levels of copper. The prototype clinical syndrome caused by excessive retention of copper is Wilson disease, a familial, neurological lethal disease accompanied by cirrhosis, which results from inactivation of the gene encoding a metal-transporting P-type ATPase, ATP7B, found mainly in hepatocytes. When exceeding storage capacity, copper deposits in various organs, especially the brain, kidneys and cornea. The disease may present with a broad spectrum of liver disease that ranges from asymptomatic to cirrhosis and acute liver failure. In teenagers, liver disease usually precedes neurologic manifestations by years, while most adult patients with neurologic symptoms have some degree of liver disease at presentation. Notably, acute liver failure occurs mostly among women. In the US it accounts for up to 12% of all listings for acute liver failure and is almost invariably fatal if not treated with emergency transplantation. Severe liver injury may cause the sudden release of copper into the blood and cause acute intravascular haemolysis with anaemia, haemoglobinuria, jaundice and progression to renal failure. Wilson disease should be differentiated from aceruloplasminemia, MDR3 (multidrug resistance protein 3) deficiency, and certain congenital disorders of glycosylation through genetic, laboratory and clinical investigations.

### Exogenous copper exposure causing clinical Wilson disease in a patient with copper deficiency [^116VEzqG]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Copper deficiency or Human Swayback is a rare condition recently recognized in humans. This disease was originally described in ruminants as a cause of ataxic myelopathy. Some of the main causes of acquired copper deficiency in humans include hereditary disorders like Menkes disease, excessive zinc ingestion, large body surface burns, malabsorptive disorders, gastric surgery, chronic denture cream use, prolonged total parenteral nutrition and idiopathic.

The most common manifestations are anemia, leukopenia and myelopathy. Myelopathy may present with spastic gait, hyperreflexia, sensory ataxia, impaired vibratory proprioception, lower extremity paresthesias and foot drop. The differential diagnosis of the myelopathy is broad, including vitamin B12 deficiency, nitrous oxide abuse, tabes dorsalis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Friedreich ataxia and intradural extramedullary tumors.

Diagnostic evaluation includes measurement of serum copper, ceruloplasmin, vitamin B12, iron studies, vitamin D, vitamin E, zinc, homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels. As an acute phase reactant, ceruloplasmin may be falsely elevated in underlying inflammatory conditions like liver disease, malignancy, pregnancy, infections and diabetes. Spinal cord imaging may be needed as well. A 24-h urine copper has a low sensitivity.

Treatment regimens have not been well established and some case reports suggest an initial dose of 8 mg per day tapered over a month followed by 2 mg of elemental copper per day. The daily recommended copper dose in adults is 1 to 3 mg per day. Its duration should be determined by periodic serum copper evaluation. In some circumstances, parenteral copper may be necessary. Unfortunately, despite therapy, patients may have residual neurological deficit. Hematological derangements tend to resolve completely after therapy.

Copper is a trace mineral essential to hematopoiesis and to the structure and function of the nervous system. Copper deficiency is a rare cause of anemia, leukopenia, and myeloneuropathy, but should be considered in the differential diagnosis in a patient with prior gastrointestinal surgery.

### Imaging features of copper deficiency myelopathy: a study of 25 cases [^112Xiv1k]. Neuroradiology (2006). Low credibility.

Acquired copper deficiency presents with a spastic gait and sensory ataxia. Spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with copper deficiency myelopathy may show increased T2 signal, most commonly in the dorsal midline cervical and thoracic cord. These imaging findings may be reversible with normalization of serum copper. The clinical and imaging picture is very similar to the subacute combined degeneration seen in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency. Neuroradiologists should consider this possibility when a long segment of symmetric dorsal spinal cord T2-hyperintensity is identified.

### Wilson's disease in an adult asymptomatic patient: a potential role for modifying factors of copper metabolism [^1126m2zh]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of Wilson's disease (WD) still remains a challenge since no single test has an accuracy of 100%. Molecular testing for ATP7B gene mutations can help reach the diagnosis when routine testing is equivocal. We herein report an asymptomatic WD patient diagnosed accidentally by genetic analysis. Th is case suggests that WD is a challenge even in particular contexts such as family screening. Genetic testing of ATP7B gene should be recommended in the family members of WD patients with minimal alterations of specific tests such as ceruloplasmin, and presence of steatosis or increased body mass index.

Wilson disease (WD) dietary background — general principles: The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for copper for healthy adults is 0.9 mg/day, and the median copper intake from foods in the United States is 1–1.6 mg/day; WD cannot be treated exclusively by dietary measures. For patients with WD, a few foods with very high concentrations of copper (nuts, chocolate, most shellfish, soy-based products, mushrooms, organ meats) should be avoided, at least in the first year of treatment, and health foods and supplements should be scrutinized for copper content.

### Wilson's disease in an adult asymptomatic patient: a potential role for modifying factors of copper metabolism [^115Husvu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

In conclusion, this case adds more information about the natural history of WD and suggests that WD is a challenge even in particular contexts such as family screening. This is particularly true in asymptomatic patients including the pediatric age group and in adults with asymptomatic increase in liver tests. In these patients, the presence of normal values of some of the copper metabolism tests decreases the accuracy of the Leipzig score. Thus, the use of genetic testing becomes imperative in the diagnosis of WD. Genetic testing of the entire ATP7B gene should be conducted in cases of relatives of WD patients with minimal alterations of copper metabolism in tests such as ceruloplasmin and signs such as steatosis, even in overweight patients.

### Wilson disease and psychiatric symptoms: a brief case report [^116K9KAw]. General Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Wilson disease (WD) is an uncommon recessive genetic disorder affecting copper metabolism. Cardiac, neurological, hepatic and renal manifestations are well defined, nevertheless approximately 30% of patients debut with neuropsychiatric symptoms. These psychiatric alterations resulting from the accumulation of this heavy metal in the basal ganglia are some how less specific. We present a short review of psychiatric symptoms of WD and describe a case of a 37-year-old woman diagnosed with WD who presented neuropsychiatric symptoms and had a consequent delay in diagnosis and causal treatment. Patients who develop WD starting with a predominance of neuropsychiatric symptoms tend to manifest hepatic symptoms later, therefore have a longer delay of diagnosis and a poorer outcome than patients with hepatic symptoms. An early diagnosis of WD can avoid irreversible neurological damage.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^114AkHwB]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Wilson disease — treatment targets and copper monitoring during chelation are defined by urinary copper metrics: Adequacy of treatment is judged by clinical and biochemical improvement and subsequent stability and by measuring 24 h urinary copper excretion on treatment. Urinary copper excretion upon initiation of treatment is often > 1000 µg/24 h and decreases over time on treatment to approximately 3–10 times the upper limit of normal for urinary copper excretion (typically approximately 150–500 µg/24 h). Generally, with nonadherence to therapy over time, urinary copper rises. Values of urinary copper excretion < 100 µg/24 h may indicate some degree of copper deficiency due to overtreatment, in which case serum copper is expected to be lower than pretreatment values, reversible sideroblastic anemia and neutropenia may be present, and overtreatment can result in hepatic iron overload. In contrast, when urinary copper excretion accompanies nonadherence, serum copper increases, reflecting increased NCC.

### Wilson disease [^116sZv7A]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Wilson's disease:

- **Definition**: WD is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired copper metabolism.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of WD involves impaired copper homeostasis due to ATP7B mutations, leading to copper overload in the liver, brain, and other organs. This copper accumulation results in cellular damage and apoptosis, leading to the clinical manifestations of the disease.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of WD worldwide is estimated at 3.3 per 100,000 population.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for WD include having two copies of a mutated ATP7B gene, indicating an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.
- **Disease course**: WD manifests through a broad spectrum of hepatic and extrahepatic symptoms, reflecting systemic copper deposition. The hepatic presentation can range from asymptomatic elevations in liver enzymes to progressive liver dysfunction, encompassing hepatomegaly, jaundice, and in more advanced cases, cirrhosis. Neurological involvement includes tremors, dystonia, dysarthria, and other extrapyramidal signs, arising from copper accumulation in the basal ganglia. Kayser-Fleischer rings, which appear as a brownish-green discoloration around the corneal limbus, differing from the white-yellow rings of arcus senilis or hyperlipidemia due to lipid deposition, are a classic ophthalmologic sign in WD, although not specific, as they can be seen in chronic cholestatic conditions.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of WD is generally good with early diagnosis and treatment. However, if left untreated, the disease can lead to severe disability and death.

### How to use tests for disorders of copper metabolism [^114rk7gd]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2017). Low credibility.

In paediatrics, one of our main aims in the diagnostic process is to identify any treatable conditions. The copper metabolism disorder Wilson's disease (WD) is one such condition that is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. Delay in treatment could result in irreversible disability or even death. Although liver disease is the most common presenting feature in children, some children may initially present with a subtle neurological presentation only. In patients presenting with dystonia, tremor, dysarthria or with a deterioration in school performance, there should be a high index of suspicion for WD. However, the differential of these clinical presentations is wide and exclusion of WD is difficult. No single diagnostic test can exclude WD and each of the biochemical tests has limitations. In this article, we discuss copper metabolism disorders including WD and Menke's disease. We then discuss the available diagnostic tests and how to investigate children for these rare disorders.

Urinary copper excretion and D-penicillamine challenge test — basal 24-hour urinary copper has overlap with other liver diseases, and in children 40 μg/24 h is cited as the best cutoff; cholestatic and autoimmune hepatitis conditions may show 100–200 μg/24 h (1.6–3.2 μmol/24 h), nonselective proteinuria can raise levels to > 100 μg/24 h without elevated NCC, and some ATP7B heterozygotes range 50–120 μg/24 h. A D-penicillamine challenge may be adjunctive and, when > 1600 μg copper/24 h (> 25 μmol/24 h) is excreted, can differentiate from other disorders; however, the predictive value of the 25 μmol/24-h cutoff is < 100%, sensitivity is insufficient in asymptomatic patients, and adult protocols are unknown and not validated. Basal 24-h urinary copper is used to screen first-degree relatives but should not be the sole screening test for asymptomatic individuals.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Copper is an essential nutrient which serves as a cofactor for serum ceruloplasmin, an oxidase necessary for proper formation of the iron carrier protein, transferrin. Copper also helps maintain normal rates of red and white blood cell formation.

Providing copper during TPN helps prevent development of the following deficiency symptoms: Leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, depressed ceruloplasmin levels, impaired transferrin formation, secondary iron deficiency and osteoporosis.

Normal serum copper values range from 80 to 163 mcg/dl (mean, approximately 110 mcg/dl). The serum copper level at which deficiency symptoms appear is not precisely defined.

In the plasma, about 7% of copper is bound to albumin and amino acids. In the liver, about 93% of copper is bound to ceruloplasmin and released to the serum. The daily turnover of copper through ceruloplasmin is approximately 0.5 mg. Copper is primarily excreted through the bile and into the gastrointestinal tract where it is not reabsorbed. Copper is also eliminated through the kidneys.

### Estimating risk from copper excess in human populations [^111aRtG5]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Risk assessment for nutrients assumes a single population with a normal distribution of indexes of requirements and excess. Toxic levels are by definition intakes above the upper level; for copper, however, because we lack noninvasive, sensitive biomarkers of storage or early damage from excess, excess is based on the infrequent occurrence of clinical disease, such as unexplained liver cirrhosis. We examine the limitations of this approach for copper given the very low prevalence of clinical and subclinical disease and suggest that the population risk for copper excess be based on hepatic copper loading as a potentially quantifiable measurement. The challenge ahead is to develop biomarkers that predict the population risk of elevated hepatic copper stores and thus the possibility of disease in a population.

Patients We describe 3 patients who developed a progressive spastic-ataxic gait with proprioceptive deficits. All patients had a severe reduction in serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels. Results All patients had evidence of posterior column dysfunction clinically and on somatosensory evoked potential studies. Two had a signal change in the posterior column on magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord. His neurological examination results revealed lower limb spasticity, generalized hyperreflexia, ankle clonus, and extensor plantar responses. There was decreased perception of touch, pinprick, and position over the toes and fingers; his vibratory sense was reduced at the knees and distally. He required assistance to ambulate. Nerve conduction studies showed a mild sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy. Tibial and median somatosensory evoked potentials were markedly abnormal, with evidence of impaired conduction in central proprioceptive pathways.

Spine magnetic resonance imaging showed an increased T2 signal in the dorsal aspect of the cord from vertebrae C2 to C7 and in the lower thoracic cord. The results of her physical examination were remarkable for mild weakness of the hand muscles, hyperreflexia, ankle clonus, and extensor plantar responses. Pinprick and touch sensation were reduced in the feet. Joint position sense at the toes was severely impaired, and there was graded decreased perception of vibration in the lower limbs. She had a spastic-ataxic gait and a positive Romberg sign. The results of a neurological examination revealed mild distal lower limb weakness, generalized hyperreflexia except for depressed ankle jerks, absent vibratory sense to the level of the anterior superior iliac spine, decreased proprioception at the ankles and toes, an ataxic gait, and a positive Romberg sign. Superficial pain sensation was preserved. The results of brain and spine MRI were normal.

Nerve conduction studies showed evidence of a mild sensory neuropathy. Tibial and median somatosensory evoked potential studies demonstrated significant slowing in central pathways with preserved peripheral latencies.

### Myeloneuropathy and anemia due to copper malabsorption [^1138eRB2]. Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Dietary deficiency of copper results in a progressive ataxic myelopathy in ruminants called swayback. Menkes disease is a human disease due to an inherited defect in copper absorption; survival into adulthood is typically not known to occur. We report a 63-year-old woman who was evaluated by us for a myeloneuropathy that occurred in the setting of copper malabsorption. Her neurological deterioration stopped with copper supplementation. The limited literature on neurological manifestations of acquired copper deficiency suggests that the clinical presentation resembles the myeloneuropathy seen with vitamin B12 deficiency.

Wilson disease (WD) — pathophysiology and epidemiology — is defined by impaired ATP7B-mediated copper handling in hepatocytes where absent or impaired function decreases biliary excretion causing toxic hepatic copper accumulation and, when storage is exceeded, copper deposits in extrahepatic organs including the brain, kidneys, and cornea; loss of ATP7B also diminishes incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin leading to low circulating ceruloplasmin. Dietary context notes that the average diet contains 2–5 mg/day of copper and the recommended intake is 0.9 mg/day. WD occurs worldwide with prevalence estimated at approximately 30 per million population.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Potential for Worsening of Clinical Symptoms at Initiation of Therapy: May include neurological deterioration. Adjust dosage or discontinue CUVRIOR if clinical condition worsens. (5.1)
Copper Deficiency: Periodic monitoring is required. (5.2)
Iron Deficiency: If iron deficiency develops, a short course of iron supplementation may be given. (5.3, 7.1)
Hypersensitivity Reactions: If rash or other hypersensitivity reaction occurs, consider discontinuing CUVRIOR. (5.4)

5.1 Potential for Worsening of Clinical Symptoms at Initiation of Therapy

Worsening of clinical symptoms, including neurological deterioration, may occur at the beginning of CUVRIOR therapy due to mobilization of excess stores of copper. Adjust the dosage or discontinue CUVRIOR if the patient's clinical condition worsens.

Evaluate serum non-ceruloplasmin copper (NCC) levels when initiating CUVRIOR treatment, after 3 months of treatment and approximately every 6 months thereafter. Therapy may also be monitored periodically (every 6 to 12 months) with measurement of 24-hour urinary copper excretion (UCE) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.2 Copper Deficiency

Copper deficiency may develop following treatment with CUVRIOR. Close monitoring for manifestations of copper deficiency is required particularly when copper requirements may change, such as in pregnancy, where appropriate control of copper levels are required to ensure proper growth and mental development [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.3 Iron Deficiency

Iron deficiency may develop following treatment with CUVRIOR, especially in menstruating or pregnant women, or as a result of the low copper diet recommended for Wilson's disease. If necessary, iron may be given in short courses, but at least two hours should elapse between administration of CUVRIOR and iron [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions, characterized by rash, have been reported with the use of trientine. In Trial 1, rash was reported in 12% (3/26) of CUVRIOR-treated patients, and one of these patients discontinued CUVRIOR because of the rash [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. If a patient develops a rash or other hypersensitivity reaction during treatment with CUVRIOR, assess clinically and consider discontinuing CUVRIOR [see Contraindications (4)].

### First case report of acquired copper deficiency following revisional single anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S) leading to severe pancytopenia with refractory anemia [^116fbdoW]. Obesity Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although rare, the current case emphasizes that the bariatric team should be aware that after bariatric procedures such as SADI-S, micronutrient deficiencies could be encountered. In order to avoid complications, early diagnosis, and prompt treatment of copper and other micronutrient deficiencies are critical. Mild neurological symptoms among post-bariatric surgery patients should alert the bariatric team to possible micronutrient/copper deficiency. Findings of anemia, pancytopenia, and cellular atypia warrant extensive assessment and replacement of micronutrients.

### Case of sensory ataxic ganglionopathy-myelopathy in copper deficiency [^1155tvLd]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

Spinal cord involvement associated with severe copper deficiency has been reported in the last 8 years. Copper deficiency may produce an ataxic myelopathy. Clinical and neuroimaging findings are similar to the subacute combined degeneration seen in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency. Macrocytic, normocytic and microcytic anemia, leukopenia and, in severe cases, pancytopenia are well known hematologic manifestations. The most patients with copper deficiency myelopathy had unrecognized carency. Some authors suggested that early recognition and copper supplementation may prevent neurologic deterioration but clinical findings do not improve. We present a patient with copper deficiency, dorsal root ganglions and cervical dorsal columns involvement. Clinical status and neuroimaging improved after copper replacement therapy. Sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia may be the most sensitive nervous pathway. In this case the early copper treatment allowed to improve neurologic lesions and to prevent further involvements.

Discussion

Perturbations to copper and copper-related processes have been broadly implicated in pathological features and symptoms related to MS. Insufficient copper availability in humans is documented in the form of copper deficiency myelopathy, a disorder which manifests as neurological symptoms associated with demyelination, white matter lesions, and axonopathy in the CNS. Without treatment, patients with copper deficiency myelopathy suffer from a progressive worsening of symptoms and pathology with similarities to MS. These MS-like symptoms and pathological features are remedied in copper deficiency myelopathy through copper supplementation and modification of risk factors which primarily relate to impairment of copper absorption in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Congruent with this, hypomyelination in copper-deficient rats is remedied by dietary copper replacement. More recently, histological assessment of SLC31A1, ATP7A, and ATP7B in post-mortem human tissue has indicated that copper-related abnormalities are present in MS-affected white matter, with lesions appearing more affected than normal appearing white matter. The relevance of copper to MS pathology is further illustrated by administration of the copper chelator cuprizone to rodents to model key features of the disease, including demyelination in the CNS. Although some reports suggest formation of a toxic cuprizone-copper complex as driving demyelination in the cuprizone model rather than copper depletion per se, studies that measured copper report decreased copper levels in affected brain regions of cuprizone treated animals. But despite these lines of evidence indicating a role for copper in MS and MS-related pathologies, the relationship between copper and MS remains insufficiently examined and understood. Not least of which, reports describing direct assessment of copper in human, MS-affected CNS tissue do not exist, and the therapeutic potential of targeting copper perturbations in MS has been largely unexplored. In this study, we show that human MS cases display broad changes to copper-related factors spanning levels and anatomical distribution, gene expression, and downstream functional consequences. We also provide evidence that features of these copper perturbations are recapitulated in the EAE model and may represent potential targets of interest for human MS.

Acute liver failure due to Wilson disease (WD) — Urgency and key diagnostic clues include that expeditious diagnosis is critically important because these patients require urgent evaluation for liver transplantation, and in both adults and children, ALF due to WD carries a high mortality (80%-90%) without liver transplantation; Kayser–Fleischer rings, if present, support the diagnosis but are absent in 50%; in most patients serum AST is higher than serum ALT though not diagnostic; serum ceruloplasmin is usually decreased with poor predictive value; serum copper and 24-h urinary excretion of copper are greatly elevated, and the serum copper is usually > 200 μg/dL, although these copper results are often not available in a timely manner and diagnosis relies on clinical and biochemical features.

### Exogenous copper exposure causing clinical Wilson disease in a patient with copper deficiency [^113nkDWG]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Human Swayback is a disease characterized by acquired copper deficiency which primarily manifests as myeloneuropathy. Common causes include malabsorptive disorders, gastric surgery, total parenteral nutrition and excessive zinc intake. In contrast, copper supplementation should be closely monitored as excessive doses can lead to acute intoxication and in chronic cases, cirrhosis. Copper derangements are rare, however it is important to consider them due to potential severe complications.

Case presentation

We present a middle-aged man who had been previously diagnosed with Human Swayback after presenting with various neurological symptoms. The patient was subsequently placed on copper supplementation. A decade later, he was referred to our hospital for liver transplant evaluation due to new diagnosis of decompensated end-stage liver disease after an abdominal surgery. His initial workup was suggestive of Wilson disease — subsequent ATP7B gene was negative. Ultimately, the patient underwent liver transplantation; liver explant was significant for a copper dry weight concentration of 5436 mcg/g.

Conclusions

Human Swayback is a very rare copper-related disease which deserves awareness due to its potential irreversible health effects in the human body. Additionally, in patients who require copper supplementation, serial levels should be monitored to ensure adequate copper levels.

### Copper deficiency causes reversible myelodysplasia [^111WFhRq]. American Journal of Hematology (2007). Low credibility.

Copper deficiency is a recognized but often overlooked cause of anemia and neutropenia. We began checking serum copper levels on patients referred for evaluation for unexplained anemia and neutropenia or myelodysplasia. Eight patients were identified as copper deficient (serum copper less than 70 microg/dL). The anemia was normochromic and normocytic in seven patients. Neutropenia was present in seven patients. Seven patients had been referred for evaluation of myelodysplasia. Three were seen for consideration for allogenic stem cell transplant. Five patients had concomitant peripheral neurological symptoms. Seven patients were treated with oral copper gluconate. All treated patients demonstrated a hematological response; seven had a complete remission. The improvement in anemia and neutropenia was rapid with normalization of blood counts within three to four weeks. In one patient, normalization of the underlying marrow dysplasia was demonstrated by bone marrow histology eight months after copper replacement. The cause of copper deficiency was felt to be gastrointestinal malabsorption in five of our patients. We conclude that copper deficiency should be considered in all patients with unexplained anemia and neutropenia or myelodysplasia.

Endocrine Practice (2019). High credibility.

Bariatric surgery — copper deficiency risk and dosing are outlined as follows: Copper is primarily absorbed in the duodenum, proximal jejunum, and stomach, so surgeries affecting this anatomy can induce low copper; at 5 years postoperatively, low copper levels after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal switch (BPD/DS) were 13.8% and 19.2%, respectively; in Roux-en-Y gastric reconstruction for non-bariatric gastric surgery, copper deficiency was relatively infrequent (5.9%) with rare symptoms; initial supplementation dosing ranges from 3 to 8 mg/day orally as gluconate or sulfate to 2 to 4 mg/day intravenously, titrated to normalize levels and ameliorate signs/symptoms, with greater amounts required after RYGB and BPD/DS guided by serum copper levels.

Micronutrient deficiency replacement after bariatric surgery — copper, iron, and zinc dosing and interactions are detailed as follows. For copper, treatment includes "3–8 mg/d oral copper gluconate or sulfate" for mild to moderate deficiency, "2–4 mg/d of IV copper for ~ one week or until blood levels, signs, and symptoms resolve", with "Maintenance dose is 1–2 mg/d". For iron, in moderate deficiency or at-risk patients, "total elemental iron oral intake is often 150–200 mg twice a day", with "Maintenance elemental iron supplementation (in patients without anemia) is ~18 mg per day", and content varies by salt: "Ferrous fumarate supplies ~33% elemental iron (Fe), ferrous sulfate ~20% Fe, ferrous gluconate ~12% Fe"; "For severe deficiency, IV iron is sometimes required". Zinc–copper considerations include that "Copper deficiency can contribute to iron deficiency" and "Zinc consumption may impair copper absorption", thus "1 mg of copper might best be given per each 10 mg of zinc administered", and typical zinc supplementation after repletion includes "zinc 30 mg/d" when malabsorption risk persists or "8–22 mg per day" if lower risk, noting "Many bariatric multivitamins have 7.5–30 mg of zinc". Clinicians are advised that "Clinicians should work closely with a pharmacist to help confirm proper dosing of vitamins and minerals for an individual patient".

### Hematogone hyperplasia in copper deficiency [^114yk5NT]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Copper deficiency is likely an underrecognized cause of anemia and neutropenia and may masquerade as a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We report 2 cases of copper deficiency in which the diagnosis was suggested based on the characteristic morphologic findings, such as cytoplasmic vacuolization of erythroid and myeloid precursors and iron-containing plasma cells. It is interesting that both patients had hematogone hyperplasia. This phenomenon, largely absent in MDS, may aid in distinguishing nonclonal causes of cytopenias, such as copper deficiency, from MDS. It is of crucial importance to identify treatable causes of cytopenias when MDS is suspected. We recommend copper level assessment in patients suspected of having low-grade MDS, especially patients with neuropathy and normal results of cytogenetic studies.

### Copper deficiency myelopathy [^1177zcHJ]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Acquired copper deficiency has been recognised as a rare cause of anaemia and neutropenia for over half a century. Copper deficiency myelopathy (CDM) was only described within the last decade, and represents a treatable cause of non-compressive myelopathy which closely mimics subacute combined degeneration due to vitamin B12 deficiency. Here, 55 case reports from the literature are reviewed regarding their demographics, aetiology, haematological and biochemical parameters, spinal imaging, treatment and outcome. The pathophysiology of disorders of copper metabolism is discussed. CDM most frequently presented in the fifth and sixth decades and was more common in women (F:M = 3.6:1). Risk factors included previous upper gastrointestinal surgery, zinc overload and malabsorption syndromes, all of which impair copper absorption in the upper gastrointestinal tract. No aetiology was established in 20% of cases. High zinc levels were detected in some cases not considered to have primary zinc overload, and in this situation the contribution of zinc to the copper deficiency state remained unclear. Cytopenias were found in 78%, particularly anaemia, and a myelodysplastic syndrome may have been falsely diagnosed in the past. Spinal MRI was abnormal in 47% and usually showed high T2 signal in the posterior cervical and thoracic cord. In a clinically compatible case, CDM may be suggested by the presence of one or more risk factors and/or cytopenias. Low serum copper and caeruloplasmin levels confirmed the diagnosis and, in contrast to Wilson's disease, urinary copper levels were typically low. Treatment comprised copper supplementation and modification of any risk factors, and led to haematological normalisation and neurological improvement or stabilisation. Since any neurological recovery was partial and case numbers of CDM will continue to rise with the growing use of bariatric gastrointestinal surgery, clinical vigilance will remain the key to minimising neurological sequelae. Recommendations for treatment and prevention are made.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113zfm4Q]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Wilson disease — monitoring and adherence assessment during therapy includes targeted examination, history, and laboratory surveillance. Physical examination should look for evidence of liver disease and neurological symptoms; for patients on D-penicillamine, cutaneous changes should be sought, and history should include questioning about psychiatric symptoms, especially depression. Repeat examination for KF rings should be performed if there is a question of adherence. Laboratory testing at baseline and over time should include liver biochemistries, tests of hepatic synthetic function, total blood count, indices of copper metabolism (including 24-h urinary copper excretion), and routine urinalysis for those on chelation therapy. Estimated NCC may provide the best guide to treatment efficacy but may be incalculable if either parameter is below the laboratory detection limit. Evidence of nonadherence includes clinical worsening, elevation of liver tests, and increased urinary copper excretion; hepatic deterioration may follow. Disproportionately low urinary copper excretion on chelation relative to steady state values can indicate overtreatment and is often accompanied by lower serum ceruloplasmin and serum copper and therefore lower NCC; neutropenia, anemia, and hyperferritinemia can also be present. Recently stopped chelation therapy or subtherapeutic dosages may also yield low 24-h urinary copper excretion, but typically with elevated NCC or CuEXC or increased serum copper. In patients taking zinc, adherence can be checked by measuring serum zinc or 24-h urinary zinc excretion.

### Clinical and electrodiagnostic findings in copper deficiency myeloneuropathy [^113a7jU1]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Copper deficiency is an increasingly recognised cause of neurological impairment. This retrospective review highlights clinical and electrodiagnostic findings in patients diagnosed at our institution with copper deficiency.

Methods

Clinical, radiographic and electrodiagnostic findings were reviewed in patients with evidence of copper deficiency. Patients with other potential causes of myelopathy or neuropathy were excluded.

Results

The predominant clinical feature in all six patients was a sensory ataxia, resulting in marked gait unsteadiness. Nerve conduction studies and needle EMG were performed in all patients and revealed a mild to moderate distal, axonal, sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy. Median and tibial somatosensory evoked potentials were abnormal in all five patients in which it was performed, showing impaired conduction in central or proximal peripheral somatosensory pathways.

Conclusions

This pattern of electrodiagnostic findings suggests that impairment in somatosensory pathways demonstrated by somatosensory evoked potential testing is the main cause of the sensory ataxia in patients with copper deficiency.

### Zinc: an essential micronutrient [^113gPs8j]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Zinc is an essential micronutrient for human metabolism that catalyzes more than 100 enzymes, facilitates protein folding, and helps regulate gene expression. Patients with malnutrition, alcoholism, inflammatory bowel disease, and malabsorption syndromes are at an increased risk of zinc deficiency. Symptoms of zinc deficiency are nonspecific, including growth retardation, diarrhea, alopecia, glossitis, nail dystrophy, decreased immunity, and hypogonadism in males. In developing countries, zinc supplementation may be effective for the prevention of upper respiratory infection and diarrhea, and as an adjunct treatment for diarrhea in malnourished children. Zinc in combination with antioxidants may be modestly effective in slowing the progression of intermediate and advanced age-related macular degeneration. Zinc is an effective treatment for Wilson disease. Current data do not support zinc supplementation as effective for upper respiratory infection, wound healing, or human immunodeficiency virus. Zinc is well tolerated at recommended dosages. Adverse effects of long-term high-dose zinc use include suppressed immunity, decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, anemia, copper deficiency, and possible genitourinary complications.

Guidance statement 9 — liver biopsy and hepatic copper quantification indicates that liver biopsy for histology can aid in the diagnosis of Wilson disease and allows quantification of liver tissue copper; hepatic parenchymal copper content more than > 250 μg/g dry weight occurs in most patients and a lower content still above normal occurs less frequently but should prompt other confirmatory testing; in untreated patients, normal hepatic copper content (< 50 μg/g dry weight) almost always excludes a diagnosis of Wilson disease; and electron microscopic evaluation of liver tissue may aid diagnosis, notably in pediatric patients.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Wilson's disease, more specifically with respect to serum ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion, AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that an extremely low serum ceruloplasmin level (< 5 mg/dL) more strongly suggests a diagnosis of WD than modestly subnormal levels, but serum ceruloplasmin by itself is insufficient for making a diagnosis of WD. Do not exclude WD based on normal serum ceruloplasmin levels.

Specific diagnostic challenges — aceruloplasminemia: Aceruloplasminemia is due to mutations in the structural gene for ceruloplasmin on human chromosome 3 and is an extremely rare disorder that may present with neurological disturbances including ataxia, dysarthria, dystonia, and parkinsonian movement disorder; clinical presentation is typically in adulthood. The pathogenesis involves iron accumulation in the CNS, the liver biopsy often shows iron overload but not copper accumulation, serum ceruloplasmin is absent, and distinction from WD is based on genetic analysis.

5.4 Monitoring and Laboratory Tests

Monitor zinc concentrations, fluid and electrolyte status, serum osmolarity, blood glucose, liver and kidney function, blood count and coagulation parameters throughout treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.5 Copper Deficiency

Several post-marketing cases have reported that high doses of supplemental zinc (approximately 10 times the recommended dosage of 3 mg/day zinc sulfate injection in adults) taken over extended periods of time (i.e., months to years) may result in decreased enteral copper absorption and copper deficiency. The cases reported the following complications of copper deficiency: anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, myeloneuropathy, and nephrotic-range proteinuria [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

If a patient develops signs and symptoms of copper deficiency during treatment with zinc sulfate injection, interrupt zinc treatment and check zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin levels. Copper deficiency should be treated with supplemental copper administration and discontinuation of zinc supplementation.

5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions to subcutaneously administered zinc-containing insulin products were identified in postmarketing case reports. Reported reactions included injection site induration, erythema, pruritus, papular rash, generalized urticaria, facial swelling, and dyspnea. Patients did not manifest symptoms after changing to zinc-free insulin or another insulin product with a reduced amount of zinc. In some cases, allergy testing confirmed the allergy to the zinc component of the insulin product. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue zinc sulfate injection and initiate appropriate medical treatment [see Contraindications (4)].

Wilson disease (WD) dietary management — adults and adolescents: A moderately copper-restricted diet complements medical therapy, and registered dietitians (RDs) can facilitate implementation of a workable and effective personalized dietary plan. Patients with WD should try to keep intake of copper to the RDA, < 0.9 mg/day, avoid foods with very high concentrations of copper and most nondairy milk alternatives, and note that among shellfish, scallops are quite low in copper and vegetable-derived "meat" products are also high in copper. During the maintenance phase of disease management, individuals should continue to be mindful of copper intake, with emphasis on low-copper (< 0.08 mg copper/serving) and moderate-copper (0.08–0.2 mg copper/serving) foods making up the base of their diet, with serving size considered and no specific limitation per day recommended.

### Nutritional immunity: the impact of metals on lung immune cells and the airway microbiome during chronic respiratory disease [^116wT7zd]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Zinc deficiency has been observed in CF patients, especially those with malabsorption and impaired growth. The serum or plasma levels of subsets of CF patients, both child and adult, have been observed to be lower than healthy controls in several studies. Zinc supplementation has been used to treat CF patients, but studies have shown conflicting results, some have shown that zinc supplementation leads to improved lung function and reduced need for antibiotics and hospitalisations, while others showed no benefits for zinc supplementation. Interestingly, while zinc levels in serum can be low, zinc levels in the airways of CFs are reported to be higher. The prevalence and the impact of altered zinc homeostasis in CF is not yet well defined, however zinc levels affect microbial community structure in CF. Explants of CF lungs had S.aureus and P. aeruginosa co-existing in calprotectin enriched regions. As calprotectin chelates zinc, regions in the lungs enriched with this protein will have lower zinc levels which causes P. aeruginosa to reduce its production of antistaphyloccal factor thus allowing for the co-existence of this bacterial species.

Studies have found reduced activities of copper enzymes from cells (mononuclear cells, neutrophils and erythrocytes) in CF patients, possibly indicating reduced copper availability within these cells. Interestingly copper supplementation does not counteract this copper deficiency in CF patients indicating an altered copper metabolism that cannot be corrected simply by supplementation. One study reported that copper levels are elevated in the sputum in CF. The cause and consequences of altered copper homeostasis in CF are yet to be determined. Selenium deficiency is observed in CF patients but the levels of selenium in the CF lung have not been reported.

Non cystic fibrosis (CF) Bronchiectasis

Bronchiectasis refers to the permanent widening of the bronchi and usually presents clinically with coughing, sputum production and recurring respiratory infections, along with other symptoms. The widening of the bronchi leads to impaired mucociliary clearance and failure to effectively clear microbes and mucus leading to persistent infection and inflammation. Bronchiectasis is complex and heterogenous and can be the final common feature of many infectious, inflammatory, and allergic disorders.

### Zinc-induced copper deficiency: a report of three cases initially recognized on bone marrow examination [^114KAEVd]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Copper deficiency is a rare cause of sideroblastic anemia and neutropenia that often is not suspected clinically. The morphologic findings in bone marrow, while not pathognomonic, are sufficiently characteristic to suggest the diagnosis, leading to further testing to establish the correct diagnosis. Excess zinc ingestion is among the causes of copper deficiency. We present 3 cases of zinc-induced copper deficiency in which the diagnosis first was suggested on the basis of bone marrow examination. The first patient was a 47-year-old man with a debilitating peripheral neuropathy that had progressed during the previous 18 months, mild anemia, and severe neutropenia. The second was a 21-year-old man receiving zinc supplementation for acrodermatitis enteropathica in whom moderate normocytic anemia and neutropenia developed. The third patient was a 42-year-old man with anemia, severe neutropenia, and a peripheral neuropathy that had progressed during 8 months. The bone marrow findings in all cases suggested copper deficiency, which was confirmed by further laboratory testing and determined to be due to zinc excess. The morphologic features, clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis, and pathogenetic mechanisms are discussed.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^112nwCdW]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Wilson disease — zinc treatment targets and overtreatment: Adequacy of zinc treatment is assessed by 24-h urinary copper excretion, which should be < 100 μg (< 1.6 μmol)/24 h on stable treatment; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization may be a good marker and correlates with maintaining 24-h urinary copper below 100 μg/24 h, and elevated NCC normalizes with effective treatment. Overtreatment is suspected when urinary copper is very low (< 20 μg [< 0.3 μmol]/24 h) with low serum copper and lower ceruloplasmin, necessitating dose reduction or brief interruption if other hematologic or neurologic side effects occur; neurological changes are uncommon but may develop when depletion is severe and prolonged, usually after 5–15 years or more of treatment.

Guidance statements 23–24 — overtreatment thresholds and actions indicate that overtreatment may be signaled by cytopenias or retention of tissue iron with raised serum ferritin and is confirmed by a low serum copper and a very low 24-h urinary copper output; for oral chelators, 24-h urinary copper excretion below the therapeutic target, specifically < 100 μg/24 h or < 1.6 μmol/24 h, suggests overtreatment, and for zinc therapy, 24-h urinary copper < 20 μg/24 h (< 0.3 μmol/24 h) suggests overtreatment. Once overtreatment is confirmed, dose reduction or brief interruption of medical therapy should be instituted with close follow-up for reassessment. Treatment failure may occur during treatment initiation or chronic therapy; concurrent diseases and nonadherence must be excluded; and pharmacological therapy should be changed or adjusted to correct treatment failure, with liver transplantation potentially required for more advanced liver disease or liver failure.

Wilson disease — treatment of neurological symptoms — effective management of neurological manifestations of WD requires that treatment of the copper overload is achieved typically through pharmacotherapy, and neurological symptoms should be monitored closely when initiating D-penicillamine or trientine because these can cause paradoxical neurological decline, especially if dosing is too aggressive (initial dose too high or dose increase too rapid), with most cases thought to be due to a transient increase in NCC (or exchangeable copper), which is in equilibrium with CNS copper. Many neurological symptoms are at least partially responsive to adjunctive medical management; medications to treat parkinsonism, such as carbidopa/levodopa, are not necessarily effective, treatments for dystonia can be extremely helpful but may be limited by adverse effects, focal dystonia can often be effectively treated with botulinum toxin injection, deep brain stimulation has been tried but with only variable success, and chorea may respond to vesicular monoamine transporter-2 inhibitors such as tetrabenazine or dopamine receptor antagonists although patients with WD may develop adverse effects from neuroleptics; a multidisciplinary approach involving speech therapy, physical therapy, and occupational therapy is often helpful, and swallowing studies may identify those with dysphagia and risk of aspiration risk requiring intervention.

Basal 24-h urinary copper excretion — diagnostic use and cutoffs: Measuring the amount of copper excreted in the urine in a 24-h period may be very helpful for diagnosing WD, and basal 24-h urinary excretion reflects the amount of NCC in the circulation; basal measurements are useful so long as there is no contamination and the urine collection is complete. Spot urine specimens are not suitable, except possibly with ALF, where extremely high spot urine copper concentrations suggest a diagnosis of WD, and volume and total creatinine excretion in the 24-h collection are measured to assess completeness. The conventional cutoff taken as diagnostic of WD is > 100 μg/24 h (> 1.6 μmol/24 h) in symptomatic patients; however, this level may miss 16%–23% with WD, and taking the cutoff as 40 μg (0.6 μmol) per 24 h is noted as the upper limit of normal.

### Zinc acetate (Galzin) [^114t24Cs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Copper Deficiency

Several post-marketing cases reported that zinc acetate taken over extended periods of time (i.e., months to years) may result in decreased enteral copper absorption and copper deficiency. The cases reported the following complications of copper deficiency: anemia, granulocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and myeloneuropathy.

If a patient develops signs and/or symptoms of copper deficiency during treatment with zinc acetate, interrupt zinc treatment and measure zinc, 24-hr urinary copper, and non-ceruloplasmin bound copper (NCC) levels. Consider restarting zinc acetate treatment based on periodic monitoring of 24-hr urinary copper and NCC levels.

Gastric Ulcer

There have been postmarketing reports of gastric ulcers with long-term use of zinc acetate. The cases reported the complications of anemia and gastric ulcer perforation with peritonitis. In some cases, ulcers persisted after treatment until zinc acetate was discontinued.

If a patient develops signs and/or symptoms of gastric ulcer during treatment with zinc acetate, discontinue zinc treatment. Most patients showed improvement after cessation of zinc treatment.

### Copper deficiency myeloneuropathy resembling B12 deficiency: partial resolution of MR imaging findings with copper supplementation [^111VcoYd]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2006). Low credibility.

Copper deficiency has been associated with a clinical syndrome, myeloneuropathy. Radiographic changes resembling B(12) deficiency in the cervical spinal cord have been described. We present a case of copper deficiency myeloneuropathy, with cervical MR imaging findings resembling B(12) deficiency, which partially reversed following copper supplementation. This is, to our knowledge, the first described case of radiographic improvement with copper supplementation.

### Copper deficiency caused by excessive alcohol consumption [^113VUwwo]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

An effective method of copper supplementation is oral administration of cocoa. Although the amount of necessary copper supplementation is not established, it is said to be 2 to 6 mg/day, which is several times the required amount of copper, which as an essential dietary micronutrient is 0.9 mg/day. However, when copper is deficient, absorption efficiency from the intestinal tract increasesif there are no problems with the intestinal tract, and thus an extreme increase may not be necessary. In this case, we chose cocoa as a copper supplement. Cocoa contains a moderate amount of copper and is a convenient beverage. This cocoa contained about 0.2 mg of copper per cup, and as such, he consumed 0.4 to 0.6 mg/day. His symptoms dramatically improved even with this small amount of supplementation.

This case report has some limitations. First, it is difficult to precisely distinguish neurological symptoms including delirium from hepatic encephalopathy and alcohol withdrawal. However, treatment of hepatic encephalopathy or alcohol withdrawal did not improve his symptoms, which instead worsened. Meanwhile, his neurological symptoms such as delirium recovered from the very next day after copper supplementation. From this characteristic course, we presumed that the main pathological condition was copper deficiency. Second, we did not prove that there was a blood cell abnormality due to copper deficiency by bone marrow examination. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish from blood cell abnormalities due to alcohol toxicity. However, the dramatic progressive increase in reticulocytes in just a few days after copper supplementation by cocoa suggests that copper deficiency was the main cause.

We experienced a case of copper deficiency due to an excessive habitual alcohol consumption. We encourage clinicians to suspect copper deficiency when patients with an alcohol habit have blood cell abnormalities and neurological symptoms. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the mechanism causing copper deficiency with excessive alcohol consumption.

Learning points

Copper deficiency should be part of the differential if patients have blood cell abnormalities and neurological symptoms.
Alcohol abuse can be a risk factor for copper deficiency.
Cocoa can easily replenish copper requirements.

Wilson disease treatment monitoring — Zinc: Maintenance control aims for 24-h urinary Cu excretion < 100 μg/24 h, and treatment failure on chronic therapy is indicated by 24-h urinary Cu excretion > 100 μg/24 h (previously normal/near-normal). Initially, 24-h urinary copper excretion may drop below the achieved target range because of drug failure or nonadherence and then increase gradually over time; reinitiation of an oral chelator increases urinary copper excretion, whereas starting zinc decreases urinary excretion of copper.
