## Question

Which laboratory abnormalities are associated with pancreatic cancer?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about which laboratory abnormalities are associated with pancreatic cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the major laboratory categories implicated in pancreatic cancer and how they map to guideline-backed practice. Then, I should verify the evidence for classic tumor markers versus emerging biomarkers. Next, I will examine paraneoplastic metabolic and coagulation changes, followed by liver and pancreatic enzyme patterns. After that, I should review immunologic and genetic markers, consider metabolic and nutritional derangements, and assess medication-change signatures. Finally, I will integrate this into a diagnostic framework with caveats and limitations anchored to ASCO and ESMO guidance [^1112bkcA] [^1154jiYc].

> Let me first confirm the scope and taxonomy so I don't miss key domains. The abnormal laboratory signals in pancreatic cancer typically encompass tumor markers, glucose dysregulation, coagulation activation, cholestatic liver chemistries, pancreatic enzymes, immunologic markers such as IgG4, germline and somatic genomic markers, systemic metabolic/tissue-wasting signatures, and indirect medication-change patterns; I should also ensure these map to recommended baseline labs and marker use as suggested by ASCO and ESMO, rather than assuming any single lab is diagnostic on its own [^1112bkcA] [^1154jiYc].

> Now, on tumor markers, I need to check CA 19–9 first because it's the most established but also the most misunderstood. CA 19–9 typically shows sensitivity and specificity around the low 80% range against controls, with significant false positives in cholestasis and benign pancreaticobiliary disease, and false negatives in Lewis antigen–negative individuals who cannot synthesize the antigen; in fact, up to 5–10% of patients are non-secretors, capping theoretical sensitivity near 92%, and the positive predictive value is very low in asymptomatic individuals, so it is not a screening test and must not replace imaging for response assessment or staging decisions [^116VBumm] [^115pMQPi] [^113R8m5G] [^113FugTH] [^116vrJQu] [^113iAa6Q].

> Wait, let me verify the role of CEA and composite approaches so I don't overstate CA 19–9 alone. CEA is less sensitive and specific than CA 19–9 and can be elevated in alcoholic liver disease and biliary disorders; however, the CA 19–9 to CEA ratio greater than 40 has been reported to improve discrimination in some cohorts, and emerging strategies that personalize CA 19–9 reference ranges using FUT genotypes can enhance diagnostic performance, but I should emphasize these are adjunctive and context-dependent rather than definitive [^113R8m5G] [^112upFaR] [^11548xrn].

> Next, I should review novel biomarkers so I do not overlook promising signals while keeping feasibility in mind. Urinary LYVE1 and REG1B combined with CA 19–9 in a clinical-grade LDT (PancSure) demonstrated high AUC with sensitivity in the mid-80% range in largely early-stage cohorts, while blood-based multimarker panels and methylated cfDNA approaches are advancing; ctDNA is particularly promising for dynamic response monitoring and may detect progression earlier than CA 19–9 or imaging in advanced disease, but prospective interventional validation is needed before routine early-detection use and CA 19–9 still cannot be substituted for imaging-guided assessment [^116FBiMM] [^112MDhZ9] [^113StDQ2] [^114kgZrQ] [^116mzLrW] [^116vrJQu].

> I will now examine glucose metabolism abnormalities because paraneoplastic dysglycemia is both prevalent and temporally informative. Approximately half or more of pancreatic cancer patients have abnormal glucose metabolism, and new-onset diabetes within 2–3 years before diagnosis is a key red flag consistent with pancreatogenic type 3C diabetes; importantly, the initiation of antidiabetic therapy, especially insulin, has been associated with a near twofold increased risk of pancreatic cancer in the subsequent 2 years in women, and at the onset of diabetes some tumors are still radiographically resectable, so this is a crucial prediagnostic window to recognize [^117GkX9K] [^114oKe8p] [^1152kXFW] [^113pVWEQ] [^115WwFe1].

> Hold on, I should verify the coagulation phenotype to avoid underestimating thrombotic risk. Pancreatic cancer induces a systemic hypercoagulable state with elevated D-dimer and increased thrombin generation; prediagnostic initiation of anticoagulants may reflect this biology and has been associated with an increased near-term risk of pancreatic cancer, and higher CA 19–9 levels have correlated with thrombin generation parameters in treatment-naïve patients, underscoring cross-talk between tumor burden and coagulation [^1152kXFW] [^113NU5Py].

> Next, I should review liver and pancreatic enzyme patterns, but not jump to conclusions because obstructive cholestasis can be multifactorial. A cholestatic profile with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and variably increased transaminases is typical when biliary obstruction is present, while amylase and lipase are often normal or only modestly elevated and are not reliable discriminators of malignancy versus benign disease; thus, normal pancreatic enzymes do not exclude cancer and abnormal liver tests should trigger appropriate imaging rather than reliance on tumor markers alone [^113FugTH] [^112NYjCw] [^111StjZw].

> I need to check immunologic markers because IgG4 elevations can confound the differential diagnosis. About 7% of pancreatic cancer patients may have elevated IgG4 without autoimmune pancreatitis, so an isolated IgG4 elevation does not confirm autoimmune pancreatitis; careful clinicoradiologic correlation and, when appropriate, steroid responsiveness and histology are necessary to distinguish AIP from cancer to avoid misdiagnosis or delayed oncologic care [^114kTg4q].

> Let me consider germline and somatic genomic markers, since these are laboratory findings with therapeutic implications even if not diagnostic. Somatic alterations commonly include KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4, while germline pathogenic variants in BRCA1/2, ATM, and PALB2 are enriched; current guidelines recommend early germline and tumor testing to identify actionable findings such as BRCA mutations, MSI/MMR deficiency, and rare fusions including NTRK, with particular attention to extended profiling in KRAS wild-type tumors [^116ZJzP1] [^112iGg5K] [^112WuVL6] [^11663rDs].

> I should confirm the systemic metabolic signatures because they can precede overt clinical diagnosis. CT-derived phenotyping demonstrates early skeletal muscle loss and subsequent adipose wasting months before diagnosis, aligning with the clinical syndrome of cancer cachexia; in parallel, features of metabolic syndrome correlate with pancreatic cancer incidence, reinforcing that metabolic laboratory and body composition trends can contextualize risk but remain non-specific triggers for imaging rather than standalone tests [^1149oqHK] [^111StjZw].

> But wait, what about medication-change patterns as indirect, lab-adjacent signals in the EHR that could prompt earlier evaluation. Prospective cohorts show that starting antidiabetic or anticoagulant medications and stopping antihypertensives in the 1–2 years before diagnosis are associated with increased pancreatic cancer risk, while large primary care datasets also map temporal shifts in BMI, glucose, and routine blood tests that can stratify near-term risk and flag candidates for pancreas-protocol imaging or specialist referral when combined with clinical judgment [^114pWQj4] [^1152kXFW] [^115LXiRh].

> I will now integrate these findings into a pragmatic diagnostic framework, but I should double-check that each step aligns with guidelines. Baseline laboratory work typically includes a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel with liver chemistries, fasting glucose or HbA1c, and coagulation studies; CA 19–9 is reasonable in suspected or established disease with full awareness of its limitations, while definitive evaluation relies on multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT as first-line imaging, selective hepatic MRI to exclude small metastases before surgery, and EUS-guided tissue acquisition to confirm diagnosis before systemic therapy; germline and tumor profiling should be obtained early for actionable alterations, and IgG4 testing is helpful when autoimmune pancreatitis is a competing diagnosis [^1112bkcA] [^115P1cnP] [^11221U6r] [^115NWqT3] [^116ZJzP1].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied CA 19–9 trends could replace imaging for treatment assessment; hold on, I should verify guideline language to avoid that error. ASCO specifically recommends against using CA 19–9 as a substitute for imaging to assess treatment response in both metastatic and locally advanced unresectable disease, and ESMO advises integrating CA 19–9 trajectory with imaging at defined intervals rather than relying on biomarkers alone, particularly given confounding from cholestasis and non-secretor phenotypes; thus, imaging remains essential for staging and response [^116vrJQu] [^113iAa6Q] [^112Jwf8X].

> I should also emphasize interpretive caveats so clinicians do not overcall laboratory noise. No single laboratory abnormality is diagnostic of pancreatic cancer; CA 19–9 yields false positives in obstructive jaundice and benign hepatobiliary conditions and false negatives in Lewis-negative patients, pancreatic enzymes are often unhelpful, and early disease may show only subtle or transient abnormalities, so laboratory signals must be integrated with clinical context and high-quality imaging reviewed in a dedicated multidisciplinary setting when suspicion persists [^113R8m5G] [^115pMQPi] [^116VBumm] [^113aBuPX].

> Putting it all together, the most informative laboratory abnormalities include elevated CA 19–9 when interpretable, new or worsening dysglycemia consistent with type 3C diabetes, cholestatic liver test abnormalities with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia when obstruction is present, a hypercoagulable profile with elevated D-dimer and enhanced thrombin generation, and occasionally elevated IgG4 that necessitates careful discrimination from autoimmune pancreatitis; secondary signals include oncogenic mutations on tumor profiling, germline susceptibility variants, prediagnostic tissue wasting and metabolic syndrome features, and medication-change patterns, all of which should prompt appropriate pancreas-focused imaging and tissue diagnosis rather than serve as standalone diagnostics [^116VBumm] [^1152kXFW] [^113FugTH] [^113NU5Py] [^114kTg4q] [^116ZJzP1] [^1149oqHK].

---

Pancreatic cancer commonly features **elevated CA 19–9** [^1154jiYc] and **cholestatic LFTs** (bilirubin, ALP, GGT) from biliary obstruction [^113FugTH]. New-onset **diabetes** or worsening hyperglycemia is common, reflecting tumor-induced insulin resistance or beta-cell dysfunction [^1152kXFW] [^113pVWEQ]. Additional findings include elevated CEA, anemia, thrombocytosis, and a **hypercoagulable state** with increased D-dimer and fibrinogen [^113R8m5G] [^113NU5Py]. CA 19–9 is **not specific** and can be elevated in benign conditions [^115pMQPi] or absent in Lewis-negative patients [^116VBumm]; it should not replace **imaging** for diagnosis or response assessment [^116vrJQu].

---

## Tumor markers

### CA 19–9 (carbohydrate antigen 19–9)

- **Clinical utility**: Most commonly used tumor marker for pancreatic cancer [^1154jiYc]; recommended by ASCO and ESMO for baseline assessment and monitoring [^1112bkcA].

- **Diagnostic performance**: Sensitivity 70–90%, specificity 68–91% [^116VBumm]; limited by false positives in benign biliary disease and false negatives in Lewis-negative individuals (5–10%).

- **Clinical limitations**: Not suitable for screening or definitive diagnosis; not a substitute for imaging in response assessment [^113iAa6Q] [^116vrJQu].

---

### CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen)

CEA is **often elevated** in pancreatic cancer but is less sensitive and specific than CA 19–9; it is used as an adjunct [^113R8m5G].

---

## Liver function tests (LFTs)

Pancreatic cancer — especially tumors of the head — often causes biliary obstruction, leading to **cholestatic LFT abnormalities** [^113FugTH]:

| **Test** | **Typical abnormality** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Total bilirubin | Elevated | Obstructive jaundice |
| Direct bilirubin | Elevated | Cholestasis |
| Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) | Elevated | Biliary obstruction |
| Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) | Elevated | Cholestasis |
| AST/ALT | Mildly elevated | Hepatocellular injury from obstruction |

---

## Glucose metabolism abnormalities

Pancreatic cancer frequently causes **disturbances in glucose metabolism** [^1152kXFW]:

- **New-onset diabetes**: Occurs in ~50% of patients; often within 2–3 years before diagnosis [^1152kXFW].

- **Hyperglycemia**: Common due to insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction [^114pWQj4].

- **Clinical significance**: New-onset or worsening diabetes in older adults may be a paraneoplastic sign [^115LXiRh].

---

## Hematological abnormalities

Pancreatic cancer is associated with several **hematological abnormalities** [^113NU5Py]:

| **Abnormality** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| Anemia (normocytic, normochromic) | Chronic disease, malnutrition, or occult bleeding |
| Thrombocytosis | Paraneoplastic inflammation; poor prognosis |
| Leukocytosis | Inflammation or infection |
| Hypercoagulability (elevated D-dimer, fibrinogen) | Increased VTE risk [^113NU5Py] |

---

## Electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities

Pancreatic cancer can cause various **electrolyte and metabolic disturbances**:

| **Abnormality** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| Hyponatremia | SIADH or dehydration |
| Hypokalemia | Vomiting, diarrhea, or malnutrition |
| Hypocalcemia | Malabsorption or vitamin D deficiency |
| Hypomagnesemia | Malnutrition or malabsorption |
| Elevated LDH | Tumor burden or metastasis |

## Clinical implications

- **Diagnosis**: Laboratory abnormalities support diagnosis but are not definitive; imaging and biopsy are required [^115P1cnP] [^115NWqT3].

- **Prognosis**: Elevated CA 19–9, thrombocytosis, and hypercoagulability indicate advanced disease and poorer outcomes [^111Lj5Un] [^113NU5Py].

- **Monitoring**: CA 19–9 and LFTs help monitor treatment response and detect recurrence, but imaging remains essential [^112Jwf8X].

### Pancreatic cancer is associated with medication changes prior to clinical diagnosis [^1152kXFW]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Diabetes is both a long-term risk factor for pancreatic cancer and is caused by pancreatic cancer in the several years prior to cancer diagnosis. Altered glucose homeostasis is one of the most prevalent prediagnostic phenotypic traits in patients who develop pancreatic cancer. Importantly, new-onset diabetes and worsening of glucose control in long-standing diabetes may occur in up to half of all patients who develop pancreatic cancer. Rapid increases in blood glucose are also more frequent in patients with pancreatic cancer-associated diabetes compared to type 2 diabetes in the general population. The addition of antidiabetic medications to a patient's medication program may signal worsening glucose control, providing risk stratifying information in both those with long-term and recent-onset diabetes, even if those conditions are known from billing codes or provider notes.

In the study, the initiation of any antidiabetic medication was associated with a nearly 2-fold increased risk of pancreatic cancer in the next two years in females, even when accounting for a patient's BMI, recent weight loss, or prior diabetes diagnosis. Furthermore, stronger associations were identified for insulin compared to oral hypoglycemic medications, indicating the utility of medication change to provide insights into disease severity.

We also identified increased two-year risks of pancreatic cancer diagnosis for individuals who started anticoagulant or stopped antihypertensive medications. Pancreatic cancer is known to induce a hypercoagulable state, which can lead to…

### Pancreatic cancer [^1177pXjY]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is a major cause of cancer-associated mortality, with a dismal overall prognosis that has remained virtually unchanged for many decades. Currently, prevention or early diagnosis at a curable stage is exceedingly difficult as patients rarely exhibit symptoms, and tumors do not display sensitive and specific markers to aid detection. Pancreatic cancers also have few prevalent genetic mutations; the most commonly mutated genes are KRAS, CDKN2A (encoding p16), TP53, and SMAD4 — none of which are currently druggable.

Therapeutic options are limited, and progress in drug development is impeded because most pancreatic cancers are complex at the genomic, epigenetic, and metabolic levels, with multiple activated pathways and crosstalk evident. Furthermore, the multilayered interplay between neoplastic and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment challenges medical treatment. Fewer than 20% of patients have surgically resectable disease; however, neoadjuvant therapies might shift tumors towards resectability. Although newer drug combinations and multimodal regimens in this setting, as well as the adjuvant setting, appreciably extend survival, approximately 80% of patients will relapse after surgery and ultimately die of their disease. Thus, consideration of quality of life and overall survival is important.

In this primer, we summarize the understanding of the salient pathophysiological, molecular, translational, and clinical aspects of this disease. In addition, we present an outline of potential future directions for pancreatic cancer research and patient management.

### The prognostic and predictive value of serum CA19.9 in pancreatic cancer [^111Lj5Un]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Serum CA19.9 possesses many features of a robust or clinically useful biomarker and has been well studied to define its limitations. Despite this, there are no clear applications for CA19.9 in the management of pancreatic cancer, as there are for other similar serum biomarkers such as PSA for prostate cancer, CEA for colorectal cancer, and CA 125 in ovarian cancer. Although sometimes controversial, these biomarkers are used in routine practice and form integral components of clinical trials to further advance clinical management.

We focused on defining potential roles for serum CA19.9 at key clinical decision-making time points in patients who have demonstrable CA19.9 production. If an individual has the capacity to produce CA19.9, either through Lewis antigen testing or through a level over 5 U/ml at diagnosis as a surrogate, postoperative CA19.9 measurements have potential prognostic and predictive value.

- **Prognostic value**: Normalization of CA19.9 postoperatively is associated with a good prognosis.

- **Predictive value**: Postoperative CA19.9 levels greater than 90 U/ml may indicate a lack of response to adjuvant gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Additionally, although numbers are small, a normal CA19.9 after the completion of adjuvant therapy is potentially associated with an excellent prognosis.

These potential applications are summarized in a schematic representation, which also proposes how CA19.9 levels could be incorporated into trials to inform clinical decision-making.

### Metabolic biomarker signature to differentiate pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma from chronic pancreatitis [^115pMQPi]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is projected to be the third leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030 due to delayed diagnosis and slow progress in treatment options. Chronic pancreatitis (CP) arises with an incidence of between 4 and 23 per 100,000 in different populations (the prevalence is tenfold higher) and represents a risk factor for pancreatic cancer and a frequent differential diagnosis. Commonly used diagnostic methods for either disorder include transabdominal ultrasound, various blood tests, and trans-sectional imaging.

The best-established blood test for this purpose is the carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9), a Lewis antigen of the MUC1 protein class. Unfortunately, CA19–9 can also be elevated in patients with non-malignant diseases, including liver cirrhosis (LC), CP, cholangitis, and other GI cancers. CA19–9 has been reported to discriminate between patients with pancreatic cancer and healthy controls, achieving a sensitivity of 80.3% (95% CI 77.7 to 82.6) and specificity of 80.2% (95% CI 78.0 to 82.3), as well as distinguishing benign pancreatic disease with a sensitivity of 78.2% (95% CI 72.3 to 80.4) and specificity of 82.8%.

As CA19–9 is not expressed in Lewis blood-type negative patients, its sensitivity theoretically cannot surpass 92%. The fact that the sensitivity and specificity of the distinction between cancer and CP is often no better than 65% or 60%, respectively, has prompted a search for alternative biomarkers. Our study was designed to exclude suspected pancreatic cancer (local, locally advanced, and metastatic) in patients with CP; therefore, we aimed at optimizing the negative predictive value (NPV).

### Serum immunoglobulin G fraction 4 levels in pancreatic cancer: Elevations not associated with autoimmune pancreatitis [^114kTg4q]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Autoimmune pancreatitis is an uncommon, inflammatory disease of the pancreas that presents with clinical features similar to those caused by pancreatic cancer, such as painless jaundice and a pancreatic mass. Patients with autoimmune pancreatitis frequently have elevated serum immunoglobulin G fraction 4 (IgG4) levels, and their pancreatic tissue may show IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltration. It is imperative to differentiate autoimmune pancreatitis from pancreatic cancer because autoimmune pancreatitis typically responds to corticosteroid treatment. A previous Japanese study reported that serum IgG4 greater than 135 mg/dL was 97% specific and 95% sensitive in predicting autoimmune pancreatitis.

- **Objective**: To prospectively measure serum IgG4 levels in pancreatic cancer patients to ascertain whether increased levels might be present in this North American population.

- **Design**: We collected blood samples and phenotypic information on 71 consecutive pancreatic cancer patients and 103 healthy controls who visited our clinics between October 2004 and April 2006. IgG4 levels were determined using a single radial immunodiffusion assay. A serum IgG4 level greater than 135 mg/dL was considered elevated.

- **Results**: Five cancer patients had IgG4 elevation, with a mean serum IgG4 level of 160.8 mg/dL. None of our cancer patients with plasma IgG4 elevation demonstrated evidence of autoimmune pancreatitis. One control subject demonstrated elevated serum IgG4 unrelated to an identified etiology.

- **Conclusions**: As many as 7% of patients with pancreatic cancer have elevated serum IgG4 levels.

### Early detection of sporadic pancreatic cancer: Summative review [^115bk36G]. Pancreas (2015). Low credibility.

For the purposes of this article, patient resources for biomarkers will be categorized into six classes: the general population, an at-risk population, symptomatic patients who do not have pancreatic cancer (PC), patients with newly diagnosed disease, patients undergoing treatment, and patients who fail treatment.

- **General population resources**: These include data and sample collections from the population at large. They may be collected from population-based studies, clinic-based settings (primary care), or convenience sampling (random volunteers). These are typically regarded as "healthy controls".

- **At-risk population**: This group includes unaffected relatives from families with a genetic predisposition to cancer and unaffected individuals whose lifestyle, exposure to carcinogens, or presence of ancillary diseases (i.e. pancreatitis, diabetes) puts them at risk for developing PC.

- **Symptomatic patients who do not have PC**: These are extremely valuable control subjects. These patients may present with abdominal pain, weight loss, and/or diarrhea; however, imaging of the pancreas is completely normal. When developing a biomarker for earlier detection of disease in symptomatic patients, this control group will be essential.

- **Patients with newly diagnosed disease**: These are those who have been diagnosed with PC.

- **Patients undergoing treatment**: This group consists of individuals with PC undergoing treatment for their disease.

- **Patients who fail therapy**: These are those who have failed all therapies or who are not able to take additional therapies due to cumulative toxicities or disease progression.

### Diagnostic accuracy and added value of blood-based protein biomarkers for pancreatic cancer: A meta-analysis of aggregate and individual participant data [^112MDhZ9]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis are reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies Statement.

- **Search strategy**: Systematic literature searches were conducted in the bibliographic databases Medline, Embase, Wiley/Cochrane Library, and Web of Science (Core Collection) from inception up to November 2, 2021, in collaboration with a medical information specialist. An updated search was conducted on June 15, 2022. Reference lists of primary studies and review articles were screened for additional publications. The full search strategies for all databases can be found in the Supplementary Appendix.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Articles were included that collected blood samples at the time of diagnosis and reported the diagnostic accuracy of blood-based protein biomarkers for PDAC in adults. Studies were excluded if they collected blood samples after chemotherapy, included less than ten patients in either the PDAC or the control group, did not use histopathological diagnosis as the reference standard for diagnosing PDAC, or did not provide enough data to construct two-by-two diagnostic contingency tables. For comparative studies between CA19–9 and blood-based proteins, articles were included if they used a fully paired or randomized design.

- **Study selection and screening**: Two reviewers (L.N.C.B. and M. A.) independently screened all potentially relevant titles and abstracts for eligibility. The full text of potentially eligible articles was checked for the inclusion criteria.

### Targeting early diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer among the diabetic population: A comprehensive review of biomarker screening strategies [^117GkX9K]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer leads to type 3C pancreaticogenic diabetes mellitus. Approximately 50–74% of pancreatic cancer (PC)-related diabetes is of recent onset, with a duration of 2–3 years. The prevalence of dysglycemia in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is higher when diagnosis is made using a standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) rather than fasting glucose levels. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism are frequently missed in PDAC. In this context, the importance of preoperative diagnosis of dysglycemia needs to be emphasized, as it has been shown to affect surgical strategy in up to 15% of patients. Although specific clinical guidelines defining pancreatic cancer complicated by diabetes remain lacking, the consensus is that new-onset diabetes occurring within 2–3 years before a pancreatic cancer diagnosis is frequently a paraneoplastic manifestation known as pancreatic cancer-new onset diabetes mellitus (PC-NODM). Often classified as type 3C diabetes, this condition encompasses various pancreatic exocrine disorders and hyperglycemia resulting from distinct pathological mechanisms, including chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, hemochromatosis, cystic fibrosis, and previous pancreatic surgeries.

Prior research consistently reports that approximately 80% of pancreatic cancer patients present glucose metabolism abnormalities, ranging from diabetes to impaired glucose tolerance. Certain studies suggest pancreatic cancer may induce insulin resistance and compromise pancreatic beta-cell function through the secretion of circulating tumor proteins and cytokines, contributing to new-onset diabetes (NOD).

### A clinical laboratory improvement amendments/college of American pathologists-compliant noninvasive laboratory-developed test for early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [^116FBiMM]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2025). High credibility.

A noninvasive test for earlier detection of pancreatic cancer in individuals at higher risk is currently unavailable. We devised PancSure, a laboratory-developed test based on the protein biomarkers lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE1) and regenerating family member 1 β (REG1B), measured in urine by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The test also accounts for commonly used serum/plasma carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA19.9), with an updated PancRISK algorithm for data interpretation.

- **Validation**: The test was validated in 565 patients: 117 asymptomatic patients without any known pancreatic condition or malignancies (21%), 242 symptomatic patients with benign pancreatic diseases (43%), and 206 patients with confirmed cancers (36%). Of those with cancer, 161 (77.5%) had stage I to II disease, and 45 (22.5%) had stage III to IV disease.

- **Performance metrics**: PancSure passed all specifications during analytical validation and distinguishes early-stage resectable cancer from asymptomatic individuals with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89–0.97), and 85% to 90% sensitivity (SN) and 78% to 87% specificity (SP). It differentiates from symptomatic patients with an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.81–0.91), and 83% to 85% SN and 72% to 83% SP. Additionally, it distinguishes from all noncancer patients (pooled controls) with an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84–0.93), and 83% to 85% SN and 78% to 87% SP.

PancSure is a noninvasive clinical-grade test with a 48-hour turnover, ready for implementation, providing a viable solution for the earlier detection of pancreatic cancer in at-risk groups for improved patient care.

### Diagnostic accuracy and added value of blood-based protein biomarkers for pancreatic cancer: A meta-analysis of aggregate and individual participant data [^116VBumm]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) poses a major diagnostic and therapeutic challenge as symptoms often develop at an advanced disease stage, resulting in a diagnosis that is typically too late. Consequently, the prognosis for patients with PDAC is poor, with a dismal relative 5-year survival rate of 10.8%. The opportunity for improving this prognosis lies foremost in accurate and early disease detection, which could aid earlier treatment initiation and increase the possibility of surgical intervention.

The modalities currently used for diagnosing PDAC involve a combination of clinical symptoms, radiological findings, and pathological confirmation of the diagnosis through fine-needle aspiration or brush cytology. These diagnostic measures are invasive and time-consuming, and often, the diagnosis remains inconclusive until after surgery is performed. Carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9) is a protein most commonly used as a non-invasive tumor biomarker for patients suspected of PDAC. CA19–9 is produced in normal pancreas tissue but can be highly expressed by cancerous pancreatic cells and is, therefore, regarded as a tumor marker that can support the diagnosis of PDAC.

However, its diagnostic power is perceived to be limited, with a reported sensitivity and specificity between 82% and 91%, and it is mainly used for monitoring disease and follow-up after therapy. Additionally, Lewis-negative patients are unable to produce CA19–9, which hampers its diagnostic utility. As such, an efficient, accurate, and minimally invasive method for diagnosing PDAC remains essential.

### Comprehensive ctDNA measurements improve prediction of clinical outcomes and enable dynamic tracking of disease progression in advanced pancreatic cancer [^114kgZrQ]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). High credibility.

The only blood-based biomarker in use to monitor the treatment response for pancreatic cancer, carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9), has several drawbacks that limit its clinical value. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as an alternative blood-based marker, with evidence indicating its prognostic and predictive value across multiple types of cancer. Our study demonstrates that ctDNA can be used as a marker to monitor treatment response and tumor progression in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Detection of ctDNA persistence after the initiation of treatment indicates a high probability of tumor progression and inferior survival. ctDNA surveillance during follow-up detects disease progression, with a median lead time of 19 days on radiological imaging/time of death compared with 6 days for CA19–9. Future prospective and interventional clinical trials will be required to implement the findings in clinical practice and improve outcomes for patients with pancreatic cancer.

### Cell-free DNA testing for the detection and prognosis prediction of pancreatic cancer [^113R8m5G]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive cancers in China, with only a 10% 5-year survival rate. With its high malignancy, pancreatic cancer remains a major cause of cancer-related mortality. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) accounts for 90% of all pancreatic cancer cases. Smoking, nonhereditary or chronic pancreatitis, chronic diabetes mellitus, obesity, nontype O blood group, and age could be risk factors for PDAC. Besides, germline mutations in genes such as BRCA2, BRCA1, CDKN2A, ATM, STK11, PRSS1, MLH1, and PALB2 are associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). At the time of writing, there's no reliable screening test for pancreatic cancer, while most patients with pancreatic cancer do not have evident symptoms until the advanced stage.

Surgical resection remains the main therapeutic method for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, but only 10–20% of patients are eligible for surgical resection. Carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are considered biomarkers of pancreatic cancer. CA19–9 also plays an important role in the guidance of surgery decisions, the use of adjuvant therapy, and the detection of post-operative tumor recurrence, but its effect is limited because 10% of patients do not secrete the antigen. As a biomarker, CA19–9 lacks sensitivity and specificity and is elevated in pancreatic benign diseases and other gastrointestinal malignancies. CEA is also neither sensitive nor specific, and it is elevated in alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatitis, and biliary disease.

### ASGE guideline on screening for pancreatic cancer in individuals with genetic susceptibility: Summary and recommendations [^1139HKgR]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2022). High credibility.

The ASGE 2022 guidelines provide recommendations for screening and diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in genetically susceptible individuals. Screening age is determined based on the specific genetic condition:

- **BRCA2 pathogenic variant**: Age 50, or 10 years earlier than the youngest relative with pancreatic cancer.
- **BRCA1 pathogenic variant**: Age 50, or 10 years earlier than the youngest relative with pancreatic cancer.
- **PALB2 pathogenic variant**: Age 50, or 10 years earlier than the youngest relative with pancreatic cancer.
- **Familial pancreatic cancer syndrome**: Age 50, or 10 years earlier than the youngest relative with pancreatic cancer. Screen all first-degree relatives of affected family members.
- **Familial atypical multiple mole melanoma syndrome**: Age 40, or 10 years earlier than the youngest relative with pancreatic cancer.
- **Peutz-Jeghers syndrome**: Age 35, or 10 years earlier than the youngest relative with pancreatic cancer.
- **Heterozygotes for ATM pathogenic variant with first- or second-degree relative with pancreatic cancer**: Age 50, or 10 years earlier than the youngest relative with pancreatic cancer.
- **Lynch syndrome with first- or second-degree relative with pancreatic cancer**: Age 50, or 10 years earlier than the youngest relative with pancreatic cancer.
- **Autosomal-dominant hereditary pancreatitis**: Age 40.

### Defining pancreatitis as a risk factor for pancreatic cancer: The role, incidence, and timeline of development [^111CPxzA]. Pancreas (2019). Low credibility.

Acute and/or chronic pancreatitis has been implicated as an important risk factor for pancreatic cancer; however, the incidence and temporal relationship of pancreatitis before pancreatic cancer diagnosis are unclear. We aim to understand the role and incidence of pancreatitis temporally with the development of pancreatic cancer.

- **Methods**: A population-based study was used to investigate a temporal relationship between pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer diagnoses. Intervals of 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months were developed. Demographical data including age, sex, and race were also recorded and analyzed.

- **Results**: A total of 50,080 patients were found to have a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, of which 7,420 (14.8%) had prior diagnoses of pancreatitis. Of those, 92% were between the ages of 40 and 89 years. African Americans had a higher rate of pancreatitis before cancer diagnosis compared to whites (21.2% vs. 14.8%, P < 0.0001). Further analysis revealed that pancreatitis occurred in 81.3% of patients 3 months before a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, and 98.9% had established diagnoses of pancreatic cancer within 3 years.

- **Conclusions**: Screening of patients older than 40 years who have pancreatitis of unclear etiology may be warranted, especially in African Americans and male individuals.

### Adipose tissue and skeletal muscle wasting precede clinical diagnosis of pancreatic cancer [^1149oqHK]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Early detection of pancreatic cancer remains difficult due to few specific warning signs and an early propensity for dissemination. However, pancreatic cancer-induced alterations in systemic metabolism may provide opportunities for earlier cancer detection. In the study, we examined how weight and peripheral tissues changed in the period leading up to a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. We used automated machine learning algorithms to interrogate prediagnosis CT imaging from pancreatic cancer cases and matched controls and a > 12,000 patient age-, sex-, and race-standardized CT reference set.

We identified adipose tissue wasting primarily in the population with CT imaging six months prior to cancer diagnosis. In contrast, the loss of skeletal muscle appeared to occur earlier, with a steady decline in skeletal muscle up to the time of cancer diagnosis. Notably, these changes were identified in equal magnitude among patients diagnosed with localized and metastatic pancreatic cancer, suggesting that cancer-induced metabolic changes may occur when pancreatic cancers can be treated with curative intent.

In previous studies using mouse models of pancreatic cancer, we observed peripheral tissue wasting early in disease progression. This wasting occurred before the tumor spread beyond the pancreas and before measurable weight loss. Nevertheless, it is unclear if and when tissue wasting occurs in the early stages of pancreatic cancer in humans. A study of 68 pancreatic cancer patients with serial CT scans in the prediagnosis period provided initial data supporting tissue wasting.

### Major molecular markers in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and their roles in screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment [^112u8cDE]. Pancreas (2011). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is notorious for its late presentation, early and aggressive local invasion, metastatic potential, and poor outcomes. It presents at a clinically advanced stage that precludes the possibility of surgical resection in most cases and shows constitutive resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in others. As a result, mortality from this disease parallels its incidence rates. Recent breakthroughs in the molecular biology of pancreatic cancer have assisted in translational research, giving hope for individualized therapy and better disease management.

Molecular biology tools are guiding early diagnosis, the assessment of prognosis, and isolation of novel, more effective therapeutic targets. This review discusses the signature mutations of pancreatic cancer, implications of these mutations to pancreatic cancer biology, their linked pathways, and recent advances in their understanding as biomarkers as diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tools in dealing with this disease.

### Early detection of pancreatic cancer-a defined future using lessons from other cancers: A white paper [^115YWA88]. Pancreas (2016). Low credibility.

- **Identifying existing and novel biomarkers of early PDAC**: Numerous biomarkers have already been identified with widely varying levels of rigor in testing and validation. A thorough investigation of biomarkers that have been studied in early-stage PDAC needs to be initiated. This will involve a group of biostatisticians and independent researchers using predetermined levels of evidence to curate a panel of biomarkers that meet the threshold for validation studies. Researchers will then participate in a think tank organized by philanthropy and governmental agencies to determine the final selection of biomarkers targeted for further validation. This in silico purge of existing biomarkers will identify those that are ready for validation in presymptomatic samples identified in action item no. 2. This is required because the retrospective sample resource is limited in number and sample volumes.

- **Identifying novel biomarkers of PDAC**: Emerging novel technologies promise to provide previously untested approaches to early detection. Some are in nascent stages of development, and others are yet to be discovered. The National Institutes of Health has reviewed the first round of applicants for its recently launched "Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium (U01)". The goal of the request for application is to establish multidisciplinary teams of researchers and clinicians to conduct research to improve the detection of early-stage PDAC and characterization of its [text appears cut off].

### International cancer of the pancreas screening (CAPS) consortium summit on the management of patients with increased risk for familial pancreatic cancer [^113m74wF]. Gut (2013). Low credibility.

What are the goals of screening? What outcomes would be considered a 'success'? Screening individuals with high-risk indicators (HRIs) can be considered successful if it demonstrates that the benefits outweigh the costs. The primary goal is to reduce mortality related to pancreatic cancer. Evidence for success is most compelling when derived from large randomized controlled trials, where outcomes of those undergoing surveillance are compared with appropriate controls, similar to colonoscopy screening. However, due to the relatively low incidence of familial pancreatic cancer, conducting such trials is challenging. Therefore, surrogate endpoints to define the success of pancreatic screening are necessary. Pathological staging is crucial, and a standardized protocol for handling pancreatic resection specimens is recommended (Appendix).

The identification of surrogate endpoints such as resection of potentially curable lesions, including high-grade precursor neoplasms and early invasive carcinomas, was the focus of the questions: What are the goals of screening? What outcomes would be considered a success? These lesions, if untreated, can advance to incurable and lethal disease.

- **Early detection and treatment targets**:
	- **Resectable carcinoma**: Early detection and subsequent resection are targets (agree 83.7%, grade high, 'do it').
	- **Early invasive cancer (T1N0M0)**: Successfully detecting and treating this at baseline or follow-up should be considered a success (agree 89.8%, grade high, 'do it'). At follow-up, a moderate agreement was noted (77.5%, grade moderate, 'do it').
	- **Any invasive resectable pancreatic cancer at baseline screening**: The detection and treatment of such cases should also be considered successful.

### Reviews on current liquid biopsy for detection and management of pancreatic cancers [^111HpWvF]. Pancreas (2020). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. It presents dismal clinical outcomes in patients, and the incidence of pancreatic cancer has continuously increased. It is likely to become the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths by as early as 2030. One of the main reasons for the high mortality rate is the lack of tools for early-stage detection. The practice in detecting and monitoring therapeutic response in pancreatic cancer relies on imaging analysis and invasive endoscopic examination. Liquid biopsy-based analysis of genetic alterations in biofluids has become a fundamental component in the diagnosis and management of cancers.

There is an urgent need for scientific and technological advancement to detect pancreatic cancer early and to develop effective therapies. The development of a highly sensitive and specific liquid biopsy tool will require extensive understanding of the characteristics of circulating tumor DNA in biofluids. Here, we have reviewed the status of liquid biopsy in detecting and monitoring pancreatic cancers and our understanding of circulating tumor DNA, which should be considered for the development of a liquid biopsy tool. This advancement will greatly aid in the diagnosis and healthcare of people at risk.

### Pancreatic cancer: Rapid evidence review [^113FugTH]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is relatively uncommon and carries a poor prognosis because patients often develop signs or symptoms at a late stage of illness. Patients with a family history, especially those with genetic syndromes, are at a significantly increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Modifiable risk factors include smoking, heavy alcohol use, and obesity. Although patients at increased risk should be screened, screening is not recommended for asymptomatic people at average risk.

The differential diagnosis for a symptomatic patient is broad, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, chronic pancreatitis, biliary dyskinesia, cholelithiasis, gastroparesis, or constipation. Initial serologic testing should include transaminase and bilirubin levels, and in patients with midepigastric pain, lipase levels. Pancreas-protocol, contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography is the imaging test of choice. Carbohydrate antigen 19–9 is the most studied cancer marker and is moderately accurate in patients suspected of having cancer; however, the positive predictive value is 0.9% in asymptomatic patients.

Treatment includes neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and surgery if the cancer is resectable. The treatment approach is best determined by a multidisciplinary, high-volume center. For a patient undergoing chemotherapy, nutritional and psychosocial support and palliation of symptoms should be goals during treatment.

### Comprehensive ctDNA measurements improve prediction of clinical outcomes and enable dynamic tracking of disease progression in advanced pancreatic cancer [^116mzLrW]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). High credibility.

Despite being a relatively uncommon disease, pancreatic cancer is currently the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death in the Western world. Recent advances in treatment have improved survival for patients with advanced disease, who make up the majority of patients with pancreatic cancer. Nonetheless, the median overall survival (OS) for this patient group is less than one year.

The tumor marker carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9) is currently the only blood-based biomarker in routine clinical use to monitor the treatment response for pancreatic cancer. However, CA19–9 has several drawbacks that limit its clinical value, including poor sensitivity, false positivity in the presence of obstructive jaundice, and false-negative results in Lewis-negative phenotype patients, who are not able to produce CA19–9. Consequently, radiological imaging is still required to determine disease progression, with subsequent changes in therapy.

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a promising new tool for predicting clinical outcomes and monitoring the treatment response in patients with cancer. We previously demonstrated that both indirect detection of ctDNA using the total cell-free (cfDNA) concentration and cfDNA fragmentation analyses and direct detection of mutant KRAS have prognostic value in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. In a pilot study, we further demonstrated the potential value of using ctDNA to monitor the treatment response in these patients. The potential of ctDNA in monitoring patients with pancreatic cancer has also been investigated in several studies.

### Pancreatic cancer is associated with medication changes prior to clinical diagnosis [^114pWQj4]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In the several years before a clinical diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, patients develop symptoms and signs that might serve as an early warning for the growing malignancy. For example, new-onset metabolic alterations such as hyperglycemia and weight loss occur during this time window and are increasingly recognized as defining a high-risk group. Similarly, pancreatic cancer patients are commonly noted in clinical practice to have started or stopped certain medications in the 1–2 years before their clinical diagnosis, due to the development of new symptoms or conditions such as hyperglycemia, venous thromboembolism, abdominal discomfort, and depression. Nevertheless, few studies have characterized the value of these medication changes in defining those at risk of a subsequent pancreatic cancer diagnosis.

To examine medication changes in the two-year pre-diagnosis time period, we investigated longitudinal, prospectively collected assessments of medication use among up to 148,973 participants from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS, a large prospective cohort of US female nurses) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS, a large prospective cohort of US male health professionals), to determine the association of medication change patterns with subsequent pancreatic cancer development. Specifically, we hypothesized that starting antidiabetic, anticoagulant, antacid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), or antidepressant medications and stopping antihypertensive medications would be associated with an increased likelihood of pancreatic cancer development in the next 2 years.

### Protein biomarkers and alternatively methylated cell-free DNA detect early stage pancreatic cancer [^113StDQ2]. Gut (2024). High credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. This high mortality results largely from more than 80% of patients presenting with locally advanced or metastatic disease that is incurable. In contrast, patients who present with earlier-stage disease can be treated with multimodal therapy and achieve long-term survival.

Early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains difficult. The disease causes few early warning symptoms and has few risk factors with high penetrance. Thus far, patients with a strong family history or genetic predisposition and those with pancreatic cystic lesions have been the primary focus of early detection programs. These programs predominantly use abdominal MRI and endoscopic ultrasound to serially evaluate the pancreas for cancer development. Blood-based early detection approaches may allow for the identification of those patients who would most benefit from imaging or endoscopic procedures. Circulating carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9) is commonly used as a marker of treatment response in PDAC, but it may also have utility as an 'anchor' marker on which to add further blood-based technologies for early cancer detection. Thus, we sought to develop a panel of circulating markers that included CA19–9 and could be used in a screening setting to assess asymptomatic individuals for pancreatic cancer.

### Targeting early diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer among the diabetic population: A comprehensive review of biomarker screening strategies [^114oKe8p]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, affects approximately 537 million individuals globally, with about 6.7 million deaths attributable to diabetes in 2021, predominantly occurring in low- and middle-income countries. The relationship between diabetes mellitus and pancreatic cancer has attracted significant research attention due to their intricate, bidirectional pathogenic interactions, which remain incompletely understood. The primary objective of this review is to systematically analyze and synthesize existing evidence regarding the association between diabetes mellitus and pancreatic cancer. Specifically, the review aims to evaluate and highlight promising early biomarker-based screening strategies tailored for diabetic populations. By addressing these points, we seek to identify novel and practical approaches for the early detection and clinical management of pancreatic cancer, ultimately improving survival outcomes among this high-risk patient group.

### Validation of biomarkers for early detection of pancreatic cancer: Summary of the Alliance of Pancreatic Cancer Consortia for Biomarkers for Early Detection workshop [^115bLcEk]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in the United States, and the 5-year relative survival for patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer is less than 10%. Early intervention is the key to a better survival outcome. Currently, there are no biomarkers that can reliably detect pancreatic cancer at an early stage or identify precursors destined to progress to malignancy.

The National Cancer Institute, in partnership with the Kenner Family Research Fund and the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, convened a Data Jamboree on Biomarkers workshop on December 5, 2016, to discuss and evaluate existing or newly developed biomarkers and imaging methods for early detection of pancreatic cancer. The primary goal of this workshop was to determine if there are any promising biomarkers for early detection of pancreatic cancer ready for clinical validation.

The Alliance of Pancreatic Cancer Consortia for Biomarkers for Early Detection, formed under the auspices of this workshop, will provide the common platform and resources necessary for validation. Although none of the biomarkers evaluated seemed ready for a large-scale biomarker validation trial, several had sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to warrant additional research, especially if combined with other biomarkers to form a panel.

### Symptoms and patient factors associated with diagnostic intervals for pancreatic cancer (SYMPTOM pancreatic study): a prospective cohort study [^116dmJDJ]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is the tenth most common cancer in the UK, accounting for 3% of all new cancers in 2012. Incidence of the disease is rising, reflecting both an aging population and an increased prevalence of obesity and diabetes. No effective screening methods are yet available, and most cases of pancreatic cancer have already invaded local structures or metastasized by the time patients are diagnosed. Survival from pancreatic cancer is very poor, with less than 5% of patients alive at 1 year. Despite advances in treatment and outcomes, a 10-year survival of 1% has remained unchanged for more than 40 years.

The diagnostic pathway for pancreatic cancer comprises a series of stages or intervals that each contribute to the overall period of time between onset of symptoms and initiation of treatment. The total diagnostic interval comprises the patient interval (from onset of first symptom to first health-care consultation) and the health system interval (from first consultation via referral and investigations to diagnosis and initiation of treatment); shorter patient and health system intervals are associated with longer survival. In the past few years, reports have suggested that both intervals are longer for pancreatic cancer than for other common cancers, such as lung or urological cancer.

- **Research in context**:

- **Evidence before this study**: We searched PubMed with the MeSH terms "symptom", "diagnosis", "pancreatic cancer", and "interval" for all reports published before Dec 31, 2015. Little evidence exists for symptomatic presentations preceding a pancreatic cancer diagnosis.

### Levels of the cancer biomarker CA 19–9 are associated with thrombin generation in plasma from treatment-naïve pancreatic cancer patients [^113NU5Py]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Low credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with a hypercoagulable state and high mortality. Increases in the plasma levels of tumor marker carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19–9 are used in diagnosis and follow-up, but have also been reported to precede venous thromboembolism (VTE).

- **Aims**: We examined the association between CA 19–9 and thrombin generation (TG) in plasma from PDAC patients, as well as their association with coagulation biomarkers prior to pancreatic surgery. In addition, we determined the effect of commercial sources of CA 19–9 on TG.

- **Methods**: We collected plasma from 58 treatment-naïve PDAC patients without any signs of VTE. We measured levels of CA 19–9, FVIII, fibrinogen, D-dimer, antithrombin, and extracellular vesicle (EV) tissue factor (TF) activity and TG using a Calibrated Automated Thrombogram (CAT). The effect of different commercial sources of CA 19–9 on TG in Standard Human Plasma (SHP) was also studied.

- **Results**: Patient plasma samples were divided into four preoperative groups based on the level of CA 19–9: none, 1000 U/mL. CA 19–9 levels were associated with several of the TG parameters, including endogenous thrombin potential, peak, and time to peak. CA 19–9 did not associate with any of the coagulation biomarkers. Spiking of SHP with CA 19–9 increased TG, but this was decreased by an anti-TF antibody.

- **Conclusions**: CA 19–9 was associated with TG in patients prior to any pancreatic cancer treatments or signs of VTE. Some commercial sources of CA 19–9 enhanced TG in SHP seemingly due to their composition.

### Temporality of body mass index, blood tests, comorbidities and medication use as early markers for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC): a nested case-control study [^115LXiRh]. Gut (2023). High credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common form of pancreatic malignancy and is associated with a nearly universally poor prognosis, mainly due to late-stage diagnosis. Currently, there is no screening program, and early detection based on symptoms is challenging because earlier stages of the disease often present with vague or no symptoms.

Understanding the symptom profiles of pancreatic cancer provides an opportunity for earlier diagnosis. However, there is a need to robustly identify clinical and biochemical factor associations to inform the identification of higher-risk subpopulations for earlier intervention with imaging or recruitment to screening studies.

An earlier small study suggested that fasting blood glucose levels were significantly elevated beginning three years prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis, and BMI significantly decreased beginning one year prior. However, this study was limited by its relatively small sample size, with most patients having only one observation up to 12 months before diagnosis, which does not provide a robust assessment for longer time trends. Furthermore, evidence on other commonly used blood tests, such as liver markers and blood counts, and their temporal associations with pancreatic cancer remains limited. Additionally, some research has identified chronic pancreatitis, prior cancers, type 2 diabetes (T2D) mellitus, and antidiabetic medications as being associated with increased risk of PDAC diagnosis, but there are limited studies on their temporal trends.

Nonetheless, although the association…

### Early detection of pancreatic cancer: Current state and future opportunities [^1156Vvxa]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer death in the United States, a lethal disease lacking a screening strategy. Although diagnosis at an early stage is associated with improved survival, clinical detection of PDAC typically occurs at an advanced symptomatic stage when the best therapies have limited impact on survival.

Recent years have challenged this status quo with the identification of novel risk factors, molecular markers of early-stage disease, and innovations in pancreatic imaging. There is now expert consensus that screening may be pursued in a cohort of individuals with an increased likelihood of developing PDAC based on genetic and familial risk.

The review summarizes the known risk factors of PDAC, knowledge, and recent observations pertinent to early detection of PDAC in these risk groups and outlines future approaches that will potentially advance the field.

### Molecular pathogenesis and targeted therapy of pancreatic cancer [^111RLnRx]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

The accumulation of multiple genetic and/or epigenetic abnormalities is required for the generation and progression of cancers, and the survival of cancer cells might depend on addiction to these abnormalities. Disruption of such dependency on the abnormal molecules should cause cancer cell death, underpinning the concept of oncogene addiction, which is the rationale for molecular targeted therapy.

Pancreatic cancer, particularly pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, is one of the most lethal malignancies in humans and remains a challenging problem in targeted therapy compared to other malignancies such as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. This review summarizes the molecular pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer, focusing on recent studies of driver mutations, including chromatin remodeling factors, and promising concepts like "cancer stemness" and "stromal niche" for the strategy of novel targeted therapy.

### Locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline [^113iAa6Q]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). High credibility.

### Screening for pancreatic cancer: Why, how, and who [^116fTtHQ]. Annals of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer mortality in the United States, with 5-year survival rates for patients with resectable tumors ranging from 15% to 20%. However, most patients present with distant metastases, are not resectable, and have a 5-year survival rate close to 0%. This demonstrates a need for improved screening to identify pancreatic cancer while the tumor is still localized and amenable to surgical resection.

Studies of patients with pancreatic tumors incidentally diagnosed demonstrate longer median survival than tumors discovered only when the patient is symptomatic, suggesting that early detection may improve outcomes. Recent evidence from genomic sequencing indicates a 15-year interval for the genetic progression of pancreatic cancer from initiation to the metastatic stage, suggesting a sufficient window for early detection. Still, many challenges remain in implementing effective screening.

Early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer relies on developing screening methodologies with highly sensitive and specific biomarkers and imaging modalities. It also depends on a better understanding of the risk factors and natural history of the disease to accurately identify high-risk groups that would be best served by screening. This review summarizes our understanding of the biology of pancreatic cancer relevant to methods available for screening. At this time, given the lack of proven benefit in this disease, screening efforts should probably be undertaken in the context of prospective trials.

### Diagnostic performance of a tumor marker gene test to personalize serum CA19–9 reference ranges [^11548xrn]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). High credibility.

A highly accurate blood test could improve the early detection of pancreatic cancer. One step towards this goal is improving the diagnostic performance of CA19–9. Common inactivating variants in fucosyltransferase (FUT) genes involved in the CA19–9 synthetic pathway influence its levels in the circulation. These variants can be used to define an individual's functional FUT group, reflecting their predicted relative level of CA19–9 synthesis. We introduced a "CA19–9 tumor marker gene test" in the Johns Hopkins Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory as a companion test to serum CA19–9 and established reference ranges for each functional FUT group. Using a case/control design involving patients with resectable-stage pancreatic cancer and controls from the Cancer of the Pancreas Screening study, we find that using the tumor marker gene test to assign individuals their appropriate CA19–9 reference range significantly improved diagnostic performance.

### Pancreatic cancer insights: Optimization of the diagnostic capacity of tumor biomarkers [^112upFaR]. Laboratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the deadliest malignancies. The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of the carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA19.9)/carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) ratio as a diagnostic tool.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective observational study conducted from 2015 to 2019. It included laboratory requests with increased CA19.9 and CEA levels but no previous neoplasia. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed for the CA19.9/CEA ratio, as well as for CA19.9 and CEA alone, for the detection of PC. Cutoff values for all strategies were selected separately and in combination.

- **Results**: A total of 373 individuals were included. The area under the curve (AUC) for CA19.9/CEA was 0.872, whereas the AUC for CA19.9 alone was 0.847 and for CEA was 0.554. Cutoff values with the greatest diagnostic power were identified as CA19.9/CEA > 40, CA19.9 > 1130 U/mL, and CEA > 14.5 U/mL. The combination of CA19.9/CEA > 40 with CA19.9 > 550 U/mL maximized the diagnostic accuracy for PC.

- **Conclusion**: Our results highlight the relevance of the measurement of serum CA19.9 and CEA in the detection of PC.

### Metastatic pancreatic cancer: ASCO guideline update [^116ZJzP1]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pancreatic cancer, the ASCO 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining early testing for actionable genomic alterations in patients who are potential candidates for additional treatment after first-line therapy. Obtain both germline and tumor (somatic) testing, including for MSI/MMR deficiency, BRCA mutations (excluding variants of unknown significance), and NTRK gene fusions. The results of these tests can lead to therapies such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy, TRK fusion inhibitors, and clinical trials of targeted therapies. Genomic testing should be part of the initial assessment to ensure that the results are available at the time of treatment decision after first-line therapy where applicable.

### Metabolic syndrome is linked to the incidence of pancreatic cancer [^111StjZw]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Cancers and cardiovascular diseases have placed a significant burden on both individual patients and national economies around the world. Cancer has been gradually and eventually managed through early detection and prompt diagnosis using novel imaging techniques or biomarkers, as well as rapid progress in innovative medical and surgical treatments. However, pancreatic cancer has been recognized as the most lethal of all cancers because the incidence and mortality rates are nearly similar, suggesting that the time of prevention and diagnosis may be too late for comprehensive treatment.

Every year, more than 40,000 people in Japan are newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and effectively preventing and early diagnosing pancreatic cancer is extremely difficult. This results in delayed diagnosis and the inoperability and incurability of this cancer. Pancreatic cancer, one of the most common tumors, has now become a leading cause of death among all cancers, with an estimated mortality rate approaching 100%. Indeed, in the United States, pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death, and it is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in Japan.

Pancreatic cancer is reportedly linked to smoking, type II diabetes mellitus (T2D), and chronic pancreatitis, all of which may impair pancreatic function. These factors affect the production of digestive enzymes such as amylase, lipase, and trypsin, as well as hormones like insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin. The first three factors are related to food digestion, while the latter three are responsible for hormonal regulation.

### MicroRNA biomarkers in whole blood for detection of pancreatic cancer [^116rXFyM]. JAMA (2014). Low credibility.

Biomarkers for the early diagnosis of patients with pancreatic cancer are needed to improve prognosis.

- **Objectives**: To describe differences in microRNA expression in whole blood between patients with pancreatic cancer, chronic pancreatitis, and healthy participants, and to identify panels of microRNAs for use in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer compared with the cancer antigen 19–9 (CA19–9).

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A case-control study that included 409 patients with pancreatic cancer and 25 with chronic pancreatitis who had been included prospectively in the Danish BIOPAC (Biomarkers in Patients with Pancreatic Cancer) study (July 2008–October 2012), plus 312 blood donors as healthy participants. The microRNA expressions in pretreatment whole blood RNA samples were collected and analyzed in three randomly determined subcohorts: discovery cohort (143 patients with pancreatic cancer, 18 patients with chronic pancreatitis, and 69 healthy participants), training cohort (180 patients with pancreatic cancer, 1 patient with chronic pancreatitis, and 199 healthy participants), and validation cohort (86 patients with pancreatic cancer, 7 patients with chronic pancreatitis, and 44 healthy participants). A total of 754 microRNAs were screened in the discovery cohort, 38 microRNAs in the training cohort, and 13 microRNAs in the validation cohort.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Identification of microRNA panels (classifiers) for diagnosing pancreatic cancer.

Results from the discovery cohort demonstrated that 38 microRNAs in whole blood were significantly dysregulated in patients with pancreatic cancer.

### The clinical utility of biomarkers in the management of pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^1146wzvK]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, and survival rates have seen minimal improvement over the past few decades. Although results are poor, surgical resection is considered the only curative therapeutic intervention for pancreatic cancer, thereby emphasizing the significance of effective diagnostic and prognostic tools to improve outcomes. As such, biomarkers play a promising role in the development of personalized treatments for patients with pancreatic cancer. Prognostic biomarkers, such as serum carbohydrate antigen 19–9 in particular, as well as cancer stem cell markers, provide valuable insight into the biological processes of an individual and their likely course of disease. This, consequently, allows for the assessment of optimal therapeutic intervention.

- **Predictive biomarkers**: Efforts target putative predictive biomarkers such as BRCA2, PALB2, and SPARC to determine their influence on tumor response to targeted therapies. As research progresses, more evidence will provide clinicians with guidelines on the utilization of biomarkers to accurately stage and tailor personalized treatment to the needs of specific patients with pancreatic cancer.

### Salivary transcriptomic biomarkers for detection of resectable pancreatic cancer [^11198qxq]. Gastroenterology (2010). High credibility.

The lack of detection technology for early pancreatic cancer invariably leads to a typical clinical presentation of incurable disease at initial diagnosis. New strategies and biomarkers for early detection are sorely needed. In this study, we conducted a prospective sample collection and retrospective blinded validation to evaluate the performance and translational utilities of salivary transcriptomic biomarkers for the noninvasive detection of resectable pancreatic cancer.

- **Methods**: The Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was used to profile transcriptomes and discover altered gene expression in saliva supernatant. Biomarkers discovered from the microarray study were subjected to clinical validation using an independent sample set of 30 pancreatic cancer patients, 30 chronic pancreatitis patients, and 30 healthy controls.

- **Results**: Twelve messenger RNA biomarkers were discovered and validated. The logistic regression model, with the combination of 4 messenger RNA biomarkers (KRAS, MBD3L2, ACRV1, and DPM1), could differentiate pancreatic cancer patients from non-cancer subjects (chronic pancreatitis and healthy controls), yielding a receiver operating characteristic plot, area under the curve value of 0.971 with 90.0% sensitivity and 95.0% specificity.

- **Conclusions**: The salivary biomarkers possess discriminatory power for the detection of resectable pancreatic cancer, with high specificity and sensitivity. This report provides proof of concept of salivary biomarkers for the noninvasive detection of a systemic cancer.

### Markers of pancreatic cancer: Working toward early detection [^111HAFmA]. Clinical Cancer Research (2011). Low credibility.

Because early detection of pancreatic cancer is the best way to cure this disease, investigators continue to try to identify accurate markers of early pancreatic cancer. Since early-stage pancreatic cancer is generally asymptomatic, the only reliable way to detect it is by targeting individuals at increased risk for pancreatic screening.

### Early detection of pancreatic cancer: The role of industry in the development of biomarkers [^113vipXy]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

Niven R. Narain outlined critical unmet needs in diagnostics, prognostics, and theranostics for the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer. Clinicians need biomarkers to stratify treatment decisions prior to surgery, chemotherapy, or clinical trial engagement. Biomarker research must consider factors beyond laboratory validation to determine the optimal pharmaceutical doses, minimizing toxicity. He emphasized that cancer involves more than just tumors. Beyond tumor genetics and molecular profiling, the tumor microenvironment and systems microenvironment must also play a fundamental role. The most sustainable biomarkers may derive from the environment around the cancer, and capturing that information is essential.

The important question for biomarker researchers is how wide and how deep to investigate? Just because something is expressed in biology does not mean it drives a substantive change in function. Project Survival performs an integrated phenomic assessment on every tissue and biofluid sample, capturing the full biological and physiological narrative of the patient at that given time. The expression data must be correlated with functional or phenotypic data to appreciate the complexity of underlying clinical phenotypes. Narain emphasized that precision medicine involves understanding clinical phenotypes at all stages of cancer. Deep molecular profiling provides a comprehensive understanding of a patient's health, which allows for informed decision-making regarding treatment strategies.

### Early detection of pancreatic cancer in high-risk individuals: Where do we go from here [^113s8Y2E]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease that is commonly diagnosed at a late stage. Screening asymptomatic patients is necessary for early detection, but this is not currently recommended in the general population. As demonstrated in the study, an important number of patients at increased risk can be diagnosed using either MRI/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or endoscopic ultrasound. Further collaborative efforts are needed to define the ideal population for testing and refine the approach to pancreatic cancer surveillance.

### Early detection of sporadic pancreatic cancer: Summative review [^114SngAt]. Pancreas (2015). Low credibility.

Clearly, the most logical time to identify pancreatic cancer (PC) is prior to invasion. Given the lack of effective systemic therapies, developing biomarkers that could identify advanced precancerous lesions such as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN-3), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) with high-grade dysplasia, or carcinoma in situ will have the greatest impact on survival.

- **Biomarkers for early detection of pancreatic cancer**: Currently, there is a great need for the development of noninvasive but highly discriminatory biomarkers for early detection of PC. The first likely impact will be on patients for whom clinically suspected PC would be part of the differential diagnosis.

If a highly accurate and inexpensive biomarker were available, a simple blood test could be performed for patients with common, but nonspecific symptoms associated with PC. These symptoms include epigastric pain, pain with eating, weight loss, unexplained diarrhea, and elevated bilirubin. Currently, the median time for diagnosis of PC is 2 months after presentation to the care provider.

In part, this delay occurs because most clinicians do not want to order an expensive CT scan associated with radiation exposure for nonspecific symptoms, as the pretest probability remains relatively low. The hurdle to ordering the diagnostic test early in the assessment will be overcome if the test is highly accurate and inexpensive. By ordering such a test in the beginning stages of the diagnostic workup, the delay to diagnosis could be considerably decreased, potentially allowing for downstaging the disease.

### Resectability of presymptomatic pancreatic cancer and its relationship to onset of diabetes: A retrospective review of CT scans and fasting glucose values prior to diagnosis [^113pVWEQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

The timeline of progression of pancreatic cancer from resectable to unresectable disease is unknown. New-onset diabetes often occurs in pancreatic cancer, and it is unclear if the cancer is resectable at the onset of diabetes. We determined the resectability of pancreatic cancer on abdominal CT scans done prior to clinical diagnosis and correlated resectability with the onset of diabetes.

- **Methods**: All CT scans conducted at or before the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer were reviewed, and pancreatic changes were classified as normal, potentially resectable, or unresectable pancreatic cancer. Fasting blood glucose values obtained at and prior to diagnosis were available in 18 patients. The date of onset of diabetes and the interval between the onset of diabetes and the diagnosis of cancer were noted.

- **Results**: Thirty patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. Prior to diagnosis, 28 patients had 38 CT scans done at a median of 18 months (range 1–41 months) before cancer diagnosis. At cancer diagnosis, only 7 out of 30 patients could undergo margin-negative surgical resection. CT scans done six months or more prior to diagnosis showed either a normal pancreas (N = 20) or a resectable mass (N = 6); none had unresectable cancer. The mean interval between the onset of diabetes and the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer was 10 months (range 5–29 months). At the onset of diabetes, 3 patients had a normal pancreas, 6 had resectable, and 4 had unresectable pancreatic cancer.

- **Conclusions**: Pancreatic cancer is frequently undetectable or resectable on CT scans conducted six months or more prior to clinical diagnosis. At the onset of diabetes, pancreatic cancer is often resectable.
