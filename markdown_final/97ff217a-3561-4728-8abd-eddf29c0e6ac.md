## Question

Temp rise during ovulation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the basal body temperature (BBT) rise during ovulation, specifically its mechanism, timing, magnitude, variability, and clinical implications for fertility assessment and family planning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the hormonal physiology that drives the temperature shift. Then, I should verify the timing relative to ovulation and the LH surge. Next, I will quantify the magnitude and variability of the rise. After that, I need to examine factors that modify BBT, including age, environment, and measurement site. Then, I should review the clinical utility and limitations of BBT for ovulation detection and luteal phase assessment. Finally, I will integrate this into practical guidance for patients and clinicians, including alternatives like LH kits and cervical mucus, and close with a concise synthesis of the key points.

> Let me first confirm the physiological basis. The biphasic BBT pattern is fundamentally driven by progesterone's thermogenic effect on the hypothalamic thermoregulatory set point. After ovulation, the corpus luteum secretes progesterone, which raises core body temperature by roughly 0.3–0.5°C and sustains that elevation through the luteal phase, whereas estradiol in the follicular phase tends to lower temperature via vasodilation and heat dissipation, contributing to the pre-ovulatory nadir [^116f6UUc] [^113FLYY7] [^1176jCH4].

> Wait, let me verify the timing relative to ovulation itself. The BBT rise is a post-ovulatory marker. Ovulation typically occurs within 24–36 hours after the onset of the LH surge, and the temperature shift lags the LH surge by about 1–2 days, so the rise is not a real-time predictor of ovulation but rather a retrospective confirmation that ovulation has occurred, which is why the fertile window must be targeted before the temperature rise is evident [^113FLYY7] [^114rBQm3] [^1157bkNb].

> I should double-check the magnitude and variability. Most studies describe a 0.2–0.5°C rise, with a commonly cited average around 0.3–0.4°C. However, individual variability is substantial, and the rise can be smaller or larger depending on measurement fidelity, age, and environmental factors, so clinicians should avoid overinterpreting small or noisy shifts and instead look for a sustained, biphasic pattern across the cycle [^113FLYY7] [^115TQox9] [^117UV3to].

> Hold on, I should review modifiers that can confound interpretation. Age influences luteal phase temperature and the magnitude of the BBT rise, with luteal temperatures peaking in the late 20s and declining after the early 40s. Environmental temperature shows a weak but consistent association with both follicular and luteal BBT, with higher ambient temperatures linked to higher BBT. Measurement site matters too, as wrist skin temperature shows the same biphasic pattern but with greater variance than core or oral BBT, which can complicate algorithmic detection from wearables [^115TQox9] [^116AjyCw] [^117XX62D] [^1176jCH4].

> Next, I should review clinical utility and limitations. BBT charting is inexpensive and noninvasive and can confirm ovulatory cycles via a biphasic pattern, but it is not recommended as a primary ovulation detection tool due to poor accuracy, user burden, and the fact that the rise occurs after the fertile window. Professional guidance emphasizes using BBT as an adjunct, if at all, and prioritizing urinary LH testing, midluteal progesterone, or ultrasound when precise ovulation timing is needed [^116B5Ztd] [^111vSBfM] [^116qqXar].

> Let me consider luteal phase assessment specifically. A sustained temperature elevation for at least 10–12 days supports adequate luteal function, whereas shorter luteal phases may suggest luteal phase deficiency. However, BBT alone cannot reliably diagnose luteal phase deficiency, and clinical decisions should integrate cycle history, progesterone levels, and, when appropriate, ultrasound rather than relying on temperature charts alone [^1161xoqG] [^116qYtov].

> I need to ensure practical guidance is clear. For patients trying to conceive, intercourse should be timed in the days leading up to ovulation, before the BBT rise, because the fertile window spans roughly the five days before ovulation through the day of ovulation. Urinary LH kits or symptothermal methods that include cervical mucus observation are more effective for prospectively identifying the fertile window than BBT alone, and randomized data suggest LH-based timed intercourse modestly improves pregnancy outcomes compared with no ovulation prediction [^1157bkNb] [^113TWW4d] [^116n5mKQ] [^112N8tmw].

> But wait, what about modern wearables and apps. Consumer devices that track peripheral temperature can detect the biphasic pattern, but accuracy varies and is sensitive to sleep, activity, and algorithm design; FDA-cleared and CE-marked temperature-based apps exist and may be discussed as part of person-centered contraceptive or conception care, yet users should be counseled on variability, privacy, and the need for consistent measurement conditions [^11324mkz] [^113Zm5Ra].

> Let me reconsider the key synthesis to ensure nothing is missing. The BBT rise is a progesterone-driven, post-ovulatory thermogenic shift of about 0.3–0.5°C that lags the LH surge by 1–2 days, confirming ovulation retrospectively. It is influenced by age and environment, shows interindividual variability, and is not a reliable standalone method for timing intercourse or diagnosing luteal phase deficiency, so clinicians should pair BBT with other markers or use LH kits, progesterone testing, or ultrasound when precision is required [^116f6UUc] [^113FLYY7] [^116B5Ztd].

---

The temperature rise during ovulation is a **0.3–0.5°C increase** [^116f6UUc] in basal body temperature (BBT) caused by progesterone after ovulation [^113FLYY7], not before. This shift typically occurs **1–2 days after ovulation** [^114rBQm3] and persists through the luteal phase, creating a biphasic pattern that confirms ovulation retrospectively [^116B5Ztd]. BBT is best measured at the same time each morning before any activity [^113FLYY7]; illness, poor sleep, alcohol, or inconsistent timing can distort readings [^112NTqeQ]. Because the rise follows ovulation, BBT is not useful for predicting the fertile window; **LH kits or cervical mucus** are better for timing intercourse [^112N8tmw] [^1157bkNb].

---

## Physiological basis of temperature rise

- **Hormonal regulation**: The rise is driven by progesterone [^116f6UUc], which increases the hypothalamic thermoregulatory set point, raising BBT by ~0.3–0.5°C [^117UV3to].

- **Timing**: The rise occurs 1–2 days after ovulation [^notfound], reflecting corpus luteum progesterone secretion [^113FLYY7].

- **Biphasic pattern**: BBT is lower in the follicular phase and higher in the luteal phase, forming a biphasic curve that retrospectively indicates ovulation [^116B5Ztd].

---

## Measurement and interpretation

- **Measurement method**: Take oral or vaginal temperature [^1176jCH4] at the same time each morning before any activity; consistent technique is critical [^113FLYY7].

- **Interpretation**: A sustained rise of 0.3–0.5°C for at least three days [^116f6UUc] confirms ovulation [^114V3pDt].

- **Limitations**: Illness, poor sleep, alcohol, or inconsistent timing can distort BBT and reduce reliability [^113FLYY7].

---

## Clinical significance

- **Ovulation confirmation**: BBT is a simple, inexpensive way to confirm ovulation retrospectively [^116B5Ztd].

- **Fertility awareness**: Helps identify the luteal phase and assess cycle regularity, but is not reliable for predicting the fertile window [^116B5Ztd].

- **Luteal phase defect**: A short luteal phase (< 10 days of elevated BBT) may suggest luteal phase defect [^1161xoqG].

---

## Factors influencing accuracy

| **Factor** | **Impact on bbt accuracy** |
|-|-|
| Illness or fever | Raises BBT, masking ovulatory rise [^116MkT9C] |
| Poor sleep | Alters BBT, reducing reliability [^113FLYY7] |
| Alcohol consumption | Elevates BBT, causing false rises [^113FLYY7] |
| Inconsistent measurement timing | Introduces variability, reducing accuracy [^113FLYY7] |
| Medications (e.g. NSAIDs) | May alter BBT, affecting interpretation [^notfound] |

---

## Alternative methods for ovulation detection

- **Urinary LH kits**: Detect the LH surge 24–36 hours before ovulation [^notfound]; more accurate for timing intercourse [^117AVUAt].

- **Cervical mucus monitoring**: Peak mucus (clear, stretchy) precedes ovulation and correlates with fertility [^1157bkNb].

- **Ultrasound**: Gold standard for follicle tracking and ovulation confirmation [^114SsEv4].

---

## Clinical applications and limitations

- **Clinical applications**: Useful for confirming ovulation, assessing luteal phase, and supporting fertility awareness counseling [^1161xoqG].

- **Limitations**: Retrospective, labor-intensive, and less accurate than LH kits or ultrasound; not recommended as a primary ovulation detection method [^116B5Ztd].

---

The BBT rise is a **post-ovulatory progesterone effect** [^116f6UUc] that confirms ovulation retrospectively; it is not useful for predicting the fertile window, for which LH kits or cervical mucus are preferred [^113iSMw1] [^1157bkNb].

### Follitropin (follistim AQ) [^113qtVnG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7	Ectopic Pregnancy

Since infertile women undergoing IVF or ICSI often have tubal abnormalities, the incidence of ectopic pregnancies might be increased. Early confirmation of an intrauterine pregnancy should be determined by β-hCG testing and transvaginal ultrasound.

5.8	Spontaneous Abortion

The risk of spontaneous abortions (miscarriage) is increased with gonadotropin products. However, causality has not been established. The increased risk may be a factor of the underlying infertility.

5.9	Ovarian Neoplasms

There have been infrequent reports of ovarian neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for controlled ovarian stimulation; however, a causal relationship has not been established.

5.10	Laboratory Tests

For Women:

In most instances, treatment with Follistim AQ Cartridge will result only in follicular growth and maturation. In order to complete the final phase of follicular maturation and to induce ovulation, hCG must be given following the administration of Follistim AQ Cartridge or when clinical assessment indicates that sufficient follicular maturation has occurred. The degree of follicular maturation and the timing of hCG administration can both be determined with the use of sonographic visualization of the ovaries and endometrial lining in conjunction with measurement of serum estradiol levels. The combination of transvaginal ultrasonography and measurement of serum estradiol levels is also useful for minimizing the risk of OHSS and multi-fetal gestations.

The clinical confirmation of ovulation is obtained by the following direct or indirect indices of progesterone production as well as sonographic evidence of ovulation.

Direct or indirect indices of progesterone production are:

Urinary or serum luteinizing hormone (LH) rise
A rise in basal body temperature
Increase in serum progesterone
Menstruation following the shift in basal body temperature

The following provide sonographic evidence of ovulation:

Collapsed follicle
Fluid in the cul-de-sac
Features consistent with corpus luteum formation

Sonographic evaluation of the early pregnancy is also important to rule out ectopic pregnancy.

For Men:

Clinical monitoring for spermatogenesis utilizes the following indirect or direct measures:

Serum testosterone level
Semen analysis

5.11 Follistim Pen

The Follistim Pen is intended only for use with Follistim AQ Cartridge. The Follistim Pen is not recommended for the blind or visually impaired without the assistance of an individual with good vision who is trained in the proper use of the injection device.

### Choriogonadotropin alfa (Ovidrel) [^113nKo96]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

General

Careful attention should be given to the diagnosis of infertility in candidates for hCG therapy. (see " Indications and Usage/ Selection of Patients "). After the exclusion of pre-existing conditions, elevations in ALT were found in 10 (3%) of 335 patients receiving Ovidrel®250 µg, 9 (10%) of 89 patients receiving Ovidrel®500 µg and in 16 (4.8%) of 328 patients receiving urinary-derived hCG. The elevations ranged up to 1.2 times the upper limit of normal. The clinical significance of these findings is not known.

Information for Patients

Prior to therapy with hCG, patients should be informed of the duration of treatment and monitoring of their condition that will be required. The risks of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and multiple births in women (see WARNINGS) and other possible adverse reactions (see " Adverse Reactions ") should also be discussed.

Laboratory Tests

In most instances, treatment of women with FSH results only in follicular recruitment and development. In the absence of an endogenous LH surge, hCG is given when monitoring of the patient indicates that sufficient follicular development has occurred. This may be estimated by ultrasound alone or in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels. The combination of both ultrasound and serum estradiol measurement are useful for monitoring the development of follicles, for timing of the ovulatory trigger, as well as for detecting ovarian enlargement and minimizing the risk of the Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome and multiple gestation. It is recommended that the number of growing follicles be confirmed using ultrasonography because serum estrogens do not give an indication of the size or number of follicles.

Human chorionic gonadotropins can crossreact in the radioimmunoassay of gonadotropins, especially luteinizing hormone. Each individual laboratory should establish the degree of crossreactivity with their gonadotropin assay. Physicians should make the laboratory aware of patients on hCG if gonadotropin levels are requested.

The clinical confirmation of ovulation, with the exception of pregnancy, is obtained by direct and indirect indices of progesterone production. The indices most generally used are as follows:

A rise in basal body temperature
Increase in serum progesterone and
Menstruation following a shift in basal body temperature

When used in conjunction with the indices of progesterone production, sonographic visualization of the ovaries will assist in determining if ovulation has occurred. Sonographic evidence of ovulation may include the following:

Fluid in the cul-de-sac
Ovarian stigmata
Collapsed follicle
Secretory endometrium

Accurate interpretation of the indices of ovulation require a physician who is experienced in the interpretation of these tests.

### Real-world menstrual cycle characteristics of more than 600, 000 menstrual cycles [^112ZEfrX]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In a clinical studythe FHP was observed in most cycles during the 12 h following ovulation. Because users of the app only measure temperature every 24 h, the FHP is expected to be detectable by the algorithm the day after ovulation. This means that ovulation itself is estimated to occur on the day of the last low temperature before the rise as suggested by Hilgers and Baileyand Mouzon et al. We define the EDO as the day before the FHP, the day of the last low temperature. According to convention the follicular phase ends on the EDO and the luteal phase starts the day after the EDO.

Another marker besides the BBT shift that has been used in clinical settings to estimate the day of ovulation is the day of luteal transition (DLT) defined as the ratio of oestrogen to progesterone falling below a critical threshold. The DLT ovulation detection algorithm has been designed to coincide with the peak of the LH surge. Although DLT is not intended for home use we mention it here because a study using it will be used as a source of reference data for validating the results of this study.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria

Women using the app who had registered between 1st September 2016 and 1st February 2019, had given their consent for the use of their data in research, were aged 18–45 at registration, had a BMI between 15 and 50 and had not been using hormonal contraception within the 12 months prior to registration were included. Users who stated at registration that they had a PCOS (hypothyroidism or endometriosis) or who had menopausal symptoms were excluded. They were required to have logged at least ten nondeviating temperatures.

Cycles were, included if they were recorded by a user with at least six complete cycles (with or without detected ovulation), the cycle length was between 10 and 90 days and nondeviating temperatures had been recorded on at least 50% of cycle days. 'Non-deviating temperatures' are defined as temperature measurements where the user has not selected the temperature to be abnormal (e.g. due to unexplained fever or high alcohol intake) when entering into the app. Cycles were excluded if a pregnancy was reported by the user or was otherwise flagged as possibly pregnant by the algorithm due to a significantly longer luteal phase than the user's average and sustained high temperatures. Figure 7 summarises the number of users and cycles at each step of the selection process.

### Reliability of ovulation tests in infertile women [^116qqXar]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the reliability of the most widely used clinical methods for predicting or confirming ovulation.

Methods

We monitored spontaneous cycles in 101 infertile women using basal body temperature (BBT), transvaginal ultrasound, a urinary stick system for LH surge, and three serum progesterone measurements in the midluteal phase. Transvaginal ultrasound monitoring was standard for ovulation detection and sensitivity. We calculated specificity and accuracy of each method compared with that standard.

Results

Follicular development and ultrasound evidence of ovulation were confirmed in 97 of 101 cycles (96%). Urinary LH surge preceded follicular rupture assessed by ultrasonography in all cycles and showed concordance with ultrasound-evidenced ovulation in 98 of 101 cases. The timing of BBT nadir had wide variability, and BBT and ultrasonography agreed in a similar percentage of cases (74%). Midluteal serum progesterone assessments showed ovulatory values in 93 subjects, and ovulation was concordant with ultrasonography in 90 subjects.

Conclusion

Urinary LH was accurate in predicting ovulation with ultrasonography as the standard for detection, but time varied widely. The nadir of BBT predicted ovulation poorly. The BBT chart was less accurate for confirming ovulation, whereas a single serum progesterone assessment in midluteal phase seemed as effective as repeated serum progesterone measures.

### Fertility awareness-based methods: another option for family planning [^1174q9Aa]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Modern fertility awareness-based methods (FABMs) of family planning have been offered as alternative methods of family planning. Billings Ovulation Method, the Creighton Model, and the Symptothermal Method are the more widely used FABMs and can be more narrowly defined as natural family planning. The first 2 methods are based on the examination of cervical secretions to assess fertility. The Symptothermal Method combines characteristics of cervical secretions, basal body temperature, and historical cycle data to determine fertility. FABMs also include the more recently developed Standard Days Method and TwoDays Method. All are distinct from the more traditional rhythm and basal body temperature methods alone. Although these older methods are not highly effective, modern FABMs have typical-use unintended pregnancy rates of 1% to 3% in both industrialized and nonindustrialized nations. Studies suggest that in the United States physician knowledge of FABMs is frequently incomplete. We review the available evidence about the effectiveness for preventing unintended pregnancy, prognostic social demographics of users of the methods, and social outcomes related to FABMs, all of which suggest that family physicians can offer modern FABMs as effective means of family planning. We also provide suggestions about useful educational and instructional resources for family physicians and their patients.

### Diagnosis and treatment of luteal phase deficiency: a committee opinion [^1161xoqG]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Menstrual cycle length — monitoring of basal body temperature (BBT) or urinary LH surge detection and monitoring of luteal length may substantiate normal ovulation and adequate luteal length, and the average luteal phase length is 14 days, with a normal variation of 11–17 days. A short luteal phase has been described as an interval of less than 9–11 days from the LH peak to the onset of menstrual flow. In noninfertile women, one study demonstrated that 13% of ovulatory menstrual cycles were associated with a luteal length < 10 days, and another study demonstrated that 18% of menstrual cycles had a luteal phase length < 12 days; although women with a shortened luteal phase in this latter study were less likely to conceive in the subsequent month, their overall fecundity at 12 months was not lower. Given these limitations, it may be reasonable to consider LPD when clinically indicated in the presence of a luteal phase of < 10 days, and the luteal phase length cannot be measured in cycles that result in pregnancy, but only in cycles that do not result in pregnancy.

### Assessment of menstrual health status and evolution through mobile apps for fertility awareness [^114kQQWB]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Estimation of ovulation day from fertility awareness body-signs

Previous studies have shown that the combination of BBT and cervical mucus variations were reliable, although not perfect, proxies for the detection of ovulation. We therefore decided to define a mathematical framework (HMM) to derive an estimate of the most likely day of ovulation with reliability indicators to reflect the uncertainty of conflicting or unexpected observation patterns (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figs 3, 4, 6, Methods). Missing temperature records have been found to alter the precision of the ovulation estimation to a slightly greater extent than missing cervical mucus reports (Supplementary Fig. 6D, Supplementary Material).

### Luteinizing hormone-independent rise of progesterone as the physiological trigger of the ovulatory gonadotropins surge in the human [^112Tjx9Z]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). Medium credibility.

The current ovarian cycle paradigm postulates that ovulation is triggered by a critically sustained elevation of estradiol. However, an in-depth look into the published data reveals considerable uncertainty about the relative roles of progesterone and estradiol in the ovulation process. This review provides compelling evidences that the role of estradiol in ovulation has been misinterpreted and that the true physiological trigger of ovulation is a luteinizing hormone-independent preovulatory progesterone surge in the circulation to approximately 0.5 ng/mL. Furthermore, the current work reconciles the ability of progesterone to trigger ovulation, with its well-established ability to block ovulation during pregnancy, or when administered in the form of a synthetic progestin in birth control formulations and with experimental data that estradiol benzoate triggers ovulation in the complete absence of progesterone.

### Effects of symptomatic status and the menstrual cycle on hot flash-related thermoregulatory parameters [^117Qon1U]. Menopause (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare core body temperature variation, sweating thresholds, and sweat rate in symptomatic and asymptomatic postmenopausal women and in eumenorrheic women in the follicular and luteal phases.

Design

Twelve symptomatic and 10 asymptomatic postmenopausal women and 12 eumenorrheic women were recorded in a temperature- and humidity-controlled laboratory during thermoneutral and warm conditions. Core body temperature variation was measured with an ingested radiotelemetry pill, basal body temperature with a rectal thermistor, skin temperature with four skin surface thermistors, and sweat rate with a capacitance hygrometer.

Results

Symptomatic women had significantly lower sweating thresholds and higher maximum sweat rates compared with all other women. These results could not be explained by differences in estrogen, progesterone, or body mass index.

Conclusions

Postmenopausal women with hot flashes are uniquely characterized by low sweating thresholds and high sweat rates, relative to asymptomatic and eumenorrheic women.

### Age-dependent and seasonal changes in menstrual cycle length and body temperature based on big data [^116f6UUc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Current understanding of menstrual cycle length and basal body temperature (BBT) is largely based on knowledge that was drawn from small descriptive studies performed in the 1950s. – However, women's eating habits, educational standards, and lifestyles have changed greatly in many countries since then, and the background against which these gynecologic findings were obtained has thus changed accordingly. In addition, cycle length and BBT may be affected by ethnic and social factors, and it is therefore not possible to make reliable comparisons among different countries.

Basal body temperature is controlled by the thermoregulatory center in the preoptic anterior hypothalamus and increases by 0.3–0.5°C after ovulation as a result of progesterone secretion from the ovaries. Basal body temperature can be measured easily to provide information on ovulation, which is, in turn, a useful index for pregnancy. Basal body temperature, as a deep-body temperature, is considered to remain stable and has recently been used as an indicator of healthy aging and longevity. Although BBT has been considered to be relatively unaffected by the environment, including external temperature, sunshine duration, and precipitation, the effect of regional environment and season on human health and longevity remain unknown. The existence of any seasonality in BBT, if present, would be expected to be very subtle, and its detection would thus require the analysis of a large sample.

### Timed intercourse for couples trying to conceive [^112tERfk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fertility problems are very common, as subfertility affects about 10% to 15% of couples trying to conceive. There are many factors that may impact a couple's ability to conceive and one of these may be incorrect timing of intercourse. Conception is only possible from approximately five days before up to several hours after ovulation. Therefore, to be effective, intercourse must take place during this fertile period. 'Timed intercourse' is the practice of prospectively identifying ovulation and, thus, the fertile period to increase the likelihood of conception. Whilst timed intercourse may increase conception rates and reduce unnecessary intervention and costs, there may be associated adverse aspects including time consumption and stress. Ovulation prediction methods used for timing intercourse include urinary hormone measurement (luteinizing hormone (LH), estrogen), tracking basal body temperatures, cervical mucus investigation, calendar charting and ultrasonography. This review considered the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the use of timed intercourse on positive pregnancy outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and risks of ovulation prediction methods for timing intercourse on conception in couples trying to conceive.

Search Methods

We searched the following sources to identify relevant randomised controlled trials, the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, LILACS, Web of Knowledge, the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Register Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. Furthermore, we manually searched the references of relevant articles. The search was not restricted by language or publication status. The last search was on 5 August 2014.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction or comparing different methods of ovulation prediction for timing intercourse against each other in couples trying to conceive.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and extracted the data. The primary review outcomes were cumulative live birth and adverse events (such as quality of life, depression and stress). Secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, pregnancy (clinical or self-reported pregnancy, not yet confirmed by ultrasound) and time to conception. We combined data to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) statistic. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the main comparisons using GRADE methods.

Main Results

We included five RCTs (2840 women or couples) comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction. Unfortunately one large study (n = 1453) reporting live birth and pregnancy had not published outcome data by randomised group and therefore could not be analysed. Consequently, four RCTs (n = 1387) were included in the meta-analysis. The evidence was of low to very low quality. Main limitations for downgrading the evidence included imprecision, lack of reporting clinically relevant outcomes and the high risk of publication bias. One study reported live birth, but the sample size was too small to draw any relevant conclusions on the effect of timed intercourse (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.41, 1 RCT, n = 17, very low quality). One study reported stress as an adverse event. There was no evidence of a difference in levels of stress (mean difference 1.98, 95 CI% -0.87 to 4.83, 1 RCT, n = 77, low level evidence). No other studies reported adverse events. Two studies reported clinical pregnancy. There was no evidence of a difference in clinical pregnancy rates (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.12, 2 RCTs, n = 177, I² = 0%, low level evidence). This suggested that if the chance of a clinical pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction is assumed to be 16%, the chance of success following timed intercourse would be between 9% and 33%. Four studies reported pregnancy rate (clinical or self-reported pregnancy). Timed intercourse was associated with higher pregnancy rates compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction in couples trying to conceive (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.71, 4 RCTs, n = 1387, I(2) = 0%, very low level evidence). This suggests that if the chance of a pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction is assumed to be 13%, the chance following timed intercourse would be between 14% and 23%. Subgroup analysis by duration of subfertility showed no difference in effect between couples trying to conceive for < 12 months versus couples trying for ≥ 12 months. One trial reported time to conception data and showed no evidence of a difference in time to conception.

Authors' Conclusions

There are insufficient data available to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of timed intercourse for the outcomes of live birth, adverse events and clinical pregnancy. Timed intercourse may improve pregnancy rates (clinical or self-reported pregnancy, not yet confirmed by ultrasound) compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction. The quality of this evidence is low to very low and therefore findings should be regarded with caution. There is a high risk of publication bias, as one large study remains unpublished 8 years after recruitment finished. Further research is required, reporting clinically relevant outcomes (live birth, clinical pregnancy rates and adverse effects), to determine if timed intercourse is safe and effective in couples trying to conceive.

### Real-world menstrual cycle characteristics of more than 600, 000 menstrual cycles [^112NTqeQ]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The main limitation of this study is that the study population is derived solely from users of the app who may not be representative of the wider population. In particular, only 8% of women in our study were obese compared to 15% of women in the general population. Only cycles with ovulation detected were included in the study. Of the 1.4 million cycles initially considered, ovulation was not detected in 665,603 (48%) of which most did not have sufficient BBT measurements to enable detection. Nevertheless, there is a bias caused by excluding these cycles. The incidence of ovulatory cycles recorded was lower among users with BMI of 30–35 (49% ovulatory) and 35–50 (45% ovulatory) compared to users with normal BMI (53% ovulatory). We also acknowledge the potential for human error in identification of the start of the cycle, the start and peak of the LH surge and the BBT rise based on self-reported bleeding, urinary LH test results and temperature measurements respectively. Study participants were able to purchase approved LH tests from the app developers, however, it is known that some users prefer to buy other commercially available tests between which there may be small variations in LH threshold values for a positive result. Measuring BBT and LH every 24 h limits the precision of phase length calculations.

Given the variations in cycle length and follicular phase length that we have described, especially for cycles outside the average range (25–30 days), an individualised approach to identification of the fertile window should be adopted. There are more than 100 fertility tracking apps freely available for download. Many of these apps claim to identify fertile days based on traditional assumptions about key menstrual cycle parameters such as regularity of cycle length, follicular phase length and luteal phase length. Apps giving predictions of fertile days based solely on an outdated understanding of ovulation day variation could completely miss the fertile window. It is, therefore, unsurprising that several studies have shown that calendar apps are not accurate in identifying the fertile window. – This study has demonstrated that such assumptions are invalid and that in reality there are significant variations in several key parameters in the general population.

### Choriogonadotropin alfa (pregnyl) [^112fQhFp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Induction of androgen secretion by hCG may cause fluid retention.

Use hCG with caution in patients with cardiac or renal disease, hypertension, epilepsy, migraine, or asthma.

Careful attention should be given to the diagnosis of infertility in candidates for hCG therapy (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE).

Evaluate patients for uncontrolled non-gonadal endocrinopathies (e.g., thyroid, adrenal or pituitary disorders) and provide the appropriate specific treatment.
Information for Patients

Prior to therapy with hCG, patients should be informed of the duration of treatment and monitoring of their condition that will be required. The risks of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome and multiple births in women (see WARNINGS) and other possible adverse reactions (see ADVERSE REACTIONS) should also be discussed.
Laboratory Tests

In most instances, treatment of women with FSH results only in follicular recruitment and development. In the absence of an endogenous LH surge, hCG is given when monitoring of the patient indicates that sufficient follicular development has occurred. This may be estimated by pelvic ultrasound alone or in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels. The combination of both pelvic ultrasound and serum estradiol measurement are useful for monitoring the development of follicles, for timing of the ovulatory trigger, as well as for detecting ovarian enlargement and minimizing the risk of the Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome and multiple gestation. Confirm the number of growing follicles using ultrasonography because serum estrogens do not give an indication of the size or number of follicles.

Human chorionic gonadotropins can crossreact in the radioimmunoassay of gonadotropins, especially luteinizing hormone. Each individual laboratory should establish the degree of crossreactivity with their gonadotropin assay. Make the laboratory aware that the patient is on hCG, if gonadotropin levels are requested.

The clinical confirmation of ovulation, with the exception of pregnancy, is obtained by direct and indirect indices of progesterone production as well as sonographic evidence of ovulation. The indices most generally used are as follows:

A rise in basal body temperature
Increase in serum progesterone and
Menstruation following a shift in basal body temperature
Urinary or serum luteinizing hormone (LH) rise

When used in conjunction with the indices of progesterone production, sonographic visualization of the ovaries will assist in determining if ovulation has occurred. Sonographic evidence of ovulation may include the following:

Fluid in the cul-de-sac
Collapsed follicle
Features consistent with corpus luteum formation (e.g., ovarian stigmata, secretory endometrium)

Accurate interpretation of the indices of ovulation requires a physician who is experienced in the interpretation of these tests.

Sonographic evaluation of the early pregnancy is also important to rule out ectopic pregnancy.

### The oestrous cycle stage affects mammary tumour sensitivity to chemotherapy [^111V46FJ]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

In addition to the overall immune landscape, the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis may also impact therapy response by inducing changes in body temperature, vasodilation or vasoconstriction. This adds an additional layer of factors within the tumour macroenvironment that can influence therapy response, because these changes may influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmodynamics of many therapeutics, including their absorption, distribution and metabolism. In line with this, we observed a decrease in intratumoural blood vessel diameter within mouse tumour samples taken in the dioestrus stage compared with those taken in the oestrus stage, suggesting potential vasoconstriction during the former. Moreover, during dioestrus, our data point to an increase in cells undergoing the EMT process, which has been extensively linked to chemoresistance –. Our findings, although shedding light on specific mechanisms, also underscore the multifaceted nature of chemotherapy sensitivity, and suggest that the menstrual cycle phase may, in addition to proliferation differences, influence chemosensitivity through a multitude of systemic and localized changes.

Although the physiology of the female body changes substantially during the menstrual cycle, therapies have not been extensively adapted to or optimized for these oscillating physiological changes. Our data warrant investigation in future clinical studies into the menstrual cycle as a factor that influences BC outcome. This is especially relevant if one considers the 'life years gained' that can be obtained from treatment at premenopausal age. This insight into the interaction between oestrous/menstrual cycle stages and therapeutic efficacy raises broader questions beyond BC: could there be similar interactions in other diseases influenced by hormonal changes or other physiological rhythms? This exploration might redefine how we approach the treatment of numerous conditions, emphasizing the importance of understanding the body's natural rhythms and their interplay with medical interventions. For optimization of therapy response, future research should delve deeper into the myriad of mechanisms contributing to NAC sensitivity during different oestrous/menstrual cycle stages. Moreover, prospective clinical trials will be essential to ascertain whether the timing of NAC in relation to the menstrual cycle stage can indeed increase chemotherapeutic efficacy in patients with BC, and potentially in other types of cancer.

### Pregnancy postponement and childlessness leads to chronic hypervascularity of the breasts and cancer risk [^111xgjqD]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Whereas the thermometric Chronobra measures temperatures to 1/20th°C accuracy on the breast surface, the important physio logical inference is that changes in temperature are presently considered to reflect changes in the mammary core tissue vascularity for the following reasons: first, the two breast cups of the instrument contain substantial external thermal insulation due to the thickness of the two layers of cellular fabric, the air gap between them and the standard T-shirt overclothing. This arrangement minimises outward heat flow from the breast to the environment so that after three-quarters of an hour of equlibration, seen as a levelling off of temperature in the recorded data, there is a minimal heat flow outwards and the recorded surface temperature measured reflects the temperature in the breast 'core'. This is the principal of the so-called deep body thermometer used in the assessment of hypothermia patients in the clinic. Second, occasionally, the 'core' breast temperatures recorded in practice are in excess of 37°C, i.e. blood heat. Third, whereas the dermal vascular plexuses will also exhibit a menstrual cycle of temperature due to the basal body temperature periodicity, nevertheless if the basal body temperature is subtracted from the Chronobra temperature, then a superposed 'breast specific' menstrual rhythm is revealed. This is documented; consistent is that the timing of this menstrual cycle is similar to that of anecdotal measurements of breast blood flow. Finally, the order of the menstrual cycle temperature changes, observed here on non-pregnant, non-lactating women, are consistent with vascular phenomena. We know of no other credible physiological source for such changes.

Fifty women of reproductive age and of parity history 0–5 participated in the trial. The field studies were carried out by a senior research nursing sister. Many controls were recruited from her friends, colleagues and acquaintances, also by the authors lecturing at church mothers groups, and 11 out of 50 of the subjects came from breast clinics. These latter subjects had clinically normal breasts but attended because of a family history, worry, etc. Bias from this subset was thought to be small because comparison with the remaining menstrual sets revealed only a small difference in averages. Some patients were a follow-up after fibroadenoma removal. Again their data appeared to be homogeneous with the balance and this condition is not documented as associated with increased risk. No cases with diffuse lumpy breasts (benign disease) were included here, i.e. the fibro-adenosis/fibrocystic disease complex.

### Understanding wrist skin temperature changes to hormone variations across the menstrual cycle [^111UGUp9]. Npj Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Consumer devices are increasingly used to monitor peripheral body temperature (PBT) for menstrual cycle tracking, but the link between PBT and hormone variations remains underexplored. This study examines the relationship between these variables with a focus on nightly wrist skin temperature (WST). Fifty participants provided physiological and self-reported data, including WST, daily step counts, glucose levels, hormone levels (E3G, LH), and diary entries. Results show a negative correlation between WST and hormone levels when E3G and LH are below average, and this trend was robust to demographics and self-reported stress. Increased variance between mid-cycle hormonal peaks and WST fluctuations may stem from differences between basal body temperature (BBT) and WST. This research suggests that algorithms reliant on body temperature for tracking hormonal changes or other aspects of the menstrual cycle may need to account for increased variance in WST trends if they are meant to be deployed on wearable devices.

### Real-world menstrual cycle characteristics of more than 600, 000 menstrual cycles [^113FLYY7]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Menstrual cycle data collection

Physiological data, including daily BBT (sublingual measurement), cycle by cycle dates of menstruation, and urinary LH test results, were collected prospectively from users of the Natural Cycles app. Participant characteristics including age and BMI were determined through mandatory in-app questions that must be completed during the sign-up process. Users are recommended to measure their temperature on 5 out of 7 days per week as soon as they wake up. They are requested to report whether a temperature measurement may be deviating for reasons such as disrupted sleep or alcohol consumption the night before. The algorithm also identifies deviating temperatures if the value is outside the range 35.0–37.5 °C.

All users in the study had consented at registration to the use of their data for the purposes of scientific research and could remove their consent at any time. This study was a subanalysis of data collected as part of a wider study protocol that was reviewed and approved by the regional ethics committee (EPN, Stockholm, diary number 2017/563–31).

Identification of ovulation day

A surge in LH is responsible for triggering follicle rupture. The start of the surge is approximately 28–48 h before follicle rupture and peak LH levels are reached 12 h before follicle rupture. After follicle rupture the corpus luteum forms, marking the start of the luteal phase, and secretes progesterone for the duration of the luteal phase in order to prime the endometrium for embryo implantation. Elevated levels of LH are detectable in blood and urine samples. At the onset of menses, marking the start of the follicular phase, the corpus luteum collapses and progesterone levels fall back to a low level until the next preovulatory increase. Progesterone has a thermogenic effect so its levels can be tracked by measuring BBT. BBT is at a relatively constant low level during the follicular phase, reaching its lowest level (the nadir) prior to ovulation, and then displays a distinct rise of 0.2–0.3 °C following ovulation. The higher level of BBT is sustained during the luteal phase before falling back to the lower level at the start of the next cycle.

### Real-world menstrual cycle characteristics of more than 600, 000 menstrual cycles [^114rBQm3]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

As the LH surge typically lasts for several daysthe probability of missing the surge if only testing every other day is relatively small. The app, therefore, recommends to only test every other day until close to the expected ovulation day. If one positive LH test has been entered, but no positive or negative LH test entry exists on the day immediately before, then the user is encouraged to test the following day to establish whether the positive test corresponds to the first or second day of the surge. If no such test is entered, the app assumes the first LH test marks the first day of the surge.

Cycles in which ovulation has been detected are hereafter referred to as ovulatory cycles. If ovulation has been detected in the current cycle then the algorithm selects the most suitable candidate day to call the First High Point (FHP) using a system of measurements based on comparisons of each temperature to the phase averages. This is the day on which the temperatures immediately before and after are most consistent with the follicular and luteal phase averages respectively. On average the FHP temperature is just below the cover line. In a previous study the FHP was 1.9 ± 1.4 days after the estimated start of the LH surge, similar to a comprehensive study of different markers of ovulation by Ecochard et al.where the FHP was most often 2 days after the LH peak. An evaluation of the timing of the FHP and the LH peak relative to the data of Ecochard et al (2001) is available in Supplementary materials.

### Fertility evaluation of infertile women: a committee opinion [^111vSBfM]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Infertility evaluation — ovulation assessment: Potential routine tests include luteal progesterone, ovulation predictor kits, and transvaginal ultrasound, and tests not routinely recommended include basal body temperature and endometrial biopsy. A menstrual history is adequate to establish an ovulatory menstrual pattern, and if the menstrual history is clearly abnormal, additional testing to determine the cause is indicated.

### Real-world menstrual cycle characteristics of more than 600, 000 menstrual cycles [^1118DHvi]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The use of apps that record detailed menstrual cycle data presents a new opportunity to study the menstrual cycle. The aim of this study is to describe menstrual cycle characteristics observed from a large database of cycles collected through an app and investigate associations of menstrual cycle characteristics with cycle length, age and body mass index (BMI). Menstrual cycle parameters, including menstruation, basal body temperature (BBT) and luteinising hormone (LH) tests as well as age and BMI were collected anonymously from real-world users of the Natural Cycles app. We analysed 612,613 ovulatory cycles with a mean length of 29.3 days from 124,648 users. The mean follicular phase length was 16.9 days (95% CI: 10–30) and mean luteal phase length was 12.4 days (95% CI: 7–17). Mean cycle length decreased by 0.18 days (95% CI: 0.17–0.18, R² = 0.99) and mean follicular phase length decreased by 0.19 days (95% CI: 0.19–0.20, R 2 = 0.99) per year of age from 25 to 45 years. Mean variation of cycle length per woman was 0.4 days or 14% higher in women with a BMI of over 35 relative to women with a BMI of 18.5–25. This analysis details variations in menstrual cycle characteristics that are not widely known yet have significant implications for health and well-being. Clinically, women who wish to plan a pregnancy need to have intercourse on their fertile days. In order to identify the fertile period it is important to track physiological parameters such as basal body temperature and not just cycle length.

### Optimizing natural fertility: a committee opinion [^1157bkNb]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Medium credibility.

Natural fertility — fertility-awareness methods for timing conception: Use of fertility-tracking methods to determine the fertile window and appropriately time intercourse is associated with an increased probability of conceiving in an ovulatory cycle. In the calendar method, the day of ovulation is set at cycle day 14 for a woman with a 28-day cycle, day 16 for a woman with a 30-day cycle, and the fertile window is the presumed day of ovulation and the 5 days prior (cycle days 9–14 for a 28-day cycle; 11–16 for a 30-day cycle). In app comparisons, a study of 949 volunteers found a maximum accuracy of 21% in predicting the day of ovulation. For ovulation detection devices that identify the midcycle urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, ovulation may occur any time within the 2 days thereafter and false-positive test results occur in approximately 7% of cycles, and use has been shown in a randomized controlled trial to decrease the time to pregnancy. Cervical mucus indicators show physiologic timing, with volume increasing over the 5 to 6 days preceding ovulation and peaking within 2 to 3 days before ovulation; in a retrospective cohort including 1,681 cycles, pregnancy rates were highest (approximately 38%) when intercourse occurred on the day of peak mucus (day 0) and appreciably lower (approximately 15% to 20%) on the day before or the day after the peak. A prospective study including 2,832 cycles observed that changes in cervical mucus characteristics correlated closely with basal body temperature and predicted the time of peak fertility more accurately than a menstrual calendar, and cervical mucus monitoring in retrospective cohort studies is associated with a higher probability of conceiving in a given cycle; one large study found that changes in cervical mucus across the fertile interval predicted the day-specific probability of conception at least as well or better than basal body temperature or urinary LH monitoring.

### A rise-to-threshold process for a relative-value decision [^112L3gpS]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

A rising signal in oviDNs

We imaged GCaMP7 (ref.) fluorescence from oviDNs during egg laying (Fig. 1g–l). We found that the oviDN ΔF/F signal dropped to its minimum value during ovulation and then peaked near the moment of the abdomen bend for egg deposition (Fig. 1g). In some cases we observed a monotonic rise (Fig. 1g, left and Supplementary Video 3) while in others the signal drifted up and down before reaching its peak (Fig. 1, right and Supplementary Video 4). The peak in the population-averaged ΔF/F signal was higher when we aligned the oviDN [Ca²⁺] signal with the moment when the abdomen finished bending to lay the egg (Fig. 1h, i) than when aligning with the moment that the egg became half-visible outside the fly (Extended Data Fig. 2l versus Extended Data Fig. 2m). On average, the [Ca 2+] signal dipped when ovulation started (Fig. 1j) and reached a minimum when the abdomen was longest (Extended Data Fig. 2i). The average [Ca 2+] signal then began to rise and returned to near baseline (ΔF/F = 0 in our normalization; Methods) when ovulation was completed (that is, the beginning of the search/delay period; Fig. 1k). We often observed in individual traces an upward inflection in the [Ca 2+] signal soon after the search/delay period began (Fig. 1g, right trace), which was evident as a small inflection in the mean trace (Fig. 1k, upward inflection just after time 0). The average [Ca 2+] signal peaked at around 3 s before completion of abdomen bend for egg deposition (Fig. 1l) — that is, approximately when the bend was initiated. The average [Ca 2+] signal returned to baseline after egg laying, while flies performed a second abdomen bend presumably to clean their ovipositor (Extended Data Fig. 2n).

### Fertility awareness-based methods for contraception: systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^1121cBgS]. Contraception (2005). Low credibility.

Context

Fertility awareness-based (FAB) methods of family planning estimate the fertile days of the menstrual cycle whether by observing fertility signs such as cervical secretions and basal body temperature or by monitoring cycle days. The efficacy and acceptability of these methods are unclear.

Methods

We retrieved and analyzed all randomized controlled trials that examined any FAB method used for contraception.

Results

Because of poor methods and reporting, pregnancy rates could not be determined. A trial in Colombia found similar numbers of pregnancies among women randomized to the ovulation and symptothermal methods, but a trial in Los Angeles observed more pregnancies in the group assigned to the ovulation method. In the two American trials, recruitment of participants was unexpectedly difficult. Continuation rates were poor.

Conclusion

Despite intensive training and ongoing support, most participants in these trials discontinued prematurely. The comparative efficacy of these methods remains unknown. However, with the ovulation and symptothermal methods, pregnancies appear to be common; method continuation rates are low.

### Understanding wrist skin temperature changes to hormone variations across the menstrual cycle [^114GQf4o]. Npj Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Statistics

To assess variations across the menstrual cycle and its phases, we present descriptive statistics for participant demographics and physiological signals in Table 1. We present these statistics both in aggregate and separated by menstrual cycle phase with χ² and repeated measures ANOVA test results to report notable differences. After visualizing nightly WST, E3G, and LH levels across temporally normalized cycles with LOESS smoothing, we then assess the impact of our collected data on nightly WST levels using linear mixed-effects models. We consider both linear and curvilinear relationshipsacross the entire menstrual cycle and stratified by menstrual cycle phase. We developed univariate models with potential confounders for every significant relationship identified, after which we constructed a multivariate model including all confounders with a statistically significant association with nightly WST in the univariate models. In all models, hormone levels were centered according to each person's average levels, and we incorporated an interaction between E3G and LH to assess their dependency. Random slopes and intercepts were utilized in all models to account for WST variance between and within participants. The results of our models were reported according to β -coefficients, 95% CI, and the significance of each relationship within models, considering a statistical significance threshold of p < 0.05. We applied Holm–Bonferroni adjustments to correct for multiple comparisons. We conclude our analysis by presenting box plots showing the timing differences between WST peaks and nadirs and mid-cycle hormone peaks.

### Understanding wrist skin temperature changes to hormone variations across the menstrual cycle [^1155GcvY]. Npj Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

The effect of hormone levels on nightly WST

As shown in Table 2, four out of the ten different models yielded statistically significant relationships between hormone levels and nightly WST. In the linear model, higher LH levels were associated with statistically significant decreases in nightly WST throughout the menstrual cycle (β = −0.002, p < 0.001, 95% confidence intervals (CI) [−0.004, −0.0009]). In the quadratic model, statistically significant linear (β = −0.006, p < 0.001, 95% CI [−0.009, −0.003]) and quadratic terms (β = 0.00004, p < 0.001, 95% CI [0.00001, 0.00006]) indicated that higher levels of LH predicted lower nightly WST. However, this effect was only present for below-average levels of LH as seen in Supplementary Fig. 1. The interaction between E3G and LH was also statistically significant (β = −0.00001, p < 0.001, 95% CI [−0.00002, −0.000005]), suggesting that LH has significant relationships with WST despite being strongly correlated to E3G. For both the ovulation and the luteal phases, the inclusion of quadratic terms for the hormone level predictors revealed significant relationships between hormone and nightly WST levels. During the luteal phase, both the linear and quadratic terms for LH levels were significant, where higher LH levels were associated with lower WST for below-average levels of LH as seen in Supplementary Fig. 2 (linear term: β = −0.008, p < 0.01, 95% CI [−0.01, −0.002]; quadratic term: β = 0.00006, p < 0.01, 95% CI [0.00002, 0.0001]). There was also a statistically significant relationship between E3G and WST in the ovulation phase for the quadratic term, with higher estrogen levels leading to lower WST (β = 0.000002, p < 0.05, 95% CI [0.0000002, 0.000003]). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 3, this relationship was only present for below-average E3G values.

### Optimizing natural fertility: a committee opinion [^113TWW4d]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Medium credibility.

Optimizing natural fertility — the fertile window and intercourse timing: For counseling purposes, the "fertile window" is best defined as the 6-day interval ending on the day of ovulation. In a study of 221 presumed fertile women, peak fecundability was observed when intercourse occurred within 2 days before ovulation. In another family planning study combining two cohorts (basal body temperature monitoring and analysis of urinary estrogen and progesterone metabolites), the likelihood of pregnancy was greatest when intercourse occurred the day before ovulation and started to decline when intercourse occurred on the day of ovulation.

### Deep learning model using continuous skin temperature data predicts labor onset [^111dtVMj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Body temperature reflects female mammalian reproductive status from adolescence through adult fertility and menopause, is non-invasive, and can be captured remotely. Body temperature monitoring is also of increasing interest in human pregnancy, as temperature change predicts parturition in a variety of species (Table 1). Historically, temperature measurements were most frequently taken from the "core", requiring probes inside the body. However, skin surface temperature has emerged as a practical metric for monitoring the female reproductive system via its influence on thermoregulation and autonomic tone. Human skin temperature has already been deemed useful in cases ranging from peri-ovulatory window prediction to conception and fever detection.

Table 1
Reported changes in body temperature (skin or core) among various mammalian species during pregnancy that have been observed prior to the onset of parturition

Interactions among the endocrine system and peripheral vasculature contribute to the utility of temperature in reproductive monitoring. Briefly, estradiol promotes peripheral vasodilation, and the addition of progesterone leads to peripheral vasoconstriction. Estradiol therefore allows body heat to escape, lowering both core and skin temperature in females. Progesterone, with or without the presence of estradiol, traps heat and increases metabolic rate, raising core and skin temperature. In addition, it was recently hypothesized that mechanisms linking thermoregulation and reproduction may originate centrally in the hypothalamus and ventral tegmental area. This phenomenon informs the basis for remote monitoring of the ovulatory cycle, with temperature tracing the trajectory of estrogen and progesterone production. Importantly, changes not only in temperature level but also in the cyclicity of temperature over hours and days (i.e. biological rhythms) indicate the peri-ovulatory period and pregnancy onset. These changes in temperature cyclicity mirror those in the levels and patterns of underlying reproductive hormones.

### Clomiphene citrtae (clomiphene citrate) [^111puZsH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

Clomiphene citrate is indicated for the treatment of ovulatory dysfunction in women desiring pregnancy. Impediments to achieving pregnancy must be excluded or adequately treated before beginning clomiphene citrate therapy. Those patients most likely to achieve success with clomiphene therapy include patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (see WARNINGS: Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome), amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome, psychogenic amenorrhea, post-oral-contraceptive amenorrhea, and certain cases of secondary amenorrhea of undetermined etiology.

Properly timed coitus in relationship to ovulation is important. A basal body temperature graph or other appropriate tests may help the patient and her physician determine if ovulation occurred. Once ovulation has been established, each course of clomiphene citrate should be started on or about the 5thday of the cycle. Long-term cyclic therapy is not recommended beyond a total of about six cycles (including three ovulatory cycles). (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and PRECAUTIONS .)

Clomiphene citrate is indicated only in patients with demonstrated ovulatory dysfunction who meet the conditions described below:

Patients who are not pregnant.
Patients without ovarian cysts. Clomiphene citrate should not be used in patients with ovarian enlargement except those with polycystic ovary syndrome. Pelvic examination is necessary prior to the first and each subsequent course of clomiphene citrate treatment.
Patients without abnormal vaginal bleeding. If abnormal vaginal bleeding is present, the patient should be carefully evaluated to ensure that neoplastic lesions are not present.
Patients with normal liver function.

### Real-world menstrual cycle characteristics of more than 600, 000 menstrual cycles [^116iJf2w]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The algorithm within the app detects ovulation retrospectively based on BBT measurements, menstrual cycle parameters and additionally on positive urinary LH tests. The algorithm can identify the BBT rise associated with ovulation in the presence of measurement errors, missing data and BBT rise occurring over a variable length of time. The risk of misidentification is reduced by excluding deviating temperatures. In order to determine that ovulation has occurred, as a minimum requirement the rolling average BBT (average of valid (nondeviating) temperatures over the last three calendar days) must be higher than both the woman's follicular phase average and her cover line (the average temperature across all data entries) and consistent with her luteal phase average. Figure 6 illustrates a typical biphasic temperature graph in an ongoing ovulatory cycle from a user in 'Prevent' mode. The horizontal grey line is the cover line. Comparisons are made using standard statistical techniques taking into account sample size and standard deviation. If ovulation is not detected in this initial test then more tests are performed with a rolling average over an increasing number of days up to 1 week. Ovulation detection is less likely if there are valid temperature measurements on fewer than about 50% of cycle days.

If a positive-LH test has been recorded, fewer high temperatures are required in order to detect ovulation since the LH test provides extra confidence that ovulation has occurred. The app recommends which days to take an LH test, considering the uncertainty of the ovulation day such that it minimises the number of LH tests used while ensuring that the user will not miss her surge. If the user is in Prevent mode, the algorithm only recommends to check for LH if the user had at least three cycles off hormonal contraception and the total ovulation uncertainty is less than ± 10 days. For users on Plan mode the app always recommends which days to check for LH since Plan users are in general more keen on finding the surge, even if it requires a large number of LH tests. The app will, however, only recommend to start checking LH 10 days prior to the earliest recorded ovulation day even if the total uncertainty is larger.

### Habitual hyperthermia: premenstrual "fever"… [^111zqR4C]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In 1932 under the title of Habitual Hyperthermia I reported the case of a woman aged 23 whose temperature had often been above the average normal for eighteen years. The "fever" led a succession of physicians to seek for infection or other causes of it and led to a long period of unnecessary, enforced semi-invalidism. On prolonged study the temperature was shown to have a regular relation to the menstrual period. It was normal or subnormal during the first half of the menstrual cycle, rose to levels higher than normal at the midperiod when the follicle matures and persisted at high levels until the day before the menses, when it dropped again. In the majority of women the rhythmic fluctuation of the temperature seldom exceeds the average normal level of 37 C. and is usually unnoticed unless careful registrations are made.

Participants were provided with paper copies of the data collection tool – the Menstrual Cycle Diary©(Diary©). This tool is organized to include the actual date and cycle day. Each woman was asked to make daily entries in the evening before bed. Menstrual cycle teaching was conducted by providing personalized written instructions as well as access to three online 10-minute videos.

All days within the single cycle with cramps scored as non-zero were counted to obtain the duration (including during flow and before the next flow). Data for cramp intensity were scored on a 0–4 scale, (0 = no cramps, 1 = minimal, 2 = moderate, 3 = moderately intense, 4 = very intense). The median cramp intensity was multiplied by the cramp duration (days per cycle) to obtain a Cramp Score.

Quantitative Basal Temperature© (QBT©) Analysis for Ovulation Documentation

Participants were provided with a digital thermometer with which they measured their daily first oral morning temperature. Temperatures were to be obtained first thing in the morning without any activity other than going to the washroom. The twice validated QBT©, was analyzed using the Mean Temperature Methodto determine if the cycle were normally ovulatory, had a short luteal phase or were anovulatory. Thus, the QBT©, method can also assess luteal phase length which is determined as the length of time with temperatures higher than the mean. In this method all the temperature records in a given cycle are averaged and the days of temperature above that average (if they remain consistently above until the day before flow) are considered the luteal phase length. On average, this temperature shift occurs approximately 24–36 hours following the LH surge. A cycle is also determined to be anovulatory if the QBT©, shows fewer than four days of temperatures above the cycle's temperature average. Throughout this research, a normally ovulatory cycle is defined by our QBT© method as having a luteal phase length of ≥ 10 days.

### Synchronised approach for intrauterine insemination in subfertile couples [^112r61dH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) should logically be performed around the moment of ovulation. Since spermatozoa and oocytes have only limited survival times correct timing is essential. As it is not known which technique of timing for IUI results in the best treatment outcome, we compared different techniques for timing IUI and different time intervals.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of different synchronisation methods in natural and stimulated cycles for IUI in subfertile couples.

Search Strategy

We searched for all publications which described randomised controlled trials of the timing of IUI. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), (1966 to March 2009), EMBASE (1974 to March 2009) and Science Direct (1966 to March 2009) electronic databases. Furthermore, we checked the reference lists of all obtained studies and performed a handsearch of conference abstracts.

Selection Criteria

Only truly randomised controlled trials comparing different timing methods for IUI were included. The following interventions were evaluated: detection of luteinising hormone (LH) in urine or blood, single test; human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration; combination of LH detection and hCG administration; basal body temperature chart; ultrasound detection of ovulation; gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist administration; or other timing methods.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the trials to be included according to the above mentioned criteria. We performed statistical analyses in accordance with the guidelines for statistical analysis developed by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Ten studies were included comparing urinary LH surge versus hCG injection; recombinant hCG versus urinary hCG; and hCG versus a GnRH agonist. One study compared the optimum time interval from hCG injection to IUI. The results of these studies showed no significant differences between different timing methods for IUI expressed as live birth rates: hCG versus LH surge (odds ratio (OR) 1.0, 95% CI 0.06 to 18); urinary hCG versus recombinant hCG (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.0); and hCG versus GnRH agonist (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.1). All the secondary outcomes analysed showed no significant differences between treatment groups.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence to advise one particular treatment option over another. The choice should be based on hospital facilities, convenience for the patient, medical staff, costs and drop-out levels. Since different time intervals between hCG and IUI did not result in different pregnancy rates, a more flexible approach might be allowed.

### Should home-based ovulation predictor kits be offered as an additional approach for fertility management for women and couples desiring pregnancy? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112N8tmw]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Methods

We conducted this systematic review in accordance to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Research question and inclusion criteria

Should home-based OPKs be made available as an additional approach for fertility management?

Population: Women attempting to become pregnant.

Intervention: Fertility management that includes home-based OPKs.

Comparison: Fertility management that does not include home-based OPKs (clinician-led assessment of ovulation only or no ovulation prediction).

Outcomes: (1) Time-to-pregnancy; (2) Pregnancy; (3) Live birth; (4) Stress/anxiety; (5) Social harms/adverse events (eg, device-related issues, coercion, violence [eg, intimate-partner violence, violence from family members or community members], psychosocial harm, self-harm, suicide, stigma, discrimination).

To be included in the effectiveness (PICO) review, an article had to (1) have a comparative study design examining women who managed their fertility using home-based OPKs to women who did not manage their fertility using home-based OPKs (ie, clinician-led assessment only or no ovulation prediction), (2) evaluate one or more of the outcomes listed above and (3) be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Inclusion was not restricted by location of the intervention. No language or publication date restrictions were used in the search.

OPKs could include both urine-based and serum-based kits and any modality (stick, monitor, digital, electronic slip that connects to a phone and so on). In order to focus on OPKs as a specific biomedical and biochemical intervention, the other behavioural and non-biochemical methods of ovulation prediction, such as calendar/standard day/fertility awareness methods, basal body temperature monitoring, Billings/cervical mucus monitoring methods, use of fertility beads and so on, were not included.

### Assessment of menstrual health status and evolution through mobile apps for fertility awareness [^1174Sxnt]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Observation description

For both app, observations of all standard cycles were summarized by cycle-day. Cycle days were either counted from the start of the cycle (first day of menstruation being day 1) or from the last day of that cycle (last day of the cycle before the next menstruation being day −1). For most tracked observations (except temperature — see below), the number of cycles for which that particular type of observation (for example "heavy" for the bleeding feature) on a specific day was divided by the total number of standard cycles for that app.

For the temperature, as the important feature to detect if ovulation has occurred is the relative rise in temperature, a reference temperature was computed for each cycle. This reference temperature was identified as the 0.25 percentile value of the temperature distribution in this cycle. Relative temperature measurements were then computed as the difference between the logged temperature and this reference temperature. The distribution (at a resolution of 0.05 °C/0.1 °F) of these relative temperatures was computed as well as the median value and the 10, 25, 75, and 90 percentile values.

### A daily temperature rhythm in the human brain predicts survival after brain injury [^113P7v2r]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

T Bo increases, and its overnight drop is blunted, in luteal versus follicular phase females. This menstrual variation predicts that T Bo is ∼0.4°C higher in the early luteal phase. For the first time, we report a parallel luteal-phase increase in global T Br by ∼0.36°C and of deep T Br by 0.82°C (95% CI 0.37–1.28, P = 0.0006). This may contribute to the reported variable sleep patterns and changes in cognition across different stages of the menstrual cycle. A thermogenic effect of progesterone is well-recognized and may involve direct stimulation of preoptic/anterior hypothalamic thermoregulatory neurons or the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Despite its postulated neuroprotective effects, large clinical trials have failed to show any benefit of progesterone therapy for TBI — one reason for this could be damping of the daily T Br rhythm (Fig. 4D). It is widely accepted that BMI positively correlates with T Bo as found here (Fig. 2), and this may have impacted our ability to detect a time of day variation in oral temperature. Since BMI was slightly higher in males relative to females in our healthy cohort, a difference in BMI cannot explain the higher T Br observed in luteal females and, notably, there was no relationship between BMI and T Br overall (Fig. 3B and Supplementary material). This supports our conclusion that T Br cannot be solely dependent on, nor predicted from, T Bo since brain heat removal also occurs through routes that are unaffected by adipose deposition. Undoubtedly, our results emphasize the importance of including healthy controls of both sexes when exploring human brain physiology.

### Understanding wrist skin temperature changes to hormone variations across the menstrual cycle [^114Xn4LC]. Npj Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Participant and cycle characteristics

A summary of participants' data is provided in Table 1, both collectively across the entire menstrual cycle and split across menstrual cycle phases. All physiological signals, as well as self-reported sleep issues, exhibited statistically significant variations across menstrual cycle phases according to χ² and repeated measures ANOVA tests.

Table 1
Participant demographics and raw physiological signals summarized

Participant demographics and raw physiological signals reported in aggregate and separated according to menstrual phase.

Significant results (✱ p < 0.05; ✱✱ p < 0.01; ✱✱✱ p < 0.001) of χ 2 and repeated measures ANOVA tests of symptom variance across cycle phases are also indicated.

Figure 1 shows the trends of nightly WST, daily E3G, and daily LH levels across the entire menstrual cycle. Participants' WST measurements peaked during the luteal phase (34.0 ± 1. 0 °C) and were lowest during the late follicular phase (33.7 ± 0. 8 °C). Furthermore, levels of E3G and LH were found to be highest during the ovulation phase (179.0 ± 141.7 ng/mL, 10.3 ± 16.4 mIU/mL), with the lowest E3G values being recorded during the menstrual phase (97.7 ± 73.3 ng/mL) and the lowest LH values being recorded during the luteal phase (4.8 ± 14.1 mIU/mL).

### Involving the male partner for interpreting the basal body temperature graph [^115EwAvZ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if the male cohabiting partner of a woman may serve as a control for exogenous influences on basal body temperature (BBT).

Methods

Twelve couples from the Atlanta area were enrolled for a total of 41 couple-cycles. Couples recorded their oral temperatures daily and used urinary test kits for luteinizing hormone to estimate the day of ovulation. The covariability between the pre-ovulatory temperature of the women and their partners was assessed. The gaps in the couples' temperatures (female temperature minus male temperature) were compared in the pre- and postovulatory phases.

Results

Considerable covariability was found between temperatures of partners in the pre-ovulatory phase (covariance parameter = 0.49; P < .001). The pre- and postovulatory temperature gaps for all couples were significantly different in size (P < .001). For all couple-cycles, the size of the mean postovulatory temperature gap was at least 0.3-degree Fahrenheit greater than the mean pre-ovulatory temperature gap.

Conclusion

Recording the BBT of women's partners may improve interpretation and accuracy of the BBT method. An increase in the size of a couple's temperature gap accompanies the transition from the pre- to the postovulatory phase. By this method, a given couple could determine their unique temperature gap indicating this transition.

### The FIGO ovulatory disorders classification system [^112kx7a3]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

A somewhat similar experience exists at the opposite end of the reproductive age spectrum, beyond the age of 45 years, as women enter what has been called the menopausal transition, where cycle length typically becomes more infrequent or irregular before culminating in amenorrhea as ovarian secretion of estradiol declines and ultimately ceases. However, this experience is perhaps even less orderly than that of the post‐menarcheal period, as there may be highly variable endocrine changes resulting in unpredictable impacts on menstrual function. Again, what is common, and often portrayed as "normal", can be highly disruptive, particularly when coupled with other symptoms.

Women who present with infertility may have accompanying menstrual symptoms typical of ovulatory disorders. However, women with cyclically normal onset of menstrual bleeding may not be ovulating, or at least not ovulating regularly, as the frequency of single‐cycle anovulation in the context of normal regular cycles is in the range of 3.7%–26.7%. Consequently, further evaluation beyond a detailed history will be necessary to identify those with ovulatory disorders.

The optimal way to assess for ovulation and, by extension, confirm ovulatory disorders may vary according to the clinical circumstance. The menstrual history of regular, predictable cycles between 24 and 38 days remains a helpful tool, and reflects the overall experience better than evaluation of endocrine or imaging parameters from a single cycle does. While patients and clinicians have traditionally used measurement of basal body temperature, interpretation can be difficult, so this approach should be used with caution. If available, ovulation predictor kits that measure the levels of luteinizing hormone in urine samples generally accurately reflect levels of serum luteinizing hormone and are a valuable tool for detecting ovulation in a given cycle. Simply measuring progesterone in the predicted luteal phase may provide satisfactory evidence supporting ovulatory function, particularly when the first day of the next menstrual period is known. Such an approach may be helpful in circumstances such as hirsutism, where the incidence of anovulation in women with cyclically predictable menstrual cycles is higher.

There are other, less common ovulatory disorders that may require more complex evaluation to determine if they are present in a given individual. For example, identifying LUF cycles, somewhat common in infertile women, requires both confirmation of the LH surge and the performance of serial ultrasound to demonstrate failed rupture of the dominant follicle. It should be remembered that scrutiny of a single cycle may not reflect the overall experience for a given individual.

### Timed intercourse for couples trying to conceive [^116n5mKQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Many factors influence fertility, one being the timing of intercourse. The 'fertile window' describes a stage in the cycle when conception can occur and is approximately five days before to several hours after ovulation. 'Timed intercourse' is the practice of prospectively identifying ovulation and, thus, the fertile window to increase the likelihood of conception. Methods of predicting ovulation include urinary hormone measurement (luteinising hormone (LH) and oestrogen), fertility awareness-based methods (FABM) (including tracking basal body temperatures, cervical mucus monitoring, calendar charting/tracking apps), and ultrasonography. However, there are potentially negative aspects associated with ovulation prediction, including stress, time consumption, and cost implications of purchasing ovulation kits and app subscriptions. This review considered the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the use of timed intercourse (using ovulation prediction) on pregnancy outcomes.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and risks of ovulation prediction methods for timing intercourse on conception in couples trying to conceive.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in January 2023. We also checked the reference lists of relevant studies and searched trial registries for any additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that compared methods of timed intercourse using ovulation prediction to other forms of ovulation prediction or intercourse without ovulation prediction in couples trying to conceive.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane to select and analyse studies in this review. The primary review outcomes were live birth and adverse events (such as depression and stress). Secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, pregnancy (clinical or positive urinary pregnancy test not yet confirmed by ultrasound), time to pregnancy, and quality of life. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the main comparisons using GRADE methods.

Main Results

This review update included seven RCTs involving 2464 women or couples. Four of the five studies from the previous review were included in this update, and three new studies were added. We assessed the quality of the evidence as moderate to very low, the main limitations being imprecision, indirectness, and risk of bias. Urinary ovulation tests versus intercourse without ovulation prediction Compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction, urinary ovulation detection probably increases the chance of live birth in couples trying to conceive (risk ratio (RR) 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.81, 1 RCT, n = 844, moderate-quality evidence). This suggests that if the chance of a live birth without urine ovulation prediction is 16%, the chance of a live birth with urine ovulation prediction is 16% to 28%. However, we are uncertain whether timed intercourse using urinary ovulation detection resulted in a difference in stress (mean difference (MD) 1.98, 95% CI -0.87 to 4.83, I² = 0%, P = 0.17, 1 RCT, n = 77, very low-quality evidence) or clinical pregnancy (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.31, I² = 0%, 1 RCT, n = 148, low-quality evidence). Similar to the live birth result, timed intercourse using urinary ovulation detection probably increases the chances of clinical pregnancy or positive urine pregnancy test (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.50, I² = 0, 4 RCTs, n = 2202, moderate-quality evidence). This suggests that if the chance of a clinical pregnancy or positive urine pregnancy test without ovulation prediction is assumed to be 18%, the chance following timed intercourse with urinary ovulation detection would be 20% to 28%. Evidence was insufficient to determine the effect of urine ovulation tests on time to pregnancy or quality of life. Fertility awareness-based methods (FABM) versus intercourse without ovulation prediction Due to insufficient evidence, we are uncertain whether timed intercourse using FABM resulted in a difference in live birth rate compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.20, I² = 0%, 2 RCTs, n = 157, low-quality evidence). We are also uncertain whether FABM affects stress (MD -1.10, 95% CI -3.88 to 1.68, 1 RCT, n = 183, very low-quality evidence). Similarly, we are uncertain of the effect of timed intercourse using FABM on anxiety (MD 0.5, 95% CI -0.52 to 1.52, P = 0.33, 1 RCT, n = 183, very low-quality evidence); depression (MD 0.4, 95% CI -0.28 to 1.08, P = 0.25, 1 RCT, n = 183, very low-quality evidence); or erectile dysfunction (MD 1.2, 95% CI -0.38 to 2.78, P = 0.14, 1 RCT, n = 183, very low-quality evidence). Evidence was insufficient to detect a benefit of timed intercourse using FABM on clinical pregnancy (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.31 to 4.07, 1 RCT, n = 17, very low-quality evidence) or clinical or positive pregnancy test rates (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.30, 3 RCTs, n = 262, very low-quality evidence). Finally, we are uncertain whether timed intercourse using FABM affects the time to pregnancy (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.38, 1 RCT, n = 140, low-quality evidence) or quality of life. No studies assessed the use of timed intercourse with pelvic ultrasonography.

Authors' Conclusions

The new evidence presented in this review update shows that timed intercourse using urine ovulation tests probably improves live birth and pregnancy rates (clinical or positive urine pregnancy tests but not yet confirmed by ultrasound) in women under 40, trying to conceive for less than 12 months, compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction. However, there are insufficient data to determine the effects of urine ovulation tests on adverse events, clinical pregnancy, time to pregnancy, and quality of life. Similarly, due to limited data, we are uncertain of the effect of FABM on pregnancy outcomes, adverse effects, and quality of life. Further research is therefore required to fully understand the safety and effectiveness of timed intercourse for couples trying to conceive. This research should include studies reporting clinically relevant outcomes such as live birth and adverse effects in fertile and infertile couples and utilise various methods to determine ovulation. Only with a comprehensive understanding of the risks and benefits of timed intercourse can recommendations be made for all couples trying to conceive.

### Providing quality family planning services in the United States: recommendations of the U.S. Office of Population Affairs (revised 2024) [^113Zm5Ra]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Fertility awareness apps — Fertility awareness–based methods (FABM) include an FDA cleared and CE marked app that uses body temperature to predict the fertile window; providers can include discussion of these tools as part of person-centered contraceptive care, advise patients to consider effectiveness, evidence base, intended use, and costs, and encourage attention to data privacy and security. Evidence suggests accuracy of predicting fertile windows and ovulation can vary due to multiple factors, and apps that collect a combination of indicators such as basal body temperature and cervical mucus in addition to calendar dates of menses may be more accurate.

### Characterizing physiological and symptomatic variation in menstrual cycles using self-tracked mobile-health data [^116rQ9Uk]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Examining cycle length is often insufficient for capturing all fluctuations in menstrual patterns — studies regarding menstrual variability showcase that although average cycle length is associated with cycle length consistency, women still experience significant variability in cycle lengths, regardless of their average cycle length. In this work, we address this limitation by utilizing our proposed metric, median CLD, to characterize menstrual cycle variability. Separating users according to their median CLD yields two distinct groups of users with statistically significant differences in cycle length, cycle length variations, and symptom tracking behaviors. We are unaware of any single figure of merit which so helpfully separates users into distinct segments. Clue uses the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) definitions for clinically irregular cycles in the app, but has not found connections with differences in tracking.

While there has been ample work on hormone-level characterizations of the menstrual cycle –, studies of the relationship between menstrual patterns and symptomatic variables are limited — recent work has explored this association using self-tracked data, but over a limited set of symptomsand without discriminating over age or birth control usage. A method for estimating ovulation timing based on Fertility Awareness Method observations (i.e. basal body temperature (BBT), cervical mucus, cervix position, and vaginal sensation) has been presented, but such data are inaccessible for this study due to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and other data-privacy concerns (sensitive fields such as appointments, ovulation and pregnancy tests, and BBT were not available in Clue's dataset). Nonetheless, such studies showcase the potential large-scale self-tracked data offer in exploring questions relating to menstruation.

### A rise-to-threshold process for a relative-value decision [^115QN7j8]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

For CsChrimson optogenetics experiments supporting a rise-to-threshold mechanism (Fig. 2f–h), two-photon imaging parameters were held relatively constant (mean frame rate of 1.5 Hz and two-photon laser power of approximately 10.5 mW). CsChrimson stimulation intensities were determined in pilot experiments. Periodic stimulation cycling four intensities was applied for 5 s every 2 min. The experimenter was blind to correlations between the neural signal and behaviour during all these recordings.

For CsChrimson manual stimulation experiments (Fig. 2a–c), stimulations were initiated by the experimenter while observing the real-time behaviour of the fly. Stimulations were initiated, on average, roughly once every 7.5 min. Manual stimulations were typically halted if the fly began to ovulate or it showed signs that it would ovulate soon (that is, pausing and slight abdominal elongation). Once ovulation was complete, stimulation was triggered when the fly's abdomen was not touching the substrate (and before any indication that a spontaneous egg-laying event was about to take place). The traces shown in Fig. 2a (and associated Supplementary Video 5) are representative of our manual stimulation protocol. We used manual stimulation because it resulted in around a twofold higher rate of eggs laid than periodic stimulation, and also it allowed us to activate oviDNs after ovulation but before spontaneous egg laying.

### Basal temperature and date of ovulation… [^117UJBKk]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

As early as 1904 van de Velde pointed out the existence of variations in body temperature during phases of the menstrual cycle. A number of clinical investigations since then have confirmed his observation. Rubenstein1 correlated a study of vaginal smears with a study of basal temperatures and found that during the phase of follicle development the basal rectal temperature tends to drop progressively. The low point in the temperature curve is reached when the follicle matures. Coitus at this time is therefore most likely to result in conception. The beginning progesterone production which occurs before ovulation suffices to counteract in part the temperature depressing action of estrone and therefore to cause an initial temperature rise beginning a few hours before ovulation. The temperature rise continues after ovulation and should exceed 0. 5 degree F. in the first twenty-four hours after ovulation and 1 degree F. the first week after ovulation.

### Timing of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination and effects on menstrual cycle changes [^1149GwHK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our three-category primary exposure was timing of COVID-19 vaccination, comparing unvaccinated individuals with those who received the vaccine in the follicular phase and those who received it in the luteal phase. Individuals reported their vaccination dates or confirmed their unvaccinated status using an in-application message. Natural Cycles uses a proprietary algorithm based on long-standing evidence that uses daily basal body temperature to identify an individual's ovulation date for each cycle and, if logged, urine LH test results, which we used to determine the phase in which a vaccine was received: follicular phase (cycle day 1 through ovulation date) and luteal phase (day immediately after ovulation through the end of cycle). In cycles in which basal body temperature data were inadequate to determine the ovulation date using the algorithm (approximately 20% of vaccination cycles), we categorized the luteal phase as the final 14 days of the cycle and the follicular phase as preceding that and performed additional sensitivity analyses (see below).

Our primary outcome was the adjusted within-individual change in cycle length (in days) from the average of the three prevaccination cycles to the first vaccination cycle. For the vaccinated cohorts (both follicular and luteal phase), cycle four was the first vaccination cycle; the second vaccination cycle varied depending on whether and when the second dose was received (cycles 4–13, with cycle five being most common). For the unvaccinated cohort, we designated cycles four and five as the notional first and second vaccination cycles, respectively, and cycles one through three as the equivalent of the prevaccination cycles. We considered three secondary outcomes: the adjusted within-individual change in cycle length from the prevaccination average to the second vaccination cycle and the proportion of individuals who experienced a clinically significant change from their prevaccination average, defined as an increase or decrease of 8 days or more, during the first and the second vaccination cycles. We were not able to assess changes from the three cycles immediately before the second dose to the second vaccination cycle due to the very small number of individuals with three cycles between their first and second dose (n = 121, 0.9% of sample).

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^117SKcns]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Menstrual cycle — hormonal fluctuations and exercise performance — has direct effects on performance that are difficult to assess, highly variable, and dependent on how the cycle is determined; studies indicate physiological factors that can impact performance, including estradiol-associated increases in free fatty acid use, glycogen sparing, and muscle glycogen storage capacity, while progesterone is associated with increases in heart rate, body temperature, sweating, and set points for sweating and vasodilation. However, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported conflicting results, and a recent large meta-analysis indicates that effects of menstrual phase on actual sports performance are small and unlikely to overcome more powerful competition-day factors such as environmental temperature, type of exercise, training status, or pain.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: contraceptive counseling for transgender and gender diverse people who were female sex assigned at birth [^11314DZX]. Contraception (2020). High credibility.

Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations — Fertility-awareness based methods for transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people assigned female at birth: Effectiveness in cisgender women is reported as 76%. For patients, most methods require tracking monthly bleeding, some require checking basal body temperature, cervical mucus, and/or cervical position, and patients must be willing to avoid intercourse or use another method for the days surrounding ovulation; many phone apps are available to help track ovulation signs and are being studied for effectiveness. For providers, lower effectiveness for patients with irregular cycles is noted, which may be more common for TGD people at baseline due to factors such as amenorrhoea on testosterone therapy.

### A comparison of app-defined fertile days from two fertility tracking apps using identical cycle data [^113CLUg3]. Contraception (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The Natural Cycles app employs daily basal body temperature to define the fertile window via a proprietary algorithm and is clinically established effective in preventing pregnancy. We sought to (1) compare the app-defined fertile window of Natural Cycles to that of CycleProGo, an app that uses BBT and cervical mucus to define the fertile window and (2) compare the app-defined fertile windows to the estimated physiologic fertile window.

Study Design

Daily BBT were entered into Natural Cycles from 20 randomly selected regularly cycling women with at least 12 complete cycles from the CycleProGo database. The proportion of cycles with equivalent (± 1 cycle day) fertile-window starts and fertile-window ends was determined. The app-defined fertile windows were then compared to the estimated physiologic fertile window using Peak mucus to estimate ovulation.

Results

Fifty seven percent of cycles (136/238) had equivalent fertile-window starts and 36% (72/181) had equivalent fertile-window end days. The mean overall fertile-window length from Natural Cycles was 12.8 days compared to 15.1 days for CycleProGo (p < 0.001). The Natural Cycles algorithm declared 12% to 30% of cycles with a fertile-window start and 13% to 38% of cycles with a fertile-window end within the estimated physiologic fertile window. The CycleProGo algorithm declared 4% to 14% of cycles with a fertile-window start and no cycles with a fertile-window end within the estimated physiologic fertile window.

Conclusions

Natural Cycles designated a higher proportion of cycles days as infertile within the estimated physiologic fertile window than CycleProGo.

Implications

Use of cervical mucus in addition to BBT may improve the accuracy of identifying the fertile window. Additional studies with other markers of ovulation and the fertile window would give additional insight into the clinical implications of app-defined fertile window differences.

### Isotopic ordering in eggshells reflects body temperatures and suggests differing thermophysiology in two cretaceous dinosaurs [^111W1Tz1]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Our understanding of the evolutionary transitions leading to the modern endothermic state of birds and mammals is incomplete, partly because tools available to study the thermophysiology of extinct vertebrates are limited. Here we show that clumped isotope analysis of eggshells can be used to determine body temperatures of females during periods of ovulation. Late Cretaceous titanosaurid eggshells yield temperatures similar to large modern endotherms. In contrast, oviraptorid eggshells yield temperatures lower than most modern endotherms but ∼ 6°C higher than co-occurring abiogenic carbonates, implying that this taxon did not have thermoregulation comparable to modern birds, but was able to elevate its body temperature above environmental temperatures. Therefore, we observe no strong evidence for end-member ectothermy or endothermy in the species examined. Body temperatures for these two species indicate that variable thermoregulation likely existed among the non-avian dinosaurs and that not all dinosaurs had body temperatures in the range of that seen in modern birds.

### Deep learning model using continuous skin temperature data predicts labor onset [^111uApwG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

While hormonal pattern and source (e.g. the placenta) differ in the third trimester of pregnancy from non-pregnant female states, we hypothesize that the same influences on thermoregulation exist prior to labor. Briefly, the influence of progesterone retreats in preparation for labor with rises in the ratio of estriol to progesterone, prolactin and corticotropin releasing hormone. Additionally, pro-inflammatory prostaglandins/ cytokines rise as active labor begins and likely contribute to high temperatures during this time, part of a broader sterile inflammatory response. Given the complexity of this hormonal state one might propose that changes in the ratio of progesterone and estriol would prompt decreasing temperatures prior to labor onset. However, changes in the latter three factors suggest rising temperatures near or during the commencement of labor. Despite this lack of clarity as to the precise thermal patterning that hormones and inflammatory factors would create, coarse decreases in body temperature have been noted prior to labor in a wide range of mammalian species (Table 1). Together, it is likely that hormonal, autonomic, and immune factors interact to regulate the level and patterning of body temperature in a consistent manner surrounding labor.

Despite the reliability of these observations across phases of reproductive life and across species, the use of body temperature for predicting human labor onset has not been robustly studied. Presently, human parturition is estimated to occur within a range of weeks around a population mean of 40.0 weeks from the last menstrual period (an estimated 38 weeks post-conception), or via ultrasound performed in the first trimester which provides the gestational age of the embryo. However, present methods are associated with multiple weeks of average error based on natural variation in gestation length, menstrual period reporting error, and variability in the timing of both ovulation and conception relative to the last menstrual period. Moreover, an individual's length of gestation has not been predictable, despite attempts using AI/ML trained mostly on clinical features and ultrasound measures of cervical change. Although hormonal timeseries taken in the third trimester may offer an improvement over traditional methods, they are both difficult to collect and costly to analyze, limiting practical application. It may be that a more appropriate method is the construction of a model that can detect subtle patterning in an output known to change before mammalian parturition: body temperature.

### Self-identification of the clinical fertile window and the ovulation period [^111d2dB6]. Fertility and Sterility (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the sensitivity and specificity of the self-identified fertile window.

Design

Observational study.

Setting

Not applicable.

Patient(S)

A total of 107 women.

Intervention(S)

Women recorded cervical mucus observation and basal body temperature daily while undergoing daily ovarian ultrasound.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

The biological fertile window, defined as the 6 days up to and including the day of ovulation; and the 2-day ovulation window, defined as the day before and the day of ovulation.

Result(S)

The self-identification of the biological fertile window by the observation of any type of cervical mucus provides 100% sensitivity but poor specificity, yielding a clinical fertile window of 11 days. However, the identification of the biological fertile window by peak mucus (defined as clear, slippery, or stretchy mucus related to estrogen) yielded 96% sensitivity and improved specificity. The appearance of the peak mucus preceded the biological fertile window in less than 10% of the cycles. Likewise, this type of mucus identified the ovulation window with 88% sensitivity.

Conclusion(S)

These results suggest that, when perceived accurately, more accurate clinical self-detection of the fertile window can be obtained by identification of peak mucus. This may improve efforts to focus intercourse in the fertile phase for couples with fertility concerns.

### Exertional heat stroke: pathophysiology and risk factors [^114oLKZF]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Responses to thermal stress between the sexes are primarily a result of decreased rates of metabolic heat production in female individuals. This decrease in metabolic heat production is presumably associated with cutaneous vascular conductance and sudomotor activity. Female individuals tend to show lower sudomotor activity at a similar heat load than male individuals, resulting in differences in temperature regulation and sweat production. However, in a clinical trial, Kazman et alcompared men's (n = 55) and women's (n = 20) responses to a heat tolerance test. All women were in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (ie, the longest step in the menstrual cycle, lasting from the first day of a period to ovulation, when oestrogen levels are high and progesterone levels are low). In this study, women were more heat intolerant than men, as defined by a core temperature over 38.5°C, failure to plateau in body temperature, or a heart rate over 150 bpm. Thus, sex was thought to predict heat intolerance. However, a linear regression analysis found body fat percentage and VO₂ max were more accurate predictors and negated the effect of sex. These findings also suggested thermal strain is less important than cardiovascular strain regarding performance in the heat. However, the heat tolerance test lacks sensitivity and specificity owing to its stringent terminal criteria and cannot account for fluctuations in temperature above 38.5°Cand it is associated with a high fail rate of false positives.

Oestrogen and progesterone fluctuations in the oestrous cycle result in variations in core temperature with women in the luteal phase (eg, high progesterone, lower oestrogen) showing 0.3–0.5 °C increase in core temperature compared with the follicular phase (eg, high oestrogen, low progesterone). Even with this variation in temperature, thermoregulatory responses did not differ throughout the estrous cycle phases. On the other hand, In a clinical trial of four women aged 20–35 years, Horvath et al observed differences in core temperature at rest that were attenuated during combined heat and exercise. More studies are warranted to determine the influence of sex hormones on EHS susceptibility.

### Clomiphene citrate (Clomid) [^111F4asw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Clomiphene citrate is indicated for the treatment of ovulatory dysfunction in women desiring pregnancy. Impediments to achieving pregnancy must be excluded or adequately treated before beginning clomiphene citrate therapy. Those patients most likely to achieve success with clomiphene therapy include patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (see WARNINGS: Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome), amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome, psychogenic amenorrhea, post-oral-contraceptive amenorrhea, and certain cases of secondary amenorrhea of undetermined etiology.

Properly timed coitus in relationship to ovulation is important. A basal body temperature graph or other appropriate tests may help the patient and her physician determine if ovulation occurred. Once ovulation has been established, each course of clomiphene citrate should be started on or about the 5th day of the cycle. Long-term cyclic therapy is not recommended beyond a total of about six cycles (including three ovulatory cycles). (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and PRECAUTIONS .)

Clomiphene citrate is indicated only in patients with demonstrated ovulatory dysfunction who meet the conditions described below:

Patients who are not pregnant.
Patients without ovarian cysts. Clomiphene citrate should not be used in patients with ovarian enlargement except those with polycystic ovary syndrome. Pelvic examination is necessary prior to the first and each subsequent course of clomiphene citrate treatment.
Patients without abnormal vaginal bleeding. If abnormal vaginal bleeding is present, the patient should be carefully evaluated to ensure that neoplastic lesions are not present.
Patients with normal liver function.

### Advances in biomonitoring technologies for women's health [^1176jCH4]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Biometric monitoring for fertility and pregnancy health

Monitoring fertility and maternal health is crucial for both the mother and child, as 810 and 6700 maternal and fetal deaths, respectively, occur every day. Additionally, the WHO reports that, annually, 40 million women develop long-term health conditions during pregnancy. If left improperly diagnosed or unaddressed, these conditions negatively impact women's lives for years after giving birth, showing a need for health monitoring solutions. Women in low-income and low-middle income countries can especially benefit, as 92% of maternal deaths in these countries are preventable by addressing the lack of access to high-quality healthcare resources, well-informed clinical guidelines and reliable data on women's reproductive health.

Biometric parameter changes, trackable with wearable devices, are characterized by physiological fluctuations throughout the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. These parameters include basal body temperature (BBT), peripheral temperature on the skin, sweat rate, and heart rate. Some wearables offer a non-invasive alternative for measuring these parameters compared to traditional clinical assessments that require physician facilitation. These include temperature measurements recorded with a thermometer either orally, rectally or intravaginally –, thermocouple or infrared sensor heat mapping conducted in clinics, and off-body sweat sample analyses performed in laboratories.

Wearable devices for BBT monitoring should be capable of detecting fluctuations in the range of 0.5–0.8 °C, as this is the typical variation observed throughout the menstrual cycle. Generally, estradiol levels increase throughout the follicular phase, peaking at ovulation, which is associated with increased vasodilation and body cooling. Subsequently, after ovulation, high progesterone levels lead to body heating by affecting the hypothalamus and central nervous system to increase the body's thermoregulatory setpoint. The most common BBT monitoring wearables are wrist-worn activity trackers. However, the challenges with measuring daily BBT through smart activity watches and bracelets are that fluctuations throughout the day, depending on level of activity, lead to fluctuating accuracy. These trackers are best suited for detecting biometric changes at night, when the body is at rest.

### Assessment of menstrual health status and evolution through mobile apps for fertility awareness [^114FTWwj]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Model description

The HMM as implemented in this study describes a discretization in 10 states of the successive hormonal events throughout an ovulatory menstrual cycle. The HMM definition includes the probabilities of observing the different FAM reported body signs in each state (emission probabilities) and the probabilities of switching from one state to another (transition probabilities). Emission probabilities were chosen to reflect observations previously made in studies that tested for ovulation with LH tests or ultrasounds, while transition probabilities were chosen in a quasi-uniform manner (Supplementary Material). The ovulation estimations were robust to changes in transition probabilities but not to variations in emission probabilities (Supplementary Fig. 6, Supplementary Material), indicating that this simple framework is suitable to detect ovulations in cycles of any length, and potentially including pregnancies, relying primarily on users' self-reported observations.

Once the model was defined, the Viterbi and the Backward–Forward algorithmswere used to calculate the most probable state sequence for each cycle (Supplementary Material) and thus to estimate ovulation timing, i.e. the most likely day of the cycle in which the HMM is in the state "ovulation". An uncertainty of the estimation has also been computed as the standard deviation of the distribution of probabilities for the state "ovulation", which can be interpreted as the confidence interval in days for the time of ovulation estimation (Supplementary Material). Finally, a confidence score was defined to account for missing observations and variation in temperature taking time in a window of ~5 days around the estimated ovulation day (Supplementary Material).

HMM states

The ten states, defined as a discretization of the hormonal evolution across the cycle (further details in Supplementary Material), are:

HM: Onset of the menses and the heavy/medium flow of fresh blood;

LM: Days of light bleeding or spotting that conclude menstruations;

LE: Low estrogen;

HE: High estrogen;

Ovu: Ovulation;

Rise: Temperature rise associated with rise in progesterone production;

HP: High progesterone;

EP: Estrogen peak in luteal phase;

LP: Low progesterone;

End: Artificial state for the end of each cycle.

### Consumer wearables and personal devices for tracking the fertile window [^11324mkz]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

The market for technology that tracks ovulation to promote conception is rapidly expanding in the United States, targeting the growing audience of technologically proficient, reproductive-age female consumers. In this narrative review, 23 different, nonprescription wearables and devices designed to help women track their fertile window were identified as currently, commercially available in the United States. The majority of these utilize measurements of basal body temperature or combinations of various urinary hormones. This clinical opinion characterizes the scant available research validating the accuracy of these technologies. It further examines research oversight, discusses the utility of these wearables and devices to consumers, and considers these technologies through an equity lens. The discussion concludes with a call for innovation, describing promising new technologies that not only harness unique physiologic parameters to predict ovulation, but also focus on cost-effectiveness with the hope of increasing access to these currently costly devices and wearables.

### Understanding wrist skin temperature changes to hormone variations across the menstrual cycle [^111TusZb]. Npj Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Other researchers have assessed the accuracy and reliability of these devices. For example, Fitbit's PBT estimates yield an estimation error of 0.23 ± 0.08 °C when compared against temperatures taken using the ThermoScan PRO 4000 ear thermometer, while other studies have shown minimal differences between Fitbit's activity measurements (e.g. step count, heart rate) and corollaries collected by manual methods. Meanwhile, David et al.measured 98.7% matching between the Dexcom G6 CGM and point-of-care testing according to a Clarke Error Grid analysis. Finally, Nakhuda et al.confirmed a strong correlation between serum E2 concentrations measured by immunoassay analyzers and urine E3G concentrations quantified by Mira devices. Their findings corroborate Mira's performance according to other studies that have observed 99% accuracy in ovulation prediction and 20% in coefficient of variation –.

Data processing

Mira estimates the start and end dates of each menstrual cycle phase, along with the day of ovulation, via rises and falls in the collected E3G and LH levels. With this information, we generated four phase labels: follicular (the day after the last day of menstrual flow to the first day of the fertile window), ovulation (the fertile window), luteal (the last day of the fertile window to the first day of menstrual flow), and menstruation (days with menstrual flow). Cycles that had more than 4 consecutive days of E3G and LH data missing, more than 40% of E3G and LH data missing, and/or more than 20% of nightly WST data missing were dropped from the dataset. Based on these criteria, 49 out of the 172 total cycles (28.4%) were eliminated, yielding a dataset with 123 cycles from 45 participants. To consolidate continuous physiological data into daily values, we calculated the total step count and median glucose levels for each day (12:00 AM-11:59 PM). We ensured the representativeness of summary statistics by removing days with less than 18 hours of continuous physiological data. For the cycles that remained, Fitbit, Dexcom CGM, and diary data were available for averages of 98.3 ± 0.9%, 84.5 ± 7.8%, and 89.7 ± 2.4% respectively within a given cycle.

### Cervicovaginal fluid changes to detect ovulation accurately [^116KieJk]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in cervicovaginal fluid characteristics to identify ovulation.

Study Design

Several ovulation indicators were studied in a university-based natural family planning center. Fifteen parous women during 29 ovulatory cycles detected cervicovaginal fluid at the vulva. They self-aspirated their upper vaginal fluid, described it, and kept it for later checking. They also took basal body temperature, collected timed first morning urine samples for estrone and pregnanediol glucuronide enzyme immunoassays, and submitted to serial ovarian transvaginal ultrasound scans.

Results

Considering a ± 1-day period since ultrasound ovulation detection or allowing an extra day (-1 to +2), women perceived ovulation from cervicovaginal fluid at the vulva in 76% or 97% of cycles, on the basis of their visual description of vaginally extracted fluid in 76% or 90%, which rose to 90% or 97% for the instructor's description, and in 76% or 86% with a rapid drop in glucuronide ratio. Basal body temperature was less precise (71% or 79%).

Conclusion

Evaluation of cervicovaginal fluid changes is an accurate ovulation indicator.

### Fertility evaluation of infertile women: a committee opinion [^116B5Ztd]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Basal body temperature (BBT) testing — performance and use: Serial, daily BBT testing is an inexpensive, although often unreliable, method of predicting ovarian function, and ovulatory cycles are generally associated with biphasic BBT recordings while anovulatory cycles typically result in monophasic patterns. Grossly short luteal phases (< 10 days of temperature elevation) may identify women with more subtle ovulatory dysfunction, and theoretically, the period of highest fertility spans the 7 days before the midcycle rise in BBT. Given the tedious nature of the testing and its lack of accuracy, this test is not routinely recommended today, especially when the menstrual history is consistent with ovulatory cycles.

### Understanding wrist skin temperature changes to hormone variations across the menstrual cycle [^111BFmt2]. Npj Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The menstrual cycle is a complex physiological process involving hormonal changes and interactions across multiple body systems. One notable pattern that has been reported in clinical literature is the biphasic fluctuation of resting-state body temperature, with temperatures higher post-ovulation than pre-ovulation. This fluctuation is influenced by the interplay of hormones such as estrogen, which lowers temperature, and progesterone, which has a thermogenic effect throughout the menstrual cycle. These hormonal dynamics regulate the release of luteinizing hormone (LH). Estrogen provides positive feedback in the late follicular phase to trigger the mid-cycle LH peaks, and progesterone inhibits LH release during the luteal phase while counteracting the positive feedback effect of elevated estrogen on LH.

This biphasic fluctuation pattern has led to the development of algorithms that rely on periodic changes in body temperature for purposes such as menstrual cycle tracking, pregnancy preparation, and contraception. Previous research has typically relied on resting-state temperature measured at internal body sites like the esophagus or rectum because these sites closely reflect the thermal characteristics of central arterial or mixed venous blood. However, measuring temperature at these sites can be inconvenient due to their invasiveness. Recent work has been done using peripheral body temperature (PBT) obtained from self-monitoring consumer devices like smartwatches and rings –, yet little has been done to explore either the relationship between PBT and hormone variations or the effectiveness of PBT in capturing anticipated patterns across the menstrual cycle.

### (not) talking about fertility: the role of digital technologies and health services in helping plan pregnancy. A qualitative study [^111EUnfe]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2022). High credibility.

Background

Fertility interventions have tended to target couples once they are having difficulties conceiving rather than pro-fertility initiatives being in place once the decision to have children has been made. Fertility declines with age; 92% of women aged 19–26 years trying for pregnancy conceive within 12 months compared with 82% of those aged 35–39 years. If frequency of vaginal intercourse is once a week, these conception rates decline to 85% and 61%, respectively. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend that opposite-sex couples wishing to conceive should have vaginal sex every 2 to 3 days to optimise their chances of pregnancy, and those using donor insemination should time the insemination around ovulation. Fertility awareness knowledge is low, with often limited understanding as to how timing of sexual intercourse affects chances of conception and overestimation of the time within the menstrual cycle when pregnancy can occur. Limited knowledge has also been found among healthcare providers. Short consultations and lack of training have been identified as barriers to fertility awareness counselling in general practice.

A proliferation of fertility awareness and pregnancy-related apps has provided users with greater autonomy, but has also led to closer monitoring of - and greater burden of - responsibility in managing their own fertility and health. Research on use of fertility awareness apps to support conception is sparse and concerns have been raised about the accuracy of many of the available apps in identifying the fertile window. Natural Cycles is a fertility awareness app for monitoring menstrual cycles, as a method of contraception or to aid conception. Users enter data on their cycle, basal body temperature (BBT) and, optionally, luteinising hormone urine test results. An algorithm, which allows for uncertainties in ovulation day prediction and pre- and post-ovulation temperatures, calculates the fertile window. A retrospective study conducted by the developers found the mean delay from the first positive ovulation test to the Natural Cycles estimation using BBT was 1.9 (± 1.4 SD) days. This compares to a mean delay of 1.5 (± 0.6 SD) days when using more precise ultrasound detection. Data on its contraceptive effectiveness have been published, but to date no such data have been published in relation to conception. The Freyja Study used qualitative interviews to explore views and experiences of people using Natural Cycles to plan pregnancy. The aim of this article arising from the study is to explore how women and their partners navigate (pre)conception healthcare and the role of the Natural Cycles technology in this process.

### Relationships between the luteinizing hormone surge and other characteristics of the menstrual cycle in normally ovulating women [^115JW3pd]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the LH surge variants in ovulating women and analyze their relationship with the day of ovulation and other hormone levels.

Design

Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort observational study.

Setting

Eight natural family planning clinics.

Subjects

Normally fertile women (n = 107) over 283 cycles.

Intervention(S)

Women collected daily first morning urine, charted basal body temperature and cervical mucus discharge, and underwent serial ovarian ultrasound.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Urinary LH, FSH, estrone-3-glucuronide (E3G), pregnanediol-3α-glucuronide (PDG), and day of ovulation by ultrasound (US-DO).

Result(S)

Individual LH surges were extremely variable in configuration, amplitude, and duration. The study also showed that LH surges marked by several peaks were associated with statistically significant smaller follicle sizes before rupture and lower LH level on the day of ovulation. LH surges lasting > 3 days after ovulation were associated with a lower E3G before ovulation, a smaller corpus luteum 2 days after ovulation, and a lower PDG value during the first 4 days after ovulation.

Conclusion(S)

In clinical practice, LH profiles should be compared with the range of profiles observed in normally fertile cycles, not with the mean profile.

### Follitropin alfa (Gonal-F) [^114V3pDt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.11	Laboratory Tests

In most instances, treatment of women with GONAL-f will result only in follicular recruitment and development. In the absence of an endogenous LH surge, hCG is given to trigger ovulation when monitoring of the woman indicates that sufficient follicular development has occurred. This may be estimated by ultrasound alone or in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels. The combination of both ultrasound and serum estradiol measurement are useful for monitoring follicular growth and maturation, timing of the ovulatory trigger, detecting ovarian enlargement and minimizing the risk of the OHSS and multiple gestation.

The clinical confirmation of ovulation is obtained by direct or indirect indices of progesterone production as well as sonographic evidence of ovulation.

Direct or indirect indices of progesterone production:

Urinary or serum luteinizing hormone (LH) rise
A rise in basal body temperature
Increase in serum progesterone
Menstruation following a shift in basal body temperature

Sonographic evidence of ovulation:

Collapsed follicle
Fluid in the cul-de-sac
Features consistent with corpus luteum formation
Secretory endometrium

### Synchronised approach for intrauterine insemination in subfertile couples [^116aGZxB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In many countries intrauterine insemination (IUI) is the treatment of first choice for a subfertile couple when the infertility work up reveals an ovulatory cycle, at least one open Fallopian tube and sufficient spermatozoa. The final goal of this treatment is to achieve a pregnancy and deliver a healthy (singleton) live birth. The probability of conceiving with IUI depends on various factors including age of the couple, type of subfertility, ovarian stimulation and the timing of insemination. IUI should logically be performed around the moment of ovulation. Since spermatozoa and oocytes have only limited survival time correct timing of the insemination is essential. As it is not known which technique of timing for IUI results in the best treatment outcome, we compared different techniques for timing IUI and different time intervals.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of different synchronisation methods in natural and stimulated cycles for IUI in subfertile couples.

Search Methods

We searched for all publications which described randomised controlled trials of the timing of IUI. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (1966 to October 2014), EMBASE (1974 to October 2014), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2014) and PsycINFO (inception to October 2014) electronic databases and prospective trial registers. Furthermore, we checked the reference lists of all obtained studies and performed a handsearch of conference abstracts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different timing methods for IUI were included. The following interventions were evaluated: detection of luteinising hormone (LH) in urine or blood, single test; human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration; combination of LH detection and hCG administration; basal body temperature chart; ultrasound detection of ovulation; gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist administration; or other timing methods.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the trials, extracted the data and assessed study risk of bias. We performed statistical analyses in accordance with the guidelines for statistical analysis developed by The Cochrane Collaboration. The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE methods.

Main Results

Eighteen RCTs were included in the review, of which 14 were included in the meta-analyses (in total 2279 couples). The evidence was current to October 2013. The quality of the evidence was low or very low for most comparisons. The main limitations in the evidence were failure to describe study methods, serious imprecision and attrition bias. Ten RCTs compared different methods of timing for IUI. We found no evidence of a difference in live birth rates between hCG injection versus LH surge (odds ratio (OR) 1.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 18, 1 RCT, 24 women, very low quality evidence), urinary hCG versus recombinant hCG (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.03, 1 RCT, 284 women, low quality evidence) or hCG versus GnRH agonist (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.6, 3 RCTS, 104 women, I(2) = 0%, low quality evidence). Two RCTs compared the optimum time interval from hCG injection to IUI, comparing different time frames that ranged from 24 hours to 48 hours. Only one of these studies reported live birth rates, and found no difference between the groups (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.00, 1 RCT, 204 couples). One study compared early versus late hCG administration and one study compared different dosages of hCG, but neither reported the primary outcome of live birth. We found no evidence of a difference between any of the groups in rates of pregnancy or adverse events (multiple pregnancy, miscarriage, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)). However, most of these data were very low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there is any difference in safety and effectiveness between different methods of synchronization of ovulation and insemination. More research is needed.

### Understanding wrist skin temperature changes to hormone variations across the menstrual cycle [^116Qwf5S]. Npj Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Previous research suggests a strong connection between body temperature variations and menstrual cycle phases, potentially resulting from the secretion of hormones during this time. To analyze these relationships across the menstrual cycle, we investigated the correlation between E3G and LH levels obtained from daily hormone tests in conjunction with nightly WST readings collected through a smartwatch. We did this by building a hierarchy of models to understand the effects of hormones, behaviors, and other physiological parameters on WST. We then identified a negative linear relationship between LH and WST, while the relationship between E3G and WST was only evident when considering non-linear associations and stratifying by menstrual cycle phase. Specifically, higher E3G levels during the ovulation phase were linked to lower WST, whereas higher E3G levels during the luteal phase corresponded to elevated WST. These relationships remained robust even after accounting for confounding factors such as glucose levels, physical activity levels, stress, and sleep quality.

### The effect of the menstrual cycle on affective modulation of pain and nociception in healthy women [^112Vb68L]. Pain (2010). Low credibility.

Research indicates pain may be influenced by the menstrual cycle. While the mechanisms underlying these effects are unclear, it is possible that menstrual phase-related changes in endogenous pain modulation contribute. The present study used well-validated methods to study affective modulation of pain and the nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) in healthy women during two menstrual phases (mid-follicular vs. late-luteal). Women (N = 41) tracked their menstrual phases for three complete cycles and were asked to attend two laboratory testing sessions in the second and third cycles to assess affective modulation of pain and nociception (testing order counterbalanced). Menstrual phase was assessed from daily diaries, luteinizing hormone tests, and basal body temperature. At each session, emotionally charged pictures were presented and suprathreshold electrocutaneous stimulations were delivered during and in between pictures. Subjective and physiological emotional reactions were recorded in response to each picture and pain ratings and NFRs were recorded in response to each suprathreshold stimulus. Results suggested pictures effectively manipulated emotion in both menstrual phases. Moreover, arousing unpleasant pictures enhanced pain and NFR, whereas arousing pleasant pictures inhibited pain and NFR. These modulatory effects were similar in both menstrual phases. Together, these findings suggest that affective engagement of corticospinal mechanisms does not differ across these phases of the menstrual cycle. However, future research is needed to directly assess the relationship between affective modulation of pain/nociception and inter- and intra-individual differences in ovarian hormones and to extend these findings to women who suffer from menstrual cycle-related pain (e.g., premenstrual dysphoric disorder, fibromyalgia).

### Age-dependent and seasonal changes in menstrual cycle length and body temperature based on big data [^115QEhCj]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of age and season on menstrual cycle length and basal body temperature (BBT). We also examined the effects of climate on cycle length and BBT, taking into account Japanese geographic and social characteristics.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data from 6 million menstrual cycles entered into a smartphone application from 310,000 females from 2016 to 2017. Only those who entered more than 10 cycles in 2 years were included. Generalized estimation equations were used to adjust for confounding factors and for within-person correlations of multiple records. Multiple regression analysis was conducted, with age, external average temperature, precipitation amount, and sunshine hours as confounding factors.

Results

The mean menstrual cycle length increased from age 15–23 years, subsequently decreased up to age 45 years, and then increased again. Average follicular phase body temperature showed no significant age-dependent changes, but luteal phase body temperature gradually increased up to 29 years and then stabilized and started to decrease after age 42 years. A significant association between external temperature and body temperature (follicular and luteal phase) was observed, though menstrual cycle length did not show such an association.

Conclusion

These results, derived from data self-entered into a smartphone application, revealed underrecognized age-dependent and seasonal changes in menstrual cycle length and BBT, which will contribute to a better understanding of female reproductive health in the modern world.

### Age-dependent and seasonal changes in menstrual cycle length and body temperature based on big data [^116KZLVw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We observed in our present study that menstrual cycle length changed with age, but it was not associated with season or other climatic factors. Luteal, but not follicular, phase temperature changed with age, and both follicular and luteal phase BBTs were associated with environmental temperature. We analyzed data from 6 million menstrual cycles derived from 310,000 active application users to add to current knowledge concerning characteristics associated with cycle length and BBT.

The human menstrual cycle is regulated by the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis. Menstruation is irregular in girls in their early teens because secretion of gonadotropins (ie, luteinizing hormone and follicular stimulating hormone) from the pituitary is suppressed owing to the immature gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulse from the hypothalamus. Pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion matures during adolescence, sex steroid secretion increases, and the menstrual cycle becomes stabilized. The increase in menstrual cycle length in teenagers likely reflects the maturation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), with an estimated prevalence of 5–20% among reproductive-aged females, causes defective ovulation, resulting in elongation of the menstrual cycle, which stabilizes when women are in their 30s. This age-dependent change helps to explain the shortened mean cycle length for women in their 30s. Another possible explanation is an increase in early-onset primary ovarian insufficiency in women in their 30s. This disease occurs in 1% of women in their 30s, with increasing frequency throughout the 30s, and could be associated with shortening of the menstrual cycle. Women in their 40s have fewer ovarian follicles, and their cycles therefore tend to be shortened. Collectively, we demonstrated age-dependent change in menstrual cycle length, from relatively short in the teens, stable in the 20s, shortened in the 30s and early 40s, and patchy in the 50s. These findings are in agreement with current knowledge on physiology and pathology involving the menstrual cycle. Interestingly, the mean menstrual cycle length peaked at 23 years, which was consistent with the peak age of fecundability (22–23 years)and the dip age for risk of miscarriage (23 years). This similarity implies the presence of common biological factors affecting menstrual cycle, fecundability, and rate of miscarriage.

### Understanding wrist skin temperature changes to hormone variations across the menstrual cycle [^116XPhca]. Npj Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

For each menstrual cycle, we performed a series of preprocessing steps to account for noise in our sensor data. We used a process similar to the one used by Maijala et al.to prepare the WST data; after applying linear interpolation to standardize the temporal spacing between data points and account for missing data, we applied a 5 th -order Butterworth low-pass filterwith a cutoff at 10% of the target sampling frequency (1 sample per day) to attenuate noise in the temperature signal. We then identified the peaks and nadirs of nightly WST within each cycle (from the end of one menstrual phase to the start of the next) by pinpointing the lowest temperature before menstrual bleeding, followed by a minimum of three consecutive days of rising temperature during which the highest local maximum was recorded. This process aligns closely with the "three-over-six rule", which states that a notable peak in WST occurs when it is elevated by at least 0.2 °C for at least five of the preceding six days and it remains elevated for a minimum of three consecutive days. We also identified peaks in E3G and LH levels by pinpointing the highest local maximum in every cycle. On average, the E3G peak was typically 1.3 ± 0.5 times higher than the next highest E3G local maximum within a given cycle, while the LH peak was typically 2.2 ± 5.0 times higher than the next highest LH local maximum within a given cycle.

### Interpretation of the BBT chart: using the "Gap" technique compared to the coverline technique [^115EMpWZ]. Contraception (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to compare the accuracy of the Gap and Coverline techniques of interpreting the basal body temperature chart.

Methods

We compared the proportion of menstrual cycles for which the Gap and Coverline techniques accurately identified the post-ovulatory final fertile phase (FFP) and the initial infertile phase (IIP) and the median number of days each overestimated the fertile period, using urinary LH testing as the gold standard.

Results

The Gap and Coverline techniques identified the FFP within ± 1 day of that identified by LH testing in 13/33 (39%) and 10/33 (30%) cycles (χ² = 0.6; p = .44), respectively, and the IIP within +1 day of that of LH testing in 13/33 (55%) and 4/33 (12%) cycles, respectively (χ² = 13.4; p < .001). The Gap and Coverline techniques overestimated the fertile period by 1 and 4 days, respectively (p = .0002).

Conclusion

Based on this small study, the Gap technique appears to be more accurate than the Coverline technique in identifying the post-ovulatory IIP.

### Temperature recording for female fecundity… [^116T9zJ8]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

van de Velde's observation as to the existence of variations in body temperature during phases of the menstrual cycle was cited in a previous editorial. 1 Rubenstein2 correlated a study of vaginal smears with a study of basal temperature; he found that the basal rectal temperature tends to drop progressively during the phase of follicle development. The low point in the temperature curve is reached when the follicle matures. Barton and Wiesner3 found in their studies of the temperature in several hundred women that the body temperature on waking in the morning varies in fecund women with the phases of the menstrual cycle. A relatively high temperature is characteristic of the premenstrual phase, and it persists after conception. Persistent low temperature excludes the diagnosis of pregnancy. The diphasic temperature cycle may persist in cases of amenorrhea, but more commonly amenorrhea is characterized by a monophasic waking temperature record.

### Menstrual cramps in anovulatory versus normally ovulatory cycles-SARS-COV-2 pandemic daily data plus a meta-analysis of cramps and anovulation [^115a3N1N]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence That Ovulatory Cycles are Necessary for Menstrual Cramps

Assuming that exposure to and a drop in luteal phase progesterone level is necessary for increased prostaglandin production, primary dysmenorrhea or menstrual cramps are thought to occur exclusively in ovulatory cycles. However, there have now been four published investigations showing that the percentage of cycles with menstrual cramps does not vary between ovulatory and anovulatory cycles. Each of these will be discussed in more detail below.

A cross-sectional study conducted by Espin Lopez et al, (2010)in 166 undergraduate university students aged 17–23, demonstrated no difference in the severity of menstrual cramps as well as other symptoms between ovulatory and anovulatory cycles. This investigation utilized basal body temperature by the non-validated "smoothed curve method" to differentiate spontaneous anovulatory cycles from ovulatory cycles. A second study conducted by Seidman et al (2018)recruited 39 adolescents and young adults experiencing primary dysmenorrhea (defined as NRS ≥ 4) and graded cramps using a numerical pain rating scale (NRS) of 0–10. They also studied as controls 52 women/people born with ovaries of reproductive age (PORA) with regular menstrual cycles aged 16–24 years (NRS ≤ 3). All participants had predictable, normal-length menstrual cycles. In this cross-sectional study, participants were asked to test urine for the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge that precedes ovulation (using either the OvuQuick ® One-Step Ovulation Predictor, or the ClearBlue Digital Ovulation Test ®) starting several days before predicted ovulation. They contacted investigators at the time of a positive result (meaning an LH surge of ≥ 40 mIU/mL). One hundred sixty-eight cycles were tracked among the 91 participants and results indicated that participants in the control group had an overall significantly higher incidence of anovulatory cycles at 37.1% compared to those with LH surge-positive ovulatory cycles (17.5%). However, within those with menstrual cramps, there was no significant difference in daily reporting of pain between anovulatory and ovulatory cycles.

### Understanding wrist skin temperature changes to hormone variations across the menstrual cycle [^117XX62D]. Npj Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have found that E3G contributes to a cooling effect days within ovulation, while progesterone plays a key role in the elevation of body temperature in the luteal phase. Consistent with previous research findings, we observed a biphasic pattern of WST with the lowest values coinciding with peak levels of E3G and LH and the highest values occurring during the luteal phase after a dramatic decrease in LH. Since progesterone acts as a primary inhibitor of LH, the negative correlation observed between LH and body temperature is likely a result of its interaction with estrogen and progesterone throughout the menstrual cycle. Additionally, the positive quadratic relationship between E3G and nightly WST is likely associated with the interaction between LH and progesterone during the luteal phase, wherein peak progesterone levels result in elevated body temperature.

WST troughed around two days near the mid-cycle hormone peaks, and WST peaked approximately 7 days after. However, our study revealed a higher degree of variation compared to previous works that reported 0–2 days as the time between hormone peaks and resting-state body temperature nadirs, and 1–4 days as the time between hormone peaks and resting-state body temperature peaks. This discrepancy may be attributed to differences in detecting ovulation based on temperature measured at peripheral versus internal body sites. Zhu et al.achieved higher true-positive and false-positive rates in ovulation detection when using WST instead of BBT, but we did not account for such discrepancies in our data analysis plan. Another explanation for the discrepancy between our work and prior literature is variation in hormonal concentrations between and within individuals at different time points across their menstrual cycles. Prior studies have not collected longitudinal hormonal data because of the burden it imposes on study participants. resulting in a limited scope of how hormone variation at different time points influence cycle phase timing and thermoregulation.

### Menotropins (menopur) [^114SsEv4]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.10	Laboratory Tests

In most instances, treatment of women with MENOPUR will result only in follicular growth and maturation. In the absence of an endogenous LH surge, hCG is given when monitoring of the woman indicates that sufficient follicular development has occurred. This may be estimated by ultrasound alone or in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels. The combination of both ultrasound and serum estradiol measurement are useful for monitoring follicular growth and maturation, timing of the ovulatory trigger, detecting ovarian enlargement and minimizing the risk of the OHSS and multiple gestation.

The clinical confirmation of ovulation is obtained by direct or indirect indices of progesterone production as well as sonographic evidence of ovulation.

Direct or indirect indices of progesterone production:

Urinary or serum luteinizing hormone (LH) rise
A rise in basal body temperature
Increase in serum progesterone
Menstruation following the shift in basal body temperature

### Use of ovulation predictor kits as adjuncts when using fertility awareness methods (FAMs): a pilot study [^116L8rMF]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Difficult clinical signs such as confusing cervical mucus or erratic basal body temperature can make the use of fertility awareness methods (FAMs) difficult in some cases. The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of using a cheap urinary luteinizing hormone (LH)-surge identification kit as an adjunct to identify the infertile phase after ovulation when facing these scenarios.

Methods

The study used a block-allocation, crossover, 2-arm methodology (LH kit/FAM vs FAM only). Comparison of the 2 arms was done with regard to the accuracy of identification (yes/no) of the luteal phase in each cycle as confirmed by serum progesterone concentrations.

Results

We recruited 23 Canadian women currently using FAM, aged 18 to 48 years, who have had menstrual cycles 25 to 35 days long for the past 3 months and perceive themselves to have difficulty with identifying the infertile phase after ovulation. LH kits identified 100% of the luteal phases, whereas FAM indentified 87% (statistically significant). In those identified cycles, LH kits provided a mean of 10.3 days of infertility, and FAM only provided 10 days of infertility (not statistically significant).

Conclusions

Among this population, LH kits may offer an adjunct for women who may wish to have an additional double-check. However, there are still clinical circumstances when even an LH kit does not provide confirmation. More research in this area is encouraged.

### Age-dependent and seasonal changes in menstrual cycle length and body temperature based on big data [^112CNt7W]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Several smartphone application–based studies have recently reported descriptive statistics for menstrual cycle length and BBT. – However, these studies had major limitations in terms of relatively small numbers of cycle data and limited numbers of cycles per person (2.5–5 cycles per person). Application users in these studies were also biased to women who wanted to become pregnant, resulting in very limited generalizability. The nature of the application used in the current study, which has been used by the Japanese female population for both contraception and to become pregnant, allowed us to use data that were less prone to selection bias.

This study had some limitations. First, there could be selection bias associated with being an active application user. It was expected that females who were self-motivated and could input details into the application and those who were sexually active would be more likely to use this application. Second, most cycle data in our application lacked information on body size (ie, height and weight), resulting in decreased power to detect potential effects of body size on cycle length and BBT. Although larger studies are warranted to confirm our result that there is no relationship between body size and cycle length, this could be true considering the fact that height and weight are not involved in irregular menstrual cycles in PCOS. Third, we did not have data on ovulation; thus, our sample may have included cycles with anovulation as seen in females with PCOS, hypothalamic amenorrhea, or hyperprolactinemia. However, our subanalyses using cycle data restricted to 15–45 days also showed age-dependent changes in menstrual cycle length and the association between external temperature and BBT; thus, it is unlikely our principal findings were driven by such outliers. Similarly, it is possible that our sample included cycle data obtained from those taking oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). However, considering the very low proportion of OCP usage for contraception in the Japanese female population (1.0%), we believe the effect of data derived from OCP users would be minimal. Fourth, this study was conducted in a single country (Japan) with relatively uniform genetic background. Although it is suggested that age-dependent changes in BBT do not depend on ethnic variations, and age-dependent changes in menstrual cycle length similar to those in our study have been reported in a recent study that enrolled Caucasian participants, menstrual cycle length and BBT are known to vary by ethnicity. Thus, our findings on BBT should be tested in other areas and in other ethnicities to draw reliable conclusions.

Table 1.
Effects of Age, Season, and Year on Menstrual Cycle Length and Basal Body Temperature, Adjusting for Correlations Within the Same Participant Using Generalized Estimating Equations

Visualization of the external average temperature of Hokkaido and Okinawa and the average follicle phase body temperature of females living in these prefectures both showed a similar seasonality (Appendix 6A and B, available online at). The correlation between climate and menstrual cycle length and BBT estimated using multiple regression analysis adjusted for age is shown in Table 2. There was little association between climactic factors and cycle length. External average temperature was weakly correlated with BBT (beta = 0.128 and 0.088 in the follicular and luteal phases, respectively) and cycle length (beta = −0.016), and sunshine hours were weakly correlated with follicular phase temperature (beta = −0.016) and cycle length (0.009); there were no significant correlations between BBT and precipitation amount.

Table 2.
Effects of Climate and Participant Age on Menstrual Cycle Length and Basal Body Temperature, Multiple Regression Analysis

A subanalysis focusing on cycles with 15–45 days showed results similar to those from all data with cycles with 7–90 days. Age-dependent changes in menstrual cycle length were comparable with those calculated from all data (Appendix 7A, available online at). Results from the generalized estimating equation analysis (corresponding to Table 1, Appendix 8, available online at) and multiple regression analysis (corresponding to Table 2, Appendix 9, available online at) were also similar. Interestingly, histograms on ΔBBT showed similar distributions, with a peak around 0.4°C (Appendix 7B and C,), suggesting that most females with cycle lengths of 45–90 days probably have delayed ovulation (oligo-ovulation) but not anovulation.

### Age-dependent and seasonal changes in menstrual cycle length and body temperature based on big data [^117UV3to]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Basal body temperature can be self-measured. Basal body temperature is known to increase by 0.3–0.5°C as a result of the action of progesterone on the hypothalamic body temperature center. Because BBT remains stable, it may be possible to predict the date of ovulation by daily monitoring. Although the American Society for Reproductive Medicine reports that the use of BBT should be discouraged because of its inconvenience and because it was not useful for determining luteal phase deficiency, the biphasic nature of the menstrual cycle is a useful indicator for women who want to become pregnant. However, there is currently no clear age-specific standard data, such as means and SDs, for BBT changes. The current results revealed that follicular phase temperature did not show any significant age-dependent changes but that luteal phase temperature gradually increased from the teens, stabilized from the late 20s to the early 40s, and then gradually decreased.

Information on the effects of the environmental factors on the menstrual cycle and BBT is lacking. The present study shows that BBT increased during warm periods and decreased during cold periods and suggests that BBT may differ by climate. The climate is mainly characterized by external temperature, precipitation amount, and sunshine hours. One strength of our study is that Japan has wide geographical characteristics and uniquely consists of islands with both subarctic and subtropical climateswhile also having relatively uniform eating habits, educational standards, and lifestyle habits throughout the country, thus making it easier to study the effect of climate. Hokkaido, the northernmost region, has a subarctic climate, with large temperature differences from month to month and lower annual precipitation and ultraviolet irradiation; Okinawa, as the southernmost region, has a subtropical, always warm climate, with fewer temperature differences throughout the year and higher annual precipitation and ultraviolet irradiation. Confirmation of our findings is anticipated in other populations, though it may be difficult to find participants living in a large variety of climates maintaining similar living habits. Although our study suggests only an association between climate and women's health, a recent study reports that a lower BBT can support a slower rate of aging. Such findings raise an alarm that recent global warming and environmental changes throughout the world may have effects on human health and longevity.

### Urinary-based ovulation and pregnancy: point-of-care testing [^117AVUAt]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature concerning ovulation prediction devices and pregnancy detection tests for home use.

Data Sources

Articles were identified through searches of the MEDLINE (1966-May 2003), EMBASE (1980-May 2003), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-May 2003) databases using the key words ovulation, ovulation detection, pregnancy test, diagnostic reagent kit, and diagnostic test. Additional references were located through review of the bibliographies of the articles found in the literature search. Searches were not limited by time restriction, language, or use of human or animal subjects.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Review articles, textbook chapters, and experimental and observational studies on home use ovulation and pregnancy tests were selected.

Data Synthesis

Luteinizing hormone (LH)-based ovulation tests have demonstrated accurate and superior ovulation detection when compared to basal body temperature charting, calendar calculation, salivary ferning, or observation of vaginal or cervical discharge changes. Systems using LH and estrone-3-glucuronide (E3G) have also demonstrated accurate detection of the fertile period. Literature evaluating home use of pregnancy tests has demonstrated accurate use by lay persons.

Conclusions

Urinary-based ovulation prediction and pregnancy detection tests available for use by nonprofessionals enable women and couples to take an active role in the family planning process. Numerous products are available at reasonable costs to the consumer.

Tatsumi. Changes in Menstrual Cycle Length and Body Temperature. Obstet Gynecol 2020.

Regarding BBT, average follicular phase temperature showed no significant age-dependent changes, with the greatest variance among teenagers (Fig. 1 B). However, luteal phase temperature showed an age-dependent change, with values gradually increasing up to the late 20s, peaking at 36.71°C at age 29 years, and then stabilizing and starting to decrease after age 42 years (Fig. 1 C). The variance in luteal phase temperature was similar to that in follicular phase temperature. The mean ΔBBT showed similar age-dependent changes to luteal phase temperature, being stable from 27 to 42 years, with a maximum of +0.301°C at age 33 years (Fig. 1 D). A subanalysis that restricted cycles to one cycle per participant to eliminate the bias related to repeated sampling showed results similar to those obtained from all-cycle data (Appendix 5A–C, available online at). The proportion of cycles with biphasic body temperature varied depending on the age group: 15–19 years, 67%; 20–24 years, 78%; 25–29 years, 88%; 30–34 years, 91%; 35–39 years, 91%; 40–44 years, 89%; 45–50 years, 81%; and 50–54 years, 69%.

We investigated the effects of season on menstrual cycle length and BBT. There was no correlation between menstrual cycle length and season (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, BBT showed clear seasonality. Both follicular and luteal phase temperatures were higher in summer and lower in winter (Fig. 2 B and C), indicating that BBT was associated with environmental factors. Generalized estimating equation analysis also confirmed the significant effect of age on cycle length and luteal phase temperature, as well as showed the presence of seasonality in both follicular and luteal phase temperature; no such seasonality was seen in cycle length (Table 1).

### Timing intercourse to achieve pregnancy: current evidence [^113iSMw1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Physicians who counsel women for preconception concerns are in an excellent position to give advice to couples regarding the optimal timing of intercourse to achieve pregnancy. The currently available evidence suggests that methods that prospectively identify the window of fertility are likely to be more effective for optimally timing intercourse than calendar calculations or basal body temperature. There are several promising methods with good scientific bases to identify the fertile window prospectively. These include fertility charting of vaginal discharge and a commercially available fertility monitor. These methods identify the occurrence of ovulation clinically and also identify a longer window of fertility than urinary luteinizing hormone kits. Prospectively identifying the full window of fertility may lead to higher rates of conception. Proper information given early in the course of trying to achieve pregnancy is likely to reduce time to conception for many couples, and also to reduce unnecessary intervention and cost.

### Experimental and procedural pain responses in primary dysmenorrhea: a systematic review [^1158gSE4]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Potentially inaccurate assessment of cycle phase

A very concerning issue with previously published studies is the lack of accurate assessment of cycle phase. There is a large body of literature examining the extent of the influence of gonadal hormones on pain perception,–and the consensus is that gonadal hormones, including the use of oral contraceptives or exogenous hormones, impacts pain perception or modulation.–The failure of many studies to clearly assess menstrual cycle phase may contribute to difficulty assessing pain responses in women with and without PD. For example, the earliest study by Haman, Cox and Meyer, and Slater et aldid not account for menstrual cycle phase at all during the testing period. However, the vast majority of other studies relied on a relatively inaccurate "calendar method", whereby day 1 of the cycle is the first day of menstruation, day 14 is the day when ovulation is assumed to occur, and day 28 is assumed to be the final day before menstruation begins (end of cycle). The variability in the length of the follicular phase, particularly in adolescents, is well known. Some studies have attempted to use additional indices to confirm menstrual cycle phase such as basal body temperature, plasma sampling for estradiol and progesterone, or self-test ovulation kits. However, these tests were performed during a single-day laboratory session (as opposed to across multiple days that may better capture the precise timing of ovulation, etc.), and it is curious why no reported subjects were excluded due to lack of ovulation or hormonal measures indicating the incorrect cycle phase. Incorrect assessment of ovulation may obscure important variations in pain reactivity across the menstrual cycle, thereby preventing a more clear understanding of hormonal influences on pain in PD.

One possible option for future studies is to continue to assess participants during a painful phase (menstruation) and non-painful phase (any part of the cycle the participant identifies as non-painful), and gather hormonal measurements to include as covariates in analyses. Estradiol and progesterone can be easily gathered through salivary collection methods. The influence of gonadal hormones can then be considered, without having to rely on self-report of cycle phase, or the assumption that all participants experience 28-day cycles.

### Return of ovulation and menses in postpartum nonlactating women: a systematic review [^117VdCdZ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To estimate, from the literature, when nonlactating postpartum women regain fertility.

Data Sources

We searched PubMed and Cochrane Library databases for all articles (in all languages) published in peer-reviewed journals from database inception through May 2010 for evidence related to the return of ovulation and menses in nonlactating postpartum women. Search terms included "Fertility" (Mesh) OR "Ovulation" (Mesh) OR "Ovulation Detection" (Mesh) OR "Ovulation Prediction" (Mesh) OR fertility OR ovulat* AND "Postpartum Period" (Mesh) OR postpartum OR puerperium AND Human AND Female.

Methods Of Study Selection

We included articles assessing nonlactating women's first ovulation postpartum. Studies in which women breastfed for any period of time or in whom lactation was suppressed with medications were excluded.

Tabulation, Integration and Results

We identified 1,623 articles; six articles reported four studies met our inclusion criteria. In three studies utilizing urinary pregnanediol levels to measure ovulation, mean day of first ovulation ranged from 45 to 94 days postpartum; 20%-71% of first menses were preceded by ovulation and 0%-60% of these ovulations were potentially fertile. In one study that used basal body temperature to measure ovulation, mean first ovulation occurred on day 74 postpartum; 33% of first menses were preceded by ovulation and 70% of these were potentially fertile.

Conclusion

Most nonlactating women will not ovulate until 6 weeks postpartum. A small number of women will ovulate earlier, potentially putting them at risk for pregnancy sooner, although the fertility of these early ovulations is not well-established. The potential risk of pregnancy soon after delivery underscores the importance of initiating postpartum contraception in a timely fashion.

### Macular, choroidal and disc associations across women's reproductive life stages: a scoping review from menarche to post-menopause [^116qa1VL]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Determining menstrual cycle phase

Various methods exist for reporting menstrual cycle phases, each with its strengths and weaknesses. These include relying solely on self-reported information, utilising published ranges for ovarian hormone levels (with direct assays available in saliva, blood serum, blood plasma, and urine), combining self-report with hormonal levels or basal body temperature, and examining within-person changes in ovarian hormone levels collected multiple times over the cycle. While self-reporting alone is very common, it is the weakest method in isolation. However, if the calculation of the menstrual cycle phase is transparent and standardised, using it as a proxy for hormonal action could be acceptable since it is the most cost-effective and minimally burdensome for participants. Since it lacks the precision to identify specific cycle subphases, such as early, mid, or late phases, when used in isolation, the identification of ovulation exhibits the lowest accuracy and should not be considered. Finally, it is recommended that cycle tracking by the participants be initiated a couple of months before answering self-report questionnaires and that ovarian hormonal levels are used in conjunction with self-reporting.

Determining menopausal status

Spontaneous menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of menstrual periods, established retrospectively after a woman has undergone 12 consecutive months of amenorrhoea without any apparent alternative cause. Determining menopausal status is a more straightforward process, often defined by questionnaire. Longitudinal studies would be particularly valuable for understanding the impact of perimenopause through menopause within individuals, extending beyond chronological age. Caution is advised when including participants in perimenopause as controls since this period has irregular cycle lengths and anovulatory cycles. In the case of potential perimenopausal participants, the staging system 'Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW + 10)' for participants aged 40 and above helps in calculating their menopausal status. Finally, in studies exploring pre- and post-menopausal changes, maintaining consistency in the menstrual cycle phase of the pre-menopausal group is crucial for obtaining reliable and comparable results.

Contraception

In the investigation of the natural menstrual cycle or menopause, it is recommended that cycling participants have experienced a minimum of two natural cycles after discontinuing hormonal contraceptives. This approach allows for a more accurate representation of the physiological changes associated with the cycle. Furthermore, consistent exclusion of all types of hormonal contraception and not only oral contraceptives, including hormonal intra-uterine devices, implants, or injections, is essential to minimise confounding variables and enhance the internal validity of the research findings.

### Age-dependent and seasonal changes in menstrual cycle length and body temperature based on big data [^114BAM81]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

The data were analyzed among users ranging in age from 15.0 to 54.9 years, with most participants being in their mid-30s (Appendix 2A, available online at). The distribution of the participants' residences was similar to the distribution of the general Japanese population reported by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications(Pearson's correlation, r = 0.984, P < .001; Appendix 2B,), suggesting that the data reflected the Japanese female population in general. There was no clear relationship between residence and cycle length distribution by age (Appendix 2C and D). We confirmed that the cycle data were derived from participants using the application for pregnancy planning and for contraception (Appendix 3, available online at). The number of children was significantly correlated with age (r = 0.739, P = 0.153). Married participants or those with partners were older than unmarried participants or those without partners (mean age 30.8 vs 25.5, 29.9 vs 27.7, respectively). The mean body mass index (BMI calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of the participants was 22.8 ± 4.1, and there was no relationship between cycle length and height (Appendix 4A, available online at) or weight (Appendix 4B).

Menstrual cycle length data were aggregated by age at the start of each cycle, and the mean and SD values were calculated (Fig. 1 A). An increase in menstrual cycle length was observed from age 15 years to the early 20s. The longest mean menstrual cycle length of 30.7 days was observed at age 23 years; this then decreased to 27.3 days at age 45 years and then increased. The variance in cycle length was relatively large among participants younger than age 20 years or older than 45 years, with the smallest variance in participants aged 41 years.

Ovulatory dysfunction

Ovulatory disorders exist on a spectrum (Figure 4) that encompasses occasional delayed or failed ovulation to a chronic process that can cause amenorrhea or manifest with bleeding that varies in volume, duration, and frequency.

FIGURE 4
Typically, but not always, these disorders manifest abnormalities in FIGO System 1 parameters that describe menstrual bleeding pattern: frequency, regularity, duration and volume of bleeding.

Whereas the diagnosis of AUB‐O is generally suggested by a history of irregular bleeding obtained via FIGO's AUB System 1, the specific cause of the ovulatory disorder requires a structured evaluation. While ovulatory status can usually be suggested from FIGO System 1, when there is a lack of clarity other measures may be employed, including daily measurement of basal body temperature or obtaining serum progesterone in the suspected luteal phase of the cycle.

Recently, a classification system for ovulatory disorders was developed under the aegis of FIGO by the Committees for Menstrual Disorders and Related Health Impacts (formerly the Menstrual Disorders Committee) and Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. The development involved journal editors, recognized experts, and national, subspecialty, and lay societies from around the world to achieve international consensus for replacing a system developed over 50 years ago by the WHO. The new system comprises three anatomic categories, as well as a separate category for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which are recognized in the acronym "HyPO‐P": Type 1 (Hypothalamic); Type 2 (Pituitary); Type 3 (Ovarian); and Type 4 (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) (Figure 5). Each of the three anatomic categories includes a list of subtypes that follow the acronym GAIN‐FIT‐PIE (Genetic, Autoimmune, Iatrogenic, Neoplasm, Functional, Infectious and Inflammatory, Trauma, and Vascular; Physiological, Idiopathic, Endocrine) reflecting the various possible mechanisms within a given anatomical location. The investigational pathway for an individual with an ovulatory disorder is dependent upon a number of factors, including age, reproductive goals, and the suspected causes based on the initial evaluation.

FIGURE 5
The proposed FIGO classification system for ovulatory disorders. This system allows for an initial allocation of presumed primary source of ovulatory dysfunction (i.e. hypothalamus, pituitary gland, or ovary). Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is defined separately and the WHO classification system for the same should be adopted. After anatomical allocation, known or presumed mechanism is classified according to the GAIN‐FIT‐PIE acronym, as appropriate and applicable.

### Pregnancy postponement and childlessness leads to chronic hypervascularity of the breasts and cancer risk [^1176i8Zz]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

In all instances we also obtained the middle line (the so-called Mesor) of a tau = 28-day cosine function fitted by least squares to the 28 data. In the averaging procedure, missing data were filled by linear interpolation. In practice, the 'averaging' or Mesor methods gave a very similar 28-day result. Underlying this method, as in the counting backwards from the next cycle method, is the observation that the length of the menstrual cycle consists of a fairly constant luteal phase (c. 12 days) and an inconstant follicular phase. Over 1000 women, of the same order of age as studied here, the standard deviation of the length of the pre-ovulatory phase was 4–5 days, whereas the luteal phase was under 2 days (see, p 158).

The subject also collected a daily 1 mL saliva sample for progesterone analysis to assess the 'luteal status' of the particular cycle (Fahmy et al, 1982). She also recorded daily oral temperature measurements (so-called basal body temperature). Exclusion criteria included anovulatory cycles, fever, certain medications and more than 4 days of missing data. Regarding the oral temperature measurements, occasionally oral temperature was used to assess objectively the situation when subjects reported feeling unwell. In this instance investigators could decide whether to discontinue on the grounds of 'fever'.

### Real-world menstrual cycle characteristics of more than 600, 000 menstrual cycles [^112t4XN3]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The menstrual cycle begins and ends with menstruation and is divided by ovulation into the follicular and luteal phases. The fertile window, during which there is a probability of conception from unprotected sex, is defined as the day of ovulation and the 5 days preceding it (the time window for sperm survival). Clinical guidelines state that a woman's median cycle length is 28 days with most falling in the 25–30 day range and that the luteal phase is almost always 14 days long, but there is much greater variation than this.– The variation in cycle length is attributed mainly to the timing of ovulation. Nevertheless, the length of the luteal phase may also deviate significantly from 14 days. For example, the luteal phase length was between 7 and 19 days in a sample of 28 day cycles. With increasing age, cycle length reduces and the timing of ovulation becomes earlier; the variation of a woman's cycle length reduces with age until menopause. Cycle characteristics also may be affected by ethnicity, high body mass index (BMI), stress and lifestyle factors.– Whilst such variations in cycle parameters have previously been observed in controlled studies there is a lack of knowledge about fundamental characterisitics of the menstrual cycle in the general population.

There are more than 100 fertility awareness based (FAB) mobile apps with more than 200 million downloadsand they are becoming increasingly popular for contraception – and pregnancy planning. The FAB apps can be separated into three categories: calendar apps that look at the length of the menstrual cycle and assume average phase lengths, basal body temperature (BBT; defined as lowest resting body temperature) based apps that detect the BBT rise, – and symptothermal apps that also measure other parameters such as cervical mucus changes. Home urinary luteinising hormone (LH) tests may also be used to determine fertile daysor used as input to BBT methods to improve the accuracy of ovulation detection. All those apps relying on calendar methods to assign the fertile days assume that our historic understanding of the menstrual cycle is correct (ovulation 14 days before the next period). Available data, however, suggests that there may be significant variability in fertile days. Therefore, women who wish to track their fertile days for the purposes of pregnancy prevention or pregnancy planning need to understand their own cycle characteristics rather than relying on a standardised cycle.

### Menstrual cramps in anovulatory versus normally ovulatory cycles-SARS-COV-2 pandemic daily data plus a meta-analysis of cramps and anovulation [^1138zwdF]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

It is asserted that primary dysmenorrhea/menstrual cramps only occur in ovulatory menstrual cycles. Our first objective was to present detailed menstrual cramps information in normally ovulatory versus anovulatory cycles from a single-cycle cohort study during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic. Secondly, we reviewed the literature for cohort studies documenting both menstrual cramps and ovulation.

Participants and Methods

The Menstruation and Ovulation Study 2 recruited 108 women ages 19–35 years to a prospective, observational single-cycle study, recording cramps daily (0–4 scale) in the Menstrual Cycle Diary© and assessing normal ovulation (luteal length ≥ 10 days) by the validated Quantitative Basal Temperature© (Mean Temperature Method). We searched databases for « primary dysmenorrhea » / » menstrual cramps »; « menstrual cycles »; « anovulation », finding four valid publications.

Results

In 75 women/cycles during the Pandemic, mean age was 28.5, body mass index 23.5, and higher education (16 years); 40 normally ovulatory and 35 anovulatory cycles had similar lengths (29.5–30.0 days), respectively (P = 0.571). However, anovulatory cycles recorded significantly worse menstrual cramps versus normally ovulatory cycles; anovulatory median intensity was 1.9 versus 1.6, and Cramp Score was 8 versus 6 in normally ovulatory cycles (P = 0.017). Four publications in 273 women (991 cycles) showed cramps in both anovulatory and ovulatory cycles; three were in adolescent/young adult women, one of which documented a significantly greater percentage of cramps in ovulatory cycles. The 694 cycles in premenopausal women (20–41 years) showed similar percentages of symptomatic cramps in cycles of both ovulatory types. Meta-analysis documented significantly higher cramp prevalence in ovulatory cycles (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.31, 3.37; P = 0.002).

Conclusion

This is the first documentation of more intense and frequent cramps in anovulatory cycles. However, meta-analysis showing the presence of symptomatic cramps in both ovulatory and anovulatory cycles documented they were twice as prevalent in ovulatory menstrual cycles.

### Assessment of menstrual health status and evolution through mobile apps for fertility awareness [^115H1HMz]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A broad diversity of fertility awareness methods (FAMs) has been developed in the past century, primarily designed to help couples manage fertility and family planning. Modern methods developed in the last quarter of the twentieth century take advantage of the precise description of menstrual variation of the basal body temperature (BBT) or waking temperature, taken with a thermometer with a 0.01 °C or 0.5 °F precision, cervical mucus quality and quantity, vaginal sensation, and cervical position. – These methods have defined a set of rules that allows the identification of the fertile window around ovulation, so that couples can adapt their sexual behavior according to their reproductive objectives. – The sympto-thermal method, which combines BBT and cervical mucus observations, is arguably amongst the most reliable FAM for family planning. Recently, a number of mobile apps have been developed by private organizations to facilitate FAM tracking. Some of these apps provide their users with automatized interpretation with regard to the opening and closing of the fertility window. Over the past few years, an increasing number of women, estimated at over 200 million in 2016, have started using these apps, contributing to the accumulation of menstrual-related data (Fig. 1) from a diverse population of users at different stage of life (Fig. 2a; Table 1, see Methods).

Menstrual history of two app users. Menstrual history of two long term Kindara a and Sympto b users. Time is shown in years as relative to the first observation of each user. Kindara user is seeking to achieve pregnancy and shows a long anovulatory episode during which her overall temperature is lower. She returns to more regular, ovulatory cycles in her last year of tracking, as indicated by the bleeding frequency and the temperature profiles. The Sympto user has used the app to avoid pregnancy and observe her cycle for almost 3 years, before trying to conceive, which she likely achieves after 9 cycles (her reported cycle-specific reproductive objective switches from "contraception" to "conception" — line "any tracking" at the bottom). Nine months later, the user reports bleeding, which likely indicates post-partum bleeding (lochia). After another 9 months, probably as she stops breastfeeding, she logs menstrual observations and returns to using the app to avoid pregnancy

### Synchronised approach for intrauterine insemination in subfertile couples [^1173zK8m]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is widely used as a first-line treatment for subfertile couples with favourable prognostic factors, yet pregnancy rates vary considerably. The optimal method for timing IUI - whether through different monitoring strategies or ovulation triggering techniques in natural or stimulated cycles - remains uncertain. This review explores which timing approaches and methods of ovulation monitoring and triggering lead to the best outcomes, including live birth and clinical pregnancy. It updates a Cochrane review last published in 2014.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of different methods of synchronisation of insemination with ovulation on live birth or ongoing pregnancy, in natural and stimulated cycles for IUI in subfertile couples.

Search Methods

We used the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and two other databases, along with reference checking, citation searching, handsearching of conference abstracts, and contact with study authors to identify the studies included in the review. The latest search date was October 2023.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing timing methods in natural or stimulated cycles, and different ovulation triggering methods. These included: varying the time interval between ovulation triggering and insemination, luteinising hormone (LH) detection in urine, LH detection in blood, basal body temperature charts, ultrasound detection of ovulation, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration, a combination of LH detection and hCG administration, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist administration, and other trigger administrations.

Outcomes

Critical outcome: live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate per couple. Important outcomes (all are rate per couple): clinical pregnancy; multiple pregnancy; miscarriage; ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome; tubal pregnancy.

Risk Of Bias

We used the Cochrane Collaboration's original tool to assess the risk of bias in the included RCTs.

Synthesis Methods

After the search, we screened the trials, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias and trustworthiness of the included studies. We synthesised results for each outcome using meta-analysis where possible. We expressed results for each included study as Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Included Studies

This review update includes 42 studies: 18 from the 2014 version, plus 24 studies newly identified in the updated search.

Synthesis Of Results

Of the 42 included studies (a total of 6603 couples), we included seven in the primary meta-analyses (1917 couples) and 12 in the sensitivity meta-analyses (2143 couples). The certainty of the evidence was low for most comparisons. The main limitation of the evidence was serious imprecision. Of the seven studies included in the primary analyses, two compared the optimum time interval from hCG injection to IUI for live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate, comparing different time frames ranging from 0 to 48 hours. We categorised the time frames into three groups: (i) 0 to 33 hours; (ii) 34 to 40 hours; and (iii) more than 40 hours. We compared 0 to 33 hours versus 34 to 40 hours, and 34 to 40 hours versus more than 40 hours. Results were too imprecise to be informative in both comparisons (0 to 33 hours versus 34 to 40 hours: OR 1.42, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.23; 1 study, 374 couples; 34 to 40 hours versus more than 40 hours: OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.33; 1 study, 107 couples). We included one study in the primary analysis for each of the following comparisons: hCG versus LH surge; recombinant hCG versus urinary hCG; and hCG alone versus hCG plus follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). It is unclear whether there might be a difference in live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates in the first two comparisons: hCG versus LH surge: OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.37; 1 study, 392 couples; low-certainty evidence; recombinant hCG versus urinary hCG: OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.63; 1 study, 125 couples; low-certainty evidence. However, live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates may be lower with hCG alone compared to hCG plus FSH (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.95; 1 study, 108 couples; low-certainty evidence). We found no clear evidence of a difference between any of the groups in clinical pregnancy rate or adverse events (multiple pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, tubal pregnancy rate). However, all results were of low-certainty evidence. None of the studies included in the primary analyses reported on ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there is any difference in effectiveness between different methods of synchronisation of ovulation and insemination.
