## Question

What are the primary symptoms of RA?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the primary symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, organized by phase and supported by evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease phases and why timing matters for symptom interpretation. Then, I should verify the cardinal musculoskeletal features that define inflammatory arthritis. Next, I will review systemic and extra-articular manifestations that commonly accompany RA. After that, I need to consider early, pre-arthritis symptom complexes and how they differ from established disease. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, phase-specific summary and double-check that I align with classification anchors and contemporary reviews to ensure clinical accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the disease phases because symptom patterns vary with stage. RA evolves from a preclinical phase with systemic autoimmunity, to a symptomatic at-risk phase often termed clinically suspect arthralgia, to undifferentiated arthritis, and finally to classifiable RA; this staged model is widely adopted and helps frame why early symptoms may be subtle before overt synovitis appears [^1157PNj6] [^116EXhgQ] [^116YANLt].

> I will now examine the cardinal musculoskeletal features that anchor diagnosis. The primary symptoms are joint pain, swelling, and morning stiffness, typically symmetric and involving small joints of the hands, wrists, and feet; morning stiffness lasting longer than 30 minutes is particularly characteristic and distinguishes inflammatory from mechanical arthropathies, and these features are embedded in the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria and contemporary primers [^111GmfGE] [^113YGn6o] [^115XA9R6].

> Wait, let me verify the systemic and extra-articular manifestations that often accompany established RA. Fatigue and malaise are common and can persist even when joint counts improve, reflecting both inflammatory and noninflammatory drivers; patients may report low-grade fever, weight loss, and generalized weakness, and over time RA can involve lungs (interstitial lung disease, airways disease), cardiovascular system (accelerated atherosclerosis), eyes (scleritis/episcleritis), skin (rheumatoid nodules), and hematologic abnormalities, with cardiovascular and respiratory disease contributing substantially to mortality [^11226zQU] [^113Y24Mn] [^113zgFr9] [^1172UL6Q].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about early disease mimicking established RA. In the pre-arthritis and clinically suspect arthralgia phases, patients frequently report joint pain without clinically detectable synovitis, stiffness that may be less classic, profound fatigue, sleep disturbance, and neuropathic-type sensations such as tingling or burning; these symptom complexes often precede overt arthritis by months and are well described in qualitative syntheses and early-phase cohorts, though they are not captured by classification criteria designed for synovitis-based disease [^116BYKre] [^114c4BbW] [^1157PNj6].

> Let me consider the temporal evolution and patterns because they refine suspicion. Symptoms may begin insidiously with vague aches and intermittent stiffness, or abruptly with severe pain and functional loss. Some patients describe palindromic episodes with migratory pain that later consolidates into persistent synovitis, and importantly, the first 3–6 months after symptom onset represent a therapeutic window wherein early DMARD initiation alters long-term outcomes, underscoring why recognizing these early patterns matters clinically [^112njHt2] [^116cxVEe] [^115zXzDq].

> I should double-check how classification criteria relate to symptoms in practice. The 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria require at least one joint with definite clinical synovitis not better explained by another disease, then score joint distribution, serology (RF/ACPA), acute-phase reactants, and symptom duration; while not diagnostic per se, they operationalize the core musculoskeletal features clinicians rely on, and their emphasis on ACPA reflects both predictive and prognostic value in early disease [^112qeuM5] [^111GmfGE].

> But wait, what if symptoms are dominated by fatigue or pain outside the 28-joint count; could that still reflect active RA. Yes, patients may have active disease in feet, ankles, hips, or cervical spine that inflate global assessments despite low joint counts, and fatigue often tracks poorly with inflammatory markers, so I need to ensure I interpret symptoms in the context of the entire musculoskeletal system and patient-reported impact rather than relying solely on limited joint counts or composite scores [^114GKbCH] [^11226zQU].

> Let me reconsider the primary symptom synthesis to ensure I have not overgeneralized. Across phases, the most consistent and defining symptoms are joint pain, swelling, and morning stiffness, typically symmetric and affecting small joints; systemic features such as fatigue, malaise, and low-grade fever commonly co-occur; in early or pre-arthritis phases, nonspecific musculoskeletal pain, stiffness, fatigue, and neuropathic sensations may predominate before synovitis is clinically evident, which is precisely where heightened vigilance and targeted evaluation can alter outcomes if arthritis emerges [^113YGn6o] [^116BYKre] [^115XA9R6].

---

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) typically presents with **symmetrical joint swelling and tenderness** of the small joints of the hands, wrists, and feet, with **morning stiffness lasting over 30 minutes** [^115XA9R6] [^111p1Et4]. Early symptoms include fatigue, low-grade fever, and weight loss, and extra-articular features such as rheumatoid nodules, interstitial lung disease, and ocular inflammation may occur [^113Y24Mn]. Prompt recognition of these features is essential for early diagnosis and treatment to prevent joint damage and disability [^113YGn6o].

---

## Articular (joint-related) symptoms

Articular symptoms are the **hallmark of RA** and typically include:

- **Symmetrical joint swelling and tenderness**: Commonly affects small joints of the hands, wrists, and feet [^111p1Et4].

- **Morning stiffness**: Lasts longer than 30 minutes, distinguishing RA from osteoarthritis [^115XA9R6].

- **Progressive joint damage**: If untreated, leads to deformity and functional impairment [^1123cHWZ].

---

## Systemic symptoms

RA also presents with **systemic symptoms**, including:

- **Fatigue**: Persistent and debilitating, often disproportionate to disease activity [^1117Y1pv].

- **Low-grade fever**: Common, particularly during disease flares [^notfound].

- **Weight loss**: Unintentional, due to chronic inflammation [^notfound].

---

## Extra-articular manifestations

RA can involve multiple organ systems, with **extra-articular manifestations** including:

| **Organ system** | **Manifestations** |
|-|-|
| Skin | - Rheumatoid nodules <br/> - Vasculitis [^113Y24Mn] |
| Lungs | - Interstitial lung disease <br/> - Pleural effusion <br/> - Rheumatoid nodules [^114UWD62] |
| Cardiovascular | - Pericarditis <br/> - Myocarditis <br/> - Accelerated atherosclerosis [^113Y24Mn] |
| Eyes | - Episcleritis <br/> - Scleritis <br/> - Keratoconjunctivitis sicca [^notfound] |
| Hematologic | - Anemia <br/> - Felty syndrome (neutropenia and splenomegaly) [^notfound] |

---

## Early symptoms and progression

Early RA symptoms may be nonspecific, including **joint pain, stiffness, and fatigue** [^116BYKre]. Over time, persistent inflammation leads to joint destruction, deformity, and disability if untreated [^1172UL6Q] [^1123cHWZ].

---

## Summary of primary symptoms

- **Symmetrical joint swelling and tenderness**: Small joints of hands, wrists, and feet [^111p1Et4].

- **Morning stiffness**: Lasting > 30 minutes [^115XA9R6].

- **Fatigue**: Persistent and debilitating [^1117Y1pv].

- **Low-grade fever and weight loss**: Common systemic symptoms [^1172UL6Q].

- **Extra-articular manifestations**: Skin, lung, cardiovascular, ocular, and hematologic involvement [^113Y24Mn].

---

Recognizing these primary symptoms is essential for **early diagnosis and management** of RA, helping prevent joint damage and improve patient outcomes [^116cxVEe].

### Measuring ACPA in the general population or primary care: is it useful? [^112huTiu]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with a significant disease burden and high costs for society. Because the disease has identifiable preclinical stages, screening and prevention have become a possibility in RA. Anticitrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs) are arguably the most likely candidate biomarker to screen for RA. This paper reviews the evidence for the use of ACPAs as a screening test in the broader general population, to identify individuals at high risk of subsequent onset of RA. We will review the diagnostic properties of the test and its positive and negative predictive value in different settings. We will discuss how ACPA testing could effectively be integrated in a broader screening strategy for RA.

Results

Study characteristics

The clinical trials included are listed in Table 1. Active treatment groups were defined as patients receiving the new immunomodulatory drug at any dose. Treatment and placebo groups may have received concomitant medication as detailed in Supplementary Table 1.

For each study we used self-reported measures of mood and anhedonia at baseline to stratify patients into two subgroups, designated as high or low depressive. The proportion of patients belonging to the high depressive stratum varied between studies categorized by primary disorder (Table 1; Fig. 1a), with the greatest proportion of high depressive patients in studies of rheumatoid arthritis (P = 0.004, 2-tailed t -test, rheumatoid arthritis vs. all other disorders). Baseline CRP was measured in most studies and the mean baseline CRP (averaged across all patients in each study) correlated positively with the proportion of high depressive patients (Pearson R² = 0.32, P = 0.04, Fig. 1b).

### Predicting rheumatoid arthritis in at-risk individuals [^111gWz1G]. Clinical Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

The typical evolution of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is that a person with genetic risk factors develops autoantibodies and subclinical inflammation under relevant environmental influences, culminating in symptoms and finally clinically detectable arthritis. Because several of these characteristics can be present before the outbreak of clinical arthritis, it is possible to study the at-risk phase (the presence of ≥ 1 risk factors for RA in an individual) with the aim of quantifying the risk for that individual. As a person progresses through the different phases of disease development, different markers can be used for prediction. In the early asymptomatic phase, genetics, environmental factors, and autoantibodies are relevant, whereas in later phases additional markers, such as symptoms and imaging, come into play, conveying the risk of not only RA but sometimes even of imminent RA. Prediction is of limited use when not coupled with the possibility to intervene and lower the risk of RA. There is a clear need for effective preventive strategies that take the phase of disease development into account. On the other hand, selecting the right persons for preventive treatment according to their stage of disease development requires the improvement of current prediction models and strategies. This commentary presents an overview of risk factors and their combination into prediction models for use in different stages of RA development. Although clear progress has been made and assuming a future with effective options to intervene, there are still several gaps in our knowledge that need to be filled before it is clear who should be tested and when.

### Considerations for improving quality of care of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and associated comorbidities [^112cqxB2]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Several challenges in the management of RA and associated comorbidities were identified. Gaps in the care of patients with RA included the following: delays in securing a diagnosis consisting of seeking medical advice (> 12 weeks); referral delays (with a median of 4 visits to the general practitioner before patients are referred to a rheumatologist) leading to an overall delay in diagnosis (in several countries, it can take up to a year from symptom onset); and upon diagnosis and treatment initiation, poor patient adherence to therapy (varying between 30% and 80%) and lack of monitoring (up to 50% of patients do not have access to an regular review in a secondary care setting.) Drivers of these gaps in care were evident at a healthcare system, patient and HCP level (table 1).

Table 1
Gaps in care and their associated drivers evident across the journey of patients with RA

Challenges were also evident throughout the patient pathway for the care of RA-associated comorbidities. One pertinent challenge was the limited guidance for the care of comorbidities in patients with RA (table 2).

Table 2
Gaps in care and their associated drivers evident across the journey of patients with RA-associated comorbidities

Through secondary research, several guidelines and recommendations were identified for some comorbidities, but the presence of guidelines differed depending on the comorbidity (table 3).

Table 3
Guidelines and/or recommendations present for comorbidities in RA

The expert panel recommended to frame the findings of the study against three different stages of disease (table 4).

Table 4
Disease stages

These disease stages were used to segment and prioritise good practice interventions. In total, 18 good practice interventions were identified, through the centre visits, which span across the whole patient pathway. Interventions were highlighted as applicable to one, multiple or all disease stages (table 5).

Table 5
Good practice interventions relevant to the three disease stages of patients with RA

All 18 interventions were reviewed by the expert panel and prioritised by ranking the highest impact on patient outcomes, against each stage of the disease: suspicion of RA; recent diagnosis of RA; established disease (while recognising that for each one of them, patients have distinct needs and requirements). The top three interventions for each disease stage are shown in table 6 and are described in the following sections.

### A multivariable prediction model to identify anti-CCP positive people in those with non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms in primary care [^114PkTGc]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Although the prediction model was developed using data from a large, multicentre prospective cohort, we acknowledge limitations of the data. The majority of the variables comprising the prediction model are subjective and self-reported (i.e. joint pain) meaning that they are subject to a certain amount of bias. The accurate reporting of RA in FDRs relies on participants having knowledge of the medical history of their immediate family and the inability to differentiate between RA and other types of inflammatory arthritis or even OA may cause false reporting of RA. Furthermore, the percentage of participants with a FDR with RA (27%) included in the prediction model appears high, which may in turn influence the predictor variable score in the model. However, FDRs with RA perceive themselves to be at high absolute risk of developing RA and were therefore more likely to present to primary care with new-onset musculoskeletal symptoms. It is important to acknowledge that model scores for individual variables, for example male sex, which at face value is counterintuitive to the RA population, cannot be interpreted clinically; only the total score can be used to indicate predicted likelihood of being anti-CCP positive. One of the hallmark features of RA, EMS, was not collected in this cohort and may have proven to be an important predictor of anti-CCP positivity.

### Viewpoint: could better understanding of risk factors for comorbidities pave the way towards personalized therapy in rheumatoid arthritis? [^111X3Tky]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Rheumatology key messages
Diverse coexisting conditions contribute to RA disease course, treatment efficacy, and quality of life.
Personalized treatment optimally should also consider the individual risk of future development of coexisting conditions.
This risk assessment can be based on the identification of biomarkers for different comorbidities.

RA, although primarily considered a disease of the joints, may affect several other organs as well, and furthermore might be associated with various coexisting conditions. The terminology of these associated conditions is multiple, including extra-articular manifestations and comorbidities, reflecting their complex, often not fully elucidated origin. In addition to joints, several organs can be affected in RA, for example the lungs, heart, blood vessels, bone and the central nervous system. As extra-articular manifestations, we mean conditions that have a clear association with the autoimmune processes of RA. The term comorbidity is widely used for coexisting conditions of different pathomechanisms, and we suggest that this term mainly refers to conditions that are fully or partially independent from RA. Coexisting condition seems to be an optimal term to cover all these pathologies that have different pathomechanisms and still can contribute to disease course and activity, treatment efficacy, mortality and quality of life. As rheumatologists are the specialists who manage RA, it is mainly their role to take into consideration all these coexisting conditions when considering the treatment options of individual patients.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for rheumatoid arthritis, more specifically with respect to indications for testing, ACR 2010 guidelines recommend to test for RA in patients who have at least one joint with definite clinical synovitis, in whom the synovitis is not better explained by another disease.

### Components of treatment delay in rheumatoid arthritis differ according to autoantibody status: validation of a single-centre observation using national audit data [^112M2cf4]. Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective. To determine whether time to treatment following symptom onset differs between RA patients according to autoantibody status.

Methods. A single-centre retrospective analysis of a UK early RA inception cohort was first undertaken to identify those components of the patient journey that differed by serological subtype. Data from a UK national audit of early inflammatory arthritis patients was accessed to replicate the key finding.

Results. A total of 173 RA patients were diagnosed over a 31-month period, of whom 80 (46%) were ACPA/RF double-seropositive (ACPA + /RF +), 53 (31%) ACPA − /RF −, 17 (10%) ACPA + /RF − and 23 (13%) RF + /ACPA −. Overall, ACPA + /RF + patients experienced significantly longer symptom duration before DMARD initiation. This was accounted for by delays in their presentation to primary care following symptom onset — a finding that was robustly confirmed in an independent dataset of 2192 UK early RA patients. In contrast, ACPA − /RF − patients were significantly more likely to experience delays in DMARD initiation after presenting to secondary care.

Conclusion. Causes of treatment delays in early RA differ according to patients' autoantibody status. More insidious symptom onset and/or distinct health-seeking behaviours among ACPA + /RF + patients may contribute to late presentations in primary care, whereas ACPA − /RF − patients experience delayed diagnosis and treatment in secondary care. These observations inform the research agenda, potentially influencing the design of service delivery for early arthritis patients.

### Symptom complexes at the earliest phases of rheumatoid arthritis: a synthesis of the qualitative literature [^113zPP9X]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

Once results are available from formal qualitative studies of the emergence of symptoms in people at risk of RA and in those with a new onset of disease, these results can be used to inform the development of a "symptom questionnaire" to assess the frequency of symptoms and their evolution in individuals at risk of RA. Through this approach, refinement of algorithms for use in secondary care to predict RA development in patients with unclassified arthritis and patients with inflammatory joint symptoms and RA-related autoantibodies may be achieved. Importantly, tools also need to be developed for use in primary care to direct management pathways, including determining which patients with joint-related symptoms should be investigated (e.g. with autoantibody testing or imaging) and who should be referred to a rheumatologist. The patient's history is readily available and inexpensive. Maximizing value from this history and assessing the predictive utility of its components in the earliest phases of RA can only be achieved once these components are fully understood.

### Imaging in rheumatology: reconciling radiology and rheumatology [^112njHt2]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis

Rheumatoid arthritis is still a disease of unclear aetiology. It is an autoimmune disease with a genetic predisposition involving many genes and women are more commonly affected than men. What exactly triggers its onset is subject to lively scientific debate, but it seems likely that once the causative abnormal immune process is established in the patient, it becomes self-perpetuating.

Rheumatoid arthritis is largely a synovial based disease with the potential for severe joint destruction, but it often has systemic manifestations. Some authors have suggested that synovitis might be secondary to a more basic disease process first occurring within medullary bone as primary inflammatory infiltrate, but this is subject to debate and not universally accepted. Intriguingly, Ostendorf and co-workers found that bone scintigraphy has demonstrated increased bone turnover in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis without correlating magnet resonance imaging (MRI) findings, while in most patients bone scintigraphic uptake correlated well with MRI changes.

Older classifications of rheumatoid arthritis were insensitive to early rheumatoid arthritis and years could pass between onset of symptoms and definite diagnosis. However studies have shown that the best outcomes are achieved by aggressive treatment within 3–6 months of onset of symptoms. The availability of biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs has moved the goalposts and enables disease control and joint preservation unknown in the past but only if treatment is started early enough.

Subsequently the diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis were revised. The 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification assesses joint involvement, blood parameters and duration of symptoms. Unlike the previous criteria, imaging is not part of this primary assessment, though radiographs of the hands might be obtained at the time of diagnosis to establish baseline findings, although, clearly, radiographs are insensitive for the early diagnosis of inflammatory joint disease. Radiographs can be used to monitor disease progression, although they are insensitive for minor change.

### Classification of rheumatoid arthritis: is it time to revise the criteria? [^1137w3RU]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a highly inflammatory, debilitating autoimmune disease with complicated multisystem involvement that is difficult to diagnose in its early stages when the characteristic disease features are not yet apparent. The process of diagnosis is complex and requires the synthesis of many data points, typically beyond a simple algorithm-based set of criteria. Hence, it is not possible to clearly define diagnostic criteria for RA (or other systemic autoimmune diseases); however, recommendations and guidelines for the management and treatment of RA have been developed. In contrast, classification criteria are used as a standardised means for including a well-defined set of patients in clinical studies to ensure better comparability across studies. Importantly, classification criteria are not intended to be used for diagnosis. Nonetheless, they may have some impact on diagnosis and clinical decision-making. Therefore, improving both the specificity and sensitivity of classification criteria across different rheumatic diseases remains a challenge and, in that context, especially the increasing importance of autoantibody testing is being discussed.

RA is classified according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) 2010 criteria, which, apart from clinical items (joint counts), encompass laboratory parameters including inflammation markers (C reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and, most importantly, the hallmark autoantibodies of RA, rheumatoid factor (RF) and anticitrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPAs). The maximum score of the criteria is 10, with a score ≥ 6 allowing the classification as RA. Among the laboratory parameters, an elevated inflammation marker contributes one point, the presence of RF or ACPA contributes two points if detectable (ie, low positive) and three points if present at levels > 3 times the upper limit of normal as defined by the reference range of the assay. Consequently, laboratory items may account for up to two-thirds of the scores needed to classify definite RA and are thus given a higher weight than in any other set of classification criteria for rheumatic autoimmune diseases.

From this viewpoint, we are discussing the performance of current criteria and their potential refinement according to insights obtained over the past years, including differences between ACPA and RF contribution as well as the emergence of novel antibodies that might be considered for inclusion to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the criteria.

### Patient information: what is rheumatoid arthritis? [^115XA9R6]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which a person's immune system attacks the lining of joints throughout the body. Rheumatoid arthritis causes joint inflammation, which in severe cases may result in permanent joint damage and disability. Additionally, RA may affect other organs, including the lungs, heart, blood vessels, skin, and eyes. Rheumatoid arthritis affects approximately 1 of every 200 adults worldwide and occurs 2 to 3 times more frequently in women than men. It can affect people of any age, but peak onset is from age 50 to 59 years. Risk Factors for RA The cause of RA is unknown, but certain risk factors are associated with an increased likelihood of developing RA, including a family history of RA or other autoimmune diseases, smoking, poor dental health, and viral infections. Common Signs and Symptoms of RA.

The first sign of RA is joint pain, particularly in the hands and feet, accompanied by joint stiffness in the morning lasting longer than 30 minutes. As the disease progresses, joints affected by RA become swollen and difficult to move. The pain and swelling often come and go, with periods of increased inflammation followed by periods of relative improvement. During flares, patients may also experience flu-like symptoms, such as muscle aches and fatigue. Diagnosis of RA Rheumatologists use physical examination, blood tests, and x-ray scans to diagnose RA. Most patients with RA have blood test results that are positive for antibodies called rheumatoid factor, anticyclic citrullinated protein antibodies, or both. Rheumatologists can help differentiate RA from other diseases that may cause similar symptoms but require different treatment. Treatment and Prognosis of RA Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are the mainstay of treatment for RA.

A common first-line therapy is a weekly dose of methotrexate. With this treatment, approximately 40% to 50% of patients with RA go into remission or have low disease activity. For those who do not improve with methotrexate, other, more immunosuppressive medications may be added sequentially. Smith MH, Berman JR. What Is Rheumatoid Arthritis. JAMA. 2022; 327:

### Rheumatoid arthritis: the continuum of disease and strategies for prediction, early intervention, and prevention [^116YANLt]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is known to include a pre-RA stage that can be defined as the presence of familial or genetic risk factors, biomarker abnormalities (eg, anticitrullinated protein antibodies [ACPA]), symptoms, and even abnormal imaging findings prior to the development of the onset of clinical RA with inflammatory arthritis that is apparent on physical examination. Indeed, there are multiple completed or ongoing retrospective case-control as well as prospective observational studies to identify the key biologic drivers of disease. Further, building on the predictive ability of combinations of biomarkers, symptoms, and imaging for future RA, there are multiple clinical trials completed, underway, or in development to identify approaches that may prevent, delay, or ameliorate future clinical RA in at-risk individuals. Importantly, however, although an effective preventive intervention has not yet been identified, at-risk individuals are being increasingly identified in clinical care; this presents a challenge of how to manage these individuals in clinical practice. This review will discuss the current understanding of the biology and natural history of RA development, nomenclature, and current models for prediction of future RA, as well as evaluate the current and ongoing clinical prevention trials with the overall goal to provide insights into the challenges and opportunities in the field of RA prevention. Moreover, this review will provide up-to-date options for clinical management of individuals at risk for RA.

### Polyarticular joint pain in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^1124uUZ4]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Polyarticular joint pain involves five or more joints and can be inflammatory or noninflammatory. Two of the most common causes of chronic polyarthritis are osteoarthritis, especially in older patients, and rheumatoid arthritis, which affects at least 0.25% of adults worldwide. The initial evaluation should include a detailed history of the patient's symptoms, with a focus on inflammation, location of pain, duration of symptoms, the presence of systemic symptoms, and any exposures to pathogens that could cause arthritis. Redness, warmth, or swelling in a joint is suggestive of synovitis and joint inflammation. A systematic approach to the physical examination that assesses for a pattern of joint involvement and presence of synovitis can help narrow the differential diagnosis. Laboratory tests, joint aspiration, and imaging studies should be used to confirm a suspected diagnosis. Rheumatoid factor and cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody tests are helpful when there is concern for rheumatoid arthritis. Although magnetic resonance imaging is highly sensitive in identifying erosive bony changes and inflammation, conventional radiography remains the standard for the initial imaging evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis. Point-of-care musculoskeletal ultrasonography can also be a useful tool to detect findings that support a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis.

### Symptom complexes at the earliest phases of rheumatoid arthritis: a synthesis of the qualitative literature [^111B3LtF]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

We note that symptoms occasionally reported by patients with established RA (e.g. numbness, tingling, jaw pain, and symptoms of restless legs and leg cramps) were not found in the literature included in this review, which focused on disease onset, and the presence of these should be explored in further qualitative work. A systematic review of the symptoms of established RA has yet to be undertaken; however, it is important to consider the symptoms identified in the present review in relation to the symptoms that are recognized to be associated with established RA. Particular symptoms of established RA have been identified as being indicators of disease activity and for distinguishing RA from other inflammatory arthritides. Therefore, joint swelling, tenderness, and pain are key features of disease activity measures and of measures to assess change in disease activity. Furthermore, the patient perspective has highlighted fatigue as an important disease activity indicator. However, although disease activity measures capture information on clinically important symptoms, they do not, and are not intended to, capture the breadth of symptoms that an individual with established RA may experience. Work to define a flare of established RA has identified a broader range of symptoms that characterize periods of worsening disease activity, including sleep disturbance, systemic disturbance, stiffness, emotional distress, and reduction in function and participation. Furthermore, classification criteria for RA have incorporated a range of symptom-related characteristics, including morning stiffness and joint swelling (1987 ACR criteria) as well as joint tenderness (2010 ACR/EULAR criteria). Classification criteria aim to distinguish patients with one condition from those with another, and therefore will include only the most discriminatory symptom variables rather than the totality. However, these comparisons demonstrate that many of the symptoms identified in early disease are also key features of established RA.

### Contemporary treatment principles for early rheumatoid arthritis: a consensus statement [^115tsEiB]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

RA has a substantial impact on both patients and healthcare systems. Our objective is to advance the understanding of modern management principles in light of recent evidence concerning the condition's diagnosis and treatment.

Methods

A group of practicing UK rheumatologists formulated contemporary management principles and clinical practice recommendations concerning both diagnosis and treatment. Areas of clinical uncertainty were documented, leading to research recommendations.

Results

A fundamental concept governing treatment of RA is minimization of cumulative inflammation, referred to as the inflammation-time area under the curve (AUC). To achieve this, four core principles of management were identified: (i) detect and refer patients early, even if the diagnosis is uncertain: patients should be referred at the first suspicion of persistent inflammatory polyarthritis and rheumatology departments should provide rapid access to a diagnostic and prognostic service; (ii) treat RA immediately: optimizing outcomes with conventional DMARDs and biologics requires that effective treatment be started early-ideally within 3 months of symptom onset; (iii) tight control of inflammation in RA improves outcome: frequent assessments and an objective protocol should be used to make treatment changes that maintain low-disease activity/remission at an agreed target; (iv) consider the risk-benefit ratio and tailor treatment to each patient: differing patient, disease and drug characteristics require long-term monitoring of risks and benefits with adaptations of treatments to suit individual circumstances.

Conclusion

These principles focus on effective control of the inflammatory process in RA, but optimal uptake may require changes in service provision to accommodate appropriate care pathways.

### Meaning of patient global assessment when joint counts are low in rheumatoid arthritis [^114GKbCH]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

The ultimate goal of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment is to suppress the disease activity that leads to pain and disabling joint damage. Current RA treatments are highly effective but still leave many patients with persistent active disease. Remission is achieved by only 10%–20% of patients on treatment in trials. However, remission as defined in these trials often depends on the patient global assessment score of RA disease activity reaching very low levels.

The patient global assessment (PGA) of disease activity is among the most sensitive to change among all RA core set measures. However, for patients on active treatment in whom treatment has successfully suppressed joint swelling and tenderness in the 28 joints counted, the patient global assessment score can remain elevated, suggesting either that treatment is insufficiently effective or that the patient is reporting as part of their disease activity symptoms from locations such as their lower back that are probably unrelated to their RA. Studies have suggested that pain and fatigue are the symptoms that best explain the patient global assessment score, but there has been no intensive inquiry into the specific symptoms present in those with elevated PGA whose joints counts are low. There are four explanations as follows: first, RA symptoms with persistent pain in joints not included in the 28-joint count (feet/ankles/hips/neck); second, symptoms probably unrelated to RA including back pain, headache and fibromyalgia; third, symptoms of fatigue which may or may not be due to RA; or fourth, a combination of these possibilities.

If elevated patient global assessment scores represent symptoms of active RA, we might need to add to treatment. If, on the other hand, the elevated PGAs reflect symptoms that do not emanate from locations usually affected by RA, better communication between patients and their physicians is needed to help patients more accurately assess what symptoms are related to their active RA so that, working together, patients and physicians accurately assess disease activity and reduce the impact of disease on quality of life. Different patients may have different reasons for scoring their disease as active and there has been little investigation of why global assessments are elevated when 28-joint joint counts are low.

Using the BRASS database of comprehensively assessed patients with RA surveyed and repeatedly examined prospectively, we investigated those with either one or no tender or swollen joints yet patient global assessments indicating active disease. We asked whether those patients had pain in joints missed by the 28-joint count or pain in locations not likely to be related to RA and/or fatigue.

### Rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis, prediction, and prevention: an emerging paradigm shift [^112Tm7nz]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is currently diagnosed and treated when an individual presents with signs and symptoms of inflammatory arthritis (IA) as well as other features, such as autoantibodies and/or imaging findings, that provide sufficient confidence that the individual has RA-like IA (e.g., meeting established classification criteria) that warrants therapeutic intervention. However, it is now known that there is a stage of seropositive RA during which circulating biomarkers and other factors (e.g., joint symptoms) can be used to predict if and when an individual who does not currently have IA may develop future clinically apparent IA and classifiable RA. Indeed, the discovery of the "pre-RA" stage of seropositive disease has led to the development of several clinical trials in which individuals are studied to identify ways to delay or prevent the onset of clinically apparent IA/RA. This review focuses on several issues pertinent to understanding the prevention of RA. These include discussion of the pathogenesis of pre-RA development, prediction of the likelihood and timing of future classifiable RA, and a review of completed and ongoing clinical trials in RA prevention. Furthermore, this review discusses challenges and opportunities to be addressed to effect a paradigm shift in RA, where in the near future, proactive risk assessment focused on prevention of RA will become a public health strategy in much the same manner as cardiovascular disease is managed today.

### Factors associated with mortality in rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114UWD62]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune, inflammatory arthritis with extra-articular manifestations in up to 50% of patients. Among those manifestations, clinical and subclinical interstitial lung disease (ILD) are the most frequent extra-articular manifestations with increased morbidity and mortality, and it can be detected in 10–60% of RA patients. Rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) has a heterogeneous clinical presentation and disease course. Despite an increasing recognition of RA-ILD and growing knowledge of the related pathogenesis, ILD remains a major cause of mortality with a median survival of only 3–7 years after diagnosis. Better means of identifying and treating RA-ILD are necessary to improve the prognosis. Multiple studies have previously investigated prognostic factors of RA-ILD. However, these findings were derived from retrospective studies with small sample sizes and the importance of their findings was unclear in isolation.

Identifying the factors consistently associated with mortality in RA-ILD would improve prognostication and provide for making better decision for clinicians in the management of these patients. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to overcome the limitations of a primary study and identify the factors associated with all-cause mortality in RA-ILD.

### A multivariable prediction model to identify anti-CCP positive people in those with non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms in primary care [^111drj4F]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Prediction of RA can be challenging in primary care as it makes up a small proportion of musculoskeletal conditions that account for a third of all GP appointments. This novel multivariable prediction model provides the opportunity to support primary care clinicians in identifying people at risk of developing RA through targeted anti-CCP testing. More importantly, intervening in those who are at high risk can reverse subclinical inflammation in some patients delaying the onset of RA and potentially reducing the long-term disability associated with the disease. There is also evidence that MTX treatment aiming at secondary prevention in the at-risk phase of RA is cost-effective. However, we acknowledge that further research is warranted to confirm that long-term outcomes associated with identifying and treating people at risk of RA are more clinically and cost-effective rather than waiting for clinical synovitis to develop.

### Rheumatoid arthritis: early diagnosis and treatment [^112y78mE]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive inflammatory disorder that manifests as a symmetric polyarthritis of small and large joints that may lead to joint and periarticular structural damage and the consequences of systemic inflammation. This overview of early RA examines the unmet needs and challenges in RA, how to best diagnose RA, and pitfalls in early diagnosis and treatment. The rules for referral to a rheumatologist are reviewed. Primary care physicians are at the front line of early diagnosis and need to start disease-modifying therapy as soon as a diagnosis of RA is established.

### A multivariable prediction model to identify anti-CCP positive people in those with non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms in primary care [^111CedRV]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to develop a prediction model identifying people presenting to primary care with musculoskeletal symptoms likely to be anti-CCP positive and therefore at risk of developing RA.

Methods

Participants aged ≥ 16years, with new-onset non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms and no history of clinical synovitis, completed a symptom questionnaire and had an anti-CCP test. Model development used LASSO-penalized logistic regression, performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and decision curve analysis, model over-fit was estimated using bootstrapping and cross-validation. Participants were followed-up at 12months for RA or seronegative/undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis diagnosis.

Results

Analysis included 6879 participants; 203 (2.95%) of whom were anti-CCP positive. Eleven predictors were retained: male sex, first-degree relative with RA, ever smoked and joint pain in: back, neck, shoulders, wrists, hands/fingers, thumbs, knees, feet/toes. AUROC was 0.65 (95% CI 0.61, 0.69, optimism = 0.03). Using a 4% decision threshold, the model recommended an anti-CCP test in 1288 (18.7%) participants, 78 (6.1%) of whom were anti-CCP positive, compared with 125/5591 (2.2%) below the threshold. Net benefit was 0.0040 (0.0020 corrected). Forty-eight participants were diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis/RA within 12months. Of those who were above the threshold and anti-CCP positive, 32.1% developed inflammatory arthritis/RA compared with 0.4% of those who were anti-CCP negative. Of those below the threshold, 0.3% were diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis/RA.

Conclusions

Targeted anti-CCP testing in primary care may aid earlier identification of people at risk of RA, prompting specialist referral to rheumatology for earlier diagnosis and initiation of disease-modifying therapy.

### Diagnosis and management of rheumatoid arthritis [^1123cHWZ]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of synovial tissue and a wide array of multisystem comorbidities. Prevalence is estimated to be 0.8 percent worldwide, with women twice as likely to develop the disease as men. Untreated, 20 to 30 percent of persons with rheumatoid arthritis become permanently work-disabled within two to three years of diagnosis. Genetic and environmental factors play a role in pathogenesis. Although laboratory testing and imaging studies can help confirm the diagnosis and track disease progress, rheumatoid arthritis primarily is a clinical diagnosis and no single laboratory test is diagnostic. Complications of rheumatoid arthritis may begin to develop within months of presentation; therefore, early referral to or consultation with a rheumatologist for initiation of treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs is recommended. Several promising new disease-modifying drugs recently have become available, including leflunomide, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and anakinra. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and nonpharmacologic modalities also are useful. Patients who do not respond well to a single disease-modifying drug may be candidates for combination therapy. Rheumatoid arthritis is a lifelong disease, although patients can go into remission. Physicians must be aware of common comorbidities. Progression of rheumatoid arthritis is monitored according to American College of Rheumatology criteria based on changes in specific symptoms and laboratory findings. Predictors of poor outcomes in early stages of rheumatoid arthritis include low functional score early in the disease, lower socioeconomic status, early involvement of many joints, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level at disease onset, positive rheumatoid factor, and early radiologic changes.

### Rheumatoid arthritis: a severe disease that preventive approaches would greatly benefit [^115KDiRQ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

With the increased understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in recent decades, the notion of disease prevention has arisen. Contemplation of potential preventive strategies must be prefaced by a clear understanding of the rationale for the prevention, as opposed to the treatment, of a disease once established. RA is the most common systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease. The worldwide prevalence is 0.24%, and the lifetime cumulative prevalence approaches 4% in women and 2% in men. RA has severe manifestations leading to chronic pain, impaired quality of life, inability to participate in social and work activities, disability, extra-articular manifestations, and premature mortality. Unfortunately, patients often experience a long duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis, owing to inadequate awareness in the general population, limitations of diagnostic assessments in the early phases of the disease, and a lack of access to rheumatologists globally. Despite the development of novel targeted therapies and substantial improvements in treatment strategies, up to 60% of patients fail to respond adequately to any particular treatment strategy, and 30% of those fail to respond to multiple agents. Therefore, there remains a large proportion of patients who fail to achieve clinical remission and patient-acceptable symptom states. Treatments for RA may be associated with a variety of complications, limiting their sustained usefulness, particularly as related to an increased risk for serious infections. Advancements in therapies have curtailed the previous main driver of mortality, cardiovascular disease, but overall mortality remains elevated in many studies of persons with RA compared to the general population. This commentary reviews the rationale in detail and introduces a clear implication that the ideal strategy would be to develop a means of preventing the onset of clinically apparent joint inflammation among individuals at risk.

### Components of treatment delay in rheumatoid arthritis differ according to autoantibody status: validation of a single-centre observation using national audit data [^1128qhMe]. Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether time to treatment following symptom onset differs between RA patients according to autoantibody status.

Methods

A single-centre retrospective analysis of a UK early RA inception cohort was first undertaken to identify those components of the patient journey that differed by serological subtype. Data from a UK national audit of early inflammatory arthritis patients was accessed to replicate the key finding.

Results

A total of 173 RA patients were diagnosed over a 31-month period, of whom 80 (46%) were ACPA/RF double-seropositive (ACPA(+)/RF(+)), 53 (31%) ACPA(-)/RF(-), 17 (10%) ACPA(+)/RF(-) and 23 (13%) RF(+)/ACPA(-) Overall, ACPA(+)/RF(+) patients experienced significantly longer symptom duration before DMARD initiation. This was accounted for by delays in their presentation to primary care following symptom onset-a finding that was robustly confirmed in an independent dataset of 2192 UK early RA patients. In contrast, ACPA(-)/RF(-) patients were significantly more likely to experience delays in DMARD initiation after presenting to secondary care.

Conclusion

Causes of treatment delays in early RA differ according to patients' autoantibody status. More insidious symptom onset and/or distinct health-seeking behaviours among ACPA(+)/RF(+) patients may contribute to late presentations in primary care, whereas ACPA(-)/RF(-) patients experience delayed diagnosis and treatment in secondary care. These observations inform the research agenda, potentially influencing the design of service delivery for early arthritis patients.

### Rheumatoid arthritis [^113YGn6o]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease that primarily affects the joints and is associated with autoantibodies that target various molecules including modified self-epitopes. The identification of novel autoantibodies has improved diagnostic accuracy, and newly developed classification criteria facilitate the recognition and study of the disease early in its course. New clinical assessment tools are able to better characterize disease activity states, which are correlated with progression of damage and disability, and permit improved follow-up. In addition, better understanding of the pathogenesis of RA through recognition of key cells and cytokines has led to the development of targeted disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Altogether, the improved understanding of the pathogenetic processes involved, rational use of established drugs and development of new drugs and reliable assessment tools have drastically altered the lives of individuals with RA over the past 2 decades. Current strategies strive for early referral, early diagnosis and early start of effective therapy aimed at remission or, at the least, low disease activity, with rapid adaptation of treatment if this target is not reached. This treat-to-target approach prevents progression of joint damage and optimizes physical functioning, work and social participation. In this Primer, we discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of RA.

### A multivariable prediction model to identify anti-CCP positive people in those with non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms in primary care [^116Rrow8]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Existing prediction models developed by our group that identify people who are likely to develop inflammatory arthritis include anti-CCP testing. However anti-CCP testing is not routinely undertaken in primary care and often with limitations imposed on access to testing. Furthermore, in the UK, current NICE guidance only exists for those where RA is suspected clinically (presence of synovitis) and anti-CCP testing is only recommended if a patient is negative for RF. Anti-CCP testing everyone in primary care who presents with musculoskeletal symptoms would cause a significant burden on an already over-stretched healthcare system; the cost of the tests, an increase in phlebotomy services and time to review results by healthcare professionals will be required. Therefore, changing the diagnostic paradigm to detect RA prior to the onset of clinical synovitis requires targeted anti-CCP testing in people who present with new-onset non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms in primary care to identify those at high risk, before they present with clinical synovitis. Additionally, it will support the implementation of existing tools, developed in anti-CCP positive participants, to refer high-risk individuals to secondary care for more timely review and intervention, potentially altering the course of their disease. In addition to delivering potential prevention intervention, identifying high-risk individuals will enable an earlier diagnosis and treatment of RA should it develop. There are clear benefits to treating RA within 12 weeks of symptom onset. Treatment-related costs have been reported to be lower in patients who were identified earlier (symptom duration < 12 weeks) compared with those with longer symptom duration (> 12 weeks). Importantly, in those who have autoantibody-positive RA, treatment initiation in those who had symptoms for > 12 weeks resulted in more intensive biologics use with overall higher costs within those requiring biologics, suggesting that earlier identification and treatment initiation is likely cost-effective.

### Should ACR / EULAR criteria be revised changing the RF and ACPA scores? [^1123YfU6]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Current classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) encompass clinical and immunological items and are capable of correctly identifying the majority of symptomatic RA patients. The presence of positive rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or and anti-cyclic citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPA) gaining increasing importance according to their serological titer eases the recognition of RA, yet the debate is open on whether this scoring system ought to be optimized by hierarchizing ACPA or the combination of ACPA and RF over single positivity, prioritizing specificity over sensitivity. The risk of misdiagnosis and misclassification are often entangled, yet they are not the same. In fact, while ideal diagnosis requires 100% sensitivity and specificity, classification criteria are conceived to gather a homogeneous patient population, favoring specificity over sensitivity. Nevertheless, as they are frequently summoned to support the diagnostic process in clinical practice, issues arise on how comprehensive those should be and on how frequently they should be updated in light of novel acquisitions regarding measurable RA-related abnormalities. In this viewpoint two different views on the topic are confronted, discussing the performance of available criteria and the potentiality and pitfalls of their refinement according to novel data on ACPA and RF contribution and emergence of newly discovered specificities.

### 2010 rheumatoid arthritis classification criteria: an American College of Rheumatology / European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^115Umhze]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "ACR/EULAR classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis" for rheumatoid arthritis.

The ACR/EULAR classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis is a clinical calculator developed jointly by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). This calculator is used to classify patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the joints.

The ACR/EULAR criteria are applied to patients who have at least one joint with definite clinical synovitis (swelling) not better explained by another disease. The criteria are based on the weighted sum of four domains: joint involvement, serology (including rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibody status), acute-phase reactants (C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and duration of symptoms.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to aid in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, particularly in its early stages, and to differentiate it from other forms of arthritis or joint diseases. It is not intended to be used as the sole criteria for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis, but rather as a tool to support clinical judgment.

Exclusion criteria for the use of this calculator include patients with conditions that could better explain the synovitis, such as lupus or psoriatic arthritis.

The ACR/EULAR classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis assist in determining whether an individual meets the diagnostic criteria for the condition by evaluating four main areas: joint involvement, serology, acute phase reactants, and duration of symptoms. Each aspect is assigned a specific score based on the severity or positivity of the criteria.

1. **Joint Involvement**:

- 1 large joint scores 0 points
- 2–10 large joints score 1 point
- 1–3 small joints score 2 points
- 4–10 small joints score 3 points
- More than 10 joints, including at least 1 small joint, score 5 points

2. **Serology**:

- Negative rheumatoid factor and negative anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody score 0 points
- Low-positive rheumatoid factor and negative anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody score 2 points
- High-positive rheumatoid factor or positive anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody score 3 points

3. **Acute Phase Reactants**:

- Normal C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate score 0 points
- Abnormal C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate score 1 point

4. **Duration of Symptoms**:

- Less than 6 weeks scores 0 points
- 6 weeks or more scores 1 point

To determine the total score, each input response is converted into a score according to the predefined scale, and these scores are summed. The cumulative score will fall between 0 and 10.

The interpretation of the total score is straightforward:

- A score of 6 or more indicates that the diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis are met.
- A score below 6 suggests that the criteria are not met.

Upon processing the inputs, the calculator provides both the total score and its corresponding interpretation based on these thresholds.

### Rheumatoid arthritis | CDC… [^1172UL6Q]. archive.cdc.gov (2024). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid Arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease, which means that your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake, causing inflammation in the affected parts of the body. RA mainly attacks the joints, usually many joints at once. RA commonly affects joints in the hands, wrists, and knees. In a joint with RA, the lining of the joint becomes inflamed, causing damage to joint tissue. This tissue damage can cause long-lasting or chronic pain, unsteadiness, and deformity. RA can also affect other parts of the body and cause problems in organs such as the lungs, heart, and eyes. What causes RA. RA occurs when the body's immune system attacks its own healthy cells. The specific causes of RA are unknown, but some factors can increase the risk of developing the disease. How is RA diagnosed. RA is diagnosed by a health care provider.

She or he reviews symptoms, conducts a physical examination, and does X-rays and lab tests. It's best to diagnose RA as soon as possible — within 6 months of the onset of symptoms — so that people with the disease can begin treatment to slow or stop disease progression. Diagnosis and effective treatments, particularly treatment to suppress or control inflammation, can help reduce the damaging effects of RA. With RA, there are times when symptoms get worse, known as flares, and times when symptoms get better, known as remission. Signs and symptoms of RA include:

- Pain or aching in more than one joint.
- Stiffness in more than one joint.
- Tenderness and swelling in more than one joint.
- The same symptoms on both sides of the body.
- Weight loss.
- Fever.
- Fatigue or tiredness.
- Weakness. What are the complications of RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis has many physical and social consequences and can lower quality of life. It can cause pain, disability, and premature death. Premature heart disease. People with RA can have a higher risk for developing other chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. To prevent people with RA from developing heart disease, treatment of RA also focuses on reducing heart disease risk factors. For example, doctors will recommend that patients with RA stop smoking and lose weight.

### Intervention with methotrexate in patients with arthralgia at risk of rheumatoid arthritis to reduce the development of persistent arthritis and its disease burden (TREAT EARLIER): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept trial [^114TT6ij]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common autoimmune disease worldwide and requires long-term treatment to suppress inflammation. Currently, treatment is started when arthritis is clinically apparent. We aimed to evaluate whether earlier intervention, in the preceding phase of arthralgia and subclinical joint inflammation, could prevent the development of clinical arthritis or reduce the disease burden.

Methods

We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept-trial at the Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, Netherlands. Adults aged 18 years or older with arthralgia clinically suspected of progressing to rheumatoid arthritis and MRI-detected subclinical joint inflammation were eligible for enrolment across 13 rheumatology outpatient clinics in the southwest region of the Netherlands and randomly assigned (1:1) to a single intramuscular glucocorticoid injection (120 mg) and a 1-year course of oral methotrexate (up to 25 mg/week), or placebo (single injection and tablets for 1 year). Participants and investigators were masked to group assignment. Follow-up continued for 1 year after the end of the 1-year treatment period. The primary endpoint was development of clinical arthritis (fulfilling the 2010 rheumatoid arthritis classification criteria or involving two or more joints) that persisted for at least 2 weeks. Patient-reported physical functioning, symptoms, and work productivity were secondary endpoints, which were measured every 4 months. Additionally, the course of MRI-detected inflammation was studied. All participants entered the intention-to-treat analysis. This trial is registered with EudraCT, 2014–004472–35, and the Netherlands Trial Register, NTR4853-trial-NL4599.

Findings

Between April 16, 2015, and Sept 11, 2019, 901 patients were assessed for eligibility and 236 were enrolled and randomly assigned to active treatment (n = 119) or placebo (n = 117). At 2 years, the frequency of the primary endpoint was similar between the groups (23 [19%] of 119 participants in the treatment group vs 21 [18%] of 117 in the placebo group; hazard ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.48). Physical functioning improved more in the treatment group during the first 4 months and remained better than in the placebo group (mean between-group difference in Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index over 2 years: -0.09, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.03; p = 0.0042). Similarly, pain (on scale 0–100, mean between-group difference: -8, 95% CI -12 to -4; p < 0.0001), morning stiffness of joints (-12, -16 to -8; p < 0.0001), presenteeism (-8%, -13 to -3; p = 0.0007), and MRI-detected joint inflammation (-1.4 points, -2.0 to -0.9; p < 0.0001) showed sustained improvement in the treatment group compared with the placebo group. The number of serious adverse events was equal in both groups; adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile for methotrexate.

Interpretation

Methotrexate, the cornerstone treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, initiated at the pre-arthritis stage of symptoms and subclinical inflammation, did not prevent the development of clinical arthritis, but modified the disease course as shown by sustained improvement in MRI-detected inflammation, related symptoms, and impairments compared with placebo.

### A quarter of patients time their early rheumatoid arthritis onset differently than physicians [^115UMmAk]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

A review of RA clinical trials that included disease duration showed studies use variable definitions ranging from onset of symptoms (symptoms rarely defined), time of first reported joint swelling, fulfilment of classification criteria, time of diagnosis and sometimes omitted any clear definition. Heterogeneity in definitions poses significant difficulties for ascertaining the 'window of opportunity'. EULAR proposed recommendations for prospective cohort studies to define the onset 'starting point' used for reported disease/symptom duration. Previous publications described heterogeneous initial symptoms in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis, ranging from gradual, vague symptoms; transient, acute episodes (palindromic); migratory pain; to acute, severe and debilitating onset, fatigue, morning stiffness, impaired function and poor sleep.

Nearly 10% of patients timed their symptom onset at least 30 days after physicians. Prior to diagnosis, many patients with EIA may not be able to distinguish different types of arthritis, and misattribute early symptoms. Lack of standardisation of how onset of symptoms and persistent synovitis timing were determined constitutes a limitation; while patient baseline surveys asked for 'date when first symptoms began', and physician baseline surveys asked for 'date of onset of symptoms', neither the patients nor rheumatologists were trained about how to answer these questions. Another limitation is that there could be concordance or discordance between the reported onset of RA and some patients would be within the 3 months optimal window for best outcomes with treatment and others far outside the window within any of the groups we defined. The 30-day difference in timing of onset between patients and their rheumatologist was chosen arbitrarily.

In multivariate analysis, OA, fibromyalgia, low annual income, active smoking and initial non-methotrexate, non-biologic DMARD use predicted discordance in reported onsets towards longer patient-reported symptom duration. OA can be associated with patients who reported RA onset prior to physicians or vice versa, but in the former group, the timing is longer. Comorbid OA and fibromyalgia as predictors of discordance reflect the difficulty in distinguishing between musculoskeletal symptoms of various aetiologies; concomitant OA or fibromyalgia predicts increased time from RA symptom onset to treatment. Low socioeconomic status is associated with a longer time to rheumatologist consultation, delay in DMARD initiation and worse disease activity.

Strengths of this study include a large number of EIA participants, multicentre design and real-world observational data and less recall bias as patients required new-onset fixed synovitis to enrol and completed questionnaires at their initial visit. Patients with high pain ratings seemed to be less accurate in their recall of initial symptom timing.

### Increased primary care use for musculoskeletal symptoms, infections and comorbidities in the years before the diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis [^111YwCzk]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Little is known about relevant events in the at-risk phase of rheumatoid arthritis before the development of clinically apparent inflammatory arthritis (IA). The present study assessed musculoskeletal symptoms, infections and comorbidity in future IA patients.

Methods

In a nested case–control study using electronic health records of general practitioners, the frequency and timing of 192 symptoms or diseases were evaluated before a diagnosis of IA, using the International Classification of Primary Care coding system. Cases were 2314 adults with a new diagnosis IA between 2012 and 2016; controls were matched 1:2. The frequency of primary care visits was compared using logistic regression.

Results

The frequency of visits for musculoskeletal symptoms (mostly of shoulders, wrists, fingers and knees) and carpal tunnel syndrome was significantly higher in IA patients vs controls within the final 1.5 years before diagnosis, with ORs of 3.2 (95% CI 2.8 to 3.5), 2.8 (95% CI 2.5 to 3.1) and 2.5 (95% CI 2.2 to 2.8) at 6, 12 and 18 months before diagnosis, respectively. Also, infections (notably of the genital and urinary tracts), IA-comorbidities and chronic diseases were more prevalent in cases than controls, but more evenly spread out over the whole 6-year period before IA. A decision tree was created including all symptoms and diseases.

Conclusion

There was an increased frequency of primary care visits for musculoskeletal symptoms, infections and comorbidities prior to the diagnosis of IA. This diverging trend is present for 4–6 years, but becomes statistically significant 1.5 years before the diagnosis. Validation of these results is warranted.

### Comorbidity in incident rheumatoid arthritis: a nationwide case-control study with bidirectional follow-up [^1134WZd2]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), affecting about 1% of the global population, is a systemic inflammatory disease impacting multiple organs beyond the joints. Comorbidities are prevalent in RA patients, with approximately half experiencing at least one concurrent condition even at an early stage. On average, RA patients suffer from 1.6 additional conditions, with the number increasing over time. Patients with refractory disease also experience higher comorbidity rates. RA-related comorbidities, often occurring in clusters, are associated with worse functional status and higher disease activity, often despite optimal treatment approaches. Various disease and management-related mechanisms potentially underlie this association, though epidemiological estimates and prevention strategies vary across countries. As management shifts towards a patient-centred approach, understanding comorbidity patterns and specific patient risk profiles becomes crucial due to the close relationship between RA and both immune and non-immune mediated disorders.

Evidence suggests comorbidities develop early-on in RA. However, few studies have examined the temporal association between comorbidities and the diagnosis of RA. The concept of preclinical RA is drawn from studies reporting the association between specific autoantibodies [most often targeting rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated peptide (ACPA), but also other post-translationally modified proteins] and the transition from arthralgia to arthritis. It has been shown that a more diverse array of autoantigens targeting various citrullinated peptides confers higher risk of arthritis. Expansion of the antibody repertoire in the preclinical RA phase is associated with elevation in pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-6, IFNγ), which is thought to shortly precede clinically detectable arthritis. Accumulating data suggest that there are different primary sites of mucosal antigenic exposure (oral, but also gut and lung), which can be tied to specific pathways of immune dysregulation and loss of tolerance. It has been speculated whether various disorders, such as CV, lung, endocrine and mental health conditions that precede RA may be tied to pathogenicity of still subclinical, RA-related immune mechanisms. There are a variety of shared risk factors, such as genetic (both HLA and non-HLA genes), environmental and lifestyle exposures (e.g. smoking) that are linked to RA development, but also enhance risk of various cardiometabolic, neoplastic and autoimmune conditions. Dey et al. also recently described how common RA-related comorbidities (e.g. obesity, infection, malignancy) promote a pro-inflammatory state that can predispose to more adverse health outcomes and requirement for more intensive therapy, which also carries inherent risks for other concomitant conditions.

Comparing patients with RA: clinical arthritis versus CSA as first sign of RA

In total 699 patients with RA were consecutively diagnosed, of whom 616 had presented with clinical arthritis to the rheumatologist and 83 had CSA at first presentation. When comparing these two patient groups at the moment of RA diagnosis, patients with CSA as the first presenting symptom had a longer duration of symptoms (232 vs 84 days), more often a gradual onset (84% vs 68%) and lower swollen joint count (4 vs 6) (table 1).

Table 1

Clustering

Two latent factors were extracted in the PLS-DA analysis and patients were plotted for their latent factor scores (figure 2A). Important variables that attributed to the latent factors were age, symptom duration, number of swollen and tender joints, ACPA, RF, DAS-44 and total Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index score (online supplemental file 4 and table S4). The two latent factors explained 13.3% of the variance observed in two patient groups. Subsequently, K-means analysis identified clusters of patients based on their latent factor scores; based on the elbow plot it concerned four clusters (online supplemental figure S4). The patient clusters are shown in figure 2B. Comparing figure 2A, B revealed that clusters A and B included patients who initially had presented with CSA. Clusters C and D in contrast, included none or almost none of these patients.

### Considerations for improving quality of care of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and associated comorbidities [^113kqTAD]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder with a global prevalence of approximately 0.5–1%. Patients with RA are at an increased risk of developing comorbidities (eg, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes and depression). Despite this, there are limited recommendations for the management and implementation of associated comorbidities. This study aimed to identify good practice interventions in the care of RA and associated comorbidities.

Methods

A combination of primary research (180+ interviews with specialists across 12 European rheumatology centres) and secondary research (literature review of existing publications and guidelines/recommendations) were used to identify challenges in management and corresponding good practice interventions. Findings were prioritised and reviewed by a group of 18 rheumatology experts including rheumatologists, comorbidity experts, a patient representative and a highly specialised nurse.

Results

Challenges throughout the patient pathway (including delays in diagnosis and referral, shortage of rheumatologists, limited awareness of primary care professionals) and 18 good practice interventions were identified in the study. The expert group segmented and prioritised interventions according to three distinct stages of the disease: (1) suspected RA, (2) recent diagnosis of RA and (3) established RA. Examples of good practice interventions included enabling self-management (self-monitoring and disease management support, for example, lifestyle adaptations); early arthritis clinic; rapid access to care (online referral, triage, ultrasound-guided diagnosis); dedicated comorbidity specialists; enhanced communication with primary care (hotline, education sessions); and integrating patient registries into daily clinical practice.

Conclusion

Learning from implementation of good practice interventions in centres across Europe provides an opportunity to more widely improved care for patients with RA and associated comorbidities.

### Is rheumatoid arthritis always preceded by a symptomatic at-risk phase of arthralgia? [^111K1A5Q]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Comparisons at RA diagnosis

All analyses comparing patient characteristics were done on patients with a clinical diagnosis of RA who fulfil the 1987 or the 2010 RA criteria. Patients with other inflammatory arthritides such as undifferentiated arthritis, axial spondylarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis and RS3PE were excluded from our analyses. Patient characteristics were compared between patients with RA who first presented with CSA and those who first presented with clinically apparent arthritis. This concerned clinical characteristics about symptom onset and current symptoms that were collected at the time of RA diagnosis, together with laboratory characteristics such as CRP, ESR, ACPA and IgM RF. Notably, from the patients who presented with CSA, it was certain that they had a symptomatic pre-arthritis stage. However, patients who presented with clinical arthritis either had no symptomatic pre-arthritis phase, or they had such a phase but did not present at the rheumatology clinic at that point in time. In order to tackle this issue, we sought to cluster patients based on their clinical and laboratory characteristics. Hereby we assumed that there are patients without and with a symptomatic pre-RA phase and that the latter group would have shared characteristics at symptom onset or clinical arthritis onset, resulting in patient clusters.

### Evolution of classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis: how do the 2010 criteria perform? [^114a5HXJ]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Classification criteria are created in an attempt to produce a homogenous group of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who can be used for clinical and basic research. The 1987 revised criteria lead to improved performance and more confidence in correct classification compared with the 1958 criteria. As therapies were introduced and early, aggressive approaches to RA management became common, there was a growing need for clinical trials focusing on early RA. The 2010 criteria were created to facilitate study of subjects at earlier stages in the disease. This article reviews the diagnostic performance of the 2010 criteria.

### Time sequence of autoimmune processes in the trajectory to rheumatoid arthritis development: what do we know? [^111tKfKf]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Approach to find evidence

Reliable data on timing or temporal sequence of pathophysiological processes require longitudinal studies, in which patients are followed over time, while sampling the patient at multiple time points and monitoring the development of symptoms and clinical arthritis. In order to identify these studies, we established the following primary inclusion criteria: (1) longitudinal and prospective studies; (2) studies reporting serially obtained samples; (3) studies that analysed serially obtained samples as such and (4) studies with explicit information on the presence/development of symptoms. Symptoms could be described as clinically suspect arthralgia (CSA), musculoskeletal symptoms or arthralgia. Studies that did not fulfil the primary inclusion criteria but that were relevant for the overview of evidence were divided into 'second-best' and 'third-best' categories. 'Second-best' studies included those that were not prospective, but retrospective or nested case–control studies. These studies still had to include serial measurements within patients and had to report information on the asymptomatic or symptomatic phase. As a 'third-best' option, studies were included without serial measurements and/or clear information on symptoms that attempted to inform about the timing of events by relating the moment of serum sampling to the moment of RA development. To find studies, we searched Medline, Embase and Web of Science for evidence on the timing of occurrence and changes in the systemic autoantibody and immune response before RA develops. A detailed method regarding the literature search, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the studies fulfilling the primary or the 'second and third-best' criteria are provided in online supplemental material.

### Symptom complexes at the earliest phases of rheumatoid arthritis: a synthesis of the qualitative literature [^116zp8B5]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The rapid identification of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is vital. Irreversible joint damage can occur during the early stages of disease, and the first 3 months following symptom onset represent a critical therapeutic window during which time drug treatment is particularly effective at controlling synovitis and limiting long-term joint damage. Recognizing this, algorithms have been developed and validated to predict the development of RA in patients with newly presenting unclassified arthritis. In addition, the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria for RA have been developed to facilitate the early identification of patients with inflammatory arthritis requiring disease-modifying therapy. Typical features of established RA, including joint pain and swelling (with a characteristic joint distribution) and morning stiffness, are key features of these predictive algorithms and classification criteria.

Since attention has focused on progressively earlier phases of RA, it has become increasingly clear that for many patients there is a prodromal phase associated with joint pain, and sometimes the presence of autoantibodies, before the development of clinically overt synovitis. The nature of symptoms during the earliest phase of disease can influence how quickly patients present to professionals and are started on disease-modifying treatment. However, the full range of symptoms that characterize this phase, and the phase of early unclassified arthritis, has not been well studied. Cohort studies addressing these phases typically capture and report data on a limited number of symptoms known to be associated with established RA (e.g. joint pain, joint swelling, and morning stiffness). In doing this, it is possible that key symptoms and symptom complexes, specific to these early phases and therefore potentially relevant to the prediction of RA development, and treatment responses are overlooked. The fact that the synovium is histologically normal in patients with joint pain and anti–citrullinated protein antibody positivity suggests that pathologic processes operating during this phase may be different from those operating in established RA; the symptoms associated with these phases may also be different.

### Preventing rheumatoid arthritis: a global challenge [^115TpRud]. Clinical Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Significant advancements have been made in the discovery of gene signatures, biomarkers, novel therapeutic targets, diagnostic tools, and risk factors that predict the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There is also overwhelming evidence that treatment of early RA can prevent or alter disease progression and potentially lead to drug-free remission. Despite these advancements, there are significant challenges to identifying patients at risk of developing RA on a global scale. This commentary provides an overview of challenges related to the primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of RA in the context of health care systems. Patient-level, provider-level, and health care system-level barriers to implementing prevention strategies are discussed. Strategies and opportunities to address these challenges, on both a local and global scale, are reported. Benefits as well as potential negative consequences that may be associated with implementation of prevention strategies for RA are discussed in the context of individuals and public health.

### A multivariable prediction model to identify anti-CCP positive people in those with non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms in primary care [^114yDNjW]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

A phase of RA-related autoimmunity often precedes the onset of clinical RA by several months or years, characterized by the presence of anti-CCP antibodies and RF. Therapeutic intervention with MTX and abatacept in people at-risk of RA has been shown to reduce MRI inflammation, clinical symptoms and rates of RA, with sustained efficacy beyond treatment. Models developed for use in secondary care can predict inflammatory arthritis/RA development in people presenting with musculoskeletal symptoms with positive RF and/or anti-CCP antibodies, and positive imaging outcomes, i.e. US power Doppler signal, but without clinical signs of synovitis. However, people who develop musculoskeletal symptoms often initially present in primary care rather than secondary care.

Those subsequently diagnosed with RA in secondary care visit a general practitioner (GP) on average four times before being referred to a specialist for diagnosis; the median time from symptom onset to diagnosis and first treatment is 9 months. Our research team has developed a simple score to predict risk of inflammatory arthritis in anti-CCP positive individuals, which includes four biomarkers: anti-CCP titre, RF, ESR and early morning stiffness (EMS). However, anti-CCP testing is not routinely requested or always accessible in primary care. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) only recommends measuring anti-CCP antibodies if the patient is negative for RF when RA is suspected clinically and it should not delay a referral for a specialist opinion. Thus, there is an opportunity to identify people earlier in the pre-clinical phase of inflammatory arthritis through targeted anti-CCP testing in primary care, combined with inflammatory arthritis prediction models that include anti-CCP.

The existing evidence demonstrates the need for early diagnosis and intervention for inflammatory arthritis in secondary care populations, with the potential for greater gains if people can be identified earlier in primary care. Primary care studies have shown the importance of determining healthcare usage in the 'presentation stage' prior to the diagnosis of RA, and ensuring patients receive early screening for known concomitant diseases (e.g. cardiovascular). We aimed to develop a prediction model to identify which people, among those presenting to primary care with new-onset non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms, are likely to be anti-CCP positive and should be tested for anti-CCP antibodies. Targeted anti-CCP testing could aid early identification of those in the pre-clinical phase of inflammatory arthritis and reduce time to diagnosis.

### A multivariable prediction model to identify anti-CCP positive people in those with non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms in primary care [^115XZ92G]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Interpretation

Given the high costs of treating someone who develops RA vs the relatively low cost of an anti-CCP test, we chose two prediction model thresholds at low levels of likelihood of being anti-CCP positive: 3% (score ≥ 8) and 4% (score ≥ 11). These represent a belief that missing an anti-CCP positive person is between 24 and 33 times worse than performing an anti-CCP test in someone who is anti-CCP negative.

Using our prediction model with a threshold of ≥ 8 to determine who should undergo anti-CCP testing, we estimate that we would test ∼40% of those presenting with new-onset non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms, 4.4% of whom would be anti-CCP positive, and 65% of all individuals diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis/RA within 12 months would be identified by a positive test. Using the ≥ 11 threshold, 19% of those presenting with new-onset non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms would be tested, 6.1% of whom would be positive, and 52% of those who developed inflammatory arthritis/RA within 12 months would be identified. Such targeted early anti-CCP testing could be combined with existing inflammatory arthritis risk scores to prioritize high-risk individuals for observation and intervention.

The clinical utility of the two score thresholds will be explored with primary care clinicians in qualitative interviews to determine acceptability and to develop an intervention to support clinicians using this prediction model.

Implications

Interviews with primary care clinicians have been undertaken to understand the key behaviours required to support clinicians using this prediction score and to develop an intervention to support implementation in primary care, alongside heath economic modelling to explore potential cost-effectiveness.

There are currently no formal clinical recommendations for monitoring or managing people who are anti-CCP positive and at risk of developing RA. Further research is needed to understand who should be monitored, when and for how long, and determine the most appropriate place (primary or secondary care) for these people to be monitored. Understanding the perspective of rheumatologists who will be receiving referrals from primary care for those who are anti-CCP positive with symptoms will aid the implementation of this prediction model in primary care and improve patient pathways.

### Measuring ACPA in the general population or primary care: is it useful? [^114DwJFM]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Screening for a disease is intimately linked to the concept of prevention. Some have even argued that screening for a disease might be unethical if patients cannot be offered preventive treatment. Once viewed as an unavoidably damaging disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has recently become a potentially curable disease. Based on data from animal models and limited clinical evidence in RA, the existence of a critical period is proposed, a 'therapeutic window of opportunity', during which antirheumatic therapy may be capable of modifying the disease permanently or preventing it altogether. Several trials are currently exploring the impact of early, aggressive use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in preclinical RA. DMARDs such as abatacept, rituximab, methotrexate, methylprednisolone or hydroxychloroquine have/are being tested in individuals who do not have yet developed classifiable RA. Most preventive trials in RA have focused on secondary prevention in patients with recent onset, undifferentiated arthritis. Only few studies have explored the impact of early DMARD therapy in subjects with arthralgias, prior to clinical arthritis, or even subjects with only biomarkers for RA, the so-called 'autoimmunity associated with RA' phase.

### ACR / EULAR 2010 rheumatoid arthritis classification criteria [^111GmfGE]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of RA over the past two decades, particularly the identification of cytokines that promote synovial inflammation (e.g. TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6), have led to treatment courses that affect the disease process itself, beyond alleviation of symptoms. In turn, emphasis has shifted to intervention early enough in the disease course to prevent the joint destruction that follows inflammation. Accordingly, in 2010 the ACR and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) put forward revised classification criteria emphasizing RA characteristics that emerge early in the disease course, including ACPAs, a biomarker that predicts aggressive disease. These were in contrast with the 1987 ARA criteria, which distinguished established RA patients from those with other forms of arthritis, and identified patients with later disease. The categories of the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria are grouped into four classifications, with point scores for each: joint symptoms; serology (including RF and/or ACPA); symptom duration, whether < 6 weeks or > 6 weeks; and acute-phase reactants (CRP and/or ESR). The criteria were developed in a three-phase process, beginning with an analysis of patient cohorts to determine what disease characteristics had persuaded clinicians to initiate MTX therapy, followed by consensus-based decisions and the creation of a scoring system that would predict which patients would go on to develop persistent and/or erosive disease.

### Symptom complexes at the earliest phases of rheumatoid arthritis: a synthesis of the qualitative literature [^116BYKre]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Understanding the features and patterns of symptoms that characterize the earliest stages of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is of considerable importance if patients are to be identified and started on treatment early. However, little is known about the characteristics of symptoms at the onset of a disease that eventually progresses to RA.

Methods

A systematic review of qualitative peer-reviewed publications was conducted to identify the earliest symptoms associated with the onset of RA. A total of 1,736 abstracts were searched to identify relevant publications. Twenty-six publications were identified, assessed for quality, and subjected to analysis informed by thematic and grounded theory frameworks.

Results

Several interacting themes describing the early symptoms of RA were identified, including swelling, pain and tenderness, stiffness, fatigue and weakness, and the emotional impact of symptoms. For each symptom, different and evolving intensities were described; in some cases, patterns of symptom onset and symptom complexes at the onset of RA were highlighted. Importantly, this review has emphasized major deficiencies in the literature. None of the studies reviewed originally aimed to explore symptoms at RA onset (often discussions about symptom onset were secondary to the study's primary aim). Also, many of the articles identified sampled people diagnosed with RA many years previously, making their recollection of symptoms at onset less reliable.

Conclusion

In order for clinicians to fully understand the earliest phases of disease, the nature of symptoms at onset needs to be understood. The current work represents a useful starting point, but this area needs further qualitative investigation, followed by quantitative explorations of symptom clusters and their associated features.

### Components of treatment delay in rheumatoid arthritis differ according to autoantibody status: validation of a single-centre observation using national audit data [^112jpP1w]. Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

An established body of evidence now underlines the importance of promptly treating RA with DMARDs. Increasing evidence for a window of opportunity after symptom onset, during which therapeutic intervention meaningfully interrupts the disease's natural history, supports this approach. However, despite a proliferation of early arthritis clinics intended to expedite diagnosis, patients continue to experience substantial and multifactorial delays between symptom onset and treatment initiation.

When considering interventions to address this problem, it has proved informative to account for those components of the patient journey that contribute to delay. These include the time from symptom onset to assessment in primary care, primary care assessment to secondary care rheumatology referral, rheumatology referral to rheumatology assessment and rheumatology assessment to DMARD initiation. Individual components of this journey have been shown to vary markedly across healthcare infrastructures in Europe, with the lag between symptom development and primary care consultation being particularly important in the UK. Intriguingly, Kumar et al. provided preliminary evidence that RF-positive patients tended to endure a longer delay before primary care presentation than their seronegative counterparts. Conversely the publication of updated classification criteria for RA might have accelerated the diagnosis of seropositive patients due to the significance attached to autoantibodies.

A better understanding of how serological status may impact on treatment delay in RA could influence management guidelines in this heterogeneous disease. We have conducted a retrospective analysis of a well-characterized early RA cohort, to address whether treatment delay varies according to serological status and, if so, which components of the patient journey are most affected.

### Rheumatoid arthritis treatment: the earlier the better to prevent joint damage [^116cxVEe]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Key messages

Early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosis with promt initiation of treatment and precocious achievement of remission are the major predictors of long-term clinical, functional and radiographic outcomes.
The concept of 'window of opportunity' set within the first 12 weeks since disease onset has been demonstrated to offer unique sustained and long-term benefits. Such early time frame of intervention still needs to be optimised in everyday clinical practice.
This short review analyses the available evidence on the topic of early diagnosis and treatment of RA, with particular focus on the impact on radiographic progression.

### Comorbidities and extra-articular manifestations in difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis: different sides of the same coin? [^113BKtgX]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite the improvement in treatment for people with RA, ∼30% of patients remain symptomatic in the presence of optimized medical therapy, described as having 'difficult-to-treat' (D2T) RA. The average patient with RA has 1.6 other clinical conditions, which accumulate over time. Comorbidities are increasingly recognized as key contributors to D2T disease, and are themselves perpetuated by the D2T state. In this review, we discuss the commonest comorbidities in the context of D2T RA. We propose the need for a paradigm shift in the clinical and research agenda for comorbidities-including a need to consider and manage these prior to the development of D2T disease and not as an afterthought.

### Laboratory biomarkers or imaging in the diagnostics of rheumatoid arthritis? [^116Q3BA4]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by persistent inflammation and joint damage with a heterogeneous course and different pathogenic mechanisms leading to common signs and symptoms. In routine clinical practices, early diagnosis and recognition of inflammatory arthritis of short duration that develops to established RA in the future is sometimes difficult. In contrast to a few patients with inflammatory arthritis who may undergo spontaneous remission and some who may have a mild disease course with slow progression, more patients have moderate to high disease activity and some develop aggressive joint damage and systemic complications. Therefore, laboratory biomarkers and/or imaging assessments that would be more effective in the diagnosis of early disease are needed. Although RA is a clinical diagnosis and has no specific pathognomonic test defined so far, serological tests represent the most important parameters for diagnosis and for identification of at risk patients. Anti-citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPAs), especially in high levels, are associated with aggressive disease and together with acute phase reactants were implemented in the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria of RA. Fulfillment of these criteria thus persuades clinicians to initiate appropriate therapy early to avoid irreversible damage. Despite the high diagnostic value of ACPAs and rheumatoid factors (RFs), there is still a need for novel biomarkers to further improve the diagnosis of RA. Several novel autoantigens and antibodies that may improve early diagnosis and predict further development of the disease have been recently identified. Besides clinical signs and serological tests, imaging techniques, particularly ultrasound, may improve early diagnosis of RA, particularly in seronegative patients.

In this commentary, we will attempt to summarize the role of ultrasound and several serological biomarkers, which are currently studied in order to serve as surrogate measures for RA diagnosis.

### Symptom complexes at the earliest phases of rheumatoid arthritis: a synthesis of the qualitative literature [^1116pxJZ]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

RESULTS

The search strategy identified 1,736 peer-reviewed publications (excluding duplicates). The abstracts of all articles were read to identify studies potentially meeting the inclusion criteria. Subsequently, 91 abstracts were identified as potentially relevant, and each article was read in full by 2 authors (MS and RJS). Twenty-six publications were included in the final analysis (Table 2). Most studies were from either Europe or North America. The majority of participants sampled across individual studies were women, with some studies exclusively focusing on the perspectives of women with RA. Importantly, no studies had, as their primary aim, the exploration of symptoms at the onset of RA. In addition, most studies explored issues surrounding the onset of symptoms many years after participants had been diagnosed with RA. The methodologic quality of the majority of articles reviewed was high. Methods included in-depth methods and validity checks, including blind coding and respondent validation. Only 4 studies reported no checks on the validity of the data collected (Table 2).

Themes

Five major themes were developed describing the physical and, to a lesser extent, the psychological symptoms experienced at the onset of RA: swelling, pain and tenderness, stiffness, fatigue and weakness, and the emotional impact of symptoms.

Concepts that cut across all of these "symptom" themes were descriptors of the intensity of each of these symptoms and their speed and pattern of onset as well as complexes of symptoms, either occurring together from onset or gradually accumulating over time. In addition, there were frequent descriptions of the development of symptoms following pregnancy, functional impairment associated with early symptoms, and the impact of early symptoms on social relationships and work. These are not systematically reported here because we regarded them as reflecting the causes and consequences of symptoms rather than being symptoms themselves.

### What is the relationship between morning symptoms and measures of disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis? [^113dVTCx]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Little is known about the relationship between morning symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and measures of disease activity currently used to assess RA. Information available from the Circadian Administration of Prednisone in Rheumatoid Arthritis (CAPRA-2) study was used to investigate these relationships.

Methods

CAPRA-2 included 350 patients with RA who were symptomatic despite treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, randomized 2:1 to additional treatment with a 5-mg daily dose of delayed-release prednisone or placebo. Pearson's correlations were used to evaluate the relationships between change from baseline in symptoms (duration of morning stiffness, severity of morning stiffness, and intensity of pain on waking) and measures of disease activity (the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria [ACR20], the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints [DAS28], and the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index). Correlations were defined as weak (< 0.3), moderate (0.3–0.7), or strong (> 0.7).

Results

There was a strong correlation between the severity of morning stiffness and the intensity of morning pain (Pearson's correlation 0.91, P < 0.001). There was a weak correlation between the duration of morning stiffness and measures of disease activity (0.24–0.28), with moderate correlations between the severity of morning stiffness or intensity of pain on waking and DAS28 or ACR20 scores (0.44–0.48). Severity of morning stiffness showed less variability and a greater effect size than did duration of morning stiffness.

Conclusion

Morning symptoms and measures of disease activity show weak to moderate correlations. Severity of morning stiffness showed less variability and greater effect size than did duration of morning stiffness. These findings suggest that severity is the preferred construct to measure the impact of morning stiffness in patients with RA, information that is not fully captured in the RA core set.

### Time sequence of autoimmune processes in the trajectory to rheumatoid arthritis development: what do we know? [^112btov6]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

The symptomatic risk stage of ACPA-positive RA

12 studies fulfilled the primary inclusion criteria, of which 7 reported on ACPA maturation and 6 on other aspects of autoimmunity maturation (eg, course of cytokines, T-cell and B-cell subsets) (online supplemental table S3). All of them were executed in patients with symptoms, defined as either CSA, musculoskeletal symptoms or arthralgia. Studies consistently reported that IgG ACPA levels remained stable from the onset of symptoms to the onset of clinically apparent arthritis, as did the number of ACPA isotypes and citrullinated peptides recognised. Also, the ACPA IgG variable domain glycosylation profile seemed stable, although the number of patients studied with serial samples was relatively low. Regarding the immune response, a study on the expression of 37 cytokines reported stable levels from symptom onset to the onset of clinical arthritis. Different B-cell and T-cell subsets were also studied from symptom onset to clinical arthritis development. Although a relatively low number of subjects were studied, overall, stable lymphocyte subsets were observed.

### Diagnosing early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). What are the problems and opportunities? [^115pGL2Y]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Early diagnosis is being appropriately emphasized in RA, as early DMARD treatment can be very effective. ACR criteria are useful but may not perform as well in early disease. These criteria depend on clinical examination, which is subject to over- and under-interpretation. Ultrasound and MRI may offer advantages. Laboratory tests and synovial fluid analyses may contribute, but are often not definitive. All of these data, synovial biopsies and a variety of other features can guide prognosis as well as diagnosis. Consideration of the whole patient, including education levels and coping strategies, can help. Aggressive management is proposed for most patients once the diagnosis is firm. Strategies are needed to arrange that patients are seen at a very early stage by rheumatologists knowledgeable in the treatment of early arthritis. Early diagnosis is receiving increasing emphasis in RA, with the recognition that erosive irreversible disease can occur in the first months and that a variety of treatments can clearly prevent or slow disease progression (1, 2). Most studies addressing early RA use the American Rheumatism Association (ARA), now the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), criteria (3) for purposes of uniformity although these criteria have been shown to be less valid in early disease (4). Early DMARD treatment can make a difference, but there are a number of unanswered or partially answered questions about diagnosis that remain to be addressed. We review this area, focusing on work from our own research and how this has guided our thinking.

### Classification of rheumatoid arthritis: is it time to revise the criteria? [^114SNsi5]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

The ACR/EULAR 2010 RA classification criteria turned out to be more sensitive than the 1987 revised ACR criteria and to facilitate early identification of patients with RA immediately after the onset of symptoms, that is, synovitis in at least one small or two large joints. This allows not only the inclusion of patients with early arthritis in clinical studies but also a more timely start of therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), depending on the healthcare setting. The higher sensitivity has been demonstrated in several studies, which, however, also revealed decreased specificity. The lower specificity partially relates to RF and ACPA positivity, as was documented in a study in which the criteria were applied to a cohort of patients with very early inflammatory arthritis. Among misclassified patients (non-RA with a score ≥ 6), 20.5% were RF and/or ACPA positive; of note, the majority of these patients were RF positive, whereas ACPA was less frequently detected. Furthermore, dual RF/ACPA positivity was largely confined to patients with RA. Hence, at the seventh International Congress on Controversies in Rheumatology and Autoimmunity, a discussion was initiated to improve the specificity of the criteria attributed to the ACPA-based and RF-based serological signatures by changing the weight factors of the serological grades.

### Classification of rheumatoid arthritis: is it time to revise the criteria? [^112oH1op]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Classification criteria have been developed for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other rheumatic diseases in order to gather a homogeneous patient population for clinical studies and facilitate the timely implementation of therapeutic measures. Although classification criteria are not intended to be used for diagnosis, they are frequently used to support the diagnostic process in clinical practice, including clinical decision-making. The 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) classification criteria for RA are capable of identifying the majority of symptomatic patients with RA already in the earliest stages of the disease who are not yet showing radiographic changes. These patients will also profit from the early implementation of therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). However, the risk of misclassification is higher as compared with the former 1987 ACR criteria, which were considerably less sensitive to the recognition of patients with early RA. Of note, the presence of rheumatoid factors (RFs) and anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) has been attributed equal weight in the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria and may contribute up to 50% of the score needed for being classified as RA. However, while ACPAs have been proven to be the most specific serological markers of RA, the specificity of RF is moderate, especially at lower titres. This may lead to the misclassification of RF-positive patients and, consequently, the unjustified implementation of DMARD therapy. Therefore, issues arise on how comprehensive the criteria should be and whether they should be updated and adapted to findings from the past two decades that might increase both their specificity and sensitivity.

### Prevention of rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature review of preventive strategies in at-risk individuals [^114hTngg]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by symmetrical peripheral polyarthritis in the hands and/or feet, leading to long-term disability if not treated effectively. RA is preceded by a preclinical phase, in which genetically predisposed individuals accumulate environmental risk factors, and during which autoimmunity develops, followed by the emergence of non-specific signs and symptoms before arthritis becomes manifest. Early treatment in at-risk individuals - i.e. before the disease is fully established - has the theoretical potential to delay or prevent disease onset, with a positive impact on both patients' life and society.

We aimed to understand the feasibility of preventive treatment in at-risk individuals, taking into account recently performed studies and ongoing clinical trials, as well as patient perspectives.

Methods

We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) on Medline and Embase, searching articles published between 2010 and 2021 with the following key-words: "Rheumatoid arthritis", "arthralgia", "pre-treatment" or "prevent".

Results

Our SLR identified a total of 1821 articles. Articles were independently screened by two researchers. A total of 14 articles were included after screening, and an additional 8 reports were manually included. We identified ten relevant clinical trials performed in at-risk individuals, or in individuals with undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis. Although no treatment was shown to prevent RA onset, early treatment with rituximab and abatacept delayed onset of full-blown RA, and both conventional and biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) decreased disease-related physical limitations and increased DAS28-defined remission, at least temporarily.

Conclusions

This SLR demonstrates that early treatment of at-risk individuals may be effective in delaying RA onset, thereby decreasing disease-related limitations in individuals in the pre-clinical phase of RA. Whether this may ultimately lead to prevention of RA remains to be determined.

### Airways abnormalities in a prospective cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^113zgFr9]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

FOR EDITORIAL COMMENT, SEE

Take-home Points

Study Question: What are the baseline rates of airways abnormalities in a rheumatoid arthritis cohort and what are the clinical associations with respiratory symptoms?

Results: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis show high rates of airways abnormalities based on spirometry (20.7%) and radiologist-determined CT scan interpretation (61%), but only quantitative CT imaging analysis was associated with worse pulmonary symptoms.

Interpretation: Our results indicate that airways involvement in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is an underrecognized phenomena and has clinical importance based on associations with respiratory symptoms.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common inflammatory arthritis affecting 1% of the general population. Although arthritis is the hallmark of RA, extra-articular manifestations of RA occur, and among these, lung disease is the leading cause of death in patients with RA. Despite the important clinical impact and high frequency of lung disease in patients with RA, little is known about airways disease in patients with RA compared with other pulmonary manifestations of RA, such as interstitial lung disease (ILD).

Patients with RA have higher incidence of asthma and COPD compared with control participants without RA matched for age and smoking history. Further, the presence of obstructive lung disease in patients with RA is associated with increased mortality. Unlike RA with ILD, RA airways disease (RA-AWD) typically is treated as an entity independent from the RA. That is, a patient with RA receives a diagnosis of COPD or asthma, as opposed to having an underlying manifestation of RA. It remains unknown if RA-AWD represents an aspect of disease that potentially has shared risk factors for articular diseases; for example, smoking is known to increase the risk of articular RA as well as to drive airways disease. Further, it is unknown if RA-AWD is a unique RA manifestation that further would respond to RA disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, or if it should remain in the realm of typical pulmonologist-directed obstructive lung disease therapeutic approaches.

Using a prospective cohort of patients with RA, we sought to characterize airways abnormalities among patients with RA using standard physiologic and radiologic measures, as well as novel quantitative imaging analysis. Our hypothesis was that patients with RA exhibit findings of airways abnormalities and that the presence of airways abnormalities is associated with the presence and severity of respiratory symptoms.

### Prodromal symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis in a primary care database: variation by ethnicity and socioeconomic status [^1139TVfT]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this OCRD-based cross-sectional study, we have assessed the differences in symptoms recorded in the 24 months preceding a diagnosis of RA in primary care in relation to ethnicity and socioeconomic status (defined as IMD quintile). We found significant differences in symptoms coded across ethnic groups, which must be considered in clinical practice in diverse populations as well as in data-based prediction tools derived from OCRD to avoid algorithmic bias. Improved understanding of the differences in symptomatology between groups may enable targeted efforts to reduce inequities in treatment and outcomes of RA. Finally, this study provides guidance for future research into demographic differences in RA symptoms, including the underlying causalities and the clinical implications.

### Rheumatoid arthritis of the shoulder [^116EL2C9]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2003). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis affecting the shoulder region is a progressive disorder that results in pain, loss of range of motion, and functional disability. The inflammatory response, which is of unknown etiology, results in synovitis, pannus formation, and articular destruction. Even when patient history and physical examination suggest rheumatoid involvement of the shoulder, laboratory assessment and radiographic evaluation often are necessary to establish the diagnosis. Nonsurgical management is the primary treatment, including pharmacologic and physical therapy regimens for patients with mild symptoms and functional disability. Surgical intervention is indicated in patients with significant pain and functional limitation when nonsurgical treatment fails to provide relief. The procedure selected depends on careful assessment of the degree of articular cartilage injury and compromise of the periarticular soft tissues.

### Initial validation and results of the symptoms in persons at risk of rheumatoid arthritis (SPARRA) questionnaire: a EULAR project [^115fE2cn]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

A range of symptoms can be present in individuals at risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These individuals are usually defined based on either autoantibody positivity or symptoms. In seropositive at risk persons, symptoms usually occur later than seropositivity. However, information on location, timing and severity of symptoms is still largely lacking.

Symptoms such as joint pain, swelling and morning stiffness represent key elements in the diagnosis of RA. Clinicians have tried to use these and other symptoms to identify those at risk of RA before they fulfil classification criteria for this condition. A European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) taskforce recently outlined symptoms that were deemed most relevant in differentiating those at risk of developing RA (also known as 'clinically suspect arthralgia' (CSA)) from other patients with non-specific joint symptoms. The criteria set for CSA were based on expert opinion and have shown value in predicting arthritis.

Qualitative research in individuals at risk of RA provided a different starting point to evaluate symptoms using the experience of the affected persons to understand the range of their symptomatology. With this approach, multiple focus group interviews were performed in patients with seropositive arthralgia. Besides symptoms originating from the joints, additional extra-articular themes emerged such as fatigue, distress and loss of motor control, with a reported major impact on daily functioning. The presumed impact of such early symptoms is underscored by increased sick leave and medical ambulatory costs long before diagnosis of RA.

The 'Symptoms in Persons At Risk of Rheumatoid Arthritis' (SPARRA) questionnaire was developed based on data from our previous qualitative study. The aim of the present study was to describe the developmental process and test the psychometric properties of the SPARRA questionnaire in an international convenience sample of individuals at risk of RA (both autoantibody positive and negative) and to quantify and describe their symptoms based on this questionnaire.

### From patients with arthralgia, pre-RA and recently diagnosed RA: what is the current status of understanding RA pathogenesis? [^115AQMEF]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterised by inflamed joints and bone damage. As with any disease RA has a series of events leading up to its diagnosis. There are six phases that a patient can experience throughout the development of RA. These phases are 'genetic risk factors', 'environmental risk factors', 'systemic autoimmunity', 'symptoms without arthritis', 'undifferentiated arthritis' and 'RA'. Pre-RA patients are patients who are at risk for developing RA and who in the future will be diagnosed with RA when multiple criteria are met. Pre-RA patients can have autoantibodies such as anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) or rheumatoid factor (RF) but can also remain seronegative for these autoantibodies. Within the time frame of being a patient with arthralgia and receiving RA as diagnosis, multiple processes can take place causing autoimmunity, pain and bone erosions. Full comprehension of how RA develops over time is of importance. By understanding this, therapies can be developed to prevent RA instead of treating symptoms. In this review we describe RA pathogenesis with a focus on knowledge obtained from patients with arthralgia, pre-RA and recently diagnosed RA. We describe the pathogenesis for seropositive as well as seronegative patients. The complex interactions that compose inflammation are subdivided in the next sections and describe serum markers such as cytokines and chemokines, inflammatory cells and local changes in the synovium. Connections are proposed between altered immune cells, cytokines and chemokines, and events like synovial hyperplasia, pain and bone damage.

### Outcomes of patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving rehabilitation [^111GfuXy]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Rehabilitation, including physical therapy and occupational therapy, complements drug therapy in the management of symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Approximately 26% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis receive a referral for rehabilitation by rheumatologists. This review summarizes findings on the effectiveness and economic outcomes of physical therapy and occupational therapy in managing rheumatoid arthritis.

Recent Findings

Studies evaluating the outcomes of various service delivery models for physical therapy and occupational therapy demonstrate improvements, especially in physical function, among people with rheumatoid arthritis. A recent pilot study examining the primary therapist model also suggests that the primary therapist model may be a viable option for delivering rheumatoid arthritis rehabilitation services. However, the evidence on other alternative models such as the physical therapy/occupational therapy practitioner model is limited. Only a few economic evaluations have been performed, and among those, none examine the cost-effectiveness of different service models.

Summary

Systematically interpreting the findings of service delivery models in rehabilitation is challenging because of the wide range of interventions and outcome measures used. A thorough understanding of the value of different rehabilitation models will require the guidance of a sound evaluation framework. Future clinical trials should consider including a component for evaluating cost-effectiveness. Such knowledge can contribute to evidence-informed resource allocation.

### Delay in presentation to primary care physicians is the main reason why patients with rheumatoid arthritis are seen late by rheumatologists [^112UL58Z]. Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study the delay from the time of symptom onset to assessment by a Rheumatologist in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to determine the contributions of patient and physician dependent factors to this delay.

Methods

Data were collected from 169 consecutive patients with RA at the time of assessment by Rheumatologists working in hospitals serving an inner city population in Birmingham, UK. Dates were recorded for: (i) onset of inflammatory joint symptoms; (ii) initial assessment in primary care; and (iii) referral from primary to secondary care. (iv) initial assessment by a rheumatologist in secondary care.

Results

The median delay from the onset of symptoms to a patient being assessed in secondary care was 23 weeks (IQR 12–54 weeks). The median delay before the patient was assessed in primary care was 12 weeks (IQR 4–28 weeks). For 96 patients (57%) more than half of the overall delay in assessment in secondary care was accounted for by a delay in assessment in primary care.

Conclusions

Patient dependent factors, leading to a delay in consulting primary care physicians, are the principal reasons for the delay in patients with RA being seen by Rheumatologists in our population. A considerable body of evidence demonstrates that the earlier that therapy is introduced the better the clinical outcome. Consequently it is important to understand why some patients with RA delay in seeking medical advice, in order to allow effective interventions to reduce this delay.

### A multivariable prediction model to identify anti-CCP positive people in those with non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms in primary care [^1133ZU7e]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This prediction model offers an opportunity to identify people at risk of RA among the rising number of musculoskeletal conditions that are seen in primary care, through targeted anti-CCP testing before they develop synovitis, the hallmark feature of RA. Ongoing work to implement this prediction model in primary care comes at a time when evidence is emerging to support intervention in those who are at high risk of developing RA. Early identification in primary care prompting referral to rheumatologists in secondary care can facilitate earlier diagnosis. It could also facilitate RA prevention strategies, aimed at reversing subclinical inflammation and potentially delaying or preventing the onset of RA. Such approaches have the potential to reduce the long-term disability and comorbidities typically associated with RA.

### Rheumatoid arthritis treatment: the earlier the better to prevent joint damage [^115zXzDq]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

The management of rheumatoid arthritis has undergone major advances in recent years, both in terms of the drugs armamentarium and therapeutic strategy. Treating disease to target, aiming at remission, through a tight control protocol is regarded as the standard of care. Reaching clinical and radiographic disease remission has therefore become an achievable goal. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that early diagnosis, prompt treatment initiation and early achievement of remission are the major predictors of long-term clinical, functional and radiographic outcomes. Concentrating efforts in controlling disease activity in a very early window of opportunity offers unique sustained benefits. In this short review, we analysed the available evidence supporting the value of treating rheumatoid arthritis early and the impact on disease outcomes, with particular focus on radiographic progression.

### The natural history of rheumatoid arthritis [^116EXhgQ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This article reviews the phases of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) development in terms of the evolution of disease, with a focus on events that occur before the first appearance of clinically apparent inflammatory arthritis. This presynovitis period is defined in individuals who eventually develop classified RA as the pre-RA phase. We include additional discussion of the relevance of this model of RA development to the concept of disease prevention.

Methods

The information provided in this review was identified through searches of the medical literature through MEDLINE and a review of references from published manuscripts as well as information obtained by the authors through attendance at various conferences and working groups related to pre-RA.

Findings

It is now well established that RA develops in a series of phases. The first of these phases is believed to be the presence of genetic and/or environmental risk factors for RA in the absence of detectable systemic autoimmunity in the blood. After this phase, autoimmunity may be detectable through a variety of means (eg, autoantibodies, autoreactive cells) in peripheral blood; in addition, there is emerging evidence that perhaps initiation and early propagation of RA-related autoimmunity may occur at mucosal sites. The presence of autoimmunity detectable in the blood through serologic or other testing is followed in most individuals by a propagation phase that is characterized by an expansion of autoimmunity, inflammation, and symptoms. This transition may be associated with similar or different genetic and environmental factors that initially triggered autoimmunity, as well as continued mucosal inflammation and local RA-related autoantibody production. Eventually, clinically detectable inflammatory arthritis develops that can be classified as RA.

Implications

Understanding the phases of RA development are critical to the development of preventive strategies for this disease.

### The new European League Against Rheumatism / American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis: how are they performing? [^113PGXe6]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This era of early aggressive treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) calls for criteria that allow timely classification of patients at risk of persistent erosive disease. We review how the new American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria meet up to this challenge.

Recent Findings

The new 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA were developed using initiation of methotrexate as anchor in a population with undifferentiated arthritis. Many studies from different countries have now been published that have addressed the performances of these new criteria.

Summary

The goal of earlier classification of RA seems to be met with the new criteria, but exclusion of other diagnoses is essential. Increased sensitivity comes at the price of loss of specificity and indiscriminate use of these classification criteria as a diagnostic tool carries the risk of overtreatment.

### Windows for intervention in the prearthritis phase of rheumatoid arthritis? A narrative review of key triggering events and potential preventive strategies [^113CCNBH]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Individuals without clinical signs of arthritis, but for different reasons are facing an increased risk for RA (eg, by testing positive for RA-related autoantibodies, presenting with small joint arthralgia, or being a first-degree relative (FDR) to a person with RA), are denoted at-risk subjects. This contrasts with the term pre-RA, which is only to be used for cases where clinical RA is known to have occurred. The risk of progression from at-risk to clinical RA is substantially different depending on the (combination of) factors underlying the at-risk classification, ranging from 0.2% to 57% over a year (table 1), highlighting the significant heterogeneity contained within the term at-risk. Stratifying the risk of progression among at-risk subjects is an important, but challenging, task to achieve personalised management of at-risk patients both in rheumatology and primary care settings. Importantly, risk stratification criteria were recently developed by the American College of Rheumatology and the European Alliance for Rheumatology Associations, which can be used for defining more homogenous risk groups in clinical trials. It is likely that the characterisation of events that determine the transition from risk phase to overt disease would not only identify potential therapeutic targets but also likely improve individualisation of patient care.

### Rheumatoid arthritis: extra-articular manifestations and comorbidities [^113Y24Mn]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Although synovitis is the pathological hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), many extra-articular manifestations (EMs) and comorbidities likely occur due to the complex, chronic, inflammatory, and autoimmune features of RA. Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the most common cause of death in patients with RA. Compared to the general population, patients with RA have twice the risk of myocardial infarction and up to 50% increased CV mortality risk. Severe and prolonged disease activity, genetics, and inflammation (e.g. CRP, ACPA, cytokines, matrix-degrading enzymes) play important roles in CV disease and atheroscleroticdamage. The second major cause of death in patients with RA is respiratory disease, which occurs in 30–40% of patients. RA may affect the lung interstitium, airways, and pleurae, while pulmonary vascular involvement is less frequent. Central and peripheral nervous system involvement is usually due to small vessel vasculitis, joint damage, or drug toxicity. There is also evidence that microvascular cerebral damage caused by systemic inflammation is associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Some observational studies have hinted how Disease Modified Anti-Rheumatic Drugs and biologics could reduce the incidence of dementia. Primary gastrointestinal and renal involvements are rare and often relate to drug therapy. To minimize morbidity and mortality, physicians must manage RA disease activity (treat-to-target) and monitor risk factors and concomitant conditions (e.g. smoking cessation; weight regulation; monitoring blood pressure, lipids, thyroid hormone, folic acid and homocysteine; screening for depression, anxiety, atlantoaxial instability, and atherosclerosis). This article aims to provide an overview of the most prevalent and important EMs and comorbidities associated with RA.

### Detecting the earliest signs of rheumatoid arthritis: symptoms and examination [^114wA1YC]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Signs and symptoms often occur well in advance of a formal diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, these do not necessarily represent symptoms that are included in classification criteria. Their intensity, frequency, and persistence over time seem to be important in the spectrum from preclinical autoimmunity to classifiable RA. Prospective study of signs and symptoms in individuals at risk for RA will help to determine their onset and relationship with epitope spreading, cytokine evolution, sensitive imaging, and their usefulness in discriminating between individuals patients who will develop incident inflammatory arthritis versus normal controls.

### Systematic literature review of residual symptoms and an unmet need in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^11226zQU]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the world's most prevalent chronic autoimmune inflammatory arthritis, is characterized by joint inflammation directly leading to pain, functional decline, and fatigue, all of which negatively impact health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) and reduce a patient's ability to work. A combination of new therapeutics and new treat‐to‐target strategies has made sustained clinical remission a primary goal in treating patients with RA. Reaching this goal requires regular assessment of RA activity composite measures and the ability to escalate treatment regimens.

Significance & Innovations

Based on a very large literature search, we have identified that there is a paucity of data and lack of standardization for reporting residual patient‐centered symptoms and outcomes in those patients attaining a treatment target.
Reliance solely on traditional rheumatoid arthritis disease activity targets as acceptable treatment goals risks underestimating the impact on patients' pain, function, health, and true burden of illness for a meaningful proportion of patients.
The use of patient‐reported outcomes in addition to a treat‐to‐target approach may provide information that will inform a management decision necessary to address residual symptoms.

Despite successes from this approach, remission may not be achievable, and a low disease activity (LDA) state may be an acceptable alternative goal. However, for some patients, particularly in the more established phase of disease, it may not be possible to achieve and sustain even LDA, as evidenced in real‐world data. In addition, patients with RA and moderate disease activity may prefer staying with their current treatment over changing treatment and risking the possibility of developing worse symptoms, including possible side effects. Whether or not a disease activity treatment target is achieved, many symptoms most troublesome to individuals living with RA are subjective in nature, and their true impact is known only to the patients themselves and not routinely captured in disease activity scores. These concerns highlight the importance of understanding and measuring other HRQoL domains that are impacted by RA and that might be ameliorated by using therapeutic approaches employed adjunctively to a goal‐oriented strategy determined solely by composite measures of disease activity.

Recognizing that individuals with RA who meet remission or LDA as defined by composite scores of disease activity may continue to have symptoms (referred to subsequently as "residual symptoms"), we set out in this study to understand the nature of such residual symptoms as reported in the literature and how these symptoms impact patients' lives.

Rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis, a concept which includes diseases like ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and arthritis/spondylitis associated with inflammatory bowel disease, are both chronic inflammatory rheumatologic conditions. This article focuses on extra-articular manifestations, defined as diseases and symptoms not directly related to the locomotor system. The different manifestations are addressed per body system. Diagnostic and prognostic implications of these manifestations in daily practice are discussed.

### Symptom complexes in patients with seropositive arthralgia and in patients newly diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis: a qualitative exploration of symptom development [^114c4BbW]. Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to explore symptoms and symptom development during the earliest phases of RA in patients with seropositive arthralgia and patients newly diagnosed with RA.

Methods

Interviews were conducted with 15 seropositive patients (anti-CCP positive, and often with arthralgia) and 11 newly presenting RA patients [classified according to the 2010 ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria]. Feedback procedures shared the experiences of seropositive arthralgia patients with early RA patients and vice versa. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.

Results

Symptoms common to both groups included joint pain, psychological distress, muscle cramps, abnormal skin sensations, stiffness, loss of motor control, weakness, fatigue and sleeping difficulties. Also, patterns of symptom evolution and the order of symptom development were described. Seropositive arthralgia patients described pain as annoying, while RA patients described how the severity of pain intensified before diagnosis, to the point where symptoms were psychologically distressing. Patients with seropositive arthralgia described reddening of the skin and burning sensations that they felt were indicative of the onset of swelling. Intense pain appeared to precede the onset of swelling for those with RA, which was often palindromic and travelled between joints until it later became persistent.

Conclusion

This study highlights the breadth of symptoms that constitute the earliest phases of RA. Further research is needed to develop measures of symptom patterns and clusters to allow the predictive utility of symptoms to be assessed and to allow the integration of aspects of the patient's history into evidence-based investigative and management algorithms for use in primary and secondary care.

### Symptoms of depression and anxiety predict treatment response and long-term physical health outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis: secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial [^111QbcKq]. Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Outcomes

Our primary outcomes are DAS-28 and HAQ. The DAS-28 is the gold standard for measuring RA disease activity: it is recommended by all major RA guidelines; it is easily calculated, and widely accepted as a high-quality indicator of the value of treatment. The HAQ is a self-reported measure, recommended by clinical guidelines to measure functional ability. Both the DAS-28 and HAQ are used widely, both as outcomes in clinical trials and in clinical practice, and were therefore selected as primary outcomes for the current analysis. Secondary outcomes of interest are the components of the DAS-28: tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), ESR and patient global assessment (PGA). We also examined the relationship between depression/anxiety symptoms and the odds of reaching clinical remission at the study end point. This was assessed through establishing the number of patients scoring < 2.6 on the DAS-28 at 2-year follow-up. These were included in the current analysis as secondary outcomes, and were all measured at 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-months following baseline assessment.

### Rheumatoid arthritis: diagnosis and management for the family physician [^111p1Et4]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that causes joint inflammation, erosion, and deformity. The prevalence of RA in North America is 0.5% to 1%. RA is associated with significant morbidity and disability and an increased mortality rate. The disease should be suspected in patients who present with joint inflammation, especially those who have polyarthritis. Additional characteristic features include symmetrical small joint polyarthritis, morning stiffness, and constitutional symptoms. Extra-articular manifestations are common and may affect multiple body systems. Application of a decision tool, such as the Leiden clinical prediction rule for undifferentiated arthritis, may facilitate early diagnosis of RA. Useful diagnostic tests include inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody. Initial therapy routinely includes oral methotrexate. The American College of Rheumatology and European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology recommend a treat-to-target approach, including rapid interventions to reduce disease activity and achieve remission. Although RA remains incurable, patient quality of life has improved dramatically with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and targeted synthetic DMARDs. All DMARDs increase the risk of infection; therefore, routine vaccinations should be up to date in patients taking these drugs. Because patients with RA have increased risk of cardiovascular disease, addressing other cardiovascular risk factors may reduce morbidity and mortality.

### Which patients presenting with arthralgia eventually develop rheumatoid arthritis? The current state of the art [^116R9Tvg]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Differentiating arthralgia suspicious for progression to RA from other arthralgias

Before reviewing the accuracy of different types of predictors, appreciation of the population studied is important. Arthralgia is a non-specific symptom and the biological nature of joint pain is diverse. Consequently, the risk to progress to RA is different for patients with arthralgia in different settings.

Musculoskeletal (MSK) symptoms are very prevalent in primary care. Primary care data from the Netherlands suggest an annual incidence of non-traumatic MSK symptoms of ~300/1000. In other words, almost one-third of the population visits the general practitioner (GP) at least once a year with an MSK symptom. The vast majority of these patients have explanations for their joint symptoms other than the beginning of a systemic inflammatory arthritis, and inflammatory arthritis is considered by GPs in only a minority of patients (figure 3). A separate Dutch GP study recorded an incidence of suspected arthritis of ~3/1000/year; most patients had a monoarthritis, and 60% had self-limiting symptoms. A small proportion of patients had suspected oligoarthritis or polyarthritis, and symptom persistence was more common in this group. These data support the notion that GPs are able to differentiate inflammatory from non-inflammatory cases of MSK symptoms and that the incidence of suspected inflammatory arthritis in primary care is low.

Figure 3
Clinical expertise of GPs and rheumatologists in differentiating patients with arthralgia. This figure is constructed based on the following references: The clinical expertise of GPs and rheumatologists is effective in differentiating patients with arthralgia; of all patients with MSK symptoms visiting their GPs (~300/1000/year), only a small subset is suspected for arthritis (~3/1000/year). Of all patients with any MSK symptoms visiting secondary care (~8/1000/year), only 7% were identified as CSA. The incidence of any MSK symptom in secondary care is higher than the incidence of patients with suspected arthritis in primary care, as GPs also refer patients with MSK symptoms in whom they did not suspect arthritis to be present. 74% of patients with CSA had a positive EULAR definition.CSA, clinically suspect arthralgia; GP, general practitioner; EULAR, European League Against Rheumatism; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; MSK, musculoskeletal symptoms.

### A multivariable prediction model to identify anti-CCP positive people in those with non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms in primary care [^116H5jf1]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rheumatology key messages
This novel multivariable prediction model provides the opportunity to support primary care clinicians in identifying people at risk of RA.
This prediction model identifies individuals with non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms without synovitis who are more likely to test anti-CCP positive and are therefore at risk of RA.
Targeted anti-CCP testing will aid the implementation of the 'simple score' in anti-CCP positive individuals to stratify risk of developing RA.

### Treat to target approach for asthma [^111bEcUF]. The Journal of Asthma (2020). Medium credibility.

Recognition that about half of asthma deaths might be preventable if recommended guidelines are followed suggests that better implementation of established management strategies is needed. However, to achieve a further substantive reduction in asthma mortality, novel strategies will also be required. It is well established that asthma is a disease of chronic inflammation, with episodes of worsening inflammation associated with increased symptoms and/or exacerbations; however, current guidelines paradoxically recommend that initial treatment is only symptomatic, rather than directed at the underlying inflammatory mechanism. The "Treat to target" (TTT) approach has become a popular concept in the medical management of several common chronic conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. For example, as part of a TTT approach, rheumatologists recommend methotrexate for RA with onset within 6months. Applying the TTT approach to asthma, the primary target could be clinical remission and the primary goals as follows: eliminate symptoms and exacerbation risk; prevent airway remodeling; and normalize lung function. To construct a TTT algorithm for chronic asthma, the proposal is to eradicate short-acting β2-agonists (SABA) at all asthma severity levels and replace SABA with "Anti-Inflammatory Reliever Therapy" (AIR), using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/SABA or ICS/formoterol. For individuals with equal to or less than 12 months' history of symptoms, fewer than two symptoms per month, no exacerbations in the last 12months and normal lung function, the recommendation is early initiation of ICS/SABA or ICS/formoterol as AIR.

### Association of genetic risk for rheumatoid arthritis with cognitive and psychiatric phenotypes across childhood and adolescence [^1133k7fL]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is genetic liability for rheumatoid arthritis associated with cognitive and psychiatric phenotypes in children prior to the clinical onset of disease?

Findings

In this cohort study of 7977 children and adolescents, genetic liability for rheumatoid arthritis was associated with lower total, performance, and verbal IQ at age 8 years and symptoms of hyperactivity and inattention from ages 4 to 16 years. However, there was little evidence of association with other domains of psychopathology.

Meaning

These findings support a primary etiological association between genetic risk for rheumatoid arthritis and cognitive phenotypes that is not simply secondary to disease-related processes or reverse causation.

### Early referral recommendation for newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis: evidence based development of a clinical guide [^115555DC]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Effective treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) requires early diagnosis and early disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment to have an impact on long term morbidity and mortality. Clinical criteria would facilitate early referral of the patient with suspected RA to a rheumatologist for definitive diagnosis and initiation of DMARD treatment at that point in the disease most likely to have an impact on the long term outcome.

Objective

To develop a referral recommendation that may serve as a clinical guide for primary care doctors, enabling them to identify patients with suspected RA during the early inflammatory stages.

Methods

Key points of the referral criteria were formed based on a thorough literature review targeting early RA, early arthritis clinics, DMARD treatment for early RA, prognostic factors of disease progression, early RA clinical trials, and quality of life. Evidence was graded using the methods defined by Shekelle et al. A draft version of the criterion was circulated among the authors for critical evaluation. A consensus integrated these comments.

Results

Clinical evidence strongly supports the observations that structural damage occurs early in active RA and that early DMARD treatment improves the long term outcome of the disease. The observations indicate that rapid referral to a rheumatologist is advised when RA is suspected. This may be supported by the presence of any of the following: ≥ 3 swollen joints, metatarsophalangeal/metacarpophalangeal involvement, and morning stiffness of ≥ 30 minutes.

Conclusion

The proposed early referral recommendation is a viable tool for primary care doctors to identify potential patients with active RA early in the disease. Early referral to a rheumatologist for definitive diagnosis and early DMARD treatment should improve the long term outcome of RA.

### Practical progress in realisation of early diagnosis and treatment of patients with suspected rheumatoid arthritis: results from two matched questionnaires within three years [^112n1nAt]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Early diagnosis and treatment with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been advocated for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This survey focuses on the individual definitions and treatment modalities of rheumatologists, and aims at determining the practical realisation of these concepts.

Methods

A questionnaire to be self completed was handed out at the EULAR Symposium 1997. The main issues dealt with were definition, referral time, diagnosis, follow up, and treatment of early RA. Of the 111 participants, who were from all continents and all age groups, 85 (77%) gave their name and address. In 2000, the same questionnaire was sent to these 85 primary respondents. Forty four questionnaires (52%) were returned, and their results were matched and further evaluated.

Results

The definition of early RA was heterogeneous, but two of three rheumatologists use the term "early" for symptoms shorter than three months. There was a drift towards acceptance of involvement of fewer affected joints. Serological tests obtained for early diagnosis were mostly rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies, usually in combination (approximately 70%), while other tests (antikeratin antibodies, antiperinuclear factor, anti-RA33) were used rarely, but increasingly (21–25% all together). No significant change in the lag time of referral to the specialist of patients with suspected early RA was seen within these three years (< 3 months for 50%, > 6 months for 20%), while the proportion followed up during the first three months increased. At both times, every second rheumatologist started DMARD treatment only when the 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria were fulfilled. However, in 1997 about 10% were willing to wait for erosions before starting DMARDs, while none did so in 2000. Methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and antimalarial drugs were the most commonly prescribed DMARDs in early RA, with the first two of these still being in increasing use.

Conclusion

The understanding of "early" rheumatoid arthritis is heterogeneous, but the vast majority of the rheumatologists surveyed regard symptom duration of < 3 months as early. Rheumatoid factor was the most useful laboratory support in early diagnosis. Because there has been no shortening of referral time of patients with new RA within the past three years, and many rheumatologists start DMARDs only when the ACR criteria are fulfilled, it is concluded that guidelines for early referral, as well as for early (rheumatoid) arthritis, are needed.

### Prodromal symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis in a primary care database: variation by ethnicity and socioeconomic status [^111Yp3Fe]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

RA is a common immune-mediated inflammatory condition with an adult prevalence of 0.8% in the UK. Patients typically present in primary care before being referred to and diagnosed by rheumatologists. Treatment within 3 months of symptom onset is associated with improved clinical outcomes, including higher chances of sustained remission, reduced joint destruction and reduction of extra-articular disease manifestations. Despite this, a recent UK audit found that half of all patients experienced symptoms for longer than 6 months prior to referral (as reported by secondary care clinicians). Similarly, an older study found that a quarter of patients experience symptoms for > 66 weeks before seeing a rheumatologist An increase in primary care consultations in the 2 years preceding a diagnosis of RA has been reported and even after being seen in primary care, 44% of patients are still not referred within the target of three working days, and a Danish study of RA patients found that 25% of RA patients had five or more general practitioner (GP) consultations before RA was considered as a cause for their symptoms. The above suggest scope for earlier identification and referral of suspect cases to secondary care.

### Rheumatoid arthritis [^114YKGin]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by painful, swollen joints that can severely impair physical function and quality of life. The presenting symptoms of musculoskeletal pain, swelling, and stiffness are common in clinical practice, so familiarity with diagnosing and managing RA is crucial. Patients with RA are at greater risk for serious infection, respiratory disease, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mortality than the general population. In recent years, early diagnosis, aggressive treatment, and expanded therapeutic options of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs have markedly improved both the management and long-term prognosis of RA.

### Considerations for improving quality of care of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and associated comorbidities [^114VafYN]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder with a global prevalence of approximately 0.5–1%. Patients with RA are at an increased risk of developing comorbidities (eg, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes and depression). Despite this, there are limited recommendations for the management and implementation of associated comorbidities. This study aimed to identify good practice interventions in the care of RA and associated comorbidities.

Methods

A combination of primary research (180+ interviews with specialists across 12 European rheumatology centres) and secondary research (literature review of existing publications and guidelines/recommendations) were used to identify challenges in management and corresponding good practice interventions. Findings were prioritised and reviewed by a group of 18 rheumatology experts including rheumatologists, comorbidity experts, a patient representative and a highly specialised nurse.

Results

Challenges throughout the patient pathway (including delays in diagnosis and referral, shortage of rheumatologists, limited awareness of primary care professionals) and 18 good practice interventions were identified in the study. The expert group segmented and prioritised interventions according to three distinct stages of the disease: (1) suspected RA, (2) recent diagnosis of RA and (3) established RA. Examples of good practice interventions included enabling self-management (self-monitoring and disease management support, for example, lifestyle adaptations); early arthritis clinic; rapid access to care (online referral, triage, ultrasound-guided diagnosis); dedicated comorbidity specialists; enhanced communication with primary care (hotline, education sessions); and integrating patient registries into daily clinical practice.

Conclusion

Learning from implementation of good practice interventions in centres across Europe provides an opportunity to more widely improved care for patients with RA and associated comorbidities.

### Nomenclature for the phases of the development of rheumatoid arthritis [^1157PNj6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common immune-mediated inflammatory disease. Research on RA is increasingly focused on the earliest stages of the disease, and has provided strong evidence that clinical signs and symptoms may be preceded by a preclinical phase during which evidence of systemic autoimmunity may be present. To facilitate research in this area, a number of international initiatives have proposed definitions of the phases of disease leading up to RA. The first of these initiatives was the European League Against Rheumatism's (EULAR) set of recommendations on terminology in persons at risk for RA, which suggested that the "at-risk phases" be described in terms of patients variably having: (A) genetic risk factors for RA; (B) environmental risk factors for RA; (C) systemic autoimmunity associated with RA; (D) symptoms without clinical arthritis; and (E) unclassified arthritis. The phrase clinically suspect arthralgia (CSA) is now widely used and can be regarded as describing a subgroup of patients in phase D. A definition of CSA was recently proposed by a EULAR taskforce, and primary research has begun to explore the full range of symptoms, as well as their sensitivity and specificity alone and in combination with other factors, that characterize this phase. Similarly, immune abnormalities at mucosal and others sites that precede and/or are associated with the onset of musculoskeletal symptoms are being increasingly studied and understood. Whether some of these at-risk phases, in particular CSA, represent entities meriting their own classification criteria is an essential area for consensus and will be discussed.

### Rheumatoid arthritis: common questions about diagnosis and management [^111Gso8L]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is the most commonly diagnosed systemic inflammatory arthritis, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 1% worldwide. Women, smokers, and those with a family history of the disease are most often affected. Rheumatoid arthritis should be considered if there is at least one joint with definite swelling that is not better explained by another disease. In a patient with inflammatory arthritis, the presence of a rheumatoid factor and/or anti-citrullinated protein antibody, elevated C-reactive protein level, or elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate is consistent with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis may impact organs other than the joints, including lungs, skin, and eyes. Rapid diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis allows for earlier treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, which is associated with better outcomes. The goal of therapy is to initiate early medical treatment to achieve disease remission or the lowest disease activity possible. Methotrexate is typically the first-line agent for rheumatoid arthritis. Additional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or biologic agents should be added if disease activity persists. Comorbid conditions, including hepatitis B or C or tuberculosis infections, must be considered when choosing medical treatments. Although rheumatoid arthritis is often a chronic disease, some patients can taper and discontinue medications and remain in long-term remission.

### Diagnosis and management of rheumatoid arthritis [^1123Ye3G]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is the most commonly diagnosed systemic inflammatory arthritis. Women, smokers, and those with a family history of the disease are most often affected. Criteria for diagnosis include having at least one joint with definite swelling that is not explained by another disease. The likelihood of a rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis increases with the number of small joints involved. In a patient with inflammatory arthritis, the presence of a rheumatoid factor or anti-citrullinated protein antibody, or elevated C-reactive protein level or erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggests a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Initial laboratory evaluation should also include complete blood count with differential and assessment of renal and hepatic function. Patients taking biologic agents should be tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis. Earlier diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis allows for earlier treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic agents. Combinations of medications are often used to control the disease. Methotrexate is typically the first-line drug for rheumatoid arthritis. Biologic agents, such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, are generally considered second-line agents or can be added for dual therapy. The goals of treatment include minimization of joint pain and swelling, prevention of radiographic damage and visible deformity, and continuation of work and personal activities. Joint replacement is indicated for patients with severe joint damage whose symptoms are poorly controlled by medical management.

### Primary and secondary fibromyalgia are the same: the universality of polysymptomatic distress [^114VFfmY]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Polysymptomatic distress (PSD) is the underlying metric of fibromyalgia (FM), and levels of PSD can identify criteria-positive FM with > 90% accuracy. We used levels of the PSD scale to test whether symptom levels in primary FM (PFM) and secondary FM (SFM) were the same and whether symptoms were equivalent in persons not meeting FM criteria.

Methods

We studied 1525 patients with a clinical diagnosis of FM and 12,037 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We used regression models to compare patients with potential and actual PFM to RA patients with potential and actual SFM for 17 key clinical variables.

Results

When controlled for PSD values, the widespread pain index, symptom severity scale, and pain, global, quality of life, and physical and mental component scores were essentially the same or only slightly different in PFM and SFM. Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index scores were slightly higher in SFM (0.21 units), as was the painful joint count (1.6 joints). Overall, higher PSD scores were associated with more severe symptoms or abnormal status. PSD scores in patients not satisfying FM criteria and in patients satisfying criteria operated similarly.

Conclusion

PFM and SFM are equivalent regarding symptom burden. PSD scores are more informative about severity and severity within diagnosis than dichotomization into FM/non-FM. Studies of FM versus "healthy individuals", or FM versus other diseases, are inherently defective, while studies of FM and PSD in RA offer the opportunity to have meaningful comparison groups, because there are no readily available unbiased appropriate controls for PFM.

### Symptom complexes at the earliest phases of rheumatoid arthritis: a synthesis of the qualitative literature [^112E7TDU]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Understanding the features and patterns of symptoms that characterize the earliest stages of RA is of considerable importance. Primary care physicians, for whom patients with articular/periarticular pain make up a considerable proportion of their workload, need to be able to identify symptoms and patterns of symptoms that most accurately predict the development of RA and that should guide decisions about further investigation and referral to rheumatologists. Even within secondary care, the ability to predict the development of RA in patients at risk is an important aim, and an understanding of the role of patients' symptoms in this process needs detailed consideration.

In this review, we have identified 5 major symptoms describing patients' experiences at the onset of their RA. For each of these symptoms, different and frequently evolving intensities were described, different patterns of symptoms were described (rapid onset and gradual onset, gradually progressive and palindromic), and different complexes of symptoms, at onset and during evolution, were noted. However, perhaps most importantly, this review has highlighted major deficiencies in the current literature in relation to this area. We were able to identify only a small number of relevant qualitative articles. Importantly, none of the studies set out specifically to examine the full depth and breadth of initial symptoms, their nature, and their evolution over time, and the coexistence of symptoms in symptom complexes. Furthermore, characteristics of patients included in the studies were often poorly described, men were significantly underrepresented, and few participants were from nonwhite populations. These issues are important, since sociodemographic differences in the experience of illness have been reported, e.g. people from different ethnic backgrounds have been shown to experience illness in different ways. Interestingly, people with RA from a South Asian background delay in seeking help for a longer period of time than white British patients. Whether this is because of a different initial symptom experience or because their response to those symptoms differs has not been fully elucidated. One of the most important deficiencies in the current literature is that patients were frequently interviewed many years after the onset of their RA, when their recollections of initial symptoms may have been poor or colored by more recent symptom experiences. Ideally, explorations of early RA symptoms should be carried out in patients shortly after a diagnosis of RA. In addition, exploring symptom experience in symptomatic individuals at risk of RA may help to avoid the drawbacks of retrospective data and help to fully characterize the range of initial symptoms at different phases of disease.

### A multivariable prediction model to identify anti-CCP positive people in those with non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms in primary care [^1148jfSa]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

We aimed to develop a prediction model identifying people presenting to primary care with musculoskeletal symptoms likely to be anti-CCP positive and therefore at risk of developing RA.

Methods

Participants aged ≥ 16 years, with new-onset non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms and no history of clinical synovitis, completed a symptom questionnaire and had an anti-CCP test. Model development used LASSO-penalized logistic regression, performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and decision curve analysis, model over-fit was estimated using bootstrapping and cross-validation. Participants were followed-up at 12 months for RA or seronegative/undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis diagnosis.

Results

Analysis included 6879 participants; 203 (2.95%) of whom were anti-CCP positive. Eleven predictors were retained: male sex, first-degree relative with RA, ever smoked and joint pain in: back, neck, shoulders, wrists, hands/fingers, thumbs, knees, feet/toes. AUROC was 0.65 (95% CI 0.61, 0.69, optimism = 0.03). Using a 4% decision threshold, the model recommended an anti-CCP test in 1288 (18.7%) participants, 78 (6.1%) of whom were anti-CCP positive, compared with 125/5591 (2.2%) below the threshold. Net benefit was 0.0040 (0.0020 corrected). Forty-eight participants were diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis/RA within 12 months. Of those who were above the threshold and anti-CCP positive, 32.1% developed inflammatory arthritis/RA compared with 0.4% of those who were anti-CCP negative. Of those below the threshold, 0.3% were diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis/RA.

Conclusions

Targeted anti-CCP testing in primary care may aid earlier identification of people at risk of RA, prompting specialist referral to rheumatology for earlier diagnosis and initiation of disease-modifying therapy.
