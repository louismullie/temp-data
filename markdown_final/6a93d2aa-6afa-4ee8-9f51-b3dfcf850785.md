## Question

Would a liver ultrasound further support an autoimmune hepatitis diagnosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a liver ultrasound can further support the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis and how it fits into the diagnostic workup. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core diagnostic criteria for autoimmune hepatitis and whether ultrasound contributes to them. Then, I should verify what ultrasound can and cannot detect in AIH. Next, I will review guideline positions on when ultrasound is indicated in suspected AIH. After that, I should consider ultrasound's role in excluding mimics and in staging fibrosis. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and note exceptions where ultrasound meaningfully informs management even if it does not confirm AIH itself.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation. Autoimmune hepatitis is diagnosed on the basis of compatible histology, elevated aminotransferases, elevated IgG and/or characteristic autoantibodies, and exclusion of alternative etiologies; ultrasound is not part of the diagnostic criteria, and guidelines emphasize that liver biopsy is generally required to establish the diagnosis, with serology and exclusion of other causes as supportive elements [^117Jivjp] [^112CzT4R] [^113ERTR3].

> Wait, let me verify what ultrasound can actually show in AIH. Standard B-mode ultrasound primarily evaluates liver echotexture, size, vascular patency, and biliary tree caliber; it can suggest chronic liver disease or cirrhosis but cannot identify interface hepatitis, plasma cell–rich infiltrates, or other histologic hallmarks of AIH, so it cannot confirm the diagnosis or grade activity, and its main value is in excluding obstructive or focal parenchymal disease rather than characterizing AIH itself [^116a72Z7] [^116HTQQ6] [^113Cf6WK].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline positions on ultrasound in the initial workup. Multiple guidelines recommend noninvasive liver imaging early to exclude biliary obstruction and to assess for alternative diagnoses, but they do not position ultrasound as a diagnostic test for AIH; rather, it is part of the differential exclusion and baseline assessment, with definitive diagnosis resting on histology plus serology and exclusion of mimics [^116DaT4c] [^113Cf6WK] [^115C5szH].

> I need to check the role of ultrasound in fibrosis staging. Initially, I thought ultrasound elastography could reliably stage fibrosis at diagnosis, but wait, I should double-check the timing because inflammation elevates stiffness and confounds accuracy early on; AASLD advises deferring vibration-controlled transient elastography for at least 6 months after successful treatment to avoid this confounding, whereas WFUMB suggests considering elastography in treated AIH with caution and notes the lack of validated cutoffs in AIH, so early elastography can misclassify fibrosis and should be interpreted carefully [^116oMPFK] [^11586zGu] [^1136fUXQ] [^116VFaur].

> Next, I should review ultrasound's role in surveillance rather than diagnosis. In patients who have or develop cirrhosis due to AIH, guidelines recommend hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance with liver ultrasound every 6 months, with or without AFP, because cirrhosis confers increased HCC risk even though the absolute incidence in AIH is lower than in viral hepatitis; this is a management and surveillance indication and does not contribute to the initial diagnostic confirmation of AIH [^114oGMX5] [^114rerMC] [^116xy5ej] [^112GqCPC].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis where ultrasound is particularly helpful. Ultrasound is useful to exclude biliary obstruction and to screen for features suggesting cholestatic or vascular disease, which can mimic or coexist with AIH; in suspected drug-induced liver injury with autoimmune features, early imaging is recommended to exclude obstruction and alternative pathology, reinforcing ultrasound's role in the exclusionary part of the workup rather than as a positive diagnostic tool for AIH [^115C5szH] [^115X1TGp] [^114vfqwf].

> I should confirm the bottom line. No, a standard liver ultrasound does not further support the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis itself; it cannot demonstrate interface hepatitis or other histologic criteria, and it is not included in diagnostic scoring systems. Its appropriate roles are to exclude obstruction or focal disease, provide baseline liver and spleen size assessment, and, once cirrhosis is established, to enable HCC surveillance; definitive diagnosis still requires liver biopsy with compatible histology, elevated IgG and/or autoantibodies, and exclusion of alternative etiologies, with elastography reserved for later fibrosis assessment after inflammation subsides [^117Jivjp] [^112CzT4R] [^113ERTR3] [^116oMPFK] [^114oGMX5].

Ultrasound is **not diagnostic** for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and cannot confirm the diagnosis [^116a72Z7]. It is mainly used to exclude other causes of liver disease (such as biliary obstruction or mass lesions) and to assess complications like cirrhosis or portal hypertension [^115C5szH]. Ultrasound may show nonspecific findings (hepatomegaly, altered echotexture, lymphadenopathy) but these are not specific for AIH [^116a72Z7]. Definitive diagnosis relies on **serology, IgG, and liver biopsy** [^112CzT4R] [^113ERTR3]. Ultrasound is important for HCC surveillance in cirrhotic AIH patients [^114oGMX5] [^116xy5ej], but it does not support the diagnosis of AIH itself [^116a72Z7].

## Role of ultrasound in AIH diagnosis

Ultrasound is **not specific for AIH** and cannot confirm the diagnosis [^116a72Z7]. It is mainly used to exclude other liver diseases and to assess complications such as cirrhosis or portal hypertension [^116a72Z7]. Typical ultrasound findings in AIH include:

- **Hepatomegaly**: Enlarged liver size is a common but nonspecific finding in AIH [^notfound].

- **Altered echotexture**: Diffuse changes in liver echotexture may be observed, indicating chronic liver disease, but these findings are not specific to AIH [^notfound].

- **Lymphadenopathy**: Enlarged periportal lymph nodes may be seen, but this is also nonspecific [^notfound].

- **Cirrhosis and portal hypertension**: In advanced cases, ultrasound may reveal features of cirrhosis, such as nodular liver surface, splenomegaly, and signs of portal hypertension [^notfound].

These findings are **nonspecific** and can be seen in various liver diseases, including viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [^notfound]. Therefore, ultrasound alone cannot differentiate AIH from other liver conditions [^116a72Z7].

---

## Limitations of ultrasound in AIH diagnosis

Ultrasound has several limitations in the diagnosis of AIH:

- **Lack of specificity**: Ultrasound findings in AIH are nonspecific and cannot reliably distinguish AIH from other liver diseases [^116a72Z7].

- **Inability to detect inflammation**: Ultrasound cannot directly visualize or quantify hepatic inflammation, which is a hallmark of AIH [^notfound].

- **Limited sensitivity**: Ultrasound may not detect early or mild cases of AIH, particularly in the absence of significant liver damage or fibrosis [^notfound].

Given these limitations, ultrasound is **not recommended as a primary diagnostic tool** for AIH [^116HTQQ6].

---

## Diagnostic criteria for AIH

The diagnosis of AIH is based on a combination of clinical, laboratory, and histological findings, as outlined by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) [^112CzT4R] [^117Jivjp]:

- **Elevated liver enzymes**: Persistent elevation of aminotransferases (ALT, AST) is a common laboratory finding in AIH [^117Jivjp].

- **Hypergammaglobulinemia**: Elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels are characteristic of AIH [^112CzT4R].

- **Autoantibodies**: Presence of autoantibodies such as antinuclear antibody (ANA), smooth muscle antibody (SMA), and anti-liver-kidney microsomal antibody (anti-LKM1) is supportive of AIH diagnosis [^111L1MSp].

- **Liver biopsy**: Histological examination revealing interface hepatitis, lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, and absence of other identifiable causes is essential for definitive diagnosis [^113ERTR3] [^111L1MSp] [^112aw4od].

- **Exclusion of other causes**: Viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, and other autoimmune liver diseases must be excluded through appropriate serological and clinical evaluation [^117Jivjp].

Ultrasound does not feature prominently in these diagnostic criteria, further underscoring its limited role in AIH diagnosis [^116a72Z7].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements consistently emphasize the limited role of ultrasound in AIH diagnosis. The AASLD and EASL guidelines recommend ultrasound primarily for **excluding other liver diseases** (such as biliary obstruction or mass lesions) and for assessing complications like cirrhosis or portal hypertension [^116DaT4c]. They do not recommend ultrasound as a primary diagnostic tool for AIH [^113ERTR3] [^117Jivjp].

---

## Alternative imaging modalities

While ultrasound is limited in AIH diagnosis, other imaging modalities have been explored for their potential utility:

- **Transient elastography (FibroScan)**: This non-invasive technique can assess liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, which are important complications of AIH. However, its accuracy can be influenced by inflammation, and it is not specific for AIH [^11586zGu] [^116Yr2gd].

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: MRI can provide detailed information about liver structure and fibrosis but is not routinely used for AIH diagnosis due to cost, availability, and lack of specificity [^114L3GyQ].

- **Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)**: CEUS can improve the detection of liver lesions and vascular abnormalities but remains investigational in AIH diagnosis [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios where ultrasound may be useful

Although ultrasound is not diagnostic for AIH, it may be useful in specific clinical scenarios:

- **Exclusion of other liver diseases**: Ultrasound can help exclude biliary obstruction, mass lesions, or other structural abnormalities that may mimic AIH [^116DaT4c].

- **Assessment of complications**: Ultrasound is valuable in assessing complications of AIH, such as cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [^114oGMX5].

- **Monitoring disease progression**: Ultrasound can be used to monitor the progression of liver disease and detect complications in patients with established AIH [^111WocmX].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Ultrasound is **not diagnostic** for autoimmune hepatitis and cannot confirm the diagnosis [^116a72Z7]. It may show nonspecific findings such as hepatomegaly, altered echotexture, or lymphadenopathy, but these are not specific to AIH [^notfound]. Definitive diagnosis relies on serological markers, immunoglobulin levels, and liver biopsy [^112CzT4R]. Ultrasound is useful for excluding other liver diseases and assessing complications such as cirrhosis or portal hypertension, but it should not be used as a primary diagnostic tool for AIH [^116DaT4c].

Historically, liver biopsy has been used to determine the etiology of liver disease, the degree of inflammation, the stage of liver fibrosis, and the response to treatments. In the last decade, the advent of noninvasive tests has improved the diagnosis and management of autoimmune liver diseases. For example, serum markers can identify hepatic inflammation, whereas ultrasound and MRI can diagnose liver fibrosis. Physicians now have a much larger repertoire of diagnostic tests to assess the liver parenchyma compared with liver biopsy alone. In some rare cases, noninvasive tests may provide an alternative to liver biopsy. In general, however, these noninvasive tests complement liver biopsy and provide quick, accurate, and reliable adjunctive data.

### Diagnosis and management of hepatitis in patients on checkpoint blockade [^114MkkWd]. The Oncologist (2018). Low credibility.

Many human tumors are recognized by the adaptive immune system, but these spontaneous antitumor responses are typically inadequate to mediate regression. Blockade of immune regulatory "checkpoint" receptors such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 and programmed cell death 1 can unleash antitumor immunity, resulting in tumor responses that can be durable. Alongside the enormous promise of immunotherapy for cancer, the immune dysregulation of checkpoint blockade has led to a plethora of new autoimmune adverse events. Hepatic toxicity occurs in 1%-17% of patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors, with the precise incidence dependent on both the drug used and the underlying malignancy. Hepatitis is most commonly a low-grade toxicity, but grade 3 and 4 hepatotoxicity does occur. Here we will answer frequently asked questions regarding immune-related hepatitis to assist in the recognition and management of this important condition.

Key Points

Immune related hepatitis is a potentially serious complication of checkpoint blockade. The differential for elevated liver function tests in patients on checkpoint blockade is broad. Diagnostic testing such as viral serologies, liver ultrasound, cross sectional imaging, and liver biopsy may help in the diagnosis of immune related hepatitis in select patients. Patients with underlying cirrhosis are an at risk population for whom current grading criteria may underestimate the severity of liver inflammation. Severe immune related hepatitis is best managed by a multi-disciplinary team that includes a hepatologist. Most patients with immune related hepatitis respond to corticosteroids, but a substantial fraction require treatment with a secondary immunosuppressive agent.

### Autoimmune hepatitis in practice, from diagnosis to complications: what is the role of imaging? A clinicoradiological review [^116a72Z7]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic inflammatory liver disease of unknown origin that can lead to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver transplantation or death. The diagnosis is performed upon a multifactorial score. Treatment is based on the combination of immunosuppressants and aims at clinical, laboratory and histological remission, the latter being the most difficult to be achieved and proven. The absence of liver inflammation, defined by biopsy, is the main determinant in remission or therapeutic modification. Imaging exams have a limited role in this clinical management and the main findings are those related to chronic liver disease. Imaging's relevance, therefore, lies mainly in helping to exclude overlapping syndromes and in assessing complications related to cirrhosis, such as in screening for HCC. In recent years, however, the radiological literature has been witnessing increasing advances with regard to imaging biomarkers in liver disease, leading some authors to consider a future of virtual liver biopsy performed by magnetic resonance imaging. The present study aims to review the role of imaging in the management of AIH in the light of recent advances in the current literature and to provide an illustrated guide with the main findings described in the disease.

Introduction

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a challenging condition that presents in both acute and chronic forms in patients of all ages. It remains a diagnosis of exclusion since there is no disease-specific test and one third of patients present with advanced liver disease. Corticosteroids and non-selective immunosuppression are currently the mainstay of treatment. Disease relapse is common and affects up to 80% of patients after treatment withdrawal. Moreover, undesired corticosteroid-related side effects are considerable, and up to 50% of patients can develop cirrhosis despite therapeutic intervention. AIH has a female predominance, with the majority of most patients requiring life-long monitoring.

To-date, liver biopsy is considered essential for diagnosis of AIH in accordance with all clinical guidelines, and can highlight co-existence with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, viral hepatitis, and variant syndromes. It is also useful for evaluation of treatment response and to guide therapy by quantification of hepatic inflammation and staging of liver fibrosis.

Monitoring of liver inflammation in AIH relies on non-invasive assessment such as liver biochemistry (alanine transaminase (ALT) activity) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels. Liver biochemistry can be insensitive to changes in fibro-inflammation in the liver and one cannot exclude underlying residual active hepatic inflammation in the presence of 'normal LFTs' (liver function tests). Some clinical guidelines recommend repeat "on-treatment" histological assessment to confirm complete resolution of histological inflammation to aid in long-term therapeutic management considerations. This has not been universally adopted. In practice, liver biopsy is performed at diagnosis, for an unexplained and persistent flare in liver biochemistry/IgG and when considering treatment cessation or withdrawal. Liver biopsy however is invasive and not liked by patients. This paucity in follow-up histological assessment has resulted in a need for objective, quantitative, reproducible, and accurate non-invasive methods of assessing liver health in this population.

Malignancies in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) — In patients with AIH and cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develops in "1%-9%" with an "annual incidence, 1.1–1.9%", with risk quantified by a standardized incidence ratio of "23.3 (95% CI, 7.5–54.3)" and a standardized mortality ratio of "42.3 (95% CI, 20.3–77.9)". Risk factors include "cirrhosis ≥ 10 years, portal hypertension, continuous inflammation, and immunosuppressive therapy ≥ 3 years". Extrahepatic malignancies occur in "Five percent of treated patients", with "Nonmelanoma skin cancers" most common and a standardized incidence ratio of "2.7 (95% CI, 1.8–3.9)". Surveillance strategies "include hepatic ultrasonography, with or without serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, every 6 months in patients with cirrhosis", and the guidance states "Cancer surveillance should include hepatic ultrasonography, with or without serum AFP level, every 6 months in patients with cirrhosis and adherence to standard guidelines for detection of extrahepatic malignancy".

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) — asymptomatic presentation: AIH is asymptomatic in 25%-34% of patients, and asymptomatic patients infrequently achieve spontaneous laboratory improvement (12%), may have histological findings similar to those of symptomatic patients, frequently develop symptoms within 2–120 months (mean interval, 32 months; 26%-70%), and experience a 10-year survival that is less than that of treated patients with more severe disease (67% versus 98%). The absence of symptoms should not discourage treatment.

Monitoring

Patients should continue to have a consultation, with recent blood test results available (table 1); at least every 6 months and more frequently, if symptomatic or not in remission. Some consultations can be remote.

De novo cirrhosis develops despite treatment over several years in 14 (6–40)% of patients with AIH(Section J) and is independently predictive of poor outcomes. Prevention of fibrosis progression is an important aim of long-term treatment. Its assessment by repeated liver biopsy is unappealing to most patients. The best studied non-invasive modality is transient elastography. Its accuracy against liver biopsy is established in chronic viral hepatitis and MASLD. Cross-sectional studies in patients with AIHalso suggest reasonable accuracy of transient elastography in comparison with liver biopsy in patients after > 6 months' treatment. Accuracy is lower in patients starting treatment because liver inflammation artificially elevates the score. Combined liver and spleen stiffness measurement by two-dimensional shear wave elastography has also been validated against histology in AIH.

Parameters based on standard blood test results (including Fibrosis-4, AST to Platelet Ratio Index, and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease fibrosis scores) have also been developed for assessing fibrosis in viral hepatitis and MASLD. However, they appear to be of limited value in AIH.

Although non-invasive fibrosis monitoring in AIH awaits firm evidence, it is a rational strategy, especially in patients with an inadequate early treatment response or who have relapsed. Demonstration of de novo cirrhosis development would also inform monitoring for cirrhosis complications. Although 2–3 yearly transient elastography seems reasonable, the optimal interval is unknown, and practice might be limited by local resources.

Management of patients attaining complete biochemical response (CBR-6)

CBR within 6 months (CBR-6) does not indicate histological remission; this can take 2–3 years. However, as discussed in Section G, patients who achieve CBR within 6 months have lower rates of subsequent liver death/transplantation and liver adverse events respectively than patients who do not. Thus CBR-6, especially if sustained, seems an adequate early treatment outcome (at least in patients without cirrhosis), without need for routine confirmation of subsequent histological remission (Section G). Confirmation of fibrosis stability or improvement with repeated non-invasive testing, provides further evidence of a favourable response.

Second, in patients with cirrhosis at diagnosis, who are less likely to achieve CBR, and have poorer longer-term outcome (see Section I). Also, CBR might be less reliable (compared with the CBR in patients without cirrhosis) in predicting histological remission. Thus, in patients with cirrhosis, the case for confirmation of histological remission might be stronger.

Management of inadequate response

If treatment response is adequate (ie, CBR is attained), corticosteroids should be phased out gradually (see Section I). The management of patients who meet the definitions of inadequate response is summarised in table 9. There is no prescriptive evidence-based algorithm for all scenarios. Decisions might also be guided by disease activity or severity. For example, in someone not achieving CBR-6, the presence of raised serum transaminases (ie, not just serum IgG), the presence of cirrhosis at diagnosis or evidence of its development on transient elastography after 6 months (Section I) might all incline towards deciding on an earlier change in treatment.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on the management of autoimmune hepatitis [^113pxMmz]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic liver disease of unknown aetiology which may affect any patient irrespective of age, sex, and ethnicity. At baseline, the clinical spectrum of the disease varies largely from asymptomatic cases to acute liver failure with massive hepatocyte necrosis. The aim of these EASL guidelines is to provide updated guidance on the diagnosis and management of AIH both in adults and children. Updated guidance on the management of patients with variants and specific forms of AIH is also provided, as is detailed guidance on the management of AIH-associated cirrhosis, including surveillance for portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as liver transplantation in decompensated cirrhosis.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) clinical presentation and diagnostic considerations — "AIH is an immune-mediated inflammatory liver disease of uncertain cause which affects all ages, both genders, and all ethnicities". "Patients may be asymptomatic, be chronically ill, or present with acute liver failure (ALF); and the diagnosis must be considered in all patients with acute or chronic liver inflammation, including patients with graft dysfunction after LT". "AIH does not have a signature diagnostic feature, and the diagnosis requires the presence of a constellation of typical features which can vary between patients with the same disease and can occur in other liver diseases". Outcomes can include "Progression to advanced hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, death from liver failure, or LT", and therapy notes that "Treatment with immunosuppressive agents has been life-saving, but management regimens may be long-term, associated with serious side effects, and variably effective".

Section E. Differential diagnosis

AIH might mimic many liver and biliary diseases. Bile duct obstruction needs exclusion by biliary ultrasound ± MRCP. For other differential diagnoses, see table 5. Importantly, some of these can co-exist with AIH.

Table 5
Differential diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis following initial workup

Even after full viral screening (box 1) confusion might arise. Patients with confirmed chronic HBV and HCV infection might have some 'autoimmune' features (table 5). Liver biopsy usually suggests viral hepatitis (rather than AIH). However, LKM-positive AIH has been associated with HCV infection. If in doubt, options include (a) assessing response of serum transaminases to antiviral therapy and viral clearance, before deciding to start immunosuppressive treatment, and (b) treating both viral hepatitis and AIH simultaneously.

AIH and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) might also overlap in immunological and histological features (table 5). Several drugs can cause liver injury indistinguishable from AIH and recently labelled as drug-induced autoimmune-like hepatitis (DIAILH: see Section O). In a blinded study of biopsies from patients with DILI and with AIH, portal plasma cell-rich inflammation, and absence of cholestasis, were associated with AIH. Eosinophils were not diagnostically useful. The presence of advanced fibrosis might also favour AIH.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)

Usually, presentation of MASLD is more indolent, and serum transaminass are lower (uncommonly over 150 U/L) than in AIH. However, immunological features of AIH might be present (table 5). Liver biopsy helps to distinguish AIH from MASLD. Steatosis, ballooning of hepatocytes, Mallory-Denk hyaline, neutrophilic inflammation and pericentral or perisinusoidal fibrosis all suggest MASLD. In contrast, plasma cell infiltrates and interface hepatitis suggest AIH. However, some patients with MASLD and cirrhosis can develop chronic portal tract inflammation. In children, portal inflammation, periportal steatosis and fibrosis are common and usually mild and without interface activity.

Liver histopathology in AIH

The presence of hepatitis in liver tissue is a prerequisite for AIH diagnosis. Noninvasive scores, serum markers, liver stiffness measurements (LSMs) and imaging methods are not able to replace liver biopsy at diagnosis and before treatment discontinuation. Nevertheless, repeat LSMs by vibration-controlled transient elastography (FibroScan) is a reliable tool for AIH monitoring.

Liver histopathology is best evaluated before starting treatment, as inflammatory severity and fibrosis extent do not always parallel liver biochemistry. In addition, liver histopathology can provide information on AIH prognosis and management. An adequate liver biopsy sample should ideally be obtained with a 16 G or wider needle (18 G needle is also acceptable; minimum length of 1.5 cm containing at least 6–8 portal tracts).

AIH has a broad histopathology spectrum and there are no pathognomonic features (Fig. 2). Two main histological patterns of liver injury are recognized depending on the topography of the hepatitic lesions: portal-based or lobular (Fig. 2A - C). Recently, the International AIH Pathology Group (IAIHPG) developed consensus recommendations for the histological diagnosis of both acute and chronic presentations of AIH in the native liver, based on liver injury pattern (Table 4). On this basis, a diagnosis of likely, possible, or unlikely AIH can be made. Validation and generalizability studies of the IAIHPG criteria are currently ongoing, and initial results show that they can accurately identify AIH with acute onset. The scores provided by the semi-quantitative evaluation of necroinflammatory activity using the modified hepatic activity index (mHAI) are helpful during therapy and follow up.

In acute severe AIH or ALF, ANA are absent or positive with low titer in 29%-90% and SMA and anti-LKM-1 in 39%; histological assessment is a key diagnostic test, with lobular hepatitis, lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, and interface hepatitis supporting the diagnosis of acute AIH. Unenhanced computed tomography demonstrates heterogenous hypoattenuated regions within the liver in 65% of patients with acute severe AIH and may be disease-specific.

Executive summary of recommendations

Presentation and severity assessment

1. We recommend that the presence of encephalopathy in a patient with acute severe (AS) autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) should codify the disease as AIH-related acute liver failure (AIH ALF). This should trigger consideration of urgent liver transplant. Grade of evidence: moderate. Strength of recommendation: strong.

2. We recommend that acute-on-chronic liver failure should be differentiated from decompensated cirrhosis, since it identifies a subgroup of patients that might merit expedited liver transplantation. Grade of evidence: low. Strength of recommendation: strong.

Diagnostic workup

3. We recommend that patients with suspected AIH should undergo thorough non-invasive liver screening, detailed in box 1 and including (a) liver imaging to exclude biliary obstruction, (b) testing for hepatitis B and C and HIV testing (all cases) and hepatitis A, E, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (in acute and/or icteric presentations). Grade of evidence: low. Strength of recommendation: strong.

Liver tissue acquisition

The development of imaging methods in recent years has limited the need to obtain a biopsy from the liver. However, there are cases when a liver biopsy (LB) is necessary to establish the diagnosis. In particular, investigation of the etiology of a complex liver disease that cannot reasonably be determined by imaging, virological, biochemical and serological testing requires a biopsy. This usually happens in the case of autoimmune hepatitis, sclerosing cholangitis of the small bile ducts, and primary biliary cholangitis with a negative serology test. LB is also necessary in cases of overlap between 2 diseases, such as autoimmune hepatitis and drug-induced liver disease. Other cases where a biopsy is deemed necessary for diagnosis are the investigation of systemic diseases, such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis, and the investigation of single or multiple liver lesions suspected of malignancy. A LB also helps determine the severity and prognosis of some liver diseases. In chronic viral hepatitis and many other liver diseases, such as autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, assessment of the degree of activity can only be achieved with LB. In addition, LB is often recommended in liver recipients with abnormal liver function tests, as there are many possible causes of post-transplant disorders.

Long-term complications

Development of cirrhosis, with or without decompensation, portal hypertension and HCC may occur during the disease process. In terms of HCC, a recent large observational, multicentric, retrospective study, involving 1428 patients with AIH from the IAIHG, confirmed previous studies, indicating that HCC prevalence and incidence are low (1.7% and 1.44 cases/1000 patient-years, respectively) compared to other liver diseases, but with a significantly increasing incidence after cirrhosis development (cumulative HCC incidence: 2.6%, 4.6%, 5.6% and 6.6% at 5, 10, 15 and 20 years after cirrhosis). The risk for HCC development in patients with AIH-associated cirrhosis remains below the cutoff recently proposed for surveillance strategies (0.5% instead of 1.0% annually); therefore, surveillance with ultrasonography and α-fetoprotein (α-FP) determination every 6 months may not be cost-effective. In this subgroup of AIH patients, personalized surveillance strategies could be adopted, taking into consideration the presence of additional risk factors.

Statement 16

The incidence and prevalence of HCC in AIH patients are extremely low compared to other liver diseases, even in cirrhotic patients (Evidence 2, Strong statement)

Recommendation 10

A surveillance strategy for HCC detection with ultrasonography, with or without α-FP determination every 6 months, can be suggested in patients with AIH-related cirrhosis and additional independent risk factors, such as obesity, advanced age, alcohol consumption, and AIH-PSC variant at diagnosis (Evidence 2, Weak recommendation)

### Diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^111eugRz]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis is an inflammatory disease of the liver of unknown cause that may progress to liver cirrhosis and end stage liver failure if diagnosis is overlooked and treatment delayed. The clinical presentation is often that of acute hepatitis, sometimes very severe; less frequently, it can be insidious or completely asymptomatic. The disease can affect people of any age and is more common in women; its incidence and prevalence seem to be on the rise worldwide. An abnormal immune response targeting liver autoantigens and inducing persistent and self-perpetuating liver inflammation is the pathogenic mechanism of the disease. A specific set of autoantibodies, increased IgG concentrations, and histological demonstration of interface hepatitis and periportal necrosis are the diagnostic hallmarks of autoimmune hepatitis. Prompt response to treatment with corticosteroids and other immunomodulatory drugs is almost universal and supports the diagnosis. The aims of treatment are to induce and maintain long term remission of liver inflammation. Treatment can often even reverse liver fibrosis, thus preventing progression to advanced cirrhosis and its complications. Most patients need lifelong maintenance therapy, and repeated follow-up in experienced hands improves the quality of care and quality of life for affected patients.

Patients with DILI should undergo testing for hepatotropic viruses including hepatitis (A–E), particularly in those with acute hepatocellular injury. For completeness an autoantibody screen (antinuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA)), M2-anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA), liver microsomal antibody, immunoglobulins) should be undertaken. DILI assessment should also include coagulation profiles, as elevated prothrombin time ratio values may suggest impending acute liver failure (ALF) and prompt referral to a liver transplant unit should be considered.

Abdominal ultrasound should be undertaken in all patients suspected of DILI to exclude any biliary, parenchymal or vasculopathy, additional imaging is dependent on the clinical context.

Liver biopsy may be reasonable to consider in DILI, as histology may provide information pertaining to severity of liver injury and provide mechanistic insights by identifying specific patterns of injury. Liver biopsy is also warranted in those patients suspected of DILI when serology raises the possibility of autoimmune hepatitis. Liver biopsy may also be considered in patients whereby suspected DILI progresses, or fails to resolve on withdrawal of the causal agent, since histology may provide prognostic information assisting clinical decision particularly regarding immunosuppression. There are characteristic histological patterns associated with individual check-point inhibitors including presence of ring granulomas and endotheliitis which may aid decision making around immunosuppression. In select cases of DILI, human leucocyte antigen genotyping can be used, whereby genetic determination may aid diagnosis and management, particularly those with features compatible with autoimmune hepatitis.

Given the non-specific nature of traditionally employed liver enzyme measurements there is increasing interest in determining novel serum biomarkers. These markers include glutamate dehydrogenase, keratin 18, glutathione S-transferase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, bile acids, cytochrome P450 and osteopontin. These markers may help to improve the specificity of DILI diagnosis, and aid prognostication. Presently, however, none are routinely employed, but represent exciting future avenues of research.

Rechallenging patients who had initial drug-related liver injury can lead to rapid, progressive liver insult often worse than previous with fulminant hepatic failure. A positive rechallenge is defined as an ALT > 3 ULN and is the strongest proof of drug causality. Some essential, irreplaceable medications may be used to rechallenge patients including; antituberculous and chemotherapy agents, however, this should only be considered with meticulous monitoring arrangements under specialist supervision.

### Histopathologist and clinician interface in diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^111pgzg4]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of AIH is based on a combination of clinical, laboratory and histological information. It has been formalised by diagnostic scoring systems, to which liver biopsy contributes substantially. Diagnostic biopsy is thus, desirable in nearly all patients. An adequate biopsy size, provision by clinicians of adequate information to histopathologists and active discussion at regular meetings are all important for accurate histological diagnosis. Recently, the specificity of some features previously thought to suggest AIH has been questioned, and new recommendations for histological diagnosis have been proposed, although not yet validated. The histology of acutely presenting AIH and that of severe or fulminant AIH include some characteristic features. Primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease may co-exist with AIH on biopsy. Liver biopsy also enables grading of severity of inflammation and staging of fibrosis. Presence of cirrhosis is a poor prognostic marker. Repeat liver biopsy after achieving biochemical remission, although not performed routinely, enables assessment of (a) histological remission, a favourable prognostic indicator and (b) fibrosis progression. It can thus help determine further management.

Concluding remarks

AIH diagnosis is based on a combination of laboratory (increase of IgG), serological (autoantibodies), and histological findings (portal and/or lobular hepatitis with or without interface hepatitis), usually in the absence of other liver diseases. As there is no specific diagnostic marker, the disease is largely underestimated or unrecognized. The reliable detection and interpretation of autoantibodies and histological findings are the cornerstones for a prompt diagnosis. Most patients respond very efficiently to immunosuppression, with almost normal life expectancy and a quite good quality of life. However, many still experience considerable morbidity because of delayed or missed diagnosis, drug intolerance and side-effects, insufficient response, relapses or flares, and poor adherence.

The establishment of the ERN on Hepatological Diseases, consisting of major European expertise centers in the diagnosis and management of AIH, will be a decisive factor in improving the holistic management of patients. In addition, research on the etiopathogenetic mechanisms and diagnostics of AIH will improve our understanding and timely diagnosis of this potentially catastrophic liver disease. In this regard, pIgG and metabolomics, along with the need for standardization of immunoassays for autoantibody detection, have recently gained attention, as all may soon improve the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected AIH. In particular, the results from metabolomics suggest different metabolic processes in AIH compared to other liver diseases, but it is currently unknown whether certain of these metabolites could theoretically affect the immune responses and the development of AIH. Moreover, the development of noninvasive imaging testing, such as LSMs by FibroScan and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, is expected to further assist our effective follow up of patients without the need for repeated liver biopsies.

### Transient elastography in autoimmune hepatitis: timing determines the impact of inflammation and fibrosis [^116Yr2gd]. Journal of Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

There is an unmet need for the non-invasive monitoring of fibrosis progression in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic performance of transient elastography in patients with AIH and to investigate the impact of disease activity on its diagnostic accuracy.

Methods

Optimal cut-offs were defined in a prospective pilot study (n = 34) and the diagnostic performance of transient elastography validated in an independent second cohort (n = 60). To explore the impact of disease activity on liver stiffness, patients were stratified according to biochemical response and the time interval between start of immunosuppression and transient elastography.

Results

Liver stiffness strongly correlated with histological fibrosis stage (pilot study: ρ = 0.611, p < 0.001; validation cohort: ρ = 0.777, p < 0.0001). ROC curves defined an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.95 for diagnosing cirrhosis at the optimal cut-off of 16kPa. The performance of transient elastography was impaired when patients were analysed in whom transient elastography was performed within 3months from start of treatment. In this setting, liver stiffness correlated with histological grading (ρ = 0.558, p = 0.001), but not with staging. In contrast, using the cut-off of 16kPa, the accuracy for diagnosing cirrhosis was excellent in patients treated for 6months or longer (area under the receiver operating curve 1.0).

Conclusions

Liver inflammation has a major impact on liver stiffness in the first months of AIH treatment. However, transient elastography has an excellent diagnostic accuracy for separating severe from non-severe fibrosis after 6months of immunosuppressive treatment.

Lay Summary

Transient elastography is a special ultrasound scan, which assesses liver stiffness as a surrogate marker for liver fibrosis/scarring. Transient elastography has been shown to be a reliable non-invasive method to assess liver fibrosis in various chronic liver diseases, it takes less than 5min and has a high patient acceptance. The current study validated for the first time this technique in a large cohort of patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and demonstrates that it is a reliable tool to detect liver fibrosis in treated AIH. For the monitoring of potential disease progression under treatment, the validation of liver stiffness as non-invasive marker of liver fibrosis will greatly improve patient care in autoimmune hepatitis.

Complications

As in other chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis and its consequences, including portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), may occur. Therefore, surveillance with ultrasonography every 6 months seems rational in patients with cirrhosis. HCC, however, is developed at significantly lower rates in AIH-associated cirrhosis compared with other causes (Table 1).

Patients with AIH-related cirrhosis should undergo ultrasonography every 6 months for early HCC detection, as in cirrhosis of other etiologies (II-2)

AIH variants

Some patients present, either concurrently or consecutively, with features of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), while some PBC or PSC patients may also show AIH characteristics (Table 4). However, the previous term " overlap " used for years for these entities strongly suggests the simultaneous presence of two distinct diseases, which of course is not the case for many of these patients. Therefore, the term "variant" has recently been proposed by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), thought to be more precise for these conditions.

Worldwide accepted criteria defining these conditions are lacking and hence their diagnosis is usually difficult. Regarding the AIH-PBC variant, its prevalence is about 10% in adults with PBC or AIH. The "Paris criteria" are even nowadays the most often used in everyday clinical practice (Table 4). Unlike several uncertainties around this issue, the recent EASL guidelines on PBC diagnosis and management recommend that liver histology is mandatory in evaluating patients with this variant of AIH. In particular, liver biopsy seems crucial because of potential therapeutic implications in the PBC cases who do not respond to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), having also disproportionate elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or IgG.

### Autoimmune liver disease: evaluating overlapping and cross-over presentations-a case-based discussion [^1115XaJP]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The three classic autoimmune liver diseases are recognised based on identifying varying clinical, laboratory, histological and radiological features that collectively classify patients. In the absence of defined aetiological factors, it is recognised that disease spectrum is broad, and, in this context, it is not infrequent for disease boundaries to be blurred, leading to overlapping features that may be present at the time of diagnosis or may appear later in the course of disease. Given the absence of accepted diagnostic criteria for overlap/cross-over syndromes, alongside weak data for intervention, it is recommended that a multidisciplinary, patient-specific approach be used to establish individual treatment pathways.

Abstract

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic inflammatory liver disease which, if untreated, often leads to cirrhosis, liver failure and death. The last British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guideline for the management of AIH was published in 2011. Since then, our understanding of AIH has advanced in many areas. This update to the previous guideline was commissioned by the BSG and developed by a multidisciplinary group. The aim of this guideline is to review and summarise the current evidence, in order to inform and guide diagnosis and management of patients with AIH and its variant syndromes. The main focus is on AIH in adults, but the guidelines should also be relevant to older children and adolescents.

### Clinical narrative: autoimmune hepatitis [^112aw4od]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an inflammatory liver disease that is characterized by circulating autoantibodies, hypergammaglobulinemia, and a lymphoplasmocytic infiltration with interface hepatitis on liver biopsy. Treatment with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents is effective and early diagnosis can result in near-normal life expectancy. Untreated patients, however, can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. The clinical presentation is heterogeneous and may pose diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas. This case-based review will address the diagnosis and management of this disease, in addition to difficult but commonly encountered clinical scenarios.

Ethnicity in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) — Across ethnic groups, clinical phenotype, treatment response, and outcomes can differ; African American patients have more advanced hepatic fibrosis at presentation than white American patients and are younger with higher disease severity, as they "commonly have cirrhosis (57%-85% versus 38%)", have "higher frequencies of liver failure (38% versus 9%)", "require LT more commonly (52% versus 23%)", and have "greater mortality (24% versus 6%)". Asian Americans with AIH have "a higher mortality (29%) than Hispanic Americans (5%) and white Americans (8%)", and hospitalizations have been "more frequent for African Americans and Hispanics than for whites". In Europe, black patients with AIH show "younger age at presentation, increased risk of LT, and greater risk of liver-related death", while having "similar responses to standard therapy" and a "higher frequency of systemic lupus erythematosus".

- **Pathophysiology**: The cause of AIH is primarily unknown, but there is a complex interplay of genetic (HLA haplotype) and environmental factors.
- **Disease course**: The immunological reaction against autologous liver antigens in genetically predisposed individuals results in AIH, which may an asymptomatic, acute, or acute severe (fulminant) presentation. Disease progression may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, cirrhosis, and a need for the liver transplantation.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: All-cause mortality/liver transplant rates for AIH over a period of 10 years is 13%.

### Autoimmune hepatitis [^117TeezR]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis was one of the first liver diseases for which an effective treatment was developed and the benefit proven by randomized controlled trials. Nonetheless, both the diagnosis and the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis remain full of challenges. The clinical spectrum is very wide, ranging from subclinical non-progressive disease to fulminant hepatic failure. Diagnostic criteria based on elevation of IgG, demonstration of characteristic autoantibodies, and histological features of hepatitis in the absence of viral disease are very helpful. However, in some patients, diagnosis remains a clinical challenge. Adequately dosed steroids are the mainstay of remission induction treatment, while remission maintenance is best achieved by azathioprine. Therapeutic alternatives are required in a small group of patients responding insufficiently to these drugs or intolerant to their side effects.

INTRODUCTION

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a rare disease of unclear etiology thought to be due to a lack of self‐tolerance ultimately leading to liver injury and, in some cases, cirrhosis or acute liver failure. The diagnosis requires exclusion of other etiologies and is multilayered, consisting of specific histological abnormalities with elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)), immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, and one or more associated autoantibodies including antinuclear antibody (ANA), smooth muscle antibodies (SMA), and rarely antibodies to liver kidney microsome type 1 (anti‐LKM1) and soluble liver antigen (SLA). First‐line treatment of AIH consists of corticosteroids with azathioprine, to which a majority of patients respond by achieving remission. Unfortunately, immunosuppressive therapy (IST) has wide‐ranging side effects and is associated with long‐term morbidities (infection, malignancy) that reduce patient quality of life and outcomes. Because of this, the recent American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) practice guidelines recommend considering IST withdrawal in patients who have liver enzymes and IgG levels within normal limits for at least 2 years. This guideline is made with known hesitancy though, as relapse during or after IST withdrawal is common in AIH (> 80% in some studies) and thus withdrawal needs to be conducted in a stepwise fashion with close monitoring. Histologically active AIH on liver biopsy, despite normal serum transaminases, predicts relapse following attempted drug withdrawal. Although liver biopsies are specific for active disease on initial presentation, they have risks and are impractical to perform serially, particularly for IST optimization decisions (augmentation, reduction, withdrawal).

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) practice guidance — purpose and scope states that the objectives are to provide guidance in the diagnosis and management of AIH based on current evidence and expert opinion and to present guidelines to clinically relevant questions based on systematic reviews. Guideline recommendations were based on evidence derived from systematic reviews and supported, if appropriate, by meta-analyses conducted independently by the Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center, with findings analyzed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts who rated the quality of evidence and determined the strength of each recommendation. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to categorize each recommendation as strong or conditional. The recommendations address glucocorticoid and azathioprine therapy as first-line management, second-line medications after failure of first-line therapy, and maintenance management after liver transplantation, and the scope includes adults and children.

Differential diagnosis and diagnostic scores

The differential diagnosis includes almost all causes of acute and chronic liver diseases as well as celiac disease (Table 2). In 1999, the IAIHG published a score for AIH diagnosis (Table 5). However, it proved quite complex for everyday use, while it was rather unable to safely distinguish AIH from cholestatic syndromes or AIH variants. In 2008, the IAIHG proposed a simplified score for daily routine clinical practice, which is user-friendly, as it is based on autoantibody detection, IgG, liver histology, and seronegativity for viral hepatitis markers (Table 6). This newer score seems to bear lower sensitivity (95% vs. 100%) but higher specificity and accuracy compared with the original revised score. In general, however, physicians should keep in mind that any score should be used only as an aid to AIH diagnosis. This is true, for example, in acute or fulminant AIH cases, AIH variants, children with AIH and DILI cases resembling AIH, as diagnosis by using the abovementioned diagnostic scores may be missed in such cases. In particular, because of poor validation of the scores in the pediatric population, different scores have been suggested for child patients.

AASLD imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment guideline — scope and methodology state that chronic liver disease (CLD) is associated with approximately two million annual deaths worldwide and is an enormous health burden, and emphasize that early identification of patients with any fibrosis and, in particular, moderate-to-advanced fibrosis is essential. The guideline explains that multiple noninvasive modalities termed "Noninvasive Liver Disease Assessment(s)" (NILDA) have been developed to determine the presence and severity of liver fibrosis (F) and steatosis (S), and that the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases commissioned a multidisciplinary group to develop guidelines and a systematic review addressing imaging-based NILDA to answer patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions for the most common CLD etiologies. The guidelines are intended primarily for adult and pediatric healthcare providers who see patients with CLD, with an algorithm summarized at the end of the document; blood-based NILDA, NILDA for the detection of portal hypertension (PHTN), and NILDA for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) are discussed elsewhere. The methodology notes that the AASLD guideline group consisted of experts in adult and pediatric hepatology, pathology, and radiology, including methodology experts, and that two complementary approaches were taken to answer the PICO questions.

### Evaluation of the effectiveness of chatGPT in supporting the management of autoimmune hepatitis Effectiveness of chatGPT in autoimmune hepatitis [^114dwsNh]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

It is believed that healthcare professionals will benefit from AI applications as well as patients in the future. It is particularly suggested that AI will play a significant role in the decision-making processes of doctors regarding the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Nevertheless, there remains ongoing debate regarding AI's ability to accurately interpret patient data and keep up with current developments. In a study assessing these scenarios, the accuracy of diagnoses in hypothetical patient cases directed to ChatGPT was found to be 33,3%.

As in many other disciplines, the number of AI-supported solutions in hepatology has increased in recent years. A recent review reported successful applications of AI in liver diseases, including imaging, histology, interpretation of non-invasive tests, and outcome prediction. Another study highlighted its valuable role in evaluating the epidemiology of liver diseases and in guiding treatment approaches. However, there is limited evidence on the performance of AI tools in patient education and in facilitating physicians' access to key guideline-based information on liver diseases.

So this study aims to contribute to the existing literature on the applicability of ChatGPT in hepatology. Specifically, it will explore the AI's ability to provide comprehensive information on AIH, its potential role in supporting the diagnostic and therapeutic processes for the disease.

Differential diagnosis and diagnostic scores

5. We recommend that, following exclusion of viral hepatitis and biliary obstruction, other conditions requiring consideration in patients with suspected AIH should include:

(a) For acute presentations: drug-induced liver injury, Wilson's disease, congestion, ischaemic liver injury and bile duct stones ± acute cholangitis.

(b For indolent presentations: metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and congestion. Some of these conditions might co-exist with AIH. Grade of evidence:low. Strength of recommendation: strong.

6. We recommend that, if the diagnosis is in doubt, diagnostic scores be used. The simplified 2008 scoring criteria have high specificity, but lower sensitivity than the 1999 criteria, which can be used if the simplified criteria are not met. Consider seeking advice from an expert clinician. Grade of evidence: low. Strength of recommendation: weak.

7. We recommend that (since there is no single pathognomonic histological feature of AIH) specialist histopathological evaluation is necessary in conjunction with clinical presentation, biochemistry, immunology, viral serology and imaging. Grade of evidence: low. Strength of recommendation: strong.

Initial treatment

8. We recommend immunosuppressive treatment (IST) in most patients with AIH, regardless of symptoms. Grade of evidence: high. Strength of recommendation: strong.

9. We recommend that in patients with mild AIH (all of: serum lanine aminotransferase (ALT) < 50 U/L, Ishak necro inflammatory score < 6 and fibrosis stage < 2), the decision to offer treatment should be based on balance of benefits and risks. Grade of evidence: low. Strength of recommendation: strong.

10. **We recommend that patients starting treatment for AIH should**:

(a) Ensure immunisation is up-to-date against: COVID-19, pneumococcus, influenza, shingles, hepatitis A, hepatitis B (if HBV markers absent) and (if under 25, or if gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men (GBMSM) and under 45) human papillomavirus.

American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 2019 autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) guidance — what's new since 2010 — states that histological features of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are present in 17%-30% of adult patients with AIH, and concurrent NAFLD may influence response to therapy; diagnostic scoring systems should be used only to support clinical judgment in challenging cases of AIH and to define AIH cohorts for clinical studies; immune checkpoint inhibitors have been associated with immune-mediated liver injury and are frequently steroid-responsive, but the liver injury lacks autoantibodies and typical histological features of AIH; elastography may be used to assess the stages of hepatic fibrosis noninvasively; testing for thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity prior to azathioprine (AZA) treatment is encouraged in all patients; budesonide and AZA or predniso(lo)ne and AZA are recommended as first-line AIH treatments in children and adults who do not have cirrhosis, acute severe hepatitis, or acute liver failure (ALF); AZA can be continued throughout pregnancy, whereas the use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is contraindicated in pregnancy; liver tissue examination prior to drug withdrawal in individuals with ≥ 2 years of biochemical remission is preferred but not mandatory and rarely required in children; MMF or tacrolimus (TAC) can be used as second-line treatment in children and adults with AIH who have failed to respond to first-line therapy; patients with acute severe AIH should receive predniso(lo)ne followed by liver transplantation (LT) if no improvement within 2 weeks, whereas patients with AIH and ALF should be evaluated directly for LT; glucocorticoids can be discontinued after LT and patients monitored for recurrence of AIH.

Imaging, phenotype signatures, and causality tools in suspected DILI: All patients with suspected DILI should undergo some type of liver imaging, typically starting with an abdominal ultrasound to assess for presence of cirrhosis, biliary obstruction, or other focal liver changes, and additional imaging such as CT or MR cholangiography may be used to assess for vascular abnormalities or pancreatobiliary disease. Certain drugs have been associated with specific clinical and histologic phenotypes, also called "signatures", such as autoimmune-like hepatitis, granulomatous hepatitis, vanishing bile duct syndrome (VBDS), or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). Finally, improvement of liver injury after drug discontinuation (dechallenge) is important in DILI diagnosis; resolution of injury after discontinuation helps confirm the causal relationship to the drug, and comparison with reported cases in public databases such as LiverTox is equally important; the LiverTox website provides a brief synopsis of idiosyncratic DILI due to more than 1000 prescription drugs and 60 HDS and provides a likelihood scale.

Implications of histology for management and prognosis

The severity (grade) of inflammatory activity and the fibrosis extent (stage) should both be assessed as they are relevant to prognosis. Ishak's modified histological activity index for grading AIH(although not validated for acute hepatitis), has advantages over other systems (Batts and Ludwig, Scheuer, METAVIR), as it provides unique granular information on grading lobular activity, particularly the degree of confluent necrosis. Also, it was used in the recent consensus recommendations for histological diagnosis of AIH, although including only three grading categories from Ishak's score: interface, lobular and confluent (but not intraportal) necro-inflammatory activity. This needs consideration if the diagnostic consensus criteria are adapted to evaluate histological remission (with remission defined as a necro-inflammatory score of < 4).

The presence of bridging or multilobular necrosis underlines the need for treatment of AIH, and severe necrosis is a prognostic marker in AS-AIH. In contrast, mild or minimal inflammation might influence a decision to defer initiation of treatment (Section F). A definition of mild histology (Ishak's interface activity ≤ 1, absence of confluent necrosis and four or less lobular necro-inflammatory foci/10X) has been proposed.

AIH might be silent for years and then present as advanced liver disease. Assessment of fibrosis is challenging, and requires special stains for collagen (see table 2), to help to differentiate post-necrotic parenchymal collapse from established fibrosis.

See Section G for the role of follow-up biopsy to confirm histological remission, and Section N for histology of overlap syndromes.

Section D recommendations

We recommend that patients with suspected AIH should undergo thorough non-invasive liver screening, including (a) liver imaging to exclude biliary obstruction, (b) testing for hepatitis B and C and HIV testing (all cases) and hepatitis A, E, CMV and EBV (in acute and/or icteric presentations). Grade of evidence: low. Strength of recommendation: strong.
We recommend that liver biopsy, a major part of the diagnostic workup, should be performed routinely, ideally before starting immunosuppression, unless the risks of biopsy clearly outweigh the benefits of diagnostic certainty. Grade of evidence: low. Strength of recommendation: strong.

### Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging to aid clinical decision making in autoimmune hepatitis [^112UxnSw]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Serum-based biomarker panels, such as FibroTest®, serum AST/platelet ratio index (APRI), Fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4)and the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) testhave been used anecdotally in patients with AIH; their use requires further validation. Non-invasive imaging techniques, including vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE; Fibroscan®, Echosens, France), magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) are confounded by hepatic inflammation.VCTE has a high coefficient of variation although is often used after 6-months of treatment to monitor disease response and progression of fibrosis.

Multiparametric magnetic resonance (mpMR) techniques have been able to impact clinical practice in medical fields such as oncology (prostate and breast cancer) and cardiology, due to the generation of quantitative biomarkers.mpMR has also demonstrated its utility in clinical pathways for the assessment of liver disease. Iron corrected T1 (cT1) from Liver MultiScan (Perspectum, Oxford) is an objective mpMR measurement of fibro-inflammation with low inter-observer variability and high repeatability over time, as well as a very low coefficient of variation in monitoring liver disease at multiple timepoints.cT1 correlates with histology, and has been shown to detect early responses to treatment in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. More recently, cT1 has also shown utility in monitoring disease regression and has correlated with histological fibrosis and inflammation in AIH patients in biochemical remission. Importantly, cT1 outperformed other surrogate markers (VCTE-liver stiffness and elevated liver enzymes) to predict future disease flare in AIH patients, with a cT1 ≥ 800 ms associated with a ≥ 20% chance of experiencing a future disease flare, rising to ≥ 75% chance with a cT1 ≥ 1000 ms.

The aim of this study was to understand the impact of cT1 on a physician's intended management plan for patients with AIH. Our objective was to investigate the effect of mpMR results on a physician's decision making and subsequent intended patient management plans for patient with suspected or confirmed AIH compared with usual standard of care.

### British society of gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines for management of autoimmune hepatitis [^113rq8bZ]. Gut (2011). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic inflammatory liver disease which, if untreated, often leads to cirrhosis, liver failure and death. Major advances were made in its management based on controlled trials performed in England and the United States in the 1970s and 1980s. Unfortunately, in recent decades there has been a dearth of controlled clinical trials and, thus, many questions regarding the optimal management of this disease remain unanswered. Many promising newer immunosuppressive therapies await formal comparison with standard therapies and also many important details in relation to the application of standard therapies remain unclear. These guidelines describe the optimal management strategies in adults based on available published evidence, including the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of AIH published in 2002 and recently updated.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113JkQRa]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

When should liver blood tests be checked?

There are a range of settings where requesting liver blood tests should be considered to determine the presence, or severity, of liver disease:

Non-specific symptoms

Liver disease tends to develop silently with no signs or symptoms, and there is evidence that the majority of people with late-stage liver disease are undiagnosed. However, inflammatory liver diseases including autoimmune liver disease and viral hepatitis can be associated with symptoms. For example, 75% of patients with AIH have one or more non-specific symptoms, such as fatigue, nausea or anorexia. These diseases can be effectively treated, and are often diagnosed late, so the presence of these non-specific symptoms would be an indication to check routine liver blood tests, accepting that there are many other causes for these symptoms.

Evidence of chronic liver disease

Patients with symptoms or signs of cirrhosis, portal hypertension or liver failure, including ascites, peripheral oedema, spider naevi and hepatosplenomegaly, need liver blood tests to monitor their function. In that regard the inclusion of INR is important to fully define their synthetic function.

Conditions which are associated with a high risk of developing liver disease

Autoimmune liver disease is more common in patients with pre-existing autoimmune diseases, and liver blood tests may be appropriate if clinical symptoms change to suggest development of liver disease — for example, pruritus in primary biliary cholangitis. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) have a particular notable risk of developing the autoimmune cholestatic liver disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis; disease prevalence is estimated at just under 10%. Primary sclerosing cholangitis-inflammatory bowel disease is associated with increased complications relating to liver disease, as well as increased colorectal cancer risk. Periodic monitoring of liver blood tests is therefore common practice, with a low clinical threshold for investigation of cholestatic liver blood tests by MRI. In the absence of currently approved medical therapy ongoing efforts clinically focus on early recognition of disease with subsequent risk stratification, in order to facilitate timely consideration of trial-based intervention.

### Early detection and staging of chronic liver diseases with a protein MRI contrast agent [^1173vL1J]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic liver disease (ALD) are common causes of chronic liver disease (CLD), cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide –. CLD originates from a variety of causes such as viral hepatitis, metabolic dysfunction, as well as alcohol abuse and autoimmune disease, and almost all chronic liver injuries cause liver fibrosis. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatic fibrosis can develop in patients with any type of CLD, including alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis C, hepatitis B, NAFLD and autoimmune hepatitis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) previously reported that 19,388 people died in the US from alcohol related liver diseases in 2014. Moreover, from 2000 to 2015, death rates for chronic liver disease and cirrhosis in the United States increased 31% among persons aged 45–64 years. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease including NASH, is the primary cause of CLD in the United States, afflicting an estimated 80–100 million Americans (30–40% of the population). NAFLD and ALD can further progress to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. It has been projected that NASH occurs in 20% of patients with NAFLD (3–12% of the US population), and 30–40% of them with NASH will develop fibrosis.

Biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis and staging of CLD as it relies on stage-dependent characteristic patterns of collagen expression. However, it has many limitations such as sampling errors, and high interobserver variability with 33–50% error rates even for diagnosis of advanced stages of liver fibrosis such as cirrhosis likely due to heterogeneity. Earlier studies have reported that imaging modalities can detect morphological characteristics of liver cirrhosis such as surface nodularity; however, in some cases, the cirrhotic liver can appear completely normal, and biopsy is required for confirmation of the diagnosis.

Tremendous effort has been devoted to the development of noninvasive imaging techniques associated with fibrosis and NASH, such as ultrasound; MR apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC); magnetic resonance elastography (MRE); T1, T2, relaxation in the rotating frame (T 1ƿ); magnetization transfer; and proton density fat fraction. However, these techniques cannot provide accurate detection of early stage liver fibrosis and NASH.

### Diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis in adults and children: 2019 practice guidance and guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113YDrvd]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) — diagnostic requisites and subtypes — is based on histology, laboratories, and autoantibodies: the diagnosis is based on histological abnormalities (interface hepatitis), characteristic clinical and laboratory findings (elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT] levels and increased serum IgG concentration), and the presence of one or more characteristic autoantibodies. AIH lacks a signature diagnostic marker, and the diagnosis requires characteristic features and the exclusion of other diseases that may resemble it. There are two types of AIH based on autoantibodies: type 1 characterized by antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and/or smooth muscle antibodies (SMA)/anti-actin antibodies, and type 2 characterized by antibodies to liver kidney microsome type 1 (anti-LKM1), usually in the absence of ANA and SMA. In addition, up to 20% of AIH cases are negative for ANA, SMA, and LKM1 autoantibodies despite other characteristic features (seronegative AIH); if seronegative AIH is suspected, other autoantibodies may be sought. Classification of AIH into types assists in management and aids in predicting outcomes in children, but it may be less informative in adults.
