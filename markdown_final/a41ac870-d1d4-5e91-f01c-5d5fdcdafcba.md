## Question

Can morphine tablet and dilaudid be taken at the same time

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether morphine tablets and Dilaudid (hydromorphone) can be taken at the same time. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and whether these are overlapping mu-opioid agonists. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about combining opioids and the risk of additive effects. Next, I will check authoritative drug–drug interaction sources. After that, I need to consider equianalgesic potency and the danger of stacking doses. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-focused recommendation and outline exceptions and monitoring if, despite risks, combination therapy is deemed necessary by a clinician.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology. Morphine and hydromorphone are both mu-opioid receptor agonists with overlapping mechanisms, so concurrent use produces additive opioid effects rather than synergistic benefit, which increases the risk of respiratory depression, sedation, and other adverse effects without improving analgesic quality [^c5fb7c89] [^55a75205].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory guidance. The FDA labeling for hydromorphone repeatedly emphasizes using the lowest effective dose, avoiding unnecessary opioid combinations, and warns that respiratory depression can occur at any time, especially during initiation and dose increases; it also advises conservative conversion and close monitoring when switching opioids due to incomplete cross-tolerance, underscoring the hazard of layering two full agonists [^6b70edaf] [^242cd4eb] [^d745b8ec].

> I should confirm the interaction risk explicitly. DrugBank notes that combining morphine with hydromorphone increases the risk or severity of adverse effects, which aligns with the mechanistic expectation of additive CNS and respiratory depression; this supports avoiding routine coadministration unless there is a compelling, clinician-supervised rationale [^55a75205].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about potency. I initially thought hydromorphone was roughly 5 times more potent than morphine orally, but I need to check the equianalgesic data carefully. Some sources cite a 5:1 oral ratio, yet others show variability across routes and studies, with IV hydromorphone about 7–8 times more potent than IV morphine and oral ratios ranging from 5:1 to 7.5:1 depending on the dataset; this variability makes dose stacking especially dangerous because apparent "small" hydromorphone doses can translate to large morphine equivalents [^63d766a2] [^6a97fca9] [^5093258a].

> I will now examine the clinical scenarios where combination might be considered. In opioid-tolerant patients with poorly controlled pain, clinicians sometimes employ a basal long-acting opioid with a different short-acting opioid for breakthrough pain, but this requires expert conversion, reduction of total opioid load to account for incomplete cross-tolerance, and vigilant monitoring for sedation and respiratory depression; even then, using the same opioid class (e.g., morphine plus hydromorphone) is less favored than using a single agent or rotating rather than layering [^242cd4eb] [^97f1f78d] [^f5b69054].

> Let me think about practical safety steps if, despite risks, a clinician elects combination therapy. I should confirm that total daily morphine milligram equivalents are calculated and reduced by about 30–50% when adding the second opioid, that naloxone is prescribed or available, and that patients and caregivers are counseled on respiratory warning signs; this mirrors best-practice guidance for opioid rotation and high-dose regimens, and it is especially critical in older adults or those with comorbidities [^242cd4eb] [^97f1f78d] [^af48c402].

> But wait, what if the patient is opioid-naïve or on modest doses? In that case, I should double-check that combining two full mu-agonists is contraindicated for routine care because the risk of overdose outweighs any theoretical benefit; guidelines emphasize reserving opioids for severe pain unresponsive to alternatives and avoiding poly-opioid regimens when possible, reinforcing that morphine and hydromorphone should not be taken together without a specialist-directed plan [^c128eca8] [^af48c402].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is clear: morphine tablets and Dilaudid (hydromorphone) should not be taken at the same time outside of a carefully supervised, exceptional circumstance, given their additive respiratory and CNS depressant effects, documented interaction risk, and the danger of miscalculated equianalgesic stacking; if combination is contemplated, it requires expert opioid rotation principles, dose reduction, and close monitoring, with naloxone available and patient education in place [^55a75205] [^242cd4eb] [^97f1f78d].

---

It is **not recommended** to take morphine tablets and Dilaudid (hydromorphone) together because both are potent opioids with additive effects that markedly increase the risk of **respiratory depression, sedation, and overdose** [^55a75205]. If combination therapy is considered, it should only be under strict medical supervision with careful dose adjustment and close monitoring for adverse effects [^6b70edaf]. Avoid concurrent use unless specifically prescribed and monitored by a clinician.

---

## Pharmacological similarities and differences

Morphine and hydromorphone are both **mu-opioid receptor agonists** [^c5fb7c89] that provide analgesia by activating opioid receptors in the central nervous system. Hydromorphone is approximately five times more potent than morphine, meaning smaller doses are needed to achieve similar analgesic effects [^63d766a2] [^5093258a]. Both drugs undergo hepatic metabolism and renal excretion, and both have similar side-effect profiles, including respiratory depression, sedation, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and pruritus [^ff3d29ac].

---

## Risks of concurrent use

Taking morphine and hydromorphone together **significantly increases the risk of adverse effects** because of their additive pharmacological effects:

- **Respiratory depression**: Both drugs can cause dose-dependent respiratory depression, and concurrent use increases the risk of life-threatening hypoventilation or apnea [^6274db0a].

- **Sedation and cognitive impairment**: Additive CNS depression can cause profound sedation, confusion, and impaired motor coordination, increasing the risk of accidents and falls [^5039a79f].

- **Overdose risk**: Combined use increases the risk of opioid overdose, which can be fatal without prompt medical intervention [^c4debc99].

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Concurrent use can exacerbate constipation, nausea, and vomiting, leading to significant discomfort and complications [^ff3d29ac].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines consistently advise against routine concurrent use of multiple opioids. Opioid therapy should be individualized, with the **lowest effective dose** used for the shortest duration possible [^6b70edaf]. If combination therapy is considered, it should only be under strict medical supervision with careful monitoring for adverse effects, including respiratory depression, sedation, and signs of overdose [^d745b8ec].

---

## Situations where combination therapy might be considered

In rare cases, combination therapy may be considered for patients with complex pain syndromes who have developed tolerance to a single opioid and require rotation or adjunctive therapy. Even then, **specialist oversight is essential**, with careful dose adjustment, close monitoring, and provision of naloxone for emergency reversal of opioid overdose [^af48c402].

---

## Alternative pain management strategies

Given the significant risks associated with concurrent opioid use, **alternative pain management strategies** should be considered:

- **Non-opioid analgesics**: Acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and adjuvant medications (e.g. gabapentin, pregabalin) can provide effective pain relief with fewer risks.

- **Multimodal analgesia**: Combining different classes of analgesics and non-pharmacological interventions (e.g. physical therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy) can improve pain control while minimizing opioid-related risks.

- **Opioid rotation**: If tolerance develops, switching to a different opioid with a different pharmacological profile may restore analgesic efficacy without increasing the risk of adverse effects.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, **concurrent use of morphine tablets and Dilaudid is not recommended** due to the significant risk of additive adverse effects, including respiratory depression, sedation, and overdose. If combination therapy is considered, it should only be under strict medical supervision with careful monitoring. Patients should always consult their healthcare provider before making any changes to their medication regimen.

2.2 Initial Dosage

Use of DILAUDID INJECTION as the First Opioid Analgesic:

Subcutaneous or Intramuscular Administration:

The usual starting dose is 1 mg to 2 mg every 2 to 3 hours as necessary for pain, and the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Depending on the clinical situation, the initial starting dose may be lowered in patients who are opioid naïve. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient’s response to their initial dose of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection.

Intravenous Administration:

The initial starting dose is 0.2 mg to 1 mg every 2 to 3 hours. Intravenous administration should be given slowly, over at least 2 to 3 minutes, depending on the dose. The initial dose should be reduced in the elderly or debilitated and may be lowered to 0.2 mg.

Conversion From Other Opioids to DILAUDID INJECTION:

There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of DILAUDID INJECTION. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour DILAUDID INJECTION dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour DILAUDID INJECTION dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose.

If the decision is made to convert to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection from another opioid analgesic using publicly available data, convert the current total daily amount(s) of opioid(s) received to an equivalent total daily dose of DILAUDID INJECTION and reduce by one-half due to the possibility of incomplete cross tolerance. Divide the new total amount by the number of doses permitted based on dosing interval (e.g., 8 doses for every- three-hour dosing). Titrate the dose according to the patient's response.

2.3 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Start patients with hepatic impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual DILAUDID INJECTION starting dose depending on the extent of impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment

Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual DILAUDID INJECTION starting dose depending on the degree of impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.5 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy

Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient’s response to their initial dose of DILAUDID INJECTION. Individually titrate DILAUDID INJECTION to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving DILAUDID INJECTION to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.12)] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration.

If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the DILAUDID INJECTION dosage. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after a dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5)] . Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.

2.6 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of DILAUDID INJECTION

When a patient who has been taking DILAUDID INJECTION regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with DILAUDID INJECTION, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not abruptly discontinue DILAUDID INJECTION in a physically-dependent patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

9.1 Controlled Substance

DILAUDID INJECTION contains hydromorphone, which is a Schedule II controlled substance.

9.2 Abuse

DILAUDID INJECTION contains hydromorphone, a substance with high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed.

Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects.

Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence.

Misuse and abuse of DILAUDID INJECTION increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of DILAUDID INJECTION with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of DILAUDID INJECTION slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone are affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in Cmaxand AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Renal Impairment

The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone are affected by renal impairment. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

DILAUDID INJECTION is an opioid agonist indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternate treatments are inadequate. (1)

Limitations of Use: (1)

Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration, reserve Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products):

Have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated
Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia

DILAUDID INJECTION should not be used for an extended period of time unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate.

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

DILAUDID INJECTION should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.
Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)] . Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of DILAUDID INJECTION for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.
Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.
There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient’s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .
Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with DILAUDID INJECTION. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5)] .
Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. A slight yellowish discoloration may develop in DILAUDID INJECTION. No loss of potency has been demonstrated. DILAUDID INJECTION is physically compatible and chemically stable for at least 24 hours at 25°C, protected from light in most common large-volume parenteral solutions.
Discard any unused portion in an appropriate manner.

### Safety and efficacy of hydromorphone as an analgesic alternative to morphine in acute pain: a randomized clinical trial [^0e7e1d30]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We compare a standard weight-based dose of intravenous hydromorphone (Dilaudid) to a standard weight-based dose of intravenous morphine in adults presenting to the ED with acute severe pain.

Methods

This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, clinical trial conducted in an academic medical center. Of the 198 adult patients presenting to the ED with acute severe pain who were randomized to receive either intravenous hydromorphone at 0.015 mg/kg or intravenous morphine at 0.1 mg/kg, 191 patients had sufficient data for analysis. The main outcome measure was the difference between the 2 groups in pain reduction at 30 minutes as measured on a validated numeric rating scale. Adverse effects, pain reduction at 5 minutes and 2 hours postbaseline, and additional analgesics and antiemetics were tracked as secondary outcome measures.

Results

The mean change of pain from baseline to 30 minutes postbaseline in patients allocated to intravenous hydromorphone was -5.5 numeric rating scale units versus -4.1 in patients allocated to intravenous morphine (difference -1.3; 95% confidence interval -2.2 to -0.5). Adverse effects were similar in both groups, with the exception of pruritus, which did not occur in patients receiving hydromorphone (0% versus 6% [difference -6%; 95% confidence interval -11% to -1%]). No patient required naloxone.

Conclusion

For the treatment of acute, severe pain in the emergency department, intravenous hydromorphone at 0.015 mg/kg represents a feasible alternative to intravenous morphine at 0.1 mg/kg.

5.8 Severe Hypotension

DILAUDID INJECTION may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of DILAUDID INJECTION. In patients with circulatory shock, DILAUDID INJECTION may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of DILAUDID INJECTION in patients with circulatory shock.

5.9 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness

In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), DILAUDID INJECTION may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with DILAUDID INJECTION.

Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of DILAUDID INJECTION in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.

5.10 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions

DILAUDID INJECTION is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.

The hydromorphone in DILAUDID INJECTION may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.

5.11 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders

The hydromorphone in DILAUDID INJECTION may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during DILAUDID INJECTION therapy.

### Randomized clinical trial of efficacy and safety of a single 2-mg intravenous dose of hydromorphone versus usual care in the management of acute pain [^710c1505]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective was to test the efficacy and safety of 2 mg of intravenous (IV) hydromorphone (Dilaudid) against "usual care" in emergency department (ED) patients with acute severe pain.

Methods

This was a randomized clinical trial. Patients allocated to 2 mg of IV hydromorphone received their medication in a single dose. Those randomized to usual care received any IV opioid, with type, dose, and frequency chosen by the ED attending. All patients received 2 L/min. nasal cannula oxygen. The primary outcome was the difference in the proportion of patients who achieved clinically satisfactory analgesia by 30 minutes. This was defined as the patient declining additional analgesia when asked the question, "Do you want more pain medicine?" A 10% absolute difference was chosen a priori as the minimum difference considered clinically significant.

Results

Of 175 subjects randomized to each group, 164 in the 2 mg hydromorphone group and 161 in the usual care group had sufficient data for analysis. Additional pain medication was declined by 77.4% of patients in the 2 mg hydromorphone group at 30 minutes, compared to 65.8% in the usual care group. This difference of 11.6% was statistically and clinically significant (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.8% to 21.1%). Safety profiles were similar and no patient required naloxone. There was more pruritus in the hydromorphone group (18.3% vs. 8.7%; difference = 9.6%, 95% CI = 2.6% to 16.6%).

Conclusions

Using a simple dichotomous patient-centered endpoint in which a difference of 10% in proportion obtaining adequate analgesia was considered clinically significant, 2 mg of hydromorphone in a single IV dose is clinically and statistically more efficacious when compared to usual care for acute pain management in the ED.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are indicated for the management of severe and persistent pain that requires an extended treatment period with a daily opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.

Limitations of Use

Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration, and because of the greater risks of overdose and death with extended-release/long-acting opioid formulations, [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], reserve hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain.

Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not indicated as an as-needed (prn) analgesic.

### Morphine or hydromorphone: which should be preferred? A systematic review [^b1e12047]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To systematically review available paediatric literature on comparisons between morphine (Mo) and hydromorphone (Hm), to guide clinicians to rationally use these medications.

Design

Systematic review within four databases for all studies published from 1963 to July 2019.

Setting

All paediatric settings.

Eligibility

All studies comparing Mo to Hm in individuals younger than 21 years.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was to compare clinical efficacy and side effects of Mo and Hm. The secondary outcomes were the comparison of pharmacokinetic profiles and the description of predefined Mo to Hm conversion ratios used across the paediatric literature.

Results

Among 754 abstracts reviewed, 59 full-text articles met inclusion criteria and 24 studies were included in the analysis: 4 studies compared pharmacodynamics of Mo and Hm and 20 studies reported the use of a predefined Mo to Hm conversion ratio. Most studies had a poor methodological quality. Available evidence suggests that, when given intravenously, the equianalgesic ratio of Mo to Hm is 5:1. Intravenous administration with this ratio results in a similar rate of adverse effects, including pruritus and nausea. The epidural administration with a ratio of 10:1 results in more pruritus and urinary retention with Mo than Hm. Pharmacokinetic data were reported in only one study. A wide range of pre-established ratios for different routes of administration were reported, but few were based on evidence.

Conclusion

Current literature does not permit a rational choice between Mo and Hm. A ratio of 5:1 seems adequate for intravenous administration and leads to a similar rate of adverse effects.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets were investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study in opioid tolerant patients with moderate-to-severe low back pain. Patients were considered opioid tolerant if they were currently on opioid therapy that was ≥ 60 mg/day of oral morphine equivalent for at least 2 months prior to screening. Patients entered an open-label conversion and titration phase with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, were converted to a starting dose that was approximately 75% of their total daily morphine equivalent dose, and were dosed once daily until adequate pain control was achieved while exhibiting tolerable side effects. Supplemental immediate-release hydromorphone tablets were allowed throughout the study. Patients who achieved a stable dose entered a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized treatment phase. Mean daily dose at randomization was 37.8 mg/day (range of 12 mg/day to 64 mg/day). Fifty-eight (58) percent of patients were successfully titrated to a stable dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets during the open-label conversion and titration phase.

During the double-blind treatment phase, patients randomized to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets continued with the stable dose achieved in the conversion and titration phase of the study. Patients randomized to placebo received, in a blinded manner, hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and matching placebo in doses tapering from the stable dose achieved in conversion and titration. During the taper down period, patients were allowed immediate-release hydromorphone tablets as supplemental analgesia to minimize opioid withdrawal symptoms in placebo patients. After the taper period, the number of immediate-release hydromorphone tablets was limited to two tablets per day. Forty-nine (49) percent of patients treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and 33% of patients treated with placebo completed the 12-week treatment period.

Hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets provided superior analgesia compared to placebo. There was a significant difference between the mean changes from Baseline to Week 12 or Final Visit in average weekly pain intensity Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores obtained from patient diaries between the two groups. The proportion of patients with various degrees of improvement from screening to Week 12 or Final Visit is shown in Figure 2 . For this analysis, patients who discontinued treatment for any reason prior to Week 12 were assigned a value of zero improvement.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids (...) [^af48c402]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

6, 17, 41– 46). Partly because of these factors affecting access to a wide range of treatment modalities, for many years medications such as prescription opioids have been the mainstay to treat pain, despite very limited evidence to support their long-term benefits; most placebo-controlled trials have been <6 weeks in duration. Opioids can be essential medications for the management of pain; however, they carry considerable potential risk. A systematic review published in 2014 by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found insufficient evidence to demonstrate long-term benefits of prescription opioid treatment for chronic pain, and long-term prescription opioid use was found to be associated with increased risk for overdose and opioid misuse, among other risks. Some risks, such as overdose, were dose dependent.

In 2014, on the basis of accumulating evidence of potential risks to patients, the Food and Drug Administration required new safety labeling changes for extended-release and long-acting opioids. Approximately half of all states have passed legislation limiting initial opioid prescriptions for acute pain to a ≤7-day supply, and many insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, and pharmacies have enacted similar policies. At least 17 states have passed laws requiring or recommending the coprescription of naloxone in the presence of overdose risk factors, such as high dosages of opioids or concomitant opioid pain medications and benzodiazepines. The durations used to define acute, subacute, and chronic pain might imply more specificity than is found in real-life patient experience, when pain often gradually transitions from acute to chronic.

These time-bound definitions are not meant to be absolute but rather to be approximate guides to facilitate the consideration and practical use of the recommendations by clinicians and patients. The AHRQ review of opioids for chronic pain updated and expanded the evidence for the 2016 CDC review; studies were included on short-term, intermediate-term and long-term outcomes of therapy involving opioids, effects of opioid plus nonopioid combination therapy, effects of tramadol, effects of naloxone coprescription, risks of coprescribed benzodiazepines, risks of coprescribed gabapentinoids, and effects of concurrent use of cannabis.

2.5     Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets

Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.

When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose of opioid (including hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with comorbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.

### Hydromorphone hydrochloride [^5ec6e9e6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Example conversion from a single opioid to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets:

Step 1: Sum the total daily dose of the opioid

30 mg of oxycodone 2 times daily = 60 mg total daily dose of oxycodone

Step 2: Calculate the approximate equivalent dose of oral hydromorphone based on the total daily dose of the current opioid using Table 1

60 mg total daily dose of oxycodone x Conversion Factor of 0.4 = 24 mg of oral hydromorphone daily

Step 3: Calculate the approximate starting dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets to be given every 24 hours, which is 50% of the calculated oral hydromorphone dose. Round down, if necessary, to the appropriate hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets strengths available.

50% of 24 mg results in an initial dose of 12 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily
Adjust individually for each patient

Close observation and frequent titration are warranted until pain management is stable on the new opioid. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal or for signs of over-sedation/toxicity after converting patients to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets.

### Hydromorphone for acute and chronic pain [^1be9f015]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

While morphine is the gold standard for the management of severe cancer pain, some patients either do not achieve adequate analgesia, or suffer intolerable morphine-related toxicity. For these patients alternatives such as hydromorphone are recommended. However, there appear to be gaps in our understanding of the efficacy and potency of hydromorphone.

Objectives

This review explores and assesses the evidence for the efficacy of hydromorphone in the management of pain.

Search Strategy

Randomised trials which included hydromorphone were sought using electronic databases and by handsearching relevant journals. Date of the most recent search: February 2000.

Selection Criteria

RCTs which involved the administration of hydromorphone, for both acute and chronic pain conditions, in adults and children, were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

A data extraction form was designed for the purpose of the review. The validity of each trial for inclusion was assessed using criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook. A grade was allocated to each study on the basis of allocation concealment. A checklist was used to assess blinding.

Main Results

Forty three studies (2725 subjects) were included in the review. Approximately half of these studies received a low quality score. In addition, the heterogeneity of the studies precluded combination of data and results. A meta-analysis was therefore not possible. Of the 43 included studies, 11 (645 subjects) involved chronic pain conditions (all cancer) and 32 (2080 subjects) acute pain. Three studies were placebo-controlled. Of the remainder, hydromorphone was compared with other opioids (morphine, fentanyl, sufentanyl, meperidine, oxycodone, diamorphine), bupivicaine and with itself, using different formulations. The routes of administration included intravenous, oral, spinal, intramuscular and subcutaneous. Overall, hydromorphone appears to be a potent analgesic. The limited number of studies available suggest that there is little difference between morphine and hydromorphone in terms of analgesic efficacy, adverse effect profile and patient preference. However, as most studies involved small numbers of patients, it is difficult to determine real differences between both drugs. In the context of both acute and chronic pain, the issue of equi-analgesic ratios between morphine and hydromorphone was not resolved.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The studies included in this review were varied in terms of quality and methodology. However, the majority demonstrated that hydromorphone is a potent analgesic, that the clinical effects of hydromorphone appear to be dose-related, and that the adverse effect profile of hydromorphone is similar to that of other mu opioid receptor agonists.

### Hydromorphone hydrochloride (Exalgo) [^c5fb7c89]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

12.1    Mechanism of Action

Hydromorphone, a semi-synthetic morphine derivative, is a hydrogenated ketone of morphine. Hydromorphone is principally an agonist of mu-receptors, showing a weak affinity for k-receptors. Comparing relative binding affinity for mu- and k-opioid receptors, hydromorphone binds more specifically to mu-receptors than structurally related morphine. As an opioid agonist, the principle therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. The precise mechanism of action of opioid analgesics is not known but the effects are thought to be mediated through opioid-specific receptors located predominantly in the central nervous system (CNS). Interaction with the mu-opioid receptor subtype is believed to be responsible for most of hydromorphone’s clinical effects. There is no intrinsic limit to the analgesic effect of hydromorphone. Clinically, however, dosage limitations are imposed by the adverse effects, primarily respiratory depression, sedation, nausea, and vomiting, which can result from high doses.

### Hydromorphone: evolving to meet the challenges of today's health care environment [^aa8958d4]. Clinical Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hydromorphone, a potent analogue of morphine, has long had an important role in pain management and is included in several international guidelines for managing pain. Advances in hydromorphone formulations and the ways in which hydromorphone is being used clinically today warrant a review of the drug's pharmacotherapeutic utility.

Objective

The history and recent advances in hydromorphone pharmacotherapy are reviewed. Areas covered include the pharmacologic and metabolic profile of hydromorphone, the role of hydromorphone in pain management, formulations and routes of administration, and issues related to relative opioid potencies, equianalgesic ratios, and opioid rotation. Because hydromorphone, like all opioids, carries a risk of misuse, abuse, and illicit diversion, the related issues of tamper-resistant formulations and "dose-dumping" of extended-release formulations are discussed.

Conclusions

Due to the epidemic of prescription opioid overdoses associated with prescription opioid abuse in the United States, development of tamper-resistant opioid formulations that avoid dose-dumping issues has become a significant goal of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The current formulation of hydromorphone extended-release potentially provides the benefits of long-acting hydromorphone (ie, continuous pain control, increased quality of life, freedom to perform daily activities) to appropriate patients, while reducing the risks of abuse and without compromising safety.

### Hydromorphone: pharmacology and clinical applications in cancer patients [^6a97fca9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2001). Low credibility.

Hydromorphone is a more potent opioid analgesic than morphine and is used for moderate to severe pain. It can be administered by injection, by infusion, by mouth, and rectally. Oral bioavailability is low. The kidney excretes hydromorphone and its metabolites. Some metabolites may have greater analgesic activity than hydromorphone itself but are unlikely to contribute to the pharmacological activity of hydromorphone. With the exception of pruritus, sedation and nausea and vomiting, which may occur less after hydromorphone than after morphine, the side-effects of these drugs are similar. On a milligram basis hydromorphone is five times as potent as morphine when given by the oral route, and 8.5 times as potent as morphine when given intravenously.

### Comparative clinical effects of hydromorphone and morphine: a meta-analysis [^5c48865d]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

We have conducted a meta-analysis of the clinical effects of morphine and hydromorphone to compare their benefit in analgesia. Embase and Medline were searched with an end-date of June 2009 for randomized, controlled trials or observational studies that addressed comparative analgesic and side-effects or particular side-effects. Two researchers independently identified included studies and extracted the data. Estimates of opioid effects were combined by using a random-effects model. Meta-analysis of eight studies suggested that hydromorphone (494 patients) provides slightly better (P=0.012) clinical analgesia than morphine (510 patients). The effect-size was small (Cohen's d=0.266) and disappeared when one study was removed, although the advantage of hydromorphone was more evident in studies of better quality (Jadad's rating). Side-effects were similar, for example, nausea (P=0.383, nine studies, 456 patients receiving hydromorphone and 460 morphine); vomiting (P=0.306, six studies, 246 patients receiving hydromorphone and 239 morphine); or itching (P=0.249, eight studies, 405 patients receiving hydromorphone, 410 morphine). This suggests some advantage of hydromorphone over morphine for analgesia. Additional potential clinical pharmacological advantages with regard to side-effects, such as safety in renal failure or during acute analgesia titration, are based on limited evidence and require substantiation by further studies.

Conversion from Other Oral Hydromorphone Formulations to EXALGO

Patients receiving oral immediate-release hydromorphone may be converted to EXALGO by administering a starting dose equivalent to the patient’s total daily oral hydromorphone dose, taken once daily.

Conversion from Oral Opioids to EXALGO

While there are useful tables of oral and parenteral equivalents, there is substantial inter-patient variation in the relative potency of different opioid drugs and formulations. Specific recommendations of equianalgesic doses are not available because of a lack of systematic evidence for these types of analgesic substitutions. Published relative potency data are available, but such ratios are approximations. As such, it is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour oral hydromorphone requirement and provide rescue medication (e.g. immediate-release hydromorphone) than to overestimate and manage an adverse reaction.

The following table was used in a clinical trial of EXALGO. The recommended starting dose of EXALGO is 50% of the calculated estimate of daily hydromorphone requirement. Calculate the estimated daily hydromorphone requirement using Table 1 .

The conversion ratios in this Table 1 are only to be used for the conversion from current oral opioid therapy to EXALGO. Do not use this table to convert patients from EXALGO to another opioid. Doing so may result in fatal overdose.
For patients on a single opioid, sum the total daily dose of the opioid and then multiply the total daily dose by the conversion ratio to calculate the approximate oral hydromorphone equivalent.
For patients on a regimen of mixed opioids, calculate the approximate oral hydromorphone dose for each opioid and sum the totals.
For patients on a regimen of fixed-ratio opioid/non-opioid analgesic medications, only the opioid component of these medications should be used in the conversion.
It is extremely important to monitor all patients closely when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and tends to accumulate in the plasma.
Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of opioid withdrawal when converting patients to EXALGO.

### Hydromorphone [^c437a5a4]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2005). Low credibility.

Hydromorphone is a semi-synthetic opioid that has been used widely for acute pain, chronic cancer pain and to a lesser extent, in chronic nonmalignant pain. Its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have been well studied, including immediate release oral preparations, a variety of slow release oral preparations, as well as administration through intravenous, subcutaneous, epidural, intrathecal and other routes. It is known to be metabolized to analgesically inactive metabolites that have been associated with neuroexcitatory states and other toxicity. There is no evidence that hydromorphone has any greater abuse liability than other opioids. Further research is needed to address remaining areas of uncertainty: equianalgesic ratios; relative risk of toxicity compared with other opioids, its use in nonmalignant pain, and the role of specific hydromorophone metabolites in the development of toxicity, particularly in association with organ failure.

### Intrathecal hydromorphone for chronic nonmalignant pain: a retrospective study [^31b79bd3]. Pain Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Ten percent to 15% of patients with chronic pain experience intolerable side effects or inadequate analgesia with continuous intrathecal morphine therapy. Although clinical experience suggests that rotation to hydromorphone (Dilaudid) can reduce side effects and recapture analgesia, there have been only scattered reports of long-term intrathecal hydromorphone use in patients with nonmalignant pain. The purpose of this study is to review the safety and effectiveness of continuous intrathecal hydromorphone in the management of patients with nonmalignant pain in whom continuous intrathecal morphine therapy has failed.

Design

A retrospective review of 37 patients with chronic nonmalignant pain managed with intrathecal hydromorphone after failure of intraspinal morphine.

Results

The mean age of patients was 64 years +/- 12 SD. All patients suffered from severe nonmalignant pain, most from failed lumbosacral spine operations (19/37; 51%). Morphine was replaced with hydromorphone because of pharmacological complications (21/37; 57%) or inadequate analgesic response (16/37; 43%) after an average of 11 months +/- 11 SD of intrathecal therapy. Pharmacological complications, particularly nausea and vomiting, pruritus, and sedation were reduced by hydromorphone in most patients. Peripheral edema was improved by hydromorphone but tended to recur with prolonged hydromorphone exposure. Analgesic response was improved by at least 25% in six of 16 patients who were switched to hydromorphone because of poor pain relief.

Conclusions

Hydromorphone can be a safe, analgesic alternative for long-term intrathecal management of nonmalignant pain among patients in whom morphine fails because of pharmacological side effects or inadequate pain relief.

### Safer opioid supply clients' values and preferences: a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative research [^0d4a3019]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Analytic theme 2: the right medications to optimise client-relevant outcomes

SOS clients consistently identified a gap between their individual medication needs and what the programmes offered. According to clients, the three key components of effective SOS medication included the ‘right drug,’ the ‘right dosage’ and the ‘right formulation’ to sufficiently reduce reliance on unregulated opioids and the associated risk of overdose. Three descriptive themes capturing the key components of effective medications contributed to this finding.

Need for multiple opioid medication options (high confidence)

Some clients reported that IR hydromorphone tablets were insufficient as an alternative to fentanyl,which resulted in continued reliance on unregulated drugs and left them at an ongoing risk of overdose:

I get 24 hydromorphone or Dilaudid a day. I use them all. They’re quite frankly not nearly strong enough to satisfy like a full-on fentanyl addiction.

These clients expressed the need for additional opioid medications to adequately meet individual needs and preferences,as stated by one client:

I would prefer something that has more of a kick to it than Dilaudids for the cravings and stuff like that, like a fentanyl without the side risks.

Right dos age (high confidence)

Reaching and maintaining an optimal dosage was crucial for addressing clients’ needs and preventing their use of unregulated opioids. For those receiving IR hydromorphone tablets as a safer alternative, achieving an adequate dose that met their individual needs was key,as illustrated below:

It was hard at the beginning but then I realized that the more of the Dilaudid that I did, the less fentanyl I had to do. So it took a while to get up to the dose I’m at now. And I remember coming in here sick and puking, dying sick, every other day when I first started, and then going up and going up and going up (in my safer opioid supply dosing) and finally, hey, I hit a dose and it’s “Okay, I feel comfortable with this dose. I’m at the point where I am not using fentanyl as much, I’m good.” And now it’s been a while and it’s been the same dose and I feel great.

### Effectiveness and safety of hydromorphone compared to morphine for postoperative analgesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a75efad4]. Pain Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Because of its side effects, a morphine replacement has been searched for in the field of postoperative analgesia. Hydromorphone is a derivative of morphine with no active metabolites.

Objectives

We conducted a meta-analysis of hydromorphone and morphine to compare their clinical effects in postoperative analgesia.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

The methodological quality of the studies included in this meta-analysis was assessed according to the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria were used to evaluate the quality of evidence and recommendation grade for inclusion of randomized controlled trials. The primary outcome was postoperative pain score. Secondary outcomes were severe sedation, nausea, vomiting, and pruritus. The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre for The Cochrane Collaboration).

Results

Eight randomized controlled trials comprising 833 patients were found. There was no significant difference in pain scores between the hydromorphone and morphine groups at any measured postoperative time point: 8 hours (mean difference [MD] = -0.42; 95%CI, -2.08 to 1.24; P = 0.62); 12 hours (MD = -0.19; 95%CI, -0.62 to 0.24; P = 0.39); 24 hours (MD = -0.22; 95%CI, -0.54 to 0.09; P = 0.17); 36 hours (MD = 0.01; 95%CI, -0.67 to 0.69; P = 0.98) and 48 hours (MD = -0.14; 95%CI, -1.25 to 0.96; P = 0.80). There was no significant difference in the incidence of nausea and vomiting at 24 hours postoperative. The incidence of pruritus at 24 hours postoperative was lower in the hydromorphone group (relative risk = 0.24; 95%CI, 0.09 to 0.66; P = 0.005).

Limitations

The perioperative multimodal analgesia measures were varying in the included studies, such as different medication doses. The sample size was small for some outcomes and high heterogeneity was observed.

Conclusions

There was no significant statistical difference in postoperative analgesic effect between hydromorphone and morphine, as well as side effects, including severe sedation, nausea, and vomiting at 24 hours postoperative. However, the incidence of pruritus was lower in the hydromorphone group at 24 hours postoperative.

### Randomized clinical trial of the 2 mg hydromorphone bolus protocol versus the "1 + 1" hydromorphone titration protocol in treatment of acute, severe pain in the first hour of emergency department presentation [^45105e7b]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We compare a high initial dose of 2 mg intravenous hydromorphone against titration of 1 mg intravenous hydromorphone followed by an optional second dose.

Methods

Patients aged 21 to 64 years with severe pain were randomly allocated to 2 mg intravenous hydromorphone in a single bolus or the "1+1" hydromorphone titration protocol. 1+1 Patients received 1 mg intravenous hydromorphone followed by a second 1 mg dose 15 minutes later if they answered yes when asked, Do you want more pain medication? The primary outcome was the between-group difference in proportion of patients who declined additional analgesia at 60 minutes.

Results

Of the 350 enrolled patients, 334 had sufficient data for analysis. The proportion who declined additional analgesics was 67.5% in the 2 mg bolus arm and 67.3% in the 1+1 titration arm (difference 0.2%; 95% confidence interval -9.7% to 10.2%). The between-group difference in numeric rating scale pain scores was 0.4 numeric rating scale units (95% confidence interval -0.3 to 1.1). The incidence of adverse effects was similar; 42.3% of 1+1 patients achieved satisfactory analgesia at 1 hour with only 1 mg hydromorphone.

Conclusion

A hydromorphone 1+1 titration protocol provides similar pain relief to an initial 2 mg bolus dose, with no apparent clinical advantage to the latter. The 1+1 titration protocol had an opioid-sparing effect because 50% less opioid was needed to achieve satisfactory analgesia for 42.3% of patients allocated to this protocol.

### A randomized, double-blind study of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets versus oxycodone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for cancer pain: efficacy and safety in Japanese cancer patients (EXHEAL: a phase III study of EXtended-release hydromorphonE for cAncer pain reLief) [^a702127d]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

From the start of study treatment to the completion (or discontinuation) of treatment, each subject evaluated their average pain severity once daily for the last 24 hours using the VAS and recorded the score in the patient diary. Oral morphine hydrochloride solution was used for rescue analgesia to avoid using the investigational agents for rescue (Table 1). The immediate-release preparations of hydromorphone and oxycodone faced challenges of being unapproved and potential confounding of safety assessments, respectively.

Concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors, opioid analgesics, and narcotic antagonists was prohibited. In addition, starting new treatment with/changing the dosing regimen of systemic nonopioid analgesics, adjuvant analgesics for pain relief, bisphosphonates, or anti-RANKL antibody preparations was prohibited. Furthermore, it was prohibited for subjects to undergo radiotherapy, nerve block, percutaneous vertebroplasty, or surgery, or receive any new cancer chemotherapy or immunotherapy for the first time. Magnesium oxide at 2 g/day and prochlorperazine maleate at 15 mg/day were administered to all subjects to ensure balanced evaluation of constipation and nausea/vomiting.

Outcomes

The primary efficacy end point was the change in VAS score from baseline to completion or discontinuation of treatment. Secondary end points evaluated were change in VAS score and sleep quality from baseline to each evaluation day. Sleep quality was assessed using a 4-point rating scale. The safety population included all subjects who were randomized to receive at least one dose of either treatment option. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study period. AEs could be determined by investigators during examination or could be reported voluntarily by patients. Incidence, intensity, and relationship to the study drug were reported for AEs. Serious AEs, including death, were reported for both treatment arms, and attribution to treatment was determined. Clinical and laboratory assessments were performed at periodic intervals (day 1, day 8, and discontinuation) throughout the study period. Investigators coded the AEs by system organ class and preferred terms based on the MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 18.1;). Severity of AEs was rated on a three-grade scale (mild, moderate, and severe).

### Hydromorphone for neuropathic pain in adults [^7b1b10c8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Opioid drugs, including hydromorphone, are commonly used to treat neuropathic pain, and are considered effective by some professionals. Most reviews have examined all opioids together. This review sought evidence specifically for hydromorphone, at any dose, and by any route of administration. Other opioids are considered in separate reviews.This review is part of an update of a previous review, Hydromorphone for acute and chronic pain that was withdrawn in 2013 because it needed updating and splitting to be more specific for different pain conditions. This review focuses only on neuropathic pain.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy of hydromorphone for chronic neuropathic pain in adults, and the adverse events associated with its use in clinical trials.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), via the CRSO; MEDLINE via Ovid; and EMBASE via Ovid from inception to 17 November 2015, together with reference lists of retrieved papers and reviews, and two online study registries.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind studies of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing hydromorphone (at any dose, by any route of administration, or in any formulation) with placebo or another active treatment in chronic neuropathic pain.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently searched for studies, extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and examined issues of study quality. We did not carry out any pooled analyses. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

Main Results

Searches identified seven publications relating to four studies. We excluded three studies. One post hoc (secondary) analysis of a study published in four reports assessed the efficacy of hydromorphone in neuropathic pain, satisfied our inclusion criteria, and was included in the review. The single included study had an enriched enrolment, randomised withdrawal design with 94 participants who were successfully switched from oral morphine to oral hydromorphone extended release (about 60% of those enrolled). These participants were then randomised to continuing hydromorphone for 12 weeks or tapering down the hydromorphone dose to placebo. The methodological quality of the study was generally good, but we judged the risk of bias for incomplete outcome data as unclear, and for study size as high.Since we identified only one study for inclusion, we were unable to carry out any analyses. The included study did not report any of our prespecified primary outcomes, which relate to the number of participants achieving moderate or substantial levels of pain relief. It did report a slightly larger increase in average pain intensity for placebo in the randomised withdrawal phase than for continuing with hydromorphone. It also reported the number of participants who withdrew due to lack of efficacy in the randomised withdrawal phase, which may be an indicator of efficacy. However, in addition to using an enriched enrolment, randomised withdrawal study design, there was an unusual choice of imputation methods for withdrawals (about 50% of participants); the evidence was of very low quality and inadequate to make a judgement on efficacy. Adverse events occurred in about half of participants with hydromorphone, the most common being constipation and nausea. A similar proportion of participants experienced adverse events with placebo, the most common being opioid withdrawal syndrome (very low quality evidence). Most adverse events were mild or moderate in intensity. One in eight participants withdrew while taking hydromorphone during the conversion and titration phase, despite participants being opioid-tolerant (very low quality evidence).We downgraded the quality of the evidence to very low because there was only one study with few participants, it did not report clinically useful efficacy outcomes, and it was a post hoc analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence to support or refute the suggestion that hydromorphone has any efficacy in any neuropathic pain condition.

### Practical management of opioid rotation and equianalgesia [^63d766a2]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Hydromorphone

Hydromorphone is a hydrogenated ketone analogue of morphine. As with morphine, there is great interindividual variation in oral bioavailability (10%–65%). Some metabolites may have greater analgesic activity than hydromorphone itself but are unlikely to contribute to the pharmacological activity of hydromorphone.According to the summary of product characteristics (hydromorphone hydrochloride 1.3 mg and 2.6 mg capsules), 1.3 mg of hydromorphone has an efficacy approximately equivalent to 10 mg of morphine given orally.

We identified one double-blind crossover study, three prospective studies, and three retrospective studies with relevant data regarding equianalgesic conversion ratios to and from hydromorphone (po, sc) in cancer pain (Table 4). In a study by Wallace et al, patients with chronic cancer pain were enrolled in an open-label conversion trial, from various opioids to HMpo, using an oral M:HM ratio of 5:1 for a MEDD conversion.Of the 127 patients who received HMpo, 85 (67%) completed the study. The majority of patients who achieved stabilization did so without titration or with just one or two titration steps. The conclusion was that the 5:1 ratio was safe and effective when converting from morphine to hydromorphone. Wallace et al did not evaluate converting patients back from hydromorphone to oral morphine.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^c3a20ac9]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP chronic non-cancer pain opioid prescribing—agent selection and cautions: Reasonable, first line opioid choices for mild pain often include tramadol, codeine, Tapentadol, or hydrocodone; for second line mild to moderate pain therapy, clinicians can start with hydrocodone or oxycodone; and for severe pain, first line therapy may begin with hydrocodone, oxycodone, hydromorphone, or morphine, with second line therapy with fentanyl and third line therapy with methadone. Buprenorphine should be considered as a viable alternative to strong opioids in moderate to severe chronic pain therapy, and the literature suggests that codeine and tramadol may confer a lower abuse risk than more potent opioids. Meperidine is not recommended for chronic pain treatment due to adverse neurological events, which are increased with long-term use, renal insufficiency, and concurrent benzodiazepine use.

### Randomized clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of a hydromorphone titration protocol to usual care in the management of adult emergency department patients with acute severe pain [^77be5f8a]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We test the efficacy and safety of the "1+1" (1 mg plus 1 mg 15 minutes later if needed) hydromorphone protocol against usual care of emergency department (ED) patients with acute severe pain.

Methods

This was a prospective, randomized clinical trial of ED patients with acute severe pain. The 1+1 protocol specifies administration of 1 mg intravenous hydromorphone, followed by a second dose of 1 mg intravenous hydromorphone 15 minutes after the first bolus if the patient answers yes to the question, "Do you want more pain medication?" Usual care is the administration of any intravenous opioid, with type and dose chosen by the ED attending physician. Usual care patients who wanted more medication at 15 minutes were treated at the physician's discretion. At 60 minutes, all patients were asked again whether they wanted more pain medication. The primary outcome was successful treatment defined a priori as not wanting additional analgesia at either 15 or 60 minutes after the initial bolus. The primary endpoint was the difference in the proportion of patients with successful treatment who received the complete 1+1 protocol versus usual care with a per-protocol analysis. An intention-to-treat analysis was also performed. A 10% difference in rate of successful treatment was chosen a priori as a clinically meaningful difference.

Results

Of 167 patients in the 1+1 group, 156 received the full 1+1 protocol, whereas 171 received usual care. Of patients who received the 1+1 protocol, 92.3% (144/156) had successful treatment versus 76.6% (131/171) of usual care patients (difference=15.7%; 95% confidence interval 7.9% to 23.3%). In the intention-to-treat analysis, 86.8% (145/167) of patients randomized to the 1+1 group received successful treatment versus 76.6% (131/171) of usual care patients (difference=10.2%; 95% confidence interval 2.0% to 18.3%). No patient required naloxone. One patient in the 1+1 group and 2 patients in the usual care group had transient oxygen saturation less than 95%. The incidence of all adverse effects was similar in both groups.

Conclusion

When analyzed per protocol or with the more conservative intention-to-treat analysis, the 1+1 hydromorphone protocol is statistically and clinically more efficacious than usual care. Safety profiles were similar in both groups.

### Toward a systematic approach to opioid rotation [^f5b69054]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Search methodology

References cited in this review were identified via a search of PubMed covering all English language publications up to May 21, 2013; the search included clinical trials, guidelines, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and case reports but excluded narrative reviews, letters, and expert opinion. Using the search string “(opioid OR buprenorphine OR codeine OR fentanyl OR hydrocodone OR hydromorphone OR methadone OR meperidine OR morphine OR oxycodone OR oxymorphone) AND (switching OR rotation OR conversion) AND chronic”; the search yielded a total of 129 articles, 92 of which were judged to provide relevant information and were included in this review. Of these, 50 were clinical trials or case reports, and the remaining 42 pertained to the scientific rationale for various aspects of opioid rotation. Treatment guidelines and references identified via this strategy were reviewed for additional articles of interest.

### A randomized, double-blind study of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets versus oxycodone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for cancer pain: efficacy and safety in Japanese cancer patients (EXHEAL: a phase III study of EXtended-release hydromorphonE for cAncer pain reLief) [^8e798dc5]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Study design

Subjects were randomized at a ratio of 1:1 to either the hydromorphone group or the oxycodone group. A double-dummy method was used for blinding, and each randomized subject received either hydromorphone extended-release tablets plus placebo oxycodone hydrochloride extended-release tablets or placebo hydromorphone extended-release tablets plus oxycodone hydrochloride extended-release tablets orally for 7 days (once-daily dosing for hydromorphone and twice-daily dosing for oxycodone). The initial dose was 4 mg/day of hydromorphone extended-release tablets and 10 mg/day of oxycodone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Investigators were allowed to increase the doses of the study drugs every 24 hours during the treatment period if necessary due to insufficient analgesic efficacy. Doses could be increased in five stages up to a maximum of 24 mg/day of hydromorphone and 80 mg/day of oxycodone (Table 1). Treatment was switched to appropriate analgesics after completion of study treatment, and subjects were followed up. The initial dose of hydromorphone extended-release tablets was determined as 4 mg/day, which was assumed to be equivalent to 20 mg/day of morphine on the basis of the fivefold-higher efficacy ratio of hydromorphone compared with morphine (Exalgo; Mallinckrodt Brand Pharmaceuticals, Hazelwood, MO, USA). The initial dose of oxycodone hydrochloride extended-release tablets was determined as 10 mg/day, which is specified as the dose for opioid-naïve patients in the Japanese package insert.

### Hydromorphone hydrochloride (Exalgo) [^18d9dba3]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

Example conversion from a single opioid to EXALGO:

Step 1: Sum the total daily dose of the opioid

30 mg of oxycodone twice daily equals a total daily dose of 60 mg of oxycodone

Step 2: Calculate the approximately equivalent dose of oral hydromorphone based on the total daily dose of the opioid

Multiply the 60 mg total daily dose of oxycodone by the conversion factor of 0.4 for a result of 24 mg of oral hydromorphone

Step 3: Calculate the starting dose of EXALGO, which is 50% of the calculated oral hydromorphone dose

50% of 24 mg results in an initial dose of 12 mg of EXALGO once daily
Adjust individually for each patient

Table 1. Conversion Ratios to EXALGO*

* The conversion ratios and approximate equivalent doses in this conversion table are only to be used for the conversion from current opioid therapy to EXALGO.

It is extremely important to monitor all patients closely when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and tends to accumulate in the plasma.

Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to EXALGO

Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, EXALGO treatment can be initiated. For each 25 mcg/hr fentanyl transdermal dose, the equianalgesic dose of EXALGO is 12 mg every 24 hours. An appropriate starting dose of EXALGO is 50% of the calculated total daily dose every 24 hours.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of nalbuphine and hydromorphone in painless colonoscopy techniques: a randomized controlled trial [^99ccf83a]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the high rates of adverse events observed, it is worth considering whether the study protocol should have been modified when these high rates became apparent. Although the study was designed to closely monitor adverse events and report them promptly, the initial protocol did not include a predefined threshold for modifying the dosing regimen based on interim results. In hindsight, a more flexible approach to dose adjustment, perhaps incorporating interim analyses to assess safety profiles, could have been considered. This would allow for real-time adjustments to minimize patient discomfort while maintaining the study's integrity.

The dosing of hydromorphone in our study was based on existing reference data and clinical guidelines, which suggested a dose of 0.016 mg/kg for effective procedural sedation. However, it is important to note that dosing recommendations for hydromorphone can vary significantly in clinical practice. For instance, some studies have used lower doses (e.g. 0.01 mg/kg) for similar procedures, with comparable efficacy but potentially fewer adverse events. The reason why we used this dose was that the dose was determined after converting the equivalent dose of nalbuphine, morphine and hydromorphone. The test results also showed that the hydromorphone group caused more adverse reactions after achieving the expected analgesic effect, which was exactly the reverse confirmation of 1. The safety range of nalbuphine is wider, 2. The dose conversion of Nalbuphine may not be the 1:1 conversion ratio that we are familiar with.

### Efficacy and safety of hydromorphone for cancer pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^cbe8f1a6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the guidelines outlined by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The protocol for this review was submitted in advance to the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), with registration ID: CRD42024517513.

Search strategy

On December 25, 2023, we conducted searches in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science using keywords and MeSH terms synonymous with “Hydromorphone” and “Cancer”. Our search criteria did not impose any limitations regarding publication date or language. (Supplemental Content, Table 1)

Study selection

The database search results were combined, and duplicate studies were eliminated using EndNote 20 software (Thomson Reuters, Toronto, ON, Canada). Two independent reviewers (S.M. S.O.) conducted two-phase title/abstract and full-text screening, while a third reviewer (M.A.) resolved any discrepancies between them. Studies that met the following eligibility criteria (based on the PICO framework) answered our PICO question—How effective is hydromorphone at alleviating cancer pain and how does its safety profile compare to alternative opioids in patients with cancer pain? —were included:

Participants: Patients diagnosed with cancer who had either of the following:

a mean pain intensity of at least 5 on the VAS or 4 on the NRS, or experienced breakthrough pain at least three times a day;
were receiving treatment with an oral opioid analgesic.

Intervention: Hydromorphone in any form.

Comparator: Placebo, substitute opioid, hydromorphone (different route and dose of administration), or another active control.

Outcomes: Cancer pain intensity, additional analgesic consumption, breakthrough pain, quality of life, and adverse events.

Study design: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

### The side effects of morphine and hydromorphone patient-controlled analgesia [^7c6e8d46]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Despite "clinical lore" among health care providers that treatment with hydromorphone results in improved pain control and fewer adverse side effects, morphine continues to be the first-line medication for postoperative patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). In this study, we compared the efficacy and side-effect profiles of morphine and hydromorphone at concentrations producing equivalent drug effect measured by pain score and miosis.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial of 50 general and gynecological surgery patients. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either morphine (1 mg/mL) or hydromorphone (0.2 mg/mL) via PCA after surgery and were followed for a period of 8 h. The primary outcome was nausea. Secondary outcome variables were pruritus, vomiting, sedation, pain report, pupillary miosis, and patient satisfaction.

Results

The side effect profile was not different between drugs. The incidence of nausea did not differ between morphine and hydromorphone-treated patients (1 h: 44% vs 52%, 8 h: 68% vs 64%), vomiting (1 h: 4% vs 0%, 8 h: 0% vs 4%), or pruritus (1 h: 4% vs 16%, 8 h: 40% vs 40%). There was no difference in the amount of medication required to treat side effects or patient satisfaction. The average ratio of morphine to hydromorphone use was about 7:1. The patients used 10.9+/-6.0 mg morphine versus 1.57+/-1.0 mg hydromorphone after 1 h and 29.0+/-18.0 mg morphine versus 3.9+/-2.5 mg hydromorphone after 8 h. There was no difference between the morphine and hydromorphone groups with respect to postoperative pain scores with movement at 1 h (7.9+/-2.3 vs 7.1+/-2.4) or 8 h (5.7+/-2.8 vs 5.9+/-2.7). There was also no difference in pain at rest or miosis between groups.

Conclusions

We found no systematic difference between morphine and hydromorphone in opioid-related side effects. Neither was there any difference in efficacy of pain control or patient satisfaction when patients self-titrated to equal drug effect as measured by equianalgesia and pupillary miosis. The choice between morphine and hydromorphone for use in PCA should be guided by patient history, as there may be idiosyncratic reactions to either drug.

### Morphine and hydromorphone pharmacokinetics in human volunteers: population-based modelling of interindividual and opioid-related variability [^8e8c3da7]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Morphine and hydromorphone have differing onsets, magnitudes, and durations of effects and side-effects. Differences between opioids in their interindividual variabilities in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics might influence rational drug selection. Crossover drug studies can provide more informative interindividual variability data than parallel group studies. Using data from a crossover study of i.v. morphine and hydromorphone in healthy volunteers, we tested the hypothesis that morphine and hydromorphone differ in their interindividual pharmacokinetic variability.

Methods

Arterial opioid and metabolite concentrations from a randomised crossover study in 51 volunteers receiving a 2-h infusion of hydromorphone (0.05 or 0.1 mg kg -1 i.v.) or morphine (total 0.1 or 0.2 mg kg -1 i.v.) 1-2 weeks apart were evaluated with a three-compartmental model for parent opioid and incorporating glucuronides using population modelling (NONMEM). The primary outcome was interindividual variability in pharmacokinetics, based on the coefficient of variation (%CV) of individual model parameters, calculated as √[exp(ω 2 )-1]×100 where ω 2 is the interindividual variability.

Results

Data were analysed per drug and in a combined morphine-hydromorphone model. Both analyses indicate that interindividual variabilities for hydromorphone and morphine were comparable with %CV ranging from 9% to 31% for structural model parameters (combined analysis). Similarly, additive and relative residual errors had comparable variabilities, 20-40% and 72-87%, respectively, for morphine and hydromorphone (combined analysis).

Conclusions

Morphine and hydromorphone did not differ in a statistically significant or clinically meaningful manner in their interindividual pharmacokinetic variability. Interindividual pharmacokinetic variability does not appear a meaningful consideration in the choice between these two opioids.

### Opioid coprescription through risk mitigation guidance and opioid agonist treatment receipt [^f8ffca79]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is coprescription of hydromorphone tablets or sustained-release oral morphine (opioid risk mitigation guidance [RMG]) and opioid agonist treatment (OAT) associated with subsequent OAT receipt?

Findings

This population-based, retrospective cohort study included 4636 individuals who received at least 1 opioid RMG dispensation and were receiving OAT at the time of first opioid RMG dispensation and their matched unexposed group. The study found that receipt of opioid RMG for 4 days or more was associated with a 46% increase in the probability of OAT receipt in the subsequent week compared with those not receiving opioid RMG.

Meaning

These findings require further investigation to determine safety and isolate the hypothesized therapeutic effectiveness of potential combination formulations of OAT.

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^668c62b6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Short-acting opioids—hydromorphone: Initial oral dosage (in opioid-naïve) is 2 mg every 4 to 6 hr, and an initial dose of 4 to 8 mg may be given for severe pain. There is no optimal or maximum dose of hydromorphone; patients on LOT are likely to become tolerant and require doses higher than the usual dosage range to maintain the desired effect. Timing parameters are Analgesic Onset (min): 15 to 30, Peak (min): 30 to 60, Duration (hr): 3 to 4, and t½ (hr): 2 to 3. In special populations, for the elderly or debilitated use with caution and start at 25% to 50% of usual dose at the low end of the dosing range, and for hepatic or renal dysfunction reduce initial dose by 25% to 50% of usual dose depending on degree of impairment. Other considerations note women appear to have a 25% higher Cmax than men, and hepatic metabolism via glucuronidation to active metabolites (mainly hydro-morphone 3-glucuronide) can accumulate in renal impairment.

Most participants lacked an established pain protocol for the ED and believed that health care professionals were not well versed in the management of SCD pain. One participant stated, “You have those [ED physicians] that they’re so limited in education that they’re skeptical about following your own protocol. It’s like my doctor wrote that protocol. You’re [ED physician] putting me in harm’s way, but of course they’re not familiar with the dosage you are on, things of that sort, so your safety becomes a prohibiting factor to them. There are specific protocols but they’ll ignore it.”

In the ED, participants also reported having to negotiate for their usual dose of opioids. At times, a shortage of hydromorphone was cited as a reason for reducing the dosage or prescribing another opioid. One participant stated, “Many people that have sickle cell are allergic to morphine and they don’t have Dilaudid so now we have to play Russian roulette and take the morphine. I think it is the worst thing to ever happen, I think it is beyond cruel.”

Participants suspected during the shortage of hydromorphone that the hospital staff was reserving the drug for patients with conditions other than SCD. For example, ED staff advised that they do not have hydromorphone in the ED; however, when the patient with SCD was hospitalized, hydromorphone was available.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Selection of patients for treatment with OPANA should be governed by the same principles that apply to the use of similar opioid analgesics [see Indications and Usage (1)] . Physicians should individualize treatment in every case [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)], using non-opioid analgesics, opioids on an as needed basis, combination products, and chronic opioid therapy in a progressive plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the American Pain Society.

OPANA should be administered on an empty stomach, at least one hour prior to or two hours after eating [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]

2.1 Individualization of Dosage

As with any opioid drug product, it is necessary to adjust the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's prior analgesic treatment experience. In the selection of the initial dose of OPANA, attention should be given to the following:

The total daily dose, potency and specific characteristics of the opioid the patient has been taking previously;
The relative potency estimate used to calculate the equivalent oxymorphone dose needed;
The patient’s degree of opioid tolerance;
The age, general condition, and medical status of the patient;
Concurrent non-opioid analgesics and other medications;
The type and severity of the patient's pain;
The balance between pain control and adverse experiences;
Risk factors for abuse or addiction, including a prior history of abuse or addiction.

Once therapy is initiated, frequently assess pain relief and other opioid effects. Titrate dose to adequate pain relief (generally mild or no pain). Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment.

If signs of excessive opioid-related adverse experiences are observed, the next dose may be reduced. Adjust dosing to obtain an appropriate balance between pain relief and opioid-related adverse experiences. If significant adverse events occur before the therapeutic goal of mild or no pain is achieved, the events should be treated aggressively. Once adverse events are adequately managed, continue upward titration to an acceptable level of pain control.

During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, frequent contact is recommended between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family. Advise patients and family members of the potential common adverse reactions associated with changing opioid doses.

The dosing recommendations below, therefore, can only be considered as suggested approaches to what is actually a series of clinical decisions over time in the management of the pain of each individual patient.

### Repeat-dose steady-state pharmacokinetic evaluation of once-daily hydromorphone extended-release (OROS® hydromorphone ER) in patients with chronic pain [^da783b86]. Journal of Pain Research (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize the steady-state pharmacokinetic profile of hydromorphone extended-release (ER) in patients with chronic pain taking concomitant medications.

Methods

This open-label repeat-dose study enrolled 22 patients (mean age, 51.4 years; 81.8% female). All patients were receiving at least one concomitant medication; 86.4% were receiving at least two concomitant medications and 81.8% were receiving at least three. Patients receiving a stable dose of an opioid were converted to hydromorphone ER at a 5:1 ratio (morphine equivalent:hydromorphone). The dose was titrated to adequate analgesia over 3-14 days and stabilized between 8-48 mg. Oral morphine immediate-release was permitted for breakthrough pain. Area under the concentration-time curve from 0-24 hours (AUC(0-24)), maximum plasma concentration (C(max)), trough plasma concentration (C(min)), average plasma concentration (C(avg)), and degree of fluctuation (100 × [(C(max) - C(min)) ÷ C(avg)]) were calculated based on data from 14 patients.

Results

Dose-normalized to 16 mg, mean pharmacokinetic parameter values were: AUC(0-24), 41.1 ng · h/mL; C(max), 2.6 ng/mL; C(min), 1.1 ng/mL; C(avg), 1.7 ng/mL; and the degree of fluctuation was 99.6%. The pharmacokinetic profile of hydromorphone ER was linear and consistent with dose proportionality. Mean pain intensity difference scores showed statistically significant improvement from 2-21 hours after dosing. Sixteen (72.7%) patients reported at least one adverse event (AE). The most common were constipation (31.8%), headache (22.7%), and vomiting (13.6%). One patient discontinued treatment due to vomiting. No deaths, serious AEs, or unexpected AEs occurred.

Conclusion

These findings replicate and extend the steady-state pharmacokinetic profile of hydromorphone ER, previously characterized in healthy volunteers, to a population of chronic pain patients taking numerous concomitant medications.

### Oxymorphone hydrochloride (Opana er) [^ccd247c9]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Selection of patients for treatment with OPANA ER should be governed by the same principles that apply to the use of other extended-release opioid analgesics (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). As with any opioid drug product, it is necessary to adjust the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's prior analgesic treatment experience. Physicians should individualize treatment in every case (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), using non-opioid analgesics, prn opioids and/or combination products, and chronic opioid therapy in a progressiveplan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the American Pain Society and the Federation of State Medical Boards Model Guidelines. Healthcare professionals should follow appropriate pain management principles of careful assessment and ongoing monitoring (see BOXED WARNING).

In the selection of the initial dose of OPANA ER, attention should be given to the following:

The total daily dose, potency and specific characteristics of the opioid the patient has been taking previously;
The relative potency estimate used to calculate the equivalent oxymorphone dose needed;
The patient’s degree of opioid tolerance;
The age, general condition, and medical status of the patient;
Concurrent non-opioid analgesic and other medications;
The type and severity of the patient's pain;
The balance between pain control and adverse experiences;
Risk factors for abuse, addiction or diversion, including a prior history of abuse, addiction or diversion.

The following dosing recommendations, therefore, can only be considered as suggested approaches to what is actually a series of clinical decisions over time in the management of the pain of each individual patient.

OPANA ER should be administered on an empty stomach, at least one hour prior to or two hours after eating.

Opioid-Naïve Patients

It is suggested that patients who are not opioid-experienced being initiated on chronic around-the-clock opioid therapy be started with OPANA ER 5 mg every 12 hours. Thereafter, it is recommended that the dose be individually titrated, preferably at increments of 5-10 mg every 12 hours every 3-7 days, to a level that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes side effects under the close supervision of the prescribing physician (see CLINICAL TRIALS: 12-Week Study in Opioid-Naïve Patients with Low Back Pain).

### Efficacy and safety of hydromorphone for cancer pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^63758fbe]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the effectiveness of hydromorphone in reducing pain among oncology patients and to compare its efficacy to that of other opioids. The review revealed that all included investigations reported a significant reduction in pain among patients, and the meta-analyses indicated a similar efficacy to that of morphine and oxycodone. Our analyses also demonstrated the similar efficacy of hydromorphone to that of morphine and oxycodone in terms of reducing additional analgesic consumption and increasing quality of life. In addition, the literature suggests that improvements in sleep quality are also similar to those associated with other opioids. Hydromorphone, however, was not similar to other opioids in its ability to reduce breakthrough pain; our analysis showed that morphine had a slight advantage over hydromorphone, and hydromorphone was noted to be more effective than oxycodone in the included study that compared the two. Additionally, one report suggested that hydromorphone requires less time to be successfully titrated than morphine. No significant difference was noted in the analgesic effect of hydromorphone when patient-controlled versus clinician-controlled administration routes were compared or when sustained-release and immediate-release administrations were contrasted.

### Overdose deaths demand a new paradigm for opioid rotation [^7daf5b47]. Pain Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

An increasing number of deaths have been inferred to be associated with current opioid rotation practices and evidence is mounting that the use of widely accepted protocols for opioid rotation is an important contributing factor. Based on the findings of a literature review published in conjunction with this article, we propose a new paradigm for a potentially safer method of opioid rotation and present a case study illustrating the paradigm. This new paradigm suggests three easy-to-remember steps in opioid rotation and obviates the need to use a conversion table.

Design

Report of a clinical case of a patient undergoing opioid rotation using this new paradigm.

Summary

The patient was successfully rotated from extended-release oxycodone to extended-release hydromorphone. The dose of oxycodone was slowly decreased, while the hydromorphone dose was slowly titrated. A critical element to this approach involved providing sufficient immediate-release opioid to treat breakthrough pain and to reverse acute abstinence signs and symptoms if the dosing changes prove insufficient.

Conclusion

A safer new paradigm for opioid rotation may provide an important incremental step forward in reducing adverse public health consequences of inappropriate opioid dosing.

All patients were given a standard order set for postoperative care that included monitoring, multimodal analgesia, therapy for nausea and pruritus, and necessary emergency care. Two tablets of ibuprofen and codeine sustained-release (each tablets containing 0.2 g of ibuprofen and 13 mg of codeine phosphate) were routinely given BID after surgery to the patients. The NRS pain score was ≥ 4 points. Tramadol 100 mg and parecoxib 40 mg was also intravenously injected as needed. Granisetron (3 mg IV) and/or droperidol (2.5 mg IV) may be used as needed to treat nausea and vomiting. Itching can be treated with nalbuphine (5 mg IV three times daily, as required).

Measurements of oxygen saturation, Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS), and respiratory rate were also taken in the specified sequence.

### Less nausea, emesis, and constipation comparing hydromorphone and morphine? A prospective open-labeled investigation on cancer pain [^8cbf32eb]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Goals Of Work

The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the effect of long-term treatment with either oral sustained-release hydromorphone (HM) or morphine (M) on nausea, emesis, and constipation.

Materials and Methods

In a prospective, open-labeled, controlled trial, 100 outpatients with cancer pain and treatment with HM or M were enrolled. Mobility, pain, and gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed by the ECOG performance status, selected items of the EORTC questionnaire and Numerical Rating Scales (NRS). Data were analyzed using descriptive and confirmatory statistics (paired t-test, chi square test, Poisson regression).

Main Results

Demographic and medical data were comparable in both treatment groups. Taking into account different conversion factors, opioid doses (M 94.4 mg/d vs. HM 137.6 [HM/M = 1:5], p = 0.05 and HM 206.4 [HM/M = 1:7.5], p = 0.0002, respectively) were higher under hydromorphone and NRS of pain (M 2.3 vs. HM 3.6, p = 0.0002) lower under morphine. Nausea and emesis did not attenuate in 33% of patients. NRS of nausea (M 2.5 vs. HM 1.5; p = 0.01), incidences of emesis (M 0.7/d vs. HM 0.1/d, p = 0.0001), the consumption of antiemetics (M 26 vs. HM 14, p = 0.01), and the number of constipated patients (M 8 vs. HM 2, p = 0.04) were higher in the morphine group. An extended use of substances for symptom control revealed constipating effects (M 31 vs. HM 13, p = 0.0003) and was associated with a higher incidence of constipation in the morphine group.

Conclusions

Symptom control in outpatients with cancer pain may be complicated by a symptom controlling medication. Particularly, antiemetics revealed potentially constipating effects. Despite lower opioid doses, morphine provided a better pain control but produced more side effects. Comparing hydromorphone with morphine, it remains unclear if fewer incidences of constipation and nausea in the hydromorphone group were related to pharmacodynamic effects or to a less effective pain control with significantly higher NRS for pain. However, the conversion factor of oral hydromorphone and morphine needs to be questioned.

### Interpreting urine drug tests: prevalence of morphine metabolism to hydromorphone in chronic pain patients treated with morphine [^7f73a764]. Pain Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Pain medicine practitioners frequently use urine drug testing (UDT) to monitor adherence to opioid therapy. It can be difficult to interpret a result as normal or abnormal in relation to which opioid compounds are expected to be found in the urine. We investigated whether hydromorphone may be a metabolite of morphine normally appearing in UDT of patients prescribed morphine.

Design

This is a retrospective case-control study of urine toxicology results in pain patients taking only morphine. Inclusion criteria included urine results positive for morphine only (controls) or morphine and hydromorphone (cases). Demographic and medical history variables, and any history of aberrant drug behavior were recorded and related to the presence or absence of hydromorphone in the urine.

Results

Hydromorphone was present in 21 of 32 cases (66%), none of whom had a history of aberrant drug behavior. Positive cases occurred more frequently in women, in those taking higher daily doses of morphine, and in those with higher urine morphine concentrations (P < 0.05). Only morphine urine concentration was a significant predictor of the hydromorphone metabolite in a logistic regression model (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Hydromorphone is likely a minor metabolite of morphine, normally appearing in the UDT of patients taking morphine. This finding assists in determining whether a UDT result is normal or abnormal, and subsequently whether a patient is compliant with opioid therapy. This observation should be confirmed by a prospective study in a controlled environment. Variables such as gender, morphine dose, morphine urine concentration, and genetic determinants of morphine metabolism should be investigated further.

Hydromorphone extended-release (ER) tablets are available as 8, 12, 16, and 32 mg tablets for once daily administration and are not indicated in opioid-naïve patients due to the risk of respiratory depression; for opioid tolerant patients, convert current MEDD to an equianalgesic daily dose of hydromorphone ER and reduce the calculated amount by 33-50% for the initial start dose. Dosage adjustments may be made in increments of 4 to 8 mg every 3 to 4 days, with steady state reached after 3 to 4 days of once-daily dosing. In special populations, initiate at a low dose and titrate slowly with close monitoring in the elderly; for renal impairment start patients with moderate impairment at 50% of usual dose and patients with severe impairment at 25% of usual dose; for hepatic impairment start patients with moderate impairment at 25% of usual dose. Hydromorphone ER tablets must be swallowed intact and should not be cut, broken, chewed, crushed or dissolved due to risk of fatal overdose; Hydromorphone ER contains sulfites and has abuse deterrent properties but is not FDA-labeled as an abuse deterrent formulation.

### Hydromorphone for cancer pain [^ff3d29ac]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an update of the original Cochrane Review first published in Issue 10, 2016. For people with advanced cancer, the prevalence of pain can be as high as 90%. Cancer pain is a distressing symptom that tends to worsen as the disease progresses. Evidence suggests that opioid pharmacotherapy is the most effective of these therapies. Hydromorphone appears to be an alternative opioid analgesic which may help relieve these symptoms.

Objectives

To determine the analgesic efficacy of hydromorphone in relieving cancer pain, as well as the incidence and severity of any adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and clinical trials registers in November 2020. We applied no language, document type or publication status limitations to the search.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared hydromorphone with placebo, an alternative opioid or another active control, for cancer pain in adults and children. Primary outcomes were participant-reported pain intensity and pain relief; secondary outcomes were specific adverse events, serious adverse events, quality of life, leaving the study early and death.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data. We calculated risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for binary outcomes on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. We estimated mean difference (MD) between groups and 95% CI for continuous data. We used a random-effects model and assessed risk of bias for all included studies. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created three summary of findings tables.

Main Results

With four new identified studies, the review includes a total of eight studies (1283 participants, with data for 1181 participants available for analysis), which compared hydromorphone with oxycodone (four studies), morphine (three studies) or fentanyl (one study). All studies included adults with cancer pain, mean age ranged around 53 to 59 years and the proportion of men ranged from 42% to 67.4%. We judged all the studies at high risk of bias overall because they had at least one domain with high risk of bias. We found no studies including children. We did not complete a meta-analysis for the primary outcome of pain intensity due to skewed data and different comparators investigated across the studies (oxycodone, morphine and fentanyl). Comparison 1: hydromorphone compared with placebo We identified no studies comparing hydromorphone with placebo. Comparison 2: hydromorphone compared with oxycodone Participant-reported pain intensity We found no clear evidence of a difference in pain intensity (measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS)) in people treated with hydromorphone compared with those treated with oxycodone, but the evidence is very uncertain (3 RCTs, 381 participants, very low-certainty evidence). Participant-reported pain relief We found no studies reporting participant-reported pain relief. Specific adverse events We found no clear evidence of a difference in nausea (RR 1.13 95% CI 0.74 to 1.73; 3 RCTs, 622 participants), vomiting (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.94; 3 RCTs, 622 participants), dizziness (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.44; 2 RCTs, 441 participants) and constipation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.19; 622 participants) (all very low-certainty evidence) in people treated with hydromorphone compared with those treated with oxycodone, but the evidence is very uncertain. Quality of life We found no studies reporting quality of life. Comparison 3: hydromorphone compared with morphine Participant-reported pain intensity We found no clear evidence of a difference in pain intensity (measured using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) or VAS)) in people treated with hydromorphone compared with those treated with morphine, but the evidence is very uncertain (2 RCTs, 433 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Participant-reported pain relief We found no clear evidence of a difference in the number of clinically improved participants, defined by 50% or greater pain relief rate, in the hydromorphone group compared with the morphine group, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.18; 1 RCT, 233 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Specific adverse events At 24 days of treatment, morphine may reduce constipation compared with hydromorphone, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.17; 1 RCT, 200 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We found no clear evidence of a difference in nausea (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.30; 1 RCT, 200 participants), vomiting (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.31; 1 RCT, 200 participants) and dizziness (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.88; 1 RCT, 200 participants) (all very low-certainty evidence) in people treated with hydromorphone compared with those treated with morphine, but the evidence is very uncertain. Quality of life We found no studies reporting quality of life. Comparison 4: hydromorphone compared with fentanyl Participant-reported pain intensity We found no clear evidence of a difference in pain intensity (measured by numerical rating scale (NRS)) at 60 minutes in people treated with hydromorphone compared with those treated with fentanyl, but the evidence is very uncertain (1 RCT, 82 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Participant-reported pain relief We found no studies reporting participant-reported pain relief. Specific adverse events We found no studies reporting specific adverse events. Quality of life We found no studies reporting quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence of the benefits and harms of hydromorphone compared with other analgesics is very uncertain. The studies reported some adverse events, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness and constipation, but generally there was no clear evidence of a difference between hydromorphone and morphine, oxycodone or fentanyl for this outcome. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of hydromorphone for cancer pain in comparison with other analgesics on the reported outcomes. Further research with larger sample sizes and more comprehensive outcome data collection is required.

### Efficacy and safety of hydromorphone for cancer pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0f41ff77]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cancer pain significantly impacts individuals’ quality of life, with opioids being employed as the primary means for pain relief. Nevertheless, concerns persist regarding the adverse reactions and effectiveness of opioids such as morphine. Hydromorphone, recognized as a potent opioid, is a viable alternative for managing cancer-related pain. The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the effectiveness and safety characteristics of hydromorphone in comparison to other opioids, as well as different methods of administering this medication within the scope of cancer pain treatment.

Methods

The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched on December 25th, 2023. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic investigation of databases was carried out, and suitable studies were chosen according to predetermined criteria (PICO framework). The meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model.

Results

This review included 18 RCTs with 2271 patients who compared hydromorphone with morphine, oxycodone, or fentanyl, as well as other types of hydromorphone. Hydromorphone demonstrated efficacy similar to that of morphine and oxycodone in reducing cancer pain intensity, decreasing additional analgesic consumption, and improving quality of life. However, morphine showed slight superiority over hydromorphone in reducing breakthrough pain. Adverse events were comparable between hydromorphone and morphine or oxycodone. Patient-controlled and clinician-controlled hydromorphone administration routes yielded similar outcomes.

Conclusions

The outcomes of this study substantiate the efficacy of hydromorphone in the management of cancer-related pain, demonstrating similar levels of effectiveness and safety as morphine and oxycodone. These findings are consistent with prior comprehensive analyses, suggesting that hydromorphone is a feasible choice for alleviating cancer-associated pain. Additional investigations are warranted to determine its efficacy in distinct patient cohorts and for different modes of administration.

### A multiple-dose phase I study of intranasal hydromorphone hydrochloride in healthy volunteers [^a73852bd]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

We evaluated the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety of 1 and 2 mg of intranasal hydromorphone hydrochloride in an open-label, single- and multiple-dose study. This Phase I study was conducted in 24 healthy volunteers (13 men and 11 women). Intranasal doses were delivered as 0.1-mL metered-dose sprays into one or both nostrils for 1- and 2-mg doses, respectively. Venous blood samples were taken serially from 0 to 12 h after the first single dose and the last (seventh) multiple dose. Plasma hydromorphone concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. Noncompartmental analysis was used to estimate pharmacokinetic variables. After 7 intranasal doses of 1 and 2 mg (once every 6 h), mean +/- sd peak plasma concentrations of 2.8 +/- 0.7 ng/mL and 5.3 +/- 2.3 ng/mL, respectively, were observed. The median time to peak concentration was 20 min for both single and multiple doses. Dose proportionality was observed for the 1- and 2-mg doses. Adverse events included somnolence, dizziness, and bad taste after dose administration. Intranasal hydromorphone hydrochloride was well tolerated and demonstrated rapid nasal drug absorption and predictable accumulation. These results support clinical investigation of hydromorphone hydrochloride nasal spray for use as an alternative to oral and IM administration.

### A randomized, double-blind study of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets versus oxycodone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for cancer pain: efficacy and safety in Japanese cancer patients (EXHEAL: a phase III study of EXtended-release hydromorphonE for cAncer pain reLief) [^4d303c3a]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In Japan, there are limited options for switching opioid analgesics. Hydromorphone is an opioid analgesic that is routinely used instead of morphine for cancer pain; however, it is not yet available in Japan. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of hydromorphone (DS-7113b) extended-release tablets in opioid-naïve patients with cancer pain not relieved by non-opioid analgesics.

Subjects and methods

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial. A double-dummy method was used for blinding. Each randomized subject received either hydromorphone extended-release tablets plus placebo oxycodone hydrochloride extended-release tablets 4 mg/day (n=88) or placebo hydromorphone extended-release tablets plus oxycodone hydrochloride extended-release tablets 10 mg/day (n=93) orally for 7 days (once-daily dosing for hydromorphone and twice-daily dosing for oxycodone). The doses were adjusted as necessary. Efficacy was evaluated by change in visual analog scale (VAS) score from baseline to completion of treatment.

Results

The between-group difference in least squares mean changes in VAS score from baseline to completion or discontinuation of treatment was −0.4 mm (95% CI −5.9 to 5 mm) by analysis of covariance where the baseline VAS score was used as a covariate. The upper limit of the 95% CI was below 10 mm, which was predefined as the noninferiority limit. This verified the noninferiority of hydromorphone tablets relative to oxycodone tablets. The incidence of adverse events was 80.7% (71 of 88) in the hydromorphone group and 83.7% (77 of 93) in the oxycodone group. The most common adverse events were nausea, vomiting, somnolence, diarrhea, and constipation, most of which are commonly observed with opioid analgesics.

Conclusion

The efficacy and safety of hydromorphone extended-release tablets were equivalent to those of the oxycodone extended-release formulation.

### Randomized clinical trial of intravenous (IV) acetaminophen as an adjunct to IV hydromorphone for acute severe pain in emergency department patients [^2e1deab2]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

A fundamental challenge for emergency department (ED) clinicians is to relieve severe, acute pain while simultaneously avoiding adverse events associated with opioid analgesics. Because there is evidence that intravenous (IV) acetaminophen is an effective adjuvant analgesic in postoperative settings, we examined whether it also has a role in the ED.

Methods

This was a two-arm, double-blind randomized clinical trial. All patients received 1 mg of IV hydromorphone. Patients were then randomized to receive 1 g of IV acetaminophen or placebo. The primary outcome was the between-group difference in change in pain from baseline (before treatment) to 60 minutes after administration of study drugs, measured on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS).

Results

Of 828 patients screened, 162 were enrolled and 159 had the primary outcome. Patients allocated to acetaminophen + hydromorphone had a mean decline in pain from baseline to 60 minutes of 6.2 NRS units; those receiving placebo + hydromorphone had a mean decline of 5.4, a difference of 0.8 NRS units (95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.01 to 1.8). Two patients in each group received additional analgesics in the first 60 minutes of the study. At 120 minutes the NRS pain difference was 0.6 (95% CI = -0.4 to 1.6). A total of 26.9% of patients who received acetaminophen wanted more analgesia versus 37.7% of those given placebo (difference = -10.8%, 95% CI = -24.3% to 4.4%). The incidence of adverse effects was similar in both groups.

Conclusions

The addition of 1 g of IV acetaminophen to 1 mg of IV hydromorphone provided neither clinically meaningful nor statistically superior analgesia than hydromorphone alone.

### Efficacy and safety of hydromorphone for cancer pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^543fef7d]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this review substantiates the safety and efficacy of hydromorphone in the management of cancer pain. Evidence suggests that hydromorphone is similar to morphine and oxycodone in providing pain relief and increasing quality of life, although the studies conducted in this regard are heterogeneous. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that patients who consumed hydromorphone had similar additional analgesic consumption and rates of adverse events to those who consumed morphine and oxycodone. However, morphine appears to have a slight advantage over hydromorphone in suppressing breakthrough pain. Future studies are needed to increase the quality of evidence regarding hydromorphone use in cancer pain treatment and to explore aspects such as sustained-release administration and patient-controlled analgesia.

### A randomized, double-blind study of hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets versus oxycodone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for cancer pain: efficacy and safety in Japanese cancer patients (EXHEAL: a phase III study of EXtended-release hydromorphonE for cAncer pain reLief) [^2662f023]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pharmacotherapy for cancer pain is based on the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for cancer-pain relief released in 1986.The WHO’s three-step ladder for cancer-pain relief recommends the use of potent opioid analgesics for moderate–severe pain; indeed, these agents have been found to be the most effective treatment for cancer pain.At present, morphine, oxycodone, and fentanyl are mainly used in Japan as step 3 opioid analgesics.

The selective μ-opioid receptor-agonist analgesic hydromorphone is currently used clinically in 45 countries and regions in the world.It is the standard alternative to morphine,–but has not been developed for use in Japan. The metabolites of hydromorphone have been found to be inactive,making hydromorphone a potential treatment option for patients with reduced renal function as an alternative to morphine.Therefore, hydromorphone is expected to expand the treatment options for pain relief.

The efficacy and safety of hydromorphone has been assessed in clinical studies.During the development of hydromorphone in Japan, Daiichi Sankyo made a once-daily extended-release formulation.We conducted a Phase III randomized double-blind study to verify the noninferiority of hydromorphone extended-release tablets (DS-7113b; Daiichi Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan) to oxycodone hydrochloride extended-release tablets (Oxycontin; Shionogi, Osaka, Japan), with the objective of investigating the efficacy of the hydromorphone formulation in Japanese patients.

Long-acting/ER opioids—Oxymorphone ER tablets have the following dosing, titration, and safety guidance: they are “Available as 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 mg tablets for every 12 hr administration”; for opioid-naive patients, “Initiate at 5 mg every 12 hr,” and for opioid tolerant patients, “Convert current opioid to equianalgesic daily dose of oxycodone; reduce the calculated amount by 33–50% for initial daily start dose.” Titration guidance states “Dose change increments: May increase by 5 to 10 mg every 12 hr every 3 to 7 days,” and “Steady-state plasma levels are achieved after 3 days of multiple dose administration,” with administration instructions that “Oxymorphone ER tablets must be taken whole, one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth.” In special populations, “Elderly: Plasma drug levels are about 40% higher in elderly versus younger subjects; use caution, starting at the low end of dosing range and titrating slowly.” Other considerations include food and alcohol restrictions: “Must be taken on an empty stomach at least 1 hr before or 2 hr after a meal; food has been shown to increase peak levels of oxymorphone ER by 50%,” and “Must NOT be taken concomitantly with alcohol, which can cause highly variable effects on peak drug levels, ranging from a decrease of 50% to an increase of 270%.”

### Morphine and hydromorphone effects, side effects, and variability: a crossover study in human volunteers [^f7bad774]. Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Balancing between opioid analgesia and respiratory depression continues to challenge clinicians in perioperative, emergency department, and other acute care settings. Morphine and hydromorphone are postoperative analgesic standards. Nevertheless, their comparative effects and side effects, timing, and respective variabilities remain poorly understood. This study tested the hypothesis that IV morphine and hydromorphone differ in onset, magnitude, duration, and variability of analgesic and ventilatory effects.

Methods

The authors conducted a randomized crossover study in healthy volunteers. Forty-two subjects received a 2-h IV infusion of hydromorphone (0.05mg/kg) or morphine (0.2mg/kg) 1 to 2 weeks apart. The authors measured arterial opioid concentrations, analgesia in response to heat pain (maximally tolerated temperature, and verbal analog pain scores at discrete preset temperatures to determine half-maximum temperature effect), dark-adapted pupil diameter and miosis, end-expired carbon dioxide, and respiratory rate for 12h after dosing.

Results

For morphine and hydromorphone, respectively, maximum miosis was less (3.9 [3.4 to 4.2] vs. 4.6mm [4.0 to 5.0], P < 0.001; median and 25 to 75% quantiles) and occurred later (3.1±0.9 vs. 2.3±0.7h after infusion start, P < 0.001; mean ± SD); maximum tolerated temperature was less (49±2 vs. 50±2°C, P < 0.001); verbal pain scores at end-infusion at the most informative stimulus (48.2°C) were 82±4 and 59±3 (P < 0.001); maximum end-expired CO2 was 47 (45 to 50) and 48 mmHg (46 to 51; P = 0.007) and occurred later (5.5±2.8 vs. 3.0±1.5h after infusion start, P < 0.001); and respiratory nadir was 9±1 and 11±2 breaths/min (P < 0.001), and occurred at similar times. The area under the temperature tolerance-time curve was less for morphine (1.8 [0.0 to 4.4]) than hydromorphone (5.4°C-h [1.6 to 12.1] P < 0.001). Interindividual variability in clinical effects did not differ between opioids.

Conclusions

For morphine compared to hydromorphone, analgesia and analgesia relative to respiratory depression were less, onset of miosis and respiratory depression was later, and duration of respiratory depression was longer. For each opioid, timing of the various clinical effects was not coincident. Results may enable more rational opioid selection, and suggest hydromorphone may have a better clinical profile.

### Efficacy and safety of hydromorphone for cancer pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^78a630aa]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cancer pain significantly impacts individuals' quality of life, with opioids being employed as the primary means for pain relief. Nevertheless, concerns persist regarding the adverse reactions and effectiveness of opioids such as morphine. Hydromorphone, recognized as a potent opioid, is a viable alternative for managing cancer-related pain. The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the effectiveness and safety characteristics of hydromorphone in comparison to other opioids, as well as different methods of administering this medication within the scope of cancer pain treatment.

Methods

The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched on December 25th, 2023. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic investigation of databases was carried out, and suitable studies were chosen according to predetermined criteria (PICO framework). The meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model.

Results

This review included 18 RCTs with 2271 patients who compared hydromorphone with morphine, oxycodone, or fentanyl, as well as other types of hydromorphone. Hydromorphone demonstrated efficacy similar to that of morphine and oxycodone in reducing cancer pain intensity, decreasing additional analgesic consumption, and improving quality of life. However, morphine showed slight superiority over hydromorphone in reducing breakthrough pain. Adverse events were comparable between hydromorphone and morphine or oxycodone. Patient-controlled and clinician-controlled hydromorphone administration routes yielded similar outcomes.

Conclusions

The outcomes of this study substantiate the efficacy of hydromorphone in the management of cancer-related pain, demonstrating similar levels of effectiveness and safety as morphine and oxycodone. These findings are consistent with prior comprehensive analyses, suggesting that hydromorphone is a feasible choice for alleviating cancer-associated pain. Additional investigations are warranted to determine its efficacy in distinct patient cohorts and for different modes of administration.

### Multicenter, open-label, prospective evaluation of the conversion from previous opioid analgesics to extended-release hydromorphone hydrochloride administered every 24 hours to patients with persistent moderate to severe pain [^18dea2e6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Hydromorphone hydrochloride is a mu-opioid agonist with dose-dependent analgesic properties. Extended-release hydromorphone hydrochloride (ER hydromorphone HCl) capsules have been developed for administration every 24 hours.

Objectives

This prospective evaluation focused on the first (ie, conversion) phase of 2 identically designed, randomized, controlled studies that compared the safety and efficacy of once-daily ER hydromorphone HCl capsules with immediate-release hydromorphone hydrochloride (IR hydromorphone HCl) tablets administered 4 times daily in the treatment of persistent moderate to severe cancer- and noncancer-related pain.

Methods

Patients being treated with opioid analgesics for persistent moderate to severe pain were converted to ER hydromorphone HCl using an 8:1 conversion ratio. The dose was titrated to attain an average pain intensity (API) score < or = 4 on a 0- to 10-point numeric rating scale. Supplemental oral IR hydromorphone HCl tablets were used as rescue medication at a dose of one eighth to one sixth of the daily ER hydromorphone HCl dose.

Results

A total of 343 patients (272 [79%] with cancer pain; mean age, 57.8 years) were enrolled and converted to ER hydromorphone HCl from their previous opioids. About half (51%) were women. At baseline, the mean (SD) API score was 5.3 (2.1). Mean (SD) API scores were 4.7 (2.0) after the first 48 hours and 3.4 (2.1) by the end of titration. After 4 to 21 days of titration, 239 (70%) patients reached stabilization defined as a > or = 48-hour period with an API score of < or =4, unchanged ER hydromorphone HCl dose, and < or = 2 rescue doses per day. The stabilized patients had mean (SD) API scores of 2.7 (1.1) at the end of titration. At stabilization, 102 (43%) of 239 patients remained at their initial conversion dose, 129 (54%) had a dose increase, and 8 (3%) had a dose decrease. Frequent (> or =10% of patients) adverse events that occurred within the first 48 hours after conversion and during the entire titration phase were nausea, somnolence, headache, constipation, vomiting, and dizziness.

Conclusion

In this prospective evaluation of the conversion and titration phase of 2 randomized, controlled studies, a conversion ratio of 8:1 mg of oral morphine to oral ER hydromorphone HCl was found to be clinically useful in patients with persistent moderate to severe cancer-related or noncancer-related pain.

### Efficacy of opioid rotation to continuous parenteral hydromorphone in advanced cancer patients failing on other opioids [^9c2fab49]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pain is a serious problem in patients with advanced solid cancer. Two thirds of these patients experience pain of whom 20% grade their pain as moderate to severe. The World Health Organization set up guidelines for treating chronic cancer pain up to high doses of around-the-clock opioids, striving for an acceptable pain control for the majority of cancer patients. However, despite following these guidelines accurately, 10–30% of patients do not achieve adequate pain relief, mainly because of uncontrolled side effects restraining them from further dose increment. For these patients, an opioid rotation, a change in opioid or route of administration has been shown to be beneficial in several studies. Parenteral administration of opioids (here defined as subcutaneous or intravenous) is especially useful for rapid titration in case of severe pain, but it is also indicated for patients with pain in whom dose escalations are needed to doses that are no longer convenient for oral use. When high doses of opioids are indicated, potent opioids that can still be delivered in small volumes are necessary, especially when subcutaneous administration is desirable. When parenteral treatment fails, more invasive techniques like epidural and intrathecal opioid treatment are possible, although these techniques are more expensive and hazardous.

Hydromorphone is a semisynthetic derivate of morphine, with comparable efficacy and side effects to morphine when administrated subcutaneously in low concentrations. Since hydromorphone is more lipophilic than other opioids, it can be administrated subcutaneously in highly concentrated solutions, making it particularly useful for subcutaneous administration when high doses of opioids are needed. Based on this knowledge, it can be hypothesized that in case of inadequate pain control and/or uncontrolled side effects in patients who already use opioids in high doses for moderate to severe pain, rotating from a certain opioid to parenteral hydromorphone might be a useful alternative. In practice, this situation will especially occur in cancer patients with progressive disease for whom antitumor therapy is no longer available and life expectancy, therefore, is limited. These patients are also often treated with earlier opioid rotations in an effort to treat pain with tolerable side effects. However, data on the effect of parenteral hydromorphone in such patients are lacking.

We therefore performed a descriptive, retrospective study in extensively pretreated advanced cancer patients with inadequate pain control or uncontrolled side effects on the current opioids who were rotated to parenteral hydromorphone. The objective of this study was to investigate the analgesic efficacy and side effects of opioid rotation to parenteral hydromorphone, continuously administrated, on serious cancer-related pain among this patient population.

### Efficacy and safety of hydromorphone for cancer pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7de0f362]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cancer is associated with chronic pain that has deliberating effects on patients’ lives. Approximately 44.5% of cancer patients experience pain, 30.6% of whom report pain that is moderate to severe. The impact of pain on patient treatment adherence, survival rate, and quality of life has been substantiated. Opioids serve as the primary pain relievers for managing cancer-related pain. In regard to this topic, morphine is the most widely discussed opioid. Nevertheless, morphine is linked to various issues, such as the risk of overdose, respiratory depression, and breakthrough pain. breakthrough pain refers to an abrupt escalation of pain in individuals with chronic pain managed by analgesics. Other options for the management of cancer-related pain include fentanyl, oxycodone, and hydromorphone.

Hydromorphone is a semisynthetic selective µ-opioid receptor agonist that was initially synthesized in Germany in 1921 and became a part of clinical practice by 1926. It constitutes a powerful pharmaceutical opioid for treating acute pain of a moderate-to-severe nature as well as chronic pain of severe intensity in patients. Compared with orally administered morphine, orally administered hydromorphone is 5 times more potent but has a similar side effect profile and stronger lipid solubility. Multiple recent clinical trials have focused on the utilization of hydromorphone for the management of cancer-related pain, as well as exploring various methods of administering this medication, making it crucial to thoroughly examine this topic systematically.

We aimed to systematically review the literature to synthesize evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of hydromorphone for reducing cancer pain. To do so, we compared the intensity of cancer pain, rate of seeking additional analgesics, number of episodes of breakthrough pain, and quality of life between the hydromorphone arm and comparison arm, which included the morphine, oxycodone, and fentanyl arms. We further examined various forms of hydromorphone, such as patient-controlled and clinician-controlled therapy, sustained-release and immediate-release therapy, and subcutaneous and intravenous therapy.

### Pharmacodynamics of orally administered sustained-release hydromorphone in humans [^1f31d2b5]. Anesthesiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The disposition kinetics of hydromorphone generally necessitates oral administration every 4 h of the conventional immediate-release tablet to provide sustained pain relief. This trial examined time course and magnitude of analgesia to experimental pain after administration of sustained-release hydromorphone as compared with that after immediate-release hydromorphone or placebo.

Methods

Using a 4 x 4 Latin square double-blind design, 12 subjects were randomized to receive a single dose of 8, 16, and 32 mg sustained-release hydromorphone and placebo. The same subjects had received 8 mg immediate-release hydromorphone before this study. Using an electrical experimental pain paradigm, analgesic effects were assessed for up to 30 h after administration, and venous hydromorphone plasma concentrations were measured at corresponding times.

Results

The hydromorphone plasma concentration peaked significantly later (12.0 h [12.0--18.0] vs. 0.8 h [0.8--1.0]; median and interquartile range) but was maintained significantly longer at greater than 50% of peak concentration (22.7 +/- 8.2 h vs. 1.1 +/- 0.7 h; mean +/- SD) after sustained-release than after immediate-release hydromorphone. Similarly, sustained-release hydromorphone produced analgesic effects that peaked significantly later (9.0 h [9.0--12.0] vs. 1.5 h [1.0--2.0]) but were maintained significantly longer at greater than 50% of peak analgesic effect (13.3 +/- 6.3 h vs. 3.6 +/- 1.7 h). A statistically significant linear relation between the hydromorphone plasma concentration and the analgesic effect on painful stimuli existed.

Conclusion

A single oral dose of a new sustained-release formulation of hydromorphone provided analgesia to experimental pain beyond 24 h of its administration.

### Oral oxymorphone for pain management [^27b0791f]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the pharmacology, safety and efficacy, and rationale for use of oral oxymorphone for the management of acute and chronic moderate-to-severe pain.

Data Sources

A PubMed/MEDLINE search (1966-March 2007) was conducted using the following terms: oral oxymorphone, oxymorphone, EN 3202, EN 3203, Opana, and Opana ER. Manufacturer-provided data (package inserts) and abstracts presented at the American Pain Society meetings (2003-2006) were also reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Human studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral oxymorphone in pain management were considered; animal and non-English-language data were excluded.

Data Synthesis

Oral oxymorphone is a semisynthetic opioid agonist that is specific for the mu-opioid receptor and approved to treat both acute and chronic pain. Unlike other opioids, such as oxycodone, oxymorphone does not bind to the kappa-opioid receptor. Due to extensive liver metabolism, oral oxymorphone is contraindicated in patients with moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment; however, no clinically significant CYP3A4, 2C9, or 2D6 mediated drug-drug interactions have been noted. Elderly patients may experience a 40% increase in plasma concentrations, while renally impaired patients may have a 57-65% increase in bioavailability. Food can increase the rate of absorption by as much as 50%, necessitating dosing either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. Oxymorphone's primary adverse effects are similar to those of other opioids: nausea, vomiting, pruritus, pyrexia, and constipation.

Conclusions

Oxymorphone is an oral therapeutic option approved for the treatment of acute and chronic moderate-to-severe pain. Oxymorphone has a safety and efficacy profile similar to that of other commonly used pure opioids (morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone). Like oxycodone and morphine, oxymorphone also has immediate-release and extended-release formulations. Since cost alone is not yet favorable for oxymorphone over oxycodone or morphine, further studies of comparative efficacy targeting potential advantages of oxymorphone over other opioids are necessary before considering it for addition to a formulary.

### 2017 HIVMA of IDSA clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic pain in patients living with HIV [^dcab7f45]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Buprenorphine for chronic pain in persons with opioid use disorder—formulations, dosing, and adjunct strategies are described as follows: Buprenorphine is available as a sublingual tablet, sublingual film, and 6-month implant that are approved for the treatment of opioid use disorders; a transdermal patch is approved for the treatment of chronic pain. The tablet or film can be prescribed off label in split doses (ie, every 6–8 hours) for the treatment of pain; however, the buprenorphine patch cannot be prescribed off label for the treatment of opioid use disorder. Walsh and colleagues examined doses of buprenorphine up to 70 times the normal analgesic doses and verified the ceiling effect of buprenorphine on the respiratory depression. Malinoff and colleagues enrolled 95 individuals with chronic noncancer pain and transferred them to daily sublingual buprenorphine ranging from 4 to 16 mg (mean 8 mg) in divided doses; the mean duration of treatment was 8.8 months. For management of chronic pain in persons on buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid use disorder, clinicians might consider switching from buprenorphine/naloxone to buprenorphine transdermal alone; The sublingual formulation has a 90% first-pass hepatic metabolism, and a transdermal patch bypasses hepatic metabolism. In a systematic review of buprenorphine vs transdermal fentanyl and morphine for chronic pain, it was found that buprenorphine provided comparable pain relief with fewer adverse events. Because buprenorphine does not occupy all opioid receptors, other opioids can be given when pain is acute; High-potency opioids such as fentanyl or hydromorphone should be considered when the addition of nonpharmacologic treatments and nonopioid pharmacotherapies are ineffective, and If the maximum dose of transdermal buprenorphine is reached, consideration should be given to adding or replacing it with an additional long-acting potent opioid such as fentanyl, morphine, or hydromorphone.

Morphine milligram equivalent (MME) conversion factors—commonly prescribed full opioid receptor agonists include: Codeine 0.15, Tapentadol 0.4, Morphine 1, Hydrocodone 1, Oxycodone 1.5, Oxymorphone 3, and Hydromorphone 4. For tapentadol, the conversion factor estimate is based upon μ-receptor agonist activity in animal models where tapentadol has been shown to be 2-3 times less potent than morphine.
