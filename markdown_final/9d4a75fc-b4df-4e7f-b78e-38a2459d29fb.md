## Question

Albuterol to treat achalasia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether albuterol has any role or indication in the treatment of achalasia and what the evidence shows. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about albuterol's pharmacology and FDA-labeled indications. Then, I should review guideline-endorsed therapies for achalasia and where pharmacologic options fit. Next, I will check whether beta-agonists, specifically albuterol, appear in any achalasia guidelines or mechanistic discussions of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation. After that, I will verify whether any look-alike medications could be causing confusion. Finally, I will synthesize a conclusion and a practical recommendation based on authoritative sources.

> Let me first confirm the basics about albuterol. Albuterol is a short-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonist indicated for relief of bronchospasm in reversible obstructive airway disease; its labeling and safety profile are entirely pulmonary and cardiovascular focused, with no gastrointestinal or esophageal motility indications described [^113StQ7S] [^114e1U9x] [^112QYRBD] [^115v5V7k] [^112TA2E7] [^111pe1ig].

> Next, I should review what constitutes standard therapy for achalasia. Hold on, I need to ensure I'm aligned with current guidelines: definitive therapies are mechanical disruption or myotomy of the LES via pneumatic dilation, laparoscopic Heller myotomy, or peroral endoscopic myotomy, with botulinum toxin generally reserved for poor procedural candidates, and these are consistently recommended across major society guidelines [^116oGPr2] [^1148VRvK] [^113TDFvR].

> Now, let me consider the place of "medical therapy" in achalasia. Initially, I thought oral smooth muscle relaxants like nitrates and calcium channel blockers can be used as temporizing measures in patients who are unwilling or unable to undergo definitive therapy, acknowledging their limited and short-lived benefit with frequent side effects [^1165ALjE] [^116dQQve]. Wait, let me verify that against more recent consensus statements: the ISDE 2018 guideline actually recommends avoiding nitrates, calcium channel blockers, or phosphodiesterase inhibitors for symptomatic relief in achalasia, which is a stricter stance than older guidance, so I should reconcile this by noting that even where pharmacologic therapy is mentioned, it is weak, short-term, and not preferred, and practice has moved away from it [^112koofC] [^113TDFvR].

> I will now examine whether there is any mechanistic rationale to use a beta-2 agonist like albuterol for LES relaxation. The pharmacologic agents historically discussed for achalasia reduce LES pressure via nitric oxide–mediated smooth muscle relaxation or calcium channel blockade; beta-agonists do not appear among agents shown to lower LES pressure or improve esophageal emptying in achalasia, and no guideline mechanistic section lists beta-agonism as relevant to LES physiology in this disease [^116dQQve] [^116oGPr2] [^114q9iEF] [^113TDFvR].

> Hold on, I should verify whether albuterol is mentioned anywhere in the achalasia guidance corpus provided. I need to check across ASGE, ACG, ESGE, ISDE, and systematic reviews, and there are zero mentions of albuterol as a treatment option or adjunct in achalasia, which strongly suggests no endorsed role for beta-agonists in this setting [^116oGPr2] [^114q9iEF] [^1148VRvK] [^113TDFvR] [^111smjq2] [^116ySYLY].

> But wait, what if there's confusion with similarly named or commonly discussed drugs in esophageal care. Let me double-check a frequent pitfall: bisphosphonates like alendronate and ibandronate are actually contraindicated in achalasia due to esophageal injury risk and delayed emptying, which is the opposite of a treatment and might be the source of confusion in some medication lists, but this has nothing to do with albuterol or beta-agonists [^1117Ag3f] [^116S1Adt].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also consider safety if someone were to contemplate off-label use. Albuterol carries sympathomimetic risks including tachycardia, hypokalemia, and potential drug interactions with beta-blockers and non–potassium-sparing diuretics; without any evidence of LES benefit, exposing patients with achalasia to these risks would not be justified clinically [^115v5V7k] [^112QYRBD] [^112TA2E7].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure my conclusion is consistent with both mechanism and guidance. There is no mechanistic rationale or evidence base supporting beta-2 agonists for LES relaxation or esophageal motility in achalasia, albuterol is absent from all major guidelines, and definitive management relies on PD, LHM, or POEM, with botulinum toxin or limited pharmacologic agents reserved only for select non-procedural candidates in older guidance and discouraged in more recent consensus, so albuterol is not indicated for the treatment of achalasia [^116oGPr2] [^114q9iEF] [^113TDFvR] [^112koofC] [^114e1U9x].

> Clinically, I should double-check that the patient is routed toward guideline-concordant care: confirm the diagnosis with high-resolution manometry if not already done, discuss PD, LHM, or POEM based on subtype, expertise, and preference, and avoid off-label albuterol use for achalasia as it lacks efficacy and carries unnecessary risk [^114q9iEF] [^116oGPr2] [^113sdykr].

---

No, albuterol is **not recommended** for achalasia because it does not address the core problem of impaired LES relaxation and absent peristalsis [^114q9iEF]. It is not included in any guideline for achalasia management [^113TDFvR] [^116oGPr2], and there is **no evidence supporting its use** for this indication [^111TKFMX]. Definitive therapies such as POEM, Heller myotomy, or pneumatic dilation are preferred [^116ySYLY] [^111cYtAq], with botulinum toxin or oral smooth muscle relaxants reserved for patients unfit for invasive procedures [^114MyN9t] [^1165ALjE].

---

## Pharmacological rationale and mechanism of action

Albuterol is a selective beta-2 adrenergic agonist that relaxes bronchial smooth muscle via cAMP-mediated pathways. The LES is primarily regulated by nitrergic and cholinergic neurons, and beta-2 agonists have minimal effect on LES tone or esophageal peristalsis. Therefore, albuterol **does not address the core pathophysiology** of achalasia.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **no clinical evidence or guideline support** for albuterol in achalasia [^114q9iEF]. Major guidelines (ASGE, ACG, ISDE) do not mention albuterol for achalasia management [^116oGPr2] [^114q9iEF] [^113TDFvR]. Pharmacologic therapy is limited to nitrates or calcium channel blockers for patients unfit for definitive therapy [^1165ALjE] [^11256H16].

---

## Comparative effectiveness with standard treatments

Albuterol has **no demonstrated efficacy** in achalasia and is not recommended [^114q9iEF]. In contrast, standard therapies have robust evidence:

- **POEM**: Effective across subtypes, especially type III [^114YmRiS].
- **Laparoscopic Heller myotomy**: Effective for types I and II [^1148VRvK].
- **Pneumatic dilation**: Effective for types I and II [^113iU4uf].
- **Botulinum toxin**: For patients unfit for definitive therapy [^114MyN9t] [^11256H16].

---

## Safety considerations and contraindications

Albuterol **can cause tremor, tachycardia, palpitations, and hypokalemia**, and is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to albuterol or its components [^111pe1ig]. These risks are unjustified given the lack of benefit in achalasia.

---

## Current clinical recommendations

Albuterol is **not recommended** for achalasia [^114q9iEF]. Definitive therapies (POEM, Heller myotomy, pneumatic dilation) are preferred, with botulinum toxin or oral smooth muscle relaxants reserved for patients unfit for invasive procedures [^1174FuLs] [^114MyN9t] [^1165ALjE]. These recommendations reflect that albuterol does not address the core pathophysiology, lacks evidence of benefit, and is not included in any guideline, while definitive therapies remain the standard of care [^116ySYLY].

### Treatment and surveillance strategies in achalasia: an update [^115mAhee]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Controversy exists with regard to the optimal treatment for achalasia and whether surveillance for early recognition of late complications is indicated. Currently, surgical myotomy and pneumatic dilation are the most effective treatments for patients with idiopathic achalasia, and a multicenter, randomized, international trial has confirmed similar efficacy of these treatments, at least in the short term. Clinical predictors of outcome, patient preferences, and local expertise should be considered when making a decision on the most appropriate treatment option.

Owing to a lack of long-term benefit, endoscopic botulinum toxin injection and medical therapies are reserved for patients of advanced age and those with clinically significant comorbidities. The value of new endoscopic, radiologic, or surgical treatments, such as peroral endoscopic myotomy, esophageal stenting, and robotic-assisted myotomy, has not been fully established. Finally, long-term follow-up data in patients with achalasia support the notion that surveillance strategies might be beneficial following a disease duration of more than 10–15 years.

### Fosamax [^1117Ag3f]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Fosamax is contraindicated in patients with the following conditions:

- **Esophageal abnormalities**: Conditions that delay esophageal emptying, such as stricture or achalasia, are contraindications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
- **Mobility restrictions**: Patients unable to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes are not suitable for Fosamax treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.6); Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
- **Risk of aspiration**: Do not administer Fosamax oral solution to patients at increased risk of aspiration.
- **Hypocalcemia**: Patients with hypocalcemia should not use Fosamax [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Individuals with a known hypersensitivity to any component of Fosamax, including those who have experienced urticaria and angioedema, should not use this product [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Please consult the full prescribing information for additional details and also consider the specific warnings and precautions associated with each contraindication noted.

### Ventolin HFA [^115v5V7k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Other short-acting sympathomimetic aerosol bronchodilators should not be used concomitantly with albuterol. If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution to avoid deleterious cardiovascular effects.

- **Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents**: Beta-blockers not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as Ventolin HFA, but may also produce severe bronchospasm in patients with asthma. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents for these patients; cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.

- **Non–potassium-sparing diuretics**: The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non–potassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of Ventolin HFA with non–potassium-sparing diuretics.

- **Digoxin**: Mean decreases of 16% to 22% in serum digoxin levels were demonstrated after single-dose intravenous and oral administration of albuterol, respectively, to normal volunteers who had received digoxin for 10 days. The clinical relevance of these findings for patients with obstructive airway disease who are receiving concurrent digoxin therapy should be considered.

### Advances in the management of oesophageal motility disorders in the era of high-resolution manometry: a focus on achalasia syndromes [^115Kq1Dw]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Advances in high-resolution manometry have significantly impacted the management of oesophageal motility disorders, with a specific focus on achalasia syndromes. The precise diagnostics possible with this technology have allowed for more tailored treatment approaches. Clinical trials have demonstrated the benefits of these new management strategies, enhancing patient outcomes and providing clearer clinical guidelines.

Recent studies have highlighted several key advancements:

- **Improved diagnostics**: High-resolution manometry has increased the accuracy of diagnosing various motility disorders, particularly achalasia. The technology's detailed pressure profiles enable precise identification of specific disorder types within the spectrum of achalasia syndromes.

- **Therapeutic interventions**: The progressive understanding of motility disorders has fueled the development of innovative therapeutic interventions such as peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) and the application of pneumatic dilation in more targeted patient groups.

- **Long-term outcomes**: Research has shown that these advancements not only improve immediate patient management but also contribute to better long-term outcomes by reducing symptoms and improving the quality of life.

Overall, the evolution of management strategies in oesophageal motility disorders, driven by high-resolution manometry, underscores the critical role of technological advancements in enhancing clinical practice. These improvements, supported by robust clinical evidence, establish a foundation for future innovations in the field.

### Albuterol [^114e1U9x]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The following dosages of albuterol tablets are expressed in terms of albuterol base.

- **Usual dosage**:

	- **Adults and children over 12 years of age**: The usual starting dosage for adults and children 12 years and older is 2 or 4 mg three or four times a day.

	- **Children 6 to 12 years of age**: The usual starting dosage for children 6 to 12 years of age is 2 mg three or four times a day.

- **Dosage adjustment**:

	- **Adults and children over 12 years of age**: For adults and children 12 years and older, a dosage above 4 mg four times a day should be used only when the patient fails to respond. If a favorable response does not occur with the 4 mg initial dosage, it should be cautiously increased stepwise up to a maximum of 8 mg four times a day as tolerated.

	- **Children 6 to 12 years of age who fail to respond to the initial starting dosage of 2 mg four times a day**: For children from 6 to 12 years of age who fail to respond to the initial starting dosage of 2 mg four times a day, the dosage may be cautiously increased stepwise, but not to exceed 24 mg/day (given in divided doses).

	- **Elderly patients and those sensitive to beta-adrenergic stimulators**: An initial dosage of 2 mg three or four times a day is recommended for elderly patients and for those with a history of unusual sensitivity to beta-adrenergic stimulators. If adequate bronchodilation is not obtained, the dosage may be increased gradually to as much as 8 mg three or four times a day.

The total daily dose should not exceed 32 mg in adults and children 12 years and older.

In conclusion, the choice of treatment for achalasia is multifactorial, and a "one size fits all" approach is not appropriate. All treatments and all patients have various aspects that need to be examined thoroughly before opting for one treatment rather than another. A center specializing in achalasia should have all possible techniques in its armamentarium so that it can choose the most appropriate treatment for a given patient.

### Comparative efficacy of first-line therapeutic interventions for achalasia: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112gXqjm]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Low credibility.

There are certain limitations related to both the network meta-analysis and individual studies, which merit further discussion. The studies had a short duration of follow-up, and the primary outcome of this network meta-analysis was focused on short-term (1-year) success. Limited post-intervention follow-up prevents the ability to understand long-term comparative efficacy between interventions, which is critical for a chronic disease. There was also a paucity of direct head-to-head comparative trials, particularly comparing POEM to the other treatments.

Further, performance and detection bias related to the non-blinded design of included trials introduced significant risk of bias. Performance and detection bias are not easily avoidable in RCTs testing new devices or techniques in surgery or endoscopy, given the nature of the intervention under study. This represents a limitation, especially when considering subjective outcomes such as improvement of symptoms in patients with achalasia. Assessment of vital physiologic outcomes by blinded readers can overcome limitations related to blinding in these trials; however, these outcomes were infrequently and/or inconsistently reported in trials data, which limits the ability to compare post-treatment physiologic efficacy. Similarly, treatment-related adverse events were poorly reported, and a thorough assessment of the risk–benefit profile could not be performed. Finally, inherent to network meta-analyses is the risk of misinterpretation due to conceptual heterogeneity related to differences in participants and interventions.

### Impact of high-resolution manometry on achalasia diagnosis and treatment [^115CHVeD]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

High-resolution esophageal pressure topography (HREPT) is more sensitive, provides more detailed information, and is easier to perform than conventional manometry (CM). Standardization is improved by analysis algorithms, known as the Chicago classification, which has increased the early recognition of achalasia. The identification of the three clinical subtypes of achalasia has achieved a clinically relevant impact by predicting treatment and disease outcomes. Furthermore, the implementation of different phenotypes of achalasia has increased our pathophysiologic understanding of the disease. This knowledge has the potential to lead to individualized management of the disease and improve outcomes for patients with achalasia.

### Comparative efficacy of first-line therapeutic interventions for achalasia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116Hezgb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Several interventions with variable efficacy are available as first-line therapy for patients with achalasia. We assessed the comparative efficacy of different strategies for the management of achalasia through a network meta-analysis combining direct and indirect treatment comparisons.

- **Methods**: We identified six randomized controlled trials in adults with achalasia that compared the efficacy of pneumatic dilation (PD; n = 260), laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM; n = 309), and peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM; n = 176). The primary efficacy outcome was 1-year treatment success, defined as patient-reported improvement in symptoms based on validated scores. Secondary efficacy outcomes were 2-year treatment success and physiologic improvement. Safety outcomes included the risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), severe erosive esophagitis, and procedure-related serious adverse events. We performed pairwise and network meta-analyses for all treatments, using GRADE criteria to appraise the quality of evidence.

- **Results**: Low-quality evidence, based primarily on direct evidence, supports the use of POEM (RR [risk ratio], 1.29; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.99–1.69) and LHM (RR, 1.18 [0.96–1.44]) over PD for treatment success at 1 year. No significant difference was observed between LHM and POEM (RR 1.09 [0.86–1.39]). The incidence of severe esophagitis after POEM, LHM, and PD was 5.3%, 3.7%, and 1.5%, respectively. Procedure-related serious adverse event rates after POEM, LHM, and PD were 1.4%, 6.7%, and 4.2%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: POEM and LHM have comparable efficacy and may improve outcomes for patients with achalasia.

### Impact of high-resolution manometry on achalasia diagnosis and treatment [^1146t8HP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The classification of achalasia has evolved with the introduction of high-resolution esophageal pressure topography (HREPT). Different achalasia subtypes have been described, all of which are associated with abnormal esophagogastric junction (EGJ) relaxation and are categorized based on the pattern of esophageal body contraction and pressurization. Thus, by HREPT, achalasia can be subtyped into classic achalasia (with no esophageal pressurization by swallowing), achalasia with esophageal pressurization (characterized by compression of the water bolus between the upper and lower esophageal sphincter), and spastic achalasia (characterized by nonpropulsive, high-amplitude contractions in the esophageal body). The impact of this new classification system on the clinical management of achalasia will be described below.

- **Differential diagnosis of abnormal LES relaxation**: HREPT studies demonstrated a population of patients with impaired lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation with remaining peristaltic activity of the tubular esophagus that fails to meet diagnostic criteria of achalasia, similar to those with 'atypical disorders of LES relaxation' in conventional manometry (CM). This disorder was called functional obstruction in the first Chicago classification schemes. Further on, it was demonstrated that these patients had an elevated intrabolus pressure, similar to patients with a known mechanical obstruction, and therefore it is now categorized as EGJ outflow obstruction.

### Binosto [^1161nixU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Binosto is contraindicated in patients with the following conditions:

- **Abnormalities of the esophagus**: Conditions which delay esophageal emptying, such as stricture or achalasia, are contraindications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
- **Inability to stand or sit upright**: Patients who cannot remain upright for at least 30 minutes should not use Binosto [see Dosage and Administration (2.3); Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. This adds risk of aspiration.
- **Hypocalcemia**: Patients with hypocalcemia should not receive Binosto [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
- **Hypersensitivity**: Reactions including urticaria and angioedema to any component of this product have been reported. Thus, hypersensitivity to any component is a contraindication [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

### Modern management of achalasia [^1133dRwJ]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Achalasia is a chronic esophageal motility disorder characterized by incomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation and aperistalsis, resulting in delayed esophageal emptying. Management is aimed at palliation of symptoms and improvement in quality of life. Multiple factors, including demographics, severity of disease, and existing comorbidities, influence management options.

- **Recent findings**: Given its low rates of complications, surgical myotomy has become the preferred primary treatment, particularly in young males. However, recent studies describing favorable long-term outcomes for pneumatic dilation make this a reasonable option to consider as first-line therapy for achalasia.

- **Summary**: Pneumatic dilation and surgical myotomy are the most effective therapeutic options for achalasia. Depending on local expertise, either option is acceptable as first-line therapy. There continues to be a limited role for other treatment modalities, such as pharmacologic agents and botulinum toxin, in certain patient populations.

### Achalasia: Current therapeutic options [^111TKFMX]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). High credibility.

Achalasia is an esophageal motor disorder characterized by impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and absent peristalsis in the smooth muscle esophageal body. As a result, patients typically experience dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain, and weight loss. Over the past 10–15 years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the evaluation of therapies for achalasia. Unfortunately, little progress in the development of effective pharmacological treatments has been made.

Botulinum toxin injection provides some relief of symptoms in many patients but requires periodic reinjection that may provide progressively less benefit over time. There are now three well-established, safe, and effective therapies for the treatment of achalasia: pneumatic dilation (PD), laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM), and peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM), which can lead to marked symptom improvement in most patients. Each treatment has a specific constellation of risks, benefits, and recurrence rate. The first-line treatment used will depend on patient preference, achalasia subtype, and local expertise.

The recent impressive advances in both the art and science of achalasia therapy are explored with a comprehensive review of the various treatment modalities and comparative controlled clinical trials. In addition, key technical pearls of the procedural treatments are demonstrated.

### ACG clinical guideline: Diagnosis and management of achalasia [^113SCH62]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for achalasia, specifically in the context of barium esophagram, the ACG 2013 guidelines recommend obtaining a timed barium esophagram to assess esophageal emptying and esophagogastric junction morphology in patients with equivocal results on esophageal manometry.

### Idiopathic (primary) achalasia: A review [^111mdiRM]. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on achalasia:

- **Definition**: Achalasia is an esophageal motility disorder defined by loss of esophageal peristalsis and incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter.

- **Pathophysiology**: Proposed causes of achalasia include GEJ obstruction, neuronal degeneration, viral infection, genetic inheritance, and autoimmune disease.

- **Disease course**: Inflammatory neurodegenerative insult with possible viral involvement within the esophagus results in achalasia, which causes the clinical manifestation of progressive dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain, heartburn, nocturnal cough, aspiration, and weight loss. The progression of the disease may result in aspiration pneumonia, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal cancer.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Achalasia is not associated with an increase in mortality.

---

### Albuterol [^112QYRBD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: The concomitant use of albuterol and other oral sympathomimetic agents is not recommended since such combined use may lead to deleterious cardiovascular effects. This recommendation does not preclude the judicious use of an aerosol bronchodilator of the adrenergic stimulant type in patients receiving albuterol; however, such concomitant use should be individualized and not given on a routine basis. If regular coadministration is required, alternative therapy should be considered.

- **Monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants**: Albuterol should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within two weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of albuterol on the vascular system may be potentiated.

- **Beta-blockers**: Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as albuterol, but may also produce severe bronchospasm in asthmatic patients. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, such as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with asthma. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.

- **Diuretics**: The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium-sparing diuretics, such as loop or thiazide diuretics, can be acut.

---

### ACG clinical guideline: Diagnosis and management of achalasia [^116ewSDb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

Achalasia is a primary motor disorder of the esophagus characterized by insufficient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation and loss of esophageal peristalsis. This condition results in patients' complaints of dysphagia to solids and liquids, regurgitation, and occasional chest pain with or without weight loss.

- **Endoscopic findings**: Retained saliva with a puckered gastroesophageal junction or a barium swallow showing a dilated esophagus with bird's beaking in a symptomatic patient should prompt appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

In this ACG guideline, the authors present an evidence-based approach for patients with achalasia based on a comprehensive review of the pertinent evidence and examination of relevant published data.

### Management strategies for achalasia [^112hDUqm]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment options for achalasia include oral pharmacologic therapy, endoscopic injection of botulinum toxin, pneumatic dilation, and myotomy (conventionally by laparoscopy, but more recently by an endoscopic approach). Oral pharmacologic agents have fallen out of use because of insufficient efficacy and frequent side effects. Endoscopic injection of botulinum toxin is safe and has good short-term effectiveness, but as the effect invariably wears off following a few months, this treatment is reserved for patients who are not candidates for more definitive treatments. Pneumatic dilation and surgical myotomy are currently considered the most effective treatments, with similar effectiveness in randomized controlled trials with follow-up of up to 2 years.

The risk/benefit ratio and choice of therapy depend on patient characteristics (age, comorbidities, disease stage, prior treatments), patient's preference, and locally available expertise. Treatment of patients who fail or relapse after initial therapy is challenging, and the success rate of pneumatic dilation or myotomy in this group is lower compared with previously untreated patients. The recently developed peroral endoscopic approach to myotomy has achieved excellent results in early uncontrolled studies, but high-quality randomized trials are needed to ensure widespread adoption is reasonable. Finally, retrospective data suggest that achalasia subtypes as defined by high-resolution esophageal pressure topography may guide treatment choice, but confirmation in prospective outcome studies is awaited.

### Expert consensus document: Advances in the management of oesophageal motility disorders in the era of high-resolution manometry: a focus on achalasia syndromes [^113iVr4V]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). High credibility.

High-resolution manometry (HRM) and new analysis algorithms, summarized in the Chicago Classification, have led to a restructured classification of oesophageal motility disorders. This advance has resulted in increased detection of clinically relevant disorders, particularly achalasia. It has become apparent that the cardinal feature of achalasia — impaired lower oesophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation — can occur in several disease phenotypes: without peristalsis (type I), with pan-oesophageal pressurization (type II), with premature (spastic) distal oesophageal contractions (type III), or with preserved peristalsis (outlet obstruction).

Furthermore, no manometric pattern is perfectly sensitive or specific for achalasia caused by a myenteric plexopathy, and there is no biomarker for this pathology. Consequently, physiological testing reveals other syndromes not meeting achalasia criteria that also benefit from therapies formerly reserved for achalasia. These findings have become particularly relevant with the development of a minimally invasive technique for performing a long oesophageal myotomy, the per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM).

Optimal management is to render treatment in a phenotype-specific manner; that is, POEM calibrated to patient-specific physiology for spastic achalasia and the spastic disorders, and more conservative strategies such as pneumatic dilation for the disorders limited to the LES. This Consensus Statement examines the effect of HRM on our understanding of oesophageal motility disorders, with a focus on the diagnosis, epidemiology, and management of achalasia.

### The 2018 ISDE achalasia guidelines [^1122Z3Eb]. Diseases of the Esophagus (2018). High credibility.

The diagnostic criteria for achalasia is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of achalasia, a rare esophageal motility disorder. The target patient population includes individuals presenting with symptoms suggestive of esophageal motility disorders, such as dysphagia, regurgitation, and chest pain.

The primary components of the diagnostic criteria are derived from esophageal manometry testing:

- **Integrated relaxation pressure**: This component indicates impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter if the pressure is above the upper limit of normal.

- **Presence of 100% failed peristalsis or spasm**: This component reflects the absence of normal esophageal contractions.

The diagnosis of achalasia is confirmed if both components are present. If either or both components are absent, the diagnostic criteria for achalasia are not met. The use of these criteria provides a standardized approach to the diagnosis of achalasia, facilitating early detection and appropriate management of the condition.

The diagnostic process relies on two key measurements obtained via esophageal manometry:

- **Integrated relaxation pressure (IRP)**: If the IRP is above the established upper limit of normal, this suggests a lack of adequate relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) during swallowing.

### Esophageal achalasia: Pros and cons of the treatment options [^113HZdD8]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

From the above analysis of the pros and cons of the techniques available for treating achalasia, it seems they are all appropriate — apart from BoT injections, which should be reserved for patients too ill to undergo more invasive options.

Patients with achalasia can be offered PD, LHM (with fundoplication), or POEM, after illustrating the merits and drawbacks of the different options. Generally speaking, the choice of treatment should be left to the patient, not based on the expertise or preferences of their doctor. PD is certainly still an attractive option as it is now well standardized, widely available, relatively safe, and does not require general anesthesia. However, it has limitations and is generally less effective than LHM or POEM, especially in certain circumstances. Therefore, it should not be offered to children and young adults (< 40 years old) or to patients with type III achalasia. On the other hand, complementary PD may be the treatment of choice following a failed LHM or POEM, as it usually relieves residual dysphagia in most patients.

- **Suggested indications for different treatments**: LHM and POEM have a similar profile in terms of efficacy, perioperative complications, and adverse events. It is worth emphasizing, however, that POEM is an invasive procedure (despite being managed endoscopically) that requires general anesthesia, like LHM. Both techniques demand skilled surgeons and endoscopists, and should only be performed at high-volume centers to ensure optimal outcomes.

### Albuterol [^112TA2E7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Adverse reactions

In clinical trials, the most frequent adverse reactions to albuterol tablets were as follows:

- **Rare cases**: Urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, and oropharyngeal edema have been reported after the use of albuterol.
- **Sympathomimetic reactions**: Albuterol, like other sympathomimetic agents, can cause adverse reactions such as hypertension, angina, vomiting, vertigo, central nervous system stimulation, unusual taste, and drying or irritation of the oropharynx.

The reactions are generally transient in nature, and it is usually not necessary to discontinue treatment with albuterol tablets. In selected cases, however, the dosage may be reduced temporarily; after the reaction has subsided, the dosage should be increased in small increments to the optimal dosage.

### Diagnosis and management of esophageal achalasia [^1112qQRF]. BMJ (2016). High credibility.

Achalasia is a rare esophageal motility disorder that is usually idiopathic in origin. It is characterized by dysphagia, with patients often experiencing chest pain, regurgitation, weight loss, and an abnormal barium radiograph showing esophageal dilation with narrowing at the gastroesophageal junction. Abnormal or absent esophageal peristalsis and impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) are typically seen on esophageal manometry.

The advent of high-resolution manometry (HRM) has allowed for a more precise diagnosis of achalasia, subtype designation, and differentiation from other esophageal motor disorders. This development began with an initial seminal publication in 2008, followed by further refinements under what has been termed the Chicago classification.

Potential treatments include drugs, endoscopic botulinum toxin injection, balloon dilation, traditional surgery (usually laparoscopic Heller myotomy; LHM), and a novel, less invasive, natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) approach to Heller myotomy, termed peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). The first human POEM was performed in 2008, with the first publication appearing in 2010. Evidence is now rapidly accumulating, showing POEM to be comparable to traditional surgery in terms of clinical success and radiologic and manometric post-therapy outcomes.

This review discusses the diagnosis and management of achalasia with particular emphasis on the recent developments of HRM and POEM, which arguably represent the most important advances in the field since the advent of laparoscopic Heller myotomy in the 1990s.

### ACG clinical guidelines: Diagnosis and management of achalasia [^114q9iEF]. American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Achalasia is an esophageal motility disorder characterized by aberrant peristalsis and insufficient relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. Patients most commonly present with dysphagia to solids and liquids, regurgitation, and occasional chest pain with or without weight loss. High-resolution manometry has identified three subtypes of achalasia distinguished by pressurization and contraction patterns.

Endoscopic findings of retained saliva with puckering of the gastroesophageal junction or esophagram findings of a dilated esophagus with bird beaking are important diagnostic clues. In this American College of Gastroenterology guideline, we used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation process to provide clinical guidance on how best to diagnose and treat patients with achalasia.

### Bronchial hyperresponsiveness induced by chronic treatment with albuterol: Role of sensory nerves [^114AHAeo]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

It has recently been suggested that regular treatment with racemic beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists might result in bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to a range of spasmogens. This might be due to adverse effects of the distomer. We sought to determine whether BHR induced by continuous exposure to racemic and S-albuterol was mediated by sensory nerves.

- **Methods**: Naive or ovalbumin-sensitized guinea pigs were treated for 10 days with RS-, R-, or S-albuterol (1 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)) through subcutaneously implanted minipumps. Lung function was then determined in response to a number of spasmogens and assessed on the basis of an increase in total airway resistance. A separate group of animals was chronically treated with capsaicin (80 mg/kg) before the albuterol treatment.

- **Results**: Treatment with RS- or S-albuterol increased airway responsiveness to bradykinin, leukotriene C(4), and capsaicin in naive guinea pigs (P < 0.05) and to histamine and ovalbumin in immunized guinea pigs (P < 0.05). Chronic treatment with capsaicin prevented the development of RS- and S-albuterol-induced BHR in these models. The bronchodilator efficacy of acute intravenously administered RS-albuterol was unaffected in RS-, R-, or S-albuterol-treated guinea pigs compared with vehicle-treated animals.

- **Conclusion**: We have provided evidence demonstrating that continuous exposure to RS- and S-albuterol increases bronchial responsiveness to a range of stimuli, an effect not attributed to beta-adrenoceptor occupancy or desensitization. Furthermore, capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves played a crucial role in mediating the increased bronchial responsiveness.

### New diagnostic approach to diagnosis of achalasia after recent Chicago classification [^117GFivp]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

We read with great interest the recently published article by Müller. The author aimed to explain the importance of high-resolution manometry (HRM) on achalasia diagnosis and management. She explained conventional manometry (CM) and HRM criteria for the diagnosis of achalasia. We thank Müller for this valuable study, but we think that there are some controversies that need to be clarified.

- **Esophageal body motility evaluation**: The author mentioned that additional effort is needed for esophageal body motility evaluation by positioning pressure sensors in the body, instead of evaluating when positioning on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). CM contains 4–8 pressure sensors. To assess the LES and the esophageal body in one investigation, it is better to use a catheter with 4 or more transducers in the esophagus. For example, with an 8-sensor CM, when the lower sensors (5th-8th) are on the LES high-pressure zone, the other 4 sensors (1st-4th) are on the esophageal body 5, 10, 15, and 20 cm above the LES. Thus, we think these sensors are adequate to evaluate esophageal motility, especially in the lower two-thirds of the esophageal body.

- **Diagnosis of achalasia with HRM**: The author also mentioned that for the diagnosis of achalasia with HRM, the mean integrated relaxation pressure (IRP) must be elevated from the upper limit of normal (> 15 mmHg). However, recently, it has been indicated by the International HRM Working Group that it is better to use the median IRP rather than the mean IRP in the diagnosis of achalasia.

- **Definition of achalasia subgroups**: The author clearly defined achalasia subgroups and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) outflow obstruction, but the importance of EGJ requires further elaboration.

### High-resolution manometry in treated achalasia: Scoping review and novel nomenclature [^11246ZnM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

The Chicago Classification (CC) for high-resolution manometry (HRM) is the standard for the diagnostic criteria of primary motility disorders, with achalasia being the most relevant. CC does not include recommendations on HRM in treated achalasia, either after surgery or endoscopic interventions.

- **Material and methods**: After a systematic review of the literature on three major databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science) from inception to December 2024, a group of 12 esophageal motility experts provided recommendations for HRM interpretation in treated achalasia. They proposed novel nomenclature and a management flow-chart to address gaps in the diagnostic CC hierarchy.

- **Results**: The search yielded 40 articles on HRM in treated achalasia. Unsuccessful achalasia treatment results in high integrated relaxation pressure (IRP) and obstructive features, especially on provocative maneuvers. We propose the term "treated achalasia with outflow obstruction" (TAOO) instead of achalasia. Conversely, the term "adequately treated achalasia" (ATA) is suggested in the absence of obstructive features, instead of absent contractility or ineffective motility, which could be misleading. We propose an IRP cut-off at the upper limit of normal according to the HRM system utilized, similar to that recommended for the naïve sphincter by CC to describe incomplete sphincter relaxation despite treatment. Intrabolus pressurization and abnormal IRP on Rapid Drink Challenge (RDC) are additional obstructive features. Assessment of body contractility, either ineffective (< 450 mmHg·cm·s) or spastic (< 4.5 seconds), is relevant to dis…

### ASGE guideline on the management of achalasia [^115xwewz]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2020). Low credibility.

Achalasia is a primary esophageal motor disorder of unknown etiology characterized by degeneration of the myenteric plexus, which results in impaired relaxation of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ), along with the loss of organized peristalsis in the esophageal body. The criterion standard for diagnosing achalasia is high-resolution esophageal manometry showing incomplete relaxation of the EGJ coupled with the absence of organized peristalsis. Three achalasia subtypes have been defined based on high-resolution manometry findings in the esophageal body. Treatment of patients with achalasia has evolved in recent years with the introduction of peroral endoscopic myotomy. Other treatment options include botulinum toxin injection, pneumatic dilation, and Heller myotomy. This American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Standards of Practice Guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of achalasia, based on an updated assessment of the individual and comparative effectiveness, adverse effects, and cost of the four aforementioned achalasia therapies.

### Treatment of achalasia in the era of high-resolution manometry [^116dQQve]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Pharmacological therapy is usually assigned a minor role in the treatment of esophageal achalasia, as it is considered the least effective option. The two most commonly used pharmacological agents are nitrates and calcium channel blockers. Nitrates work by inhibiting normal lower esophageal sphincter (LES) contraction through increasing nitric oxide concentration in smooth muscle cells, which in turn raises cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels and promotes muscle relaxation. In a recent review, Wen et al. identified only two randomized studies assessing the success of nitrates in the treatment of achalasia and concluded that no solid recommendations could be made.

Calcium antagonists function by blocking calcium entry, thus inhibiting esophageal muscle contraction. Nifedipine, administered in sublingual doses of 10–20 mg 15–30 minutes before meals, is the most commonly used oral drug for achalasia. It inhibits LES contraction and can decrease resting pressure by up to 60%. However, the clinical response is of short duration because drug tolerance develops rapidly. Symptom improvement is often incomplete, and side effects such as headache, hypotension, and leg edema frequently limit use. Consequently, these drugs are typically reserved for patients unable or unwilling to undergo more invasive therapies and for those where Botox treatment has failed.

### Comparative efficacy of first-line therapeutic interventions for achalasia: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111smjq2]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). High credibility.

An important strength of this network meta-analysis is the inclusion of RCTs alone and the inclusion of new trials, particularly the two landmark head-to-head RCTs comparing POEM to LHM and PD. Prior meta-analyses predated these RCTs, included both observational and randomized studies, and did not objectively appraise the overall quality of evidence using standardized GRADE methodology.

Although the finding of an increased rate of post-treatment GERD after POEM was expected, it is important to discuss the clinical implications. Ten to 20-year long-term follow-up after Heller myotomy reports a high incidence of GERD and erosive complications, including strictures, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma, which in turn contribute to the failure rate of myotomy at 10 years. As such, Heller myotomy is often performed with an anti-reflux procedure. In POEM, the lack of a combined anti-reflux procedure to strengthen the integrity of the anti-reflux barrier likely augments gastroesophageal reflux physiology following POEM. However, the pooled estimate of severe erosive reflux disease following POEM in the short term is low. A previous meta-analysis found that approximately 30 patients should be treated with LHM over POEM to prevent one case of post-procedure severe esophagitis. Further, initial experiences of endoscopic transoral incisionless fundoplication following POEM have been shown to reduce the risks of esophagitis and esophageal acid exposure. Nonetheless, long-term follow-up of consequences of GERD post POEM needs to be studied.

### Impact of high-resolution manometry on achalasia diagnosis and treatment [^113sdykr]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). High credibility.

The implementation of high-resolution esophageal pressure topography (HREPT) involved the establishment of a structured classification system, known as the Chicago classification of esophageal motility. After all swallows are analyzed using the stepwise approach described above, the data are used in the Chicago classification to make a diagnosis. Initially, as shown in Fig. 1, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) function is assessed, followed by the characterization of esophageal motor function.

A key feature of the Chicago classification is the hierarchical categorization of esophageal motility disorders into four general groupings: achalasia, esophageal outlet obstruction, abnormalities of esophageal motor function not observed in asymptomatic controls — such as absent peristalsis, distal esophageal spasm, and hypercontractile (jackhammer) esophagus — and borderline abnormalities of esophageal function commonly found in asymptomatic individuals, such as weak or hypertensive (nutcracker esophagus) peristalsis.

This systematic review is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) for network meta-analyses (PRISMA-NMA) and was conducted following a priori established protocol. We also adhered to good research practices as outlined in the ISPOR (International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research) report on interpreting indirect treatment comparisons and network meta-analysis for healthcare decision-making.

- **Selection criteria**: Studies included in this meta-analysis were RCTs with a minimum follow-up of 1 year that met the following inclusion criteria: (a) patients: adults (age > 18 years) with achalasia, treated with (b) interventions and comparators: PD, LHM, and POEM, and reported (c) outcome: treatment success assessed at 1 year. We excluded (a) observational or non-randomized studies, (b) RCTs of endoscopic botulinum toxin injection, as this is considered second-line therapy for patients who are not candidates for first-line therapy, (c) RCTs of oral therapies reserved for patients who are not candidates for first-line therapy (i.e. oral smooth muscle relaxants), and (d) trials with short duration of follow-up (< 1 year).

- **Search strategy**: The search strategy was conducted by updating a prior systematic literature review performed as part of the recent American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines through December 2019. Briefly, in this guideline, combinations of subject headings and text words were used, including esophageal achalasia OR cardiospasm OR achalasia OR megaesophagus.

### Treatment of achalasia in the era of high-resolution manometry [^114XLLga]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Esophageal achalasia is a primary motility disorder characterized by impaired lower esophageal sphincter relaxation and absence of esophageal peristalsis, leading to impaired bolus transit. This condition manifests with symptoms such as dysphagia, regurgitation, retrosternal pain, and weight loss. The standard diagnostic tool is esophageal manometry, which demonstrates incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and impaired esophageal peristalsis.

Recently, the advanced technique of high-resolution manometry (HRM), with the addition of pressure topography plotting and multiple sensors to capture manometric data as a spatial continuum, allows detailed pressure recording of esophageal motility. This technique, currently the gold standard for the diagnosis of achalasia, has led to a subclassification of three manometric types that seem to have different responsiveness to treatment.

Because its pathogenesis is as yet unknown, achalasia treatment options are not curative. Type II achalasia patients respond better to treatment compared to those with types I and III. Low-risk patients with type I or II achalasia have good outcomes with both graded pneumatic dilatations and laparoscopic Heller myotomy, while type III achalasia patients respond better to laparoscopic Heller myotomy. However, type III achalasia patients respond less favorably compared to types I and II to laparoscopic Heller myotomy.

Peroral endoscopic myotomy is a promising new technique, but long-term follow-up studies for its safety and efficacy must be performed.

### Whose patient is it? The path to multidisciplinary management of achalasia [^116FQszB]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

In the past decade, the introduction of high-resolution manometry and the classification of achalasia into subtypes has made it possible to accurately diagnose the disease and predict the response to treatment for its different subtypes. However, even at the time of writing, in an era of exponential medical progress and increased insight into disease mechanisms, treatment of patients with achalasia is still rather simplistic and mostly confined to mechanical disruption of the lower esophageal sphincter by different means. In addition, there is partial consensus on what is the best form of available treatments for patients with achalasia.

Herein, we provide a comprehensive outlook on the general approach to the patient with suspected achalasia by:

- **Defining the modern evaluation process** and continues with text on the same line about the evaluation process.
- **Describing the diagnostic value of high-resolution manometry and the Chicago classification in predicting treatment outcomes** and continues with text on the same line about diagnostic value.
- **Discussing the available treatment options**: considering patient conditions, alternatives available to both the surgeon and the gastroenterologist, and the burden to the healthcare system.

It is our hope that such a discussion will contribute to value-based management of achalasia by promoting a leaner clinical flow of patients at all points of care.

### Efficacy and safety of pneumatic dilation in achalasia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114FMxFo]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

- **Comparing efficacy between different dilation protocols**: We compared studies that followed a predefined series of dilations (three studies) with studies that performed elective additional dilations in patients with persisting symptoms (seven studies). The second group had a higher remission rate after 6 months (88%) and 12 months of follow-up (86%) compared to the group that underwent dilations according to a predefined protocol (78% and 75%). The additional dilation group, however, had a wider range of final success rates.

Regarding the studies performing a predefined series of dilations, 2 out of 3 only dilated up to 30 mm: Chuah et al. and Tanaka et al, and one study dilated up to 35 mm: Smeets et al. This partially explains the lower remission rates in the predefined treatment group compared to the elective additional dilation group.

### Surgical and endoscopic interventions in the management of idiopathic achalasia [^114YmRiS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Management of achalasia can be challenging. Guided by version 4 of the Chicago Classification (an internationally recognized system used to interpret esophageal manometry results), treatment often relies on endoscopic or surgical techniques for definitive improvement in symptoms. Endoscopic injection of botulinum toxin into the LES is considered a temporizing measure, and pharmacological treatment (i.e. with calcium channel blockers or nitrates) is infrequently considered due to a relative lack of effectiveness and inconsistent tolerability. Both botulinum toxin and pharmacological approaches are typically reserved for non-operative/non-procedural candidates.

For individuals who can undergo procedures, however, longer-lasting symptom relief is typically afforded by either surgical or endoscopic interventions. In particular, there are three primary procedures: pneumatic dilation; per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM); and laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM). Recently, network meta-analyses reported that POEM and LHM are the preferred modalities in the management of achalasia compared to pneumatic dilation. Furthermore, clinical guidelines recommend different procedures based on achalasia subtype, wherein types I and II achalasia are considered responsive to all of LHM, POEM, and pneumatic dilation, and type III achalasia is primarily responsive to POEM.

### Efficacy and safety of pneumatic dilation in achalasia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114b44c7]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Achalasia is a primary motor disease of the esophagus, characterized manometrically by the loss of peristalsis and a non-relaxing lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The classic presentation includes progressive dysphagia to both solids and liquids, often accompanied by regurgitation of undigested food and chest pain. Radiographically, poor esophageal emptying and a very narrow LES are observed, while histopathology shows a loss of neural cells in the myenteric plexus of the esophagus.

Unfortunately, there is no curative treatment that can target the neurodegenerative process. Therefore, all treatments are symptomatic, aiming to improve esophageal emptying by reducing LES tone. Currently, the most common and effective interventions are surgical Heller myotomy, per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM), and pneumatic dilation. Many different techniques and treatment protocols have been described for pneumatic dilation. A non-compliant polyethylene balloon (Rigiflex, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) is generally positioned across the LES under fluoroscopic guidance, aided by radiopaque markers on the balloon catheter, and the balloon is inflated with a handheld manometer. Various balloon sizes, number of dilation sessions, inflation pressures, and inflation durations can be used. Consequently, the reported series are heterogeneous with respect to the treatment protocol. Reported treatment success rates vary from 52% to 99%.

### Current diagnosis and management of achalasia [^113E1qay]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Achalasia is the best-characterized primary esophageal motility disorder and typically presents with absent peristalsis of the esophageal body and a failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax upon swallowing, as observed in manometry. It is associated with progressively severe dysphagia, regurgitation, aspiration, chest pain, and weight loss. The diagnosis is suggested by a barium swallow and endoscopy and confirmed by manometry. As there is no curative treatment for achalasia, treatment focuses on the disruption of the lower esophageal sphincter to improve bolus passage.

- **Treatment modalities available**: Pneumatic dilation, laparoscopic Heller myotomy, and, more recently, peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM).

In this review, we will discuss the diagnosis, management, and treatment options for achalasia.

### An update on current management strategies for achalasia and future perspectives [^111ZpXb9]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

In the last decade, there has been a growing insight into the pathophysiology of achalasia. Treatments focus on decreasing the resting pressure in the lower esophageal sphincter through endoscopic methods, such as botulinum toxin injection, pneumatic dilation, and peroral endoscopic myotomy, or surgical means like Heller myotomy. Manometry is considered the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis of achalasia.

Pneumatic dilation and laparoscopic Heller myotomy have shown similar effectiveness and are both more successful in patients with type II achalasia. Laparoscopic myotomy, when combined with partial fundoplication, is an effective surgical technique and has been regarded as the operative procedure of choice until recently. Peroral endoscopic myotomy is emerging as a therapy with promising results, offering a minimally invasive and efficacious option, especially for type III achalasia. However, it remains to be determined if peroral endoscopic myotomy provides long-term efficacy.

### Efficacy of surgical or endoscopic treatment of idiopathic achalasia: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116ySYLY]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Treatment of achalasia has changed substantially over the past 20 years. Therapeutic options offered to patients vary, depending on access to both resources and expertise, and include pneumatic dilation (PD), laparoscopic Heller's myotomy (LHM), or per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). Although there are head-to-head trials of these interventions, many are small and underpowered, so relative efficacy is unknown. We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to try to resolve this uncertainty.

- **Methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, and Embase Classic from database inception up to June 11, 2020, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of POEM, LHM, or PD, compared with each other in adults with idiopathic achalasia. We extracted all data as dichotomous outcomes (treatment success or failure) after completion of therapy. Additional data extracted included country of origin, number of centres, duration of follow-up, and primary outcome measure used to define treatment success or failure. Data were extracted for intention-to-treat analyses, with all dropouts assumed to be treatment failures (i.e. symptomatic at final point of follow-up), wherever trial reporting allowed this. We pooled data using a random effects model and assessed heterogeneity between studies using the I² statistic. Risk of bias was examined for all studies. The primary outcome was efficacy, in terms of a dichotomous measure of treatment success or failure, following a minimum of 1 year of follow-up. Secondary outcomes were not fully listed in the text.

### Efficacy and safety of pneumatic dilation in achalasia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112XU3ML]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: To identify studies describing the efficacy of pneumatic dilation in achalasia patients, we searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane. We performed our search on December 8, 2016, using the following terms (including synonyms): "esophageal achalasia", "pneumatic dilation", and "size" or "effect". The exact search is displayed in Appendix S1, and Figure 1 shows a summary of our literature search, screening, and selection. During title and abstract screening, we used the following inclusion criteria: adult patients with primary achalasia; treatment with pneumatic dilation; and article type: no reviews, commentaries, meta-analyses, or case reports. Next, two authors (FH and LP) separately screened the full text of the remaining articles more accurately using stricter inclusion criteria: no previous treatments; use of Rigiflex balloon and full description of the procedure; use of Eckardt score or a similar validated questionnaire; and full-text availability. Publications that did not meet the aforementioned criteria were excluded from further analysis.

- **Critical appraisal and article selection**: Of the remaining articles, two authors (FH and LP) independently determined the relevance and validity during critical appraisal (Table 1), using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale as a guideline. We noted the number of included patients, the study design, the level of evidence, and the inclusion period of the patients. The relevance of the articles was assessed.

### Surgical and endoscopic interventions in the management of idiopathic achalasia [^113yAvBV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

- **Methods - Criteria for considering studies for this review**

- **Types of studies**: We will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compare any combination of POEM, LHM, and/or pneumatic dilation. Subtypes of these interventions, such as pneumatic dilation with or without botulinum toxin injection, will also be considered where data permit. We will include studies published as full manuscripts and conference abstracts, as well as unpublished data. We will impose no restrictions on publication date or language. We will exclude crossover trials and cluster-randomized controlled trials, as our unit of analysis will be individuals and not groups (e.g. clinics, hospitals). We will exclude observational studies and quasi-randomized trials.

- **Types of participants**: We will include studies in participants who are adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with idiopathic achalasia (i.e. not secondary to Chagas disease) whose diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and high‐resolution manometry (HRM). Although it is possible for barium esophagram and endoscopy to be used, clinical guidelines strongly recommend the use of HRM to diagnose achalasia (Oude Nijhuis 2020; Vaezi 2020). However, if there is traditional manometry with at least 24 months of data, we will consider that equivalent to HRM for the purposes of diagnosis (Niebisch 2017). We will exclude any participants who are not diagnosed with idiopathic achalasia.

- **Types of interventions**: We will include RCTs that compare any combination of the following interventions: POEM, including procedural variations in terms of anterior ver…

### Efficacy and safety of pneumatic dilation in achalasia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Uz3ML]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Results from this systematic review are as follows:

- **Literature search, screening, and selection**: The search yielded 1,777 records from PubMed (884), Embase (790), and Cochrane (103). After removing 557 duplicates, 1,220 unique studies were identified. Among these, 1,163 studies were excluded during title and abstract screening, and another 41 articles were excluded during full-text screening. The remaining 16 articles underwent critical appraisal. Four studies were excluded during this phase, and two additional studies were excluded due to reported success rates being outliers that caused significant heterogeneity. Ultimately, 10 articles were deemed eligible and included in the systematic review.

- **Critical appraisal and heterogeneity assessment**: The four studies excluded during critical appraisal were listed in Table 1. Two of these studies, Ding 12 and Yamashita et al 13, were excluded due to inconsistent treatment protocols; they dilated some patients with a 30 mm balloon and others with a 35 mm balloon without differentiating these groups in the results. Additionally, Ding et al did not report their final success rate after follow-up or their outcome measurement. Ahmed et al 14 was excluded for not specifying a definition of clinical remission. The study by Muehldorfer et al 15 was also excluded because it included a heterogeneous group of treated and untreated patients without detailing previous treatments or distinguishing treatment results among these patients.

Two outlier studies were excluded during heterogeneity assessment.

### Impact of high-resolution manometry on achalasia diagnosis and treatment [^111uSAZF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

These studies have methodological differences according to the type of esophageal manometry, treatment modalities, definition of response, and time of follow-up. Nevertheless, consistent across all studies was the observation that patients with type II achalasia have the best and patients with type III achalasia have the worst response to treatment. It seems that type II had the best results for PD, and surgery seems to benefit more type I achalasia patients. Although PD and surgery are not very effective in patients with type III achalasia, medical therapy (BOTOX) might be an alternative for these patients.

These results suggest that achalasia subtypes represent unique clinical phenotypes and may offer criteria to plan the optimal treatment for the patient with achalasia, although more prospective data are needed to confirm these first results.

### Treatment of achalasia in the era of high-resolution manometry [^11156gwj]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Type I (classic achalasia) is characterized by no significant pressurization within the esophageal body and impaired LES relaxation. Type II (achalasia with compression or compartmentalization in the distal esophagus > 30 mmHg) involves rapid panesophageal pressurization with water swallows. Type III (spastic achalasia) is marked by rapidly propagated pressurization attributable to an abnormal lumen-obliterating contraction.

- **Eckardt score**: Clinical scoring for achalasia.
- **Manometric subtypes of achalasia**: According to the Chicago classification.

- **Figure**: Achalasia subtypes according to the Chicago classification.
- **Type I (classic achalasia)**: Refers to patients with an absence of peristalsis, no pressurization within the esophageal body, and high integrated relaxation pressure (IRP).
- **Type II (achalasia with compression)**: Refers to patients with absence of peristalsis and contractile activity, panesophageal pressurization > 30 mmHg, and high IRP.
- **Type III (spastic achalasia)**: Refers to patients with absence of peristalsis and two or more spastic contractions with or without periods of compartmentalized pressurization and a high IRP.

Additionally, high-resolution manometry (HRM) introduced a new parameter for quantification of the LES relaxation: integrated relaxation pressure, which calculates the mean post-swallow LES pressure of a 4-second period during which the LES pressure was the lowest, skipping periods of crural contractions if necessary. The upper normal limit for the integrated relaxation pressure is 10 mmHg for type I achalasia, 15 mmHg for type II, and 17 mmHg for type III achalasia, which best differentiates impairment.

### Comparative efficacy of first-line therapeutic interventions for achalasia: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112xr1kq]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). High credibility.

Several interventions with variable efficacy are available as first-line therapy for patients with achalasia. We assessed the comparative efficacy of different strategies for management of achalasia through a network meta-analysis combining direct and indirect treatment comparisons.

- **Methods**: We identified six randomized controlled trials in adults with achalasia that compared the efficacy of pneumatic dilation (PD; n = 260), laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM; n = 309), and peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM; n = 176). The primary efficacy outcome was the 1-year treatment success, defined as patient-reported improvement in symptoms based on validated scores. Secondary efficacy outcomes included 2-year treatment success and physiologic improvement. Safety outcomes involved the risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), severe erosive esophagitis, and procedure-related serious adverse events. We performed pairwise and network meta-analysis for all treatments and used GRADE criteria to appraise the quality of evidence.

- **Results**: Low-quality evidence, based primarily on direct evidence, supports the use of POEM (RR [risk ratio], 1.29; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.99–1.69) and LHM (RR, 1.18 [0.96–1.44]) over PD for treatment success at 1 year; no significant difference was observed between LHM and POEM (RR 1.09 [0.86–1.39]). The incidence of severe esophagitis after POEM, LHM, and PD was 5.3%, 3.7%, and 1.5%, respectively. The procedure-related serious adverse event rate after POEM, LHM, and PD was 1.4%, 6.7%, and 4.2%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: POEM and LHM have comparable efficacy and may increase the success rate over PD for patients undergoing treatment for achalasia.
