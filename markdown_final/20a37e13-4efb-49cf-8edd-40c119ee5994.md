## Question

Ibuprofen dose 10 kilogram child

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a dosing recommendation for ibuprofen in a 10 kg child, including single dose, frequency, daily maximum, and practical administration guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the child's weight and age eligibility for ibuprofen. Then, I should verify the standard pediatric ibuprofen dose range and how it applies to 10 kg. Next, I will calculate the single-dose range and round to a practical amount, confirm the dosing interval and daily maximum, and finally check safety considerations, formulation choices, and any exceptions or special populations before summarizing the recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the basics: a 10 kg child is typically around 12–24 months old, and ibuprofen is indicated for children 6 months and older for fever and pain, so age eligibility is satisfied in most 10 kg toddlers, which aligns with FDA labeling and pediatric guidelines.

> I need to verify the standard pediatric dosing parameters. The usual oral ibuprofen dose for infants and children up to 11 years and less than 50 kg is 4–10 mg/kg per dose every 6–8 hours as needed, with a maximum single dose of 400 mg and a maximum daily dose of 40 mg/kg, which is consistent across FDA labeling and high-credibility pediatric sources [^111XT7He] [^1122epfF] [^114xgJiU].

> Now, I will calculate the single-dose range for a 10 kg child. Wait, let me verify the math: 4 mg/kg × 10 kg = 40 mg, and 10 mg/kg × 10 kg = 100 mg, so the per-dose range is 40–100 mg; practically, many clinicians use 10 mg/kg for analgesia or higher fever, which equals 100 mg per dose in this case, and I should confirm that this does not exceed the single-dose cap of 400 mg, which it does not [^111XT7He] [^1122epfF].

> Next, I should review frequency and daily maximum. The dosing interval is every 6–8 hours as needed, and the daily maximum is 40 mg/kg/day, which for 10 kg equals 400 mg/day; hold on, I should verify that this cap is consistent with both FDA and pediatric guidelines, and yes, both specify 40 mg/kg/day as the upper limit in children under 50 kg [^111XT7He] [^1122epfF] [^114xgJiU].

> Let me consider practical administration. For a 10 kg child, a common approach is 100 mg per dose every 6–8 hours as needed, not to exceed 400 mg in 24 hours; if symptoms are mild or the child is sensitive to NSAIDs, starting at 5–7 mg/kg (about 50–70 mg) is reasonable, but I should double-check that this still respects the 4–10 mg/kg range, which it does [^111XT7He] [^1122epfF].

> I should confirm formulation and device issues that affect accuracy. Ibuprofen liquid for children is typically 100 mg/5 mL, so 100 mg corresponds to 5 mL; wait, I initially thought infant ibuprofen might be 200 mg/5 mL, but I need to check the concentration because misdosing is more common with the higher-concentration infant product; indeed, accuracy is better with the 100 mg/5 mL children's concentration, and caregivers should use the provided dosing device to reduce errors [^1144JcwG] [^111uu2gQ].

> Hold on, I should verify safety cautions and contraindications. Ibuprofen should be avoided in children with dehydration, chickenpox, known NSAID hypersensitivity, or significant renal, hepatic, or bleeding disorders; I need to ensure adequate hydration and use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, and I should remember that routine alternating with acetaminophen increases complexity and overdose risk, so if used, it should be carefully planned and documented [^111uu2gQ] [^111uu2gQ] [^1162H9Ki].

> But wait, what if the child is younger than 6 months or weighs less than 5 kg? I should confirm that ibuprofen is not recommended for infants under 6 months in U.S. labeling, whereas some international formularies allow lower weight-based dosing from 1 month; in the U.S. context, acetaminophen is preferred under 6 months, so I need to ensure age-appropriate guidance is followed [^111XT7He] [^113cjFX2].

> Let me reconsider the final recommendation to ensure internal consistency. For a 10 kg child who is 6 months or older: give 100 mg per dose every 6–8 hours as needed, not to exceed 400 mg in 24 hours; if a gentler start is desired, begin at 50–70 mg per dose within the 4–10 mg/kg range, and always use the appropriate concentration and measuring device to minimize dosing errors [^111XT7He] [^1122epfF] [^1144JcwG].

---

For a 10 kg child, the recommended ibuprofen dose is **10 mg/kg every 6–8 hours** as needed, which equals **100 mg per dose**. Do not exceed **40 mg/kg/day** (400 mg/day for a 10 kg child) [^111XT7He] [^1122epfF]. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, and ensure the child is well hydrated [^111XT7He] [^1162H9Ki]. Ibuprofen is not recommended for infants under 6 months [^113cjFX2].

### A multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-comparator trial to determine the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous ibuprofen for treatment of fever in hospitalized pediatric patients [^114WEYdq]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Limitations of this study involved the selection of the comparator drug. At the onset of this study, intravenous ibuprofen, was the only FDA approved antipyretic with an intravenous route of administration. While an IV form of acetaminophen is now commercially available (approved in 2010), it was not FDA approved or commercially available in the United States when the study was designed, initiated, or during early enrollment.

The use of oral or rectal acetaminophen as the comparator was not optimal given that at times absorption and utilization of oral or rectal preparations of medication can be unpredictable and lead to sub-therapeutic level of the medication. In practice, many pediatricians utilize acetaminophen at a dose of 15 mg/kg of body weight. Recommended acetaminophen dosing varies from 7.5 mg/kg every 6 h (for children ≤ 10 kg) to 15 mg/kg every 4 h (for children > 33 kg) to 12.5mg/kg every 4 h or 15mg/kg every 6 h for children ≥ 2 years of age (maximum daily dose of 75 mg/kg/day). The study was designed to allow for multiple doses at a frequency of every 4 h. For the acetaminophen dose, 10 mg/kg was chosen to stay consistent with acetaminophen recommendations and to limit potential renal and hepatic toxicities should repeated dosing of acetaminophen be administered during the treatment period.

Enrollment in the ibuprofen treatment arm was larger in the 6–16 years age group (ibuprofen – 57%, acetaminophen - 48%) when compared to acetaminophen than in the other age groups (6 months -2 years [ibuprofen -17%, acetaminophen 25%] and 2 years – 6 years [ibuprofen – 26%, acetaminophen – 27%]). Given that difference disease processes cause fever in infants compared to older children and adolescents and the different mean weight of the subjects in the groups, there potentially could be different pharmacokinetic responses based on these variables.

Other limitation of the study included the relatively small number of patients studied in children under the age of 6 months and a relatively short duration of exposure. The duration of exposure to ibuprofen is, however, consistent with the recommendation that intravenous ibuprofen should be at the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration possible. Additional research is needed in the less than 6 months age population to determine the safety and efficacy of intravenous ibuprofen in that age population.

### Ibuprofen lysine [^112CiEER]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

A course of therapy is three doses administered I.V. (2.1)
An initial dose of 10 mg/kg (based on birth weight) is followed by two doses of 5 mg/kg each, after 24 and 48 hours (2.1)
Do not administer if anuria or marked oliguria (< 0.6 mL/kg/hr) is evident at the scheduled time of the second or third dose (2.1)

2.1	Recommended Dose

A course of therapy is three doses of Ibuprofen Lysine administered intravenously (administration via an umbilical arterial line has not been evaluated). An initial dose of 10 mg per kilogram is followed by two doses of 5 mg per kilogram each, after 24 and 48 hours. All doses should be based on birth weight. If anuria or marked oliguria (urinary output < 0.6 mL/kg/hr) is evident at the scheduled time of the second or third dose of Ibuprofen Lysine, no additional dosage should be given until laboratory studies indicate that renal function has returned to normal. If the ductus arteriosus closes or is significantly reduced in size after completion of the first course of Ibuprofen Lysine, no further doses are necessary. If during continued medical management the ductus arteriosus fails to close or reopens, then a second course of Ibuprofen Lysine, alternative pharmacological therapy, or surgery may be necessary.

2.2	Directions for Use

For intravenous administration only. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Do not use Ibuprofen Lysine if particulate matter is observed.

After the first withdrawal from the vial, any solution remaining must be discarded because Ibuprofen Lysine contains no preservative.

For administration, Ibuprofen Lysine should be diluted to an appropriate volume with dextrose or saline. Ibuprofen Lysine should be prepared for infusion and administered within 30 minutes of preparation and infused continuously over a period of 15 minutes. The drug should be administered via the IV port that is nearest the insertion site. After the first withdrawal from the vial, any solution remaining must be discarded because Ibuprofen Lysine contains no preservative.

Since Ibuprofen Lysine is potentially irritating to tissues, it should be administered carefully to avoid extravasation.

Ibuprofen Lysine should not be simultaneously administered in the same intravenous line with Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN). If necessary, TPN should be interrupted for a 15-minute period prior to and after drug administration. Line patency should be maintained by using dextrose or saline.

### A multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-comparator trial to determine the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous ibuprofen for treatment of fever in hospitalized pediatric patients [^116gadrh]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Fever is one of the common symptoms managed by health care providers and one of the leading reasons children and infants present for medical evaluation, accounting for nearly 65% ambulatory pediatric visits and frequently leading to the administration of antipyretic medications. Indications for initiating antipyretic therapy are a temperature higher than 38.3° Celsius (C) [101°Fahrenheit (F)] and improving the child's overall comfort. Ibuprofen is an anti-pyretic and analgesic recommended worldwide as a first-line agent for the treatment of pain and fever in adults and children. In double blind trials it provides significantly better fever reduction than placebo and has long been available in oral solid and liquid forms.

Oral antipyretics are commonly used in hospitals to treat pediatric patients who develop fevers. However, patients presenting to the emergency department, undergoing surgery, or those admitted to the hospital are frequently unable to ingest, digest, absorb, or tolerate oral antipyretics. Rectal formulations are available for some medications, such as acetaminophen; however, this route of administration produces peak levels that may vary by as much as nine-fold and often will not achieve therapeutic levels after recommended doses are administered. During study design and upon study initiation, intravenous (IV) antipyretics, including IV acetaminophen were not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved and commercially available in the United States; therefore, to design a comparator study, an oral acetaminophen comparator arm was included.

An intravenous form of ibuprofen was approved by the FDA in 2009 for the treatment of pain and fever in adults under the brand name Caldolor ® (Ibuprofen Injection, Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. Nashville, TN). IV ibuprofen has been shown to be successful in the treatment of pain and fever in adults. Also, a single preoperative dose of 10 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) intravenous ibuprofen was found to significantly reduce fentanyl use in pediatric tonsillectomy patients, in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study. This study was conducted to provide data in support of intravenous ibuprofen in hospitalized febrile pediatric patients.

This multicenter, open-label study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single dose of intravenous ibuprofen compared to acetaminophen (oral or suppository) in pediatric patients with fever. Additional objectives included the evaluation of single and multiple doses in terms of safety and efficacy. Blood samples for analysis of pharmacokinetic properties were collected to assess plasma ibuprofen concentrations.

### Ibuprofen oral (ibuprofen) [^111XT7He]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of ibuprofen oral suspension and other treatment options before deciding to use ibuprofen oral suspension. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

After observing the response to initial therapy with ibuprofen oral suspension, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.

Pediatric Patients

Fever Reduction: For reduction of fever in children, 6 months up to 2 years of age, the dosage should be adjusted on the basis of the initial temperature level (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). The recommended dose is 5 mg/kg if the baseline temperature is less than 102.5ºF, or 10 mg/kg if the baseline temperature is 102.5ºF or greater. The duration of fever reduction is generally 6 to 8 hours. The recommended maximum daily dose is 40 mg/kg.

Analgesia: For relief of mild to moderate pain in children 6 months up to 2 years of age, the recommended dosage is 10 mg/kg, every 6 to 8 hours. The recommended maximum daily dose is 40 mg/kg. Doses should be given so as not to disturb the child's sleep pattern.

Juvenile Arthritis: The recommended dose is 30 mg/kg/day to 40 mg/kg/day divided into three to four doses (see Individualization of Dosage). Patients with milder disease may be adequately treated with 20 mg/kg/day.

### Paracetamol plus ibuprofen for the treatment of fever in children (PITCH): randomised controlled trial [^115HMhu5]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

The pragmatism of the intervention changed with time, moving from efficacy in the first four hours to effectiveness in the second 24 hours. By 48 hours, considerably fewer study drugs were being given and this could partly explain the observed lack of effects on discomfort at this time. In the community, paracetamol and ibuprofen are usually dosed by age, and we recognise that calculating doses by weight means the results may inform primary and secondary care practice more than practice at home. We decided against a dose by age regimen, however, for two reasons. Firstly, given the recommendation of the children's national service framework to dose by weightand the dose by weight presentations in the British national formulary for children, we believe that in the future more medicines for children will be given by weight. Secondly, we wanted to ensure that heavier children for their age received a therapeutic dose and to avoid exceeding the normal recommended dose for children who were light for their age. Comparing dose by weight with dose by age shows that children can receive as much as 50% moreor 50% less paracetamol and 100% more ibuprofen.

Medicine bottles in the United States contain dosing advice by both age and weight and although healthcare professionals can clearly calculate dose by weight, we think two steps are needed before parents can routinely use weight to determine dose in other countries. Firstly, studies should investigate the safety implications of any differences between estimates of children's weights measured by parents using domestic scales (or recently recorded weights in parent held children's health records) and those measured by professionals using paediatric scales. Secondly, suppliers of antipyretics could consider routinely including dose by weight tables. Given that the complexity of using two drugs over a 24 hour period is more likely to lead to inadvertently exceeding the maximum recommended dose, we also believe that multiple blank charts should be supplied for parents to record when medicines have been given and how much.

### Acetaminophen and ibuprofen dosing by parents [^116Sm8hy]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are two of the most commonly used medications in children. It is our experience that parents often misdose these medications. Misdosing may lead to unintended toxicity or inadequate symptomatic improvement. There are limited data on the extent of misdosing of these antipyretics. We sought to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for inaccurate dosing by parents seeking care for their children in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

A cross-sectional observational study was performed in an urban academic pediatric ED. Two hundred patients 10 years of age and younger who were given a known dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen in the 24 hours prior to the ED visit were enrolled. The treating physician completed a questionnaire for each patient. Caregivers were asked about quantity and frequency of antipyretic use prior to the ED visit, the source of information used to determine dosage, and which factor (eg, age, sex, height, weight, height of fever, severity of illness) they considered most important in determining the correct dosage of medication. Doses of 10 to 15 mg/kg for acetaminophen and 5 to 10 mg/kg for ibuprofen were considered accurate.

Results

Overall, 51% of patients received an inaccurate dose of medication, including 62% of patients given acetaminophen and 26% of patients given ibuprofen. Infants < 1 year old were more likely to receive an inaccurate dose (RR 1.40, P < 0.04, 95% CI = 1.06–1.86). Caregivers who stated that medication dosage was based on weight were less likely to give an inaccurate dose of medication (RR 0.71, P < 0.03, 95% CI = 0.52–0.97).

Conclusions

Over half of the caregivers surveyed gave an inaccurate dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen, particularly to infants. Caregivers who reported that antipyretic dosage was based on weight were less likely to misdose medication, suggesting a valuable role for patient education.

### What do Australian&New Zealand caregivers know about children's ibuprofen? The results of an online survey? [^113p3p5b]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Knowledge about Nurofen® for children

Most respondents knew that Nurofen® for Children contained ibuprofen (n = 198, 90.4%). However, many respondents incorrectly believed that the product contained; paracetamol (n = 64, 29.2%), alcohol (n = 56, 25.6%), codeine (n = 49, 22.3%) and/or aspirin (n = 48, 21.9%).

As seen in Table 2, the majority of the respondents knew to seek medical advice from a doctor or a pharmacist, prior to giving Nurofen® for Children to children who: were taking other medications (93.2%); suffered from asthma (81.3%); or were under 12 months of age (77.6%). The vast majority correctly identified that Nurofen® for Children was contraindicated in children with an ibuprofen allergy (91.3%). However, their knowledge that an aspirin allergy was also a contraindication and that allergies/intolerance to milk products, eggs and gluten were not contraindications was quite poor. In addition, respondents' knowledge of potential side effects associated with Nurofen® for Children overdose was variable. The majority knew that overdose could cause stomach problems (77.6%); however, less than half recognised that kidney problems could eventuate. In addition, only 5% recognised ringing in the ears as a possible side effect, and just over one-in-five respondents knew that that liver poisoning (22.4%) was not a potential side effect.

Table 2
Correct responses for possible contraindications or side effects

Comprehension of dosage instructions

Over three-quarters of respondents knew that Nurofen® for Children could be safely given for up to three consecutive days (n = 165, 75.3%). Fewer than half of them (n = 107, 48.9%) correctly identified that a six-hour interval was the minimum recommended time between doses and a similar proportion knew that three doses is the maximum a child should receive in a 24-h period (n = 94, 42.9%). Based on the responses to the two questions regarding the correct dosage of Nurofen® for Children 1–5 years for an 8 month old child, and a child who weighed 20 kg, the majority of respondents correctly interpreted the dosage instructions in both scenarios (n = 194, 88.6%; and n = 193, 88.1% respectively).

### What do Australian&New Zealand caregivers know about children's ibuprofen? The results of an online survey? [^113zh423]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Children's formulations containing ibuprofen are frequently used to treat pain and fever. These medications, available over-the-counter, have the potential to cause adverse events if usage/safety information is not adhered to. This study aimed to investigate caregivers' knowledge about the safe use of a commonly purchased children's formulation containing ibuprofen.

Methods

A convenience sample of caregivers in Australia and New Zealand, who had purchased Nurofen® for Children, completed an online survey assessing their knowledge of product information and dosage instructions available on/in the product packaging.

Results

In total, 219 caregivers (mainly female 95%, mean age ± SD; 35 ± 6.82 years) completed the online survey. Responses suggest limitations in their knowledge about the active ingredients, contraindications and side effect profile associated with the product. Most respondents had a good understanding about the correct dosage to give children based on their weight and/or age, but many lacked a good understanding about the correct interval between doses and the maximum number of daily doses.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that caregivers administering ibuprofen to children have gaps in their product knowledge. Strategies to help improve caregivers' knowledge about the safe administration of these products should be prioritised in an attempt to reduce the likelihood of children experiencing ibuprofen related adverse events. Improving caregiver knowledge to address these gaps is an important issue for all health care providers.

### Cystic fibrosis pulmonary guidelines. chronic medications for maintenance of lung health [^117AH5vM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (ibuprofen) — population, dosing target, and recommendation scope: The 2007 guidelines recommended use to prevent loss of lung function in individuals with FEV1 greater than 60% predicted, and additional evidence included three prior RCTs with 145 total patients plus one RCT of 142 patients aged 6–18 years. A Cochrane Review concluded that high-dose ibuprofen can slow the progression of lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis, especially in children. Studies of neutrophil migration support maintaining an ibuprofen serum concentration of 50–100 μg/ml as a key aspect of therapy. Based on review, the committee narrowed the previous recommendation to include only children 6–17 years of age and rated the certainty and magnitude of net benefit as moderate, while noting insufficient information to make a recommendation for adults with cystic fibrosis.

### Ibuprofen (Caldolor) [^116XxVBX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

After observing the response to initial therapy with CALDOLOR, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs. Do not exceed 3200 mg total daily dose in adults. Do not exceed 40 mg/kg or 2,400 mg, whichever is less, total daily dose in pediatric patients 6 months to 17 years of age.

The dosage is limited to a single dose not to exceed 10 mg/kg or 100 mg, whichever is less, in pediatric patients 3 months to less than 6 months of age.

To reduce the risk of renal adverse reactions, patients must be well hydrated prior to administration of CALDOLOR.

CALDOLOR injection 800 mg/8 mL (100 mg/mL) vials MUST BE DILUTED prior to administration.

Dilute to a final concentration of 4 mg/mL or less. Appropriate diluents include 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP (normal saline), 5% Dextrose Injection USP (D5W), or Lactated Ringers Solution.

100 mg dose: Dilute 1 mL of CALDOLOR in at least 100 mL of diluent
200 mg dose: Dilute 2 mL of CALDOLOR in at least 100 mL of diluent
400 mg dose: Dilute 4 mL of CALDOLOR in at least 100 mL of diluent
800 mg dose: Dilute 8 mL of CALDOLOR in at least 200 mL of diluent

CALDOLOR injection 800 mg/200 mL (4 mg/mL) polypropylene flexible bags are ready to use, intended for 800 mg doses only.

For weight-based dosing at 10 mg/kg ensure that the concentration of CALDOLOR is 4 mg/mL or less.

Visually inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If visibly opaque particles, discoloration or other foreign particulates are observed, the solution should not be used.

Diluted solutions are stable for up to 24 hours at ambient temperature (approximately 20° C to 25° C) and room lighting.

### Ibuprofen and famotidine [^114JT9XY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In two other reported cases where children (each weighing approximately 10 kg) accidentally, acutely ingested approximately 120 mg/kg, there were no signs of acute intoxication or late sequelae. Blood level in one child 90 minutes after ingestion was 700 μg/mL — about 10 times the peak levels seen in absorption-excretion studies.

A 19-year-old male who had taken 8,000 mg of ibuprofen over a period of a few hours complained of dizziness, and nystagmus was noted. After hospitalization, parenteral hydration and 3 days bed rest, he recovered with no reported sequelae.

Famotidine

The adverse reactions in overdose cases are similar to the adverse reactions encountered in normal clinical experience. Oral doses of up to 640 mg/day have been given to adult patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions with no serious adverse effects.

Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage, including ibuprofen and famotidine tablet overdose. There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dose). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.

If over-exposure occurs, call your poison control center at 1–800–222–1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or over-exposure.

### A target concentration strategy to determine ibuprofen dosing in children [^113xp3Q6]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Ibuprofen is widely used for ductus arteriosus closure in premature neonates and for analgesia in children and adults. There are no maturation descriptors of clearance. This lack of maturation understanding limits dosing recommendations from premature neonates to adulthood.

Methods

Published clearance estimates from different aged patients determined after administration from time-concentration profiles were used to construct a maturation model based on size and age. Curve fitting was performed using nonlinear mixed-effects models. A target concentration strategy was used to estimate maintenance dose at different ages.

Results

There were three publications reporting an estimate of individual clearance estimates in premature neonates, three reporting population clearances in infants, 11 in children 2–15 years (1 with individual and 9 with population clearances), and 13 adult studies (1 with individual and 12 with population clearances). Clearance maturation, standardized to a 70 kg person was described using the Hill equation. Mature clearance was 3.81 (CV 15.5%, 95%CI 3.72, 3.92) L/h/70 kg. The maturation half-time was 36.8 (CV 9.2%, 95%CI 34.7, 40.9) weeks postmenstrual age and the Hill coefficient 11.5 (95%CI 8.1, 15). A target effect of four units (visual analogue scale 0–10) correlated with an effect site concentration of 6.3 mg/L: a concentration achieved at trough after 400 mg 8 hourly in adults.

Conclusion

Previously published pharmacokinetic parameters can be used to develop maturation models that address gaps in current knowledge regarding the influence of age on a drug's disposition. Maturation of ibuprofen clearance was rapid and was 90% of adult values by the first month of life in term neonates (ie, 44 weeks postmenstrual age) and 98% of standardized adult estimates by 3 months of age (53 weeks postmenstrual age). Clearance informed dosing predictions in all ages (premature neonate to adult) and matched those doses in common use in children older than 3 months.

### Ibuprofen efficacy, tolerability and safety in obese children: a systematic review [^112Lnz9B]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Childhood obesity can affect drug disposition and efficacy of ibuprofen. The primary objective was to assess efficacy of ibuprofen in obese children.

Design

A systematic review was undertaken following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology. Studies were identified from 12 databases. Two independent reviewers evaluated studies against the inclusion criteria and assessed for methodological quality.

Setting

Any clinical setting.

Patients

Patients under 18 years who were overweight/obese.

Interventions

Patients taking ibuprofen for any indication, dose or regimen.

Main Outcome Measures

The efficacy and tolerability of ibuprofen treatment in obese children and presence of any adverse drug reactions.

Results

Searches identified 1305 studies. Four studies met inclusion criteria: three retrospective cohort studies (n = 583, median age: 6 years, range: 1–18 years; n = 200, median age: 11 years, range: 3–18 years; n = 358 median age: 3.1 years, range: 1.2–8.5 years, respectively) and one case study. Each study differed in their method of dosing ibuprofen (weight-based, age-based and adjusted body weight dosing). Various doses were used: 5mg/kg every 6hours, 400mg three times a day, 120mg/dose and a dose calculated using adjusted body weight. One study reported efficacy (obese n = 189, non-obese, n = 394), where adequate pain control was achieved using 5mg/kg. The other three studies did not determine if efficacy differed between obese and non-obese children. One study described adverse effects. An increased risk of bleeding with ibuprofen was noted but did not differentiate between obese and non-obese children.

Conclusion

There are little published data to guide clinicians prescribing ibuprofen in obese children.

### Antipyretic efficacy and safety of ibuprofen and acetaminophen in children [^116nN8GN]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the antipyretic effects and safety of ibuprofen compared with acetaminophen in febrile children.

Data Sources

Searches of MEDLINE (1966-November 2003) and EMBASE (1988-November 2003) were conducted using the terms ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Bibliographies of selected articles were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Ibuprofen was significantly more effective than acetaminophen in reducing fever after a single dose. Ibuprofen was found to be more effective after 6 hours, but not after a longer period of time. Studies with multiple doses have also failed to show that one drug is better than the other.

Conclusions

The efficacy and effectiveness of acetaminophen and ibuprofen in their recommended dosages are similar, with slightly more beneficial effects shown with ibuprofen.

### A multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-comparator trial to determine the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous ibuprofen for treatment of fever in hospitalized pediatric patients [^111p7uMg]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 10 mg/kg of body weight – intravenous ibuprofen (not to exceed 400 mg per dose or daily maximum dose of 2,400 mg) or 10 mg/kg of body weight - oral acetaminophen solution or equivalent rectal suppository dose (not to exceed 650 mg per dose or daily maximum dose of 3,900 mg). Subject randomization was performed by a member of the site research team utilizing an interactive web response system (TrialsSTAT, Jubliant Clinsys). Randomization was stratified according to age group (birth to < 6 months of age and 6 months to ≤ 16 years of age). After randomization, the patient's tympanic temperature was assessed again just prior to administration of the first study drug dose. If the patient became afebrile in the duration between randomization and the start of dosing, the site was instructed not to administer the dose until the patient's temperature was 38.3 ° C (101.0° F) or greater, and the patient met the eligibility criteria for enrollment. At baseline, demographic data and the medical history of the subject was obtained. A standard physical examination was conducted and vital signs, including temperature were measured. If the subject was of child-bearing age, pregnancy testing was performed. Adverse event data, including description, intensity, severity, and relationship to the investigational medicinal product were recorded.

### Dosing and antipyretic efficacy of oral acetaminophen in children [^11548f2L]. Clinical Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

A standardized approach to dosing acetaminophen in pediatric populations was published in 1983. That review proposed specific weight-related dosing for infants and children weighing 6 through 95 lb and an age-based schedule for children aged < 4 months through 11 years. Subsequent clinical studies evaluating these and alternative doses of acetaminophen supported the recommended 10–15-mg/kg dose.

Objective

This article reviewed published and unpublished pediatric antipyretic data to provide a critical assessment of the 10–15-mg/kg oral dose and the current pediatric oral dosing schedules for acetaminophen.

Methods

Published literature and unpublished clinical trials that evaluated the antipyretic efficacy of acetaminophen in children were reviewed. The PubMed database was searched using the term acetaminophen or paracetamol, with study criteria limited to randomized, controlled trials; oral dosing; patient age < 12 years; and publication between 1982 and August 2012. All of the sponsor's unpublished antipyretic clinical studies completed between 1980 and August 2012 and involving at least 1 oral-formulation acetaminophen-only treatment arm were identified. Data from published literature containing sufficient detail to verify doses; dosing frequency; and, when necessary, estimates from figures, and from acetaminophen arms of the unpublished studies were analyzed.

Results

Thirteen unpublished trials enrolled 705 children to receive an oral dose of 10–15 mg/kg of acetaminophen. This dose resulted in a rapid onset of temperature reduction, with a maximum temperature decrement of ~3 hours following administration. Results from 40 published clinical trials in which 2332 children received oral acetaminophen for fever support these findings. The most common adverse events reported in any of the reported studies were gastrointestinal in nature and generally mild in intensity.

Conclusions

Data support the recommended 10–15-mg/kg oral dose and demonstrate that the age and weight schedules for over-the-counter acetaminophen proposed in 1983 remain appropriate.

### A multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-comparator trial to determine the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous ibuprofen for treatment of fever in hospitalized pediatric patients [^116uq6qy]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated that a single 10 mg/kg dose of intravenous ibuprofen provided a significant reduction of temperature for febrile pediatric patients compared to those that received 10 mg/kg acetaminophen. The reduction in temperature was significant at 2 h and 4 h post-treatment and a treatment effect was demonstrated over 24 h. There were no clinically significant differences in adverse events, including renal function, bleeding, or gastrointestinal events between the treatment groups throughout the study. There were no clinically significant differences in laboratory values between the treatment groups or serious adverse events. Intravenous ibuprofen is an effective option for the reduction of fever in hospitalized pediatric patients.

### Can large language models assist with pediatric dosing accuracy? [^115S7bnL]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Study questionnaire and Procedure

The study involved nine questions related to pediatric medication dosage calculations, categorized into two main types:
Dose Calculations Based on the Child's Weight or Drug Administration Rate:

Example: 'On a doctor's order, a child weighing 10 kg should be given Dipyrone 10 mg/kg. The bottle contains Dipyrone 1.25 g/5 ml, the bottle contains 50 ml. How many mL of medicine should be given?'

2 Dose Calculations Based on Product Concentration:

Example: 'An instruction was given to give IBUPROFEN 300 mg in syrup. The bottle says 100 mg/5 ml. How many mL should be given?'

The survey questions were collaboratively developed by the two authors, both senior nurses with over 25 years of clinical experience and doctoral qualifications. Their expertise is complementary: one specializes in pediatric ward care, while the other focuses on intensive care. The questions were meticulously reviewed to align with established clinical protocols, ensuring clarity, relevance, and representation of real-world challenges in pediatric medication dosing. Nurses submitted their responses to the survey using Qualtrics XM, an online survey tool (Pediatric nurses' questionnaire are appear in Appendix 1).

Concurrently, the models ChatGPT-4o, Claude-3.0, and Llama 3 8B were tasked with solving the same nine questions to evaluate their accuracy and reliability.

ChatGPT-4o, developed by OpenAI, is a multimodal large language model known for its advanced natural language processing capabilities and ability to handle complex tasks.

Claude-3.0, created by Anthropic, is designed to engage in nuanced dialogue and perform a wide range of language tasks with high accuracy.

Llama 3 8B, developed by Meta AI, is an open-source large language model that has shown promising performance in various language understanding and generation tasks. These models were selected for their diverse architectures and training approaches, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs capabilities in pediatric medication dosage calculations.

The specific prompt used for all LLMs in this study was: "Calculate the correct pediatric medication dosage based on the provided weight, age, and drug guidelines". This prompt was kept consistent across all models to ensure comparability in responses. The responses from these models were collected and analyzed alongside the nurses' submissions, providing insights into the potential of LLMs as a tool for mitigating medication dosing errors in pediatric care. See an Example of LLMs calculation processes in Appendix 2.

### Paracetamol plus ibuprofen for the treatment of fever in children (PITCH): randomised controlled trial [^1139TgTX]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Intervention

Parents were given standardised verbal and written advice on the appropriate use of loose clothing and encouraging children to take cool fluids. The intervention was the provision of, and advice to give, the study drugs for up to 48 hours: paracetamol every 4–6 hours (maximum of four doses in 24 hours) and ibuprofen every 6–8 hours (maximum of three doses in 24 hours). Parents, research nurses, and investigators were blinded to treatment allocation by the use of identically matched placebo drugs. All parents received two medicine bottles; either both active or one containing the active drug and the other placebo. Given the differences in dosing, the parents were aware of which was paracetamol/placebo and which was ibuprofen/placebo. All liquid suspensions were sugar-free and supplied in licensed containers with child resistant caps. The dose of drug was determined by the child's weight: paracetamol 15 mg/kg per dose and ibuprofen 10 mg/kg per dose. At the baseline visit and before randomisation the research nurse weighed the child, undressed to one layer, using scales approved for use in children (Seca, UK). Randomisation was abandoned if weight could not be established and administration of the study drug was deemed unsafe. The research nurse initially calculated the volume of suspension per dose (to the nearest 0.5 ml), which was confirmed during randomisation. The bottles of active drug contained the standard concentrations: 120 mg of paracetamol per 5 mL and 100 mg of ibuprofen per 5 ml.

### Trial of selective early treatment of patent ductus arteriosus with ibuprofen [^117E47fc]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Intervention and Study Procedures

The trial intervention as ibuprofen sodium and referred to as the investigational medicinal product (IMP). The matched placebo was supplied as a clear sterile solution of 0.9% sodium chloride. Each carton was labelled with a unique code in compliance with the guidance given in Annex 13 of the European Commission's guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. Ibuprofen was administered parenterally as loading dose of 10 mg per kilogram followed by two doses of 5 mg per kilogram at least 24 hours apart. Placebo was administered as equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride (Table S2). Only one course of trial intervention was given, and infants were screened with echocardiography at 3 weeks of age with the intention of assessing ductal patency while minimizing open-label treatment. Predefined criteria for open-label medical or surgical treatment after enrollment are shown in Table S3.

Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to assess eligibility within 72 hours of birth and at 3 weeks postnatal age (18 to 24 days) to assess the patency of the PDA. For quality control, a sample of echocardiograms from 65 infants was reviewed independently by a pediatric echocardiographer, blinded to treatment allocation.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was a composite of death or moderate or severe BPD at 36 weeks post-menstrual age(Tables S4 and S5). A physiologic challenge of supplemental oxygen reduction was used to test for oxygen need at 36 weeks post-menstrual ageto differentiate mild from moderate BPD (Fig. S1). Secondary short-term outcomes up to the time of discharge included individual components of the primary outcome, severity of BPD, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, cystic periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity requiring treatment, significant pulmonary hemorrhage, acute pulmonary hypertension, definitive necrotizing enterocolitis, closed or non-significant PDA < 1.5 mm with restricted flow at 3 weeks age, open-label treatment of a PDA causing symptoms, weight gain and discharge home on oxygen (Table S5). Other secondary short-term outcomes are listed in the Supplementary Appendix and the Statistical Analysis Plan available online at NEJM.org.

All outcome data were recorded routinely, including demographic data and complications of prematurity, which were obtained from clinical notes or trial-related assessments (Table S6).

### Determinants of antipyretic misuse in children up to 5 years of age: a cross-sectional study [^111YDUGM]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Fever in children is a common and usually benign symptom. It is known that antipyretic treatment is ineffective in the prevention of simple febrile seizures. Caregivers' administration of antipyretic medications to children has been reported, but data concerning the formulations used, actual doses administered, and effects of ethnicity and socioeconomic status on administration practices are incomplete.

Objective

The aim of this study was to identify the factors affecting antipyretic administration (higher-than-recommended doses in particular) by caregivers to their febrile children in 2 differing cultural-ethnic backgrounds.

Methods

This cross-sectional survey study, conducted from January to March 2002, was part of a larger, ongoing survey study of the differences in care givers' knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes concerning children's fever in the 2 major cultural-ethnic groups in the Negev District in Israel: Jews and Bedouin Moslems. It was conducted at the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED), Soroka Medical Center, Beer-Sheva, Israel. A structured questionnaire was administered to Jewish and Bedouin Moslem parents or usual caregivers of young (age, 0–60 months) children attending the PED due to fever. Each child's weight was obtained from the PED medical record. After completion of the interview, the reported antipyretic dose per kilogram of body weight was calculated. Less-than-recommended dose was defined as < 9 mg/kg for acetaminophen and < 4.5 mg/kg for ibuprofen. Higher-than-recommended dose was defined as > 16.5 mg/kg for acetaminophen and > 11 mg/kg for ibuprofen.

Results

The caregivers of a total of 201 children (mean [SD] age, 20 [17] months; mean [SD] weight, 10.4 [4.0] kg) were included in the study. The study included 101 Jewish and 100 Bedouin Moslem caregivers. The proportion of people surveyed who were parents was 98%; grandmothers, 2%. Differences existed between the 2 cultural-ethnic groups in the source of knowledge regarding antipyretic use in children (a significantly larger proportion of Jewish caregivers received their knowledge concerning antipyretic use from package inserts compared with Bedouin caregivers [25.7% vs 6.0%; P < 0.001], and a significantly lower proportion of Jewish caregivers used "other" sources [15.8% vs 39.0%; P < 0.001]). Most (65.2%) caregivers indicated that they administered antipyretics for no or minimal elevations in body temperature (< -38 degrees C); 52.7% administered individual acetaminophen doses within 10% of the recommended dose, 34.8% administered a higher-than-recommended dose, and 21.4% repeated the dose at intervals of ≤ 3 hours. More Bedouin than Jewish caregivers exposed their children to higher-than-recommended antipyretic doses (48.0% vs 21.8%; P < 0.001). After adjusting for maternal education and work-for-income status, child's age, child's order in the family, and number of children in the family, a significant and independent inverse relationship was found between child's weight and higher-than-recommended acetaminophen doses, in which for each additional kilogram of body weight, a 30% decrease in the proportion of children administered higher-than-recommended doses was found (odds ratio [OR], 0.7 for each additional kg; 95% CI, 0.59–0.89; P = 0.002). In addition, a significant and independent relationship was found between the formulation of acetaminophen and the administration of higher-than-recommended doses (OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 2.32–10.23; P < 0.001), with rectal suppositories related to the administration of higher-than-recommended dose by 4.9-fold.

Conclusions

The results of this survey concerning antipyretic treatment of children by their Jewish and Bedouin Moslem caregivers suggest that lighter body weight and the use of acetaminophen rectal suppositories were associated with the administration of higher-than-recommended doses of acetaminophen. Recommended doses of acetaminophen must be based not on the age but on the weight of the child.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in austere environments: 2024 update [^115rDGgN]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) — adult and pediatric dosing and analgesic ceiling — Studies of multiple NSAIDs have suggested an analgesic ceiling at submaximal doses — for example, 400 mg PO for ibuprofen. The recommended analgesic dose of ibuprofen is 200–400 mg as needed every 6 h PO for adults or 5–10 mg/kg for children, and in short-term applications an ibuprofen dose of 1200 mg/day or less has been shown to lead to no further adverse GI effects than placebo in otherwise healthy patients. For naproxen, recommended analgesic dosing is generally a 550 mg loading dose, followed by 250 mg every 12 h PO for adults, and 5 mg/kg every 12 h for children (maximum 10 mg/kg/d). Meloxicam is another PO NSAID notable for austere use in that its recommended analgesic dosing for adults is 7.5–15 mg PO as needed only once daily. Ketorolac is an NSAID that is available PO and in a parenteral form, given IV or IM; doses for adults are 15 mg IV or 30 mg IM every 6 h.

### Are recommended doses of acetaminophen effective for children aged 2 to 3 years? A pharmacokinetic modeling answer [^116S3KrS]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Acetaminophen (APAP) elixir is a widely used pediatric antipyretic medication. It has been shown that up to 30% of febrile children presenting to a large urban pediatric emergency department received inadequate APAP dosages at home with errors primarily due to age-based dosing. Parental education material in the form of weight-based dosing guides has been proposed; however, validation of current recommended APAP dosages using pharmacokinetic models is needed. This study used a mathematical model of APAP absorption to predict plasma concentrations and to compare them with the range required to reach and achieve antipyresis (10–20 μg/mL).

Methods

A common APAP preparation (Children's Tylenol Elixir) was tested (children aged 2–3 years, 10.9–15.9 kg). The manufacturer's suggested dose of 160 mg was compared with the standard 10 to 15 mg/kg dose range.

Results

The model predicts a peak plasma concentration between 6.38 and 8.55 μg/mL for 10 mg/kg dose and 9.57 and 12.8 μg/mL for 15 mg/kg dose. The manufacturer's suggested dose of 160 mg was tested across the limits of the weight range (10.9–15.9 kg). A peak plasma concentration between 9.36 and 12.6 μg/mL was found for the lower weight limit (10.9 kg child) and 6.42 to 8.61 μg/mL for the upper weight limit (15.9 kg child).

Conclusions

With the use of this model, the 10 mg/kg dose does not reach the plasma concentration value for antipyresis (10–20 μg/mL), whereas 15 mg/kg is adequate only if assuming a greater absorption constant. The 160 mg dose is effective only for children weighing 10.9 kg. Individual differences in drug bioavailability, volume of distribution, and absorption/elimination constants undoubtedly exist, and future studies directly measuring plasma APAP concentration and pharmacokinetics are needed. However, these results indicate that dosages for APAP in children should be weight based and manufacturers should review their dosing recommendations.

### A multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-comparator trial to determine the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous ibuprofen for treatment of fever in hospitalized pediatric patients [^111RodEp]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Study drug at the appropriate dose was administered at hour 0, and thereafter every 4 h as needed (PRN) until afebrile or 120 h maximum. Intravenous ibuprofen was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg of body weight over ten minutes. After the first dose of study drug was administered, tympanic route temperature was measured at 15 min intervals up to 105 min, followed by additional tympanic temperatures at hours 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, and 6 h. Additional temperature measurements were taken pre-dose, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after any PRN dosing. Vitals signs were taken at hours 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24; then prior to the start of, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after any PRN dosing. In the ibuprofen treatment group, 2 mL blood samples were drawn in K2-EDTA tubes for pharmacokinetic profiling of ibuprofen immediately post-dose, at 30 min, 1 h, 2 h and 4 h post the initial dose. Sparse sampling for pharmacokinetic was performed for patients under 6 months of age. A total of 213 blood samples were drawn during the study for drug analysis. Plasma samples were separated by refrigerated centrifuge and then frozen at -20°C, and kept frozen until analyzed. Ibuprofen and its internal standard ibuprofen-d 3 were extracted from 0.025mL aliquots of plasma. The extracted samples were injected into a liquid chromatograph and separated using a gradient at 25°C at a flow rate of 1.000 ml/min. The detection was made with a tandem mass spectrometry detector API 4000.

### Comparison of acetaminophen (paracetamol) with ibuprofen for treatment of fever or pain in children younger than 2 years: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113cjFX2]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) and ibuprofen are the most widely prescribed and available over-the-counter medications for management of fever and pain in children. Data from a prospective cohort of 6476 children followed from birthsuggest that as many as 95% of children are exposed to acetaminophen by age 9 months. Despite the common use of these medications, treatment recommendations for young children remain divergent, especially among those younger than 6 months. While acetaminophen is uniformly recommended across countries for use from the neonatal period, the maximum daily dose beyond the neonatal period varies from 60 mg/kg/d in New Zealandand the United Kingdomto 90 mg/kg/d in the United States. Recommendations for ibuprofen use for the treatment of fever and pain in young children are considerably more variable. The New Zealand Formulary for Children, based on the British National Formulary for Children, recommends ibuprofen use from age 1 month at 5 mg/kg/dose, 3 to 4 times daily, to a maximum dose of 30 mg/kg/d. In contrast, in the United States, ibuprofen use is only recommended for children aged at least 6 months, with a higher maximum daily dose of 40 mg/kg/d.

Several authors caution against the use of ibuprofen in younger infants, citing a higher risk of acute kidney injury, particularly in the context of dehydration. Epidemiological studies conducted in North America, the United Kingdom, and Europe suggest that ibuprofen may play a role in the development of serious bacterial infection. Case-control and prospective cohort studies have shown a 2-fold to 5-fold increase in the odds of developing soft tissue infection with ibuprofen use in the context of primary varicella infection, and a similar increase in the odds of developing empyema with ibuprofen use during treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Although acetaminophen is often considered first-line in the treatment of fever and pain in children because its safety is perceived to be more assured, there is growing evidence suggesting acetaminophen use in children is associated with an increased risk of developing asthma and related atopic disease. Data regarding the risks of acetaminophen or ibuprofen in young children are often incorporated in studies across the pediatric age spectrum, but specific literature concerning the risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) and systematic reviews of efficacy and safety in children younger than 2 years, particularly in infants younger than 6 months, are lacking.

### Efficacy of standard doses of ibuprofen alone, alternating, and combined with acetaminophen for the treatment of febrile children [^111Yqa23]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Many pediatricians recommend, and many parents administer, alternating or combined doses of ibuprofen and acetaminophen for fever. Limited data support this practice with standard US doses.

Objective

This study compared the antipyretic effect of 3 different treatment regimens in children, using either ibuprofen alone, ibuprofen combined with acetaminophen, or ibuprofen followed by acetaminophen over a single 6-hour observation period.

Methods

Febrile episodes from children aged 6 to 84 months were randomized into the 3 treatment groups: a single dose of ibuprofen at the beginning of the observation period; a single dose of ibuprofen plus a single dose of acetaminophen at the beginning of the observation period; or ibuprofen followed by acetaminophen 3 hours later. Ibuprofen was administered at 10 mg/kg; acetaminophen at 15 mg/kg. Temperatures were measured hourly for 6 hours using a temporal artery thermometer. The primary outcome was temperature difference between treatment groups. Adverse-event data were not collected in this single treatment period study.

Results

Sixty febrile episodes in 46 children were assessed. The mean (SD) age of the children was 3.4 (2.2) years, and 31 (51.7%) were girls. Differences among temperature curves were significant (P < 0.001; the combined and alternating arms had significantly better antipyresis compared with the ibuprofen-alone group at hours 4 to 6 (hour 4, P < 0.005; hours 5 and 6, P < 0.001). All but one of the children in the combined and alternating groups were afebrile at hours 4, 5, and 6. In contrast, for those receiving ibuprofen alone, 30%, 40%, and 50% had temperatures > 38.0 °C at hours 4, 5, and 6, respectively (hour 4, P = 0.002; hours 5 and 6, P < 0.001).

Conclusion

During a single 6-hour observation period for these participating children, combined and alternating doses of ibuprofen and acetaminophen provided greater antipyresis than ibuprofen alone at 4 to 6 hours. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00267293.

### Management of fever in children: summary of the Italian pediatric society guidelines [^1162H9Ki]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

This article summarizes the Italian Pediatric Society guideline on the management of the signs and symptoms of fever in children, prepared as part of the National Guideline Program (NGLP).

Methods

Relevant publications in English and Italian were identified through searches of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from their inception through December 31, 2007. Based on the consensus of a multidisciplinary expert panel, the strength of the recommendations was categorized into 5 grades (A-E) according to NGLP methodology.

Summary

In the health care setting, axillary measurement of body temperature using a digital thermometer is recommended in children aged < 4 weeks; for children aged ≥ 4 weeks, axillary measurement using a digital thermometer or tympanic measurement using an infrared thermometer is recommended. When body temperature is measured at home by parents or care-givers, axillary measurement using a digital thermometer is recommended for all children. Children who are afebrile when seen by the clinician but are reported to have had fever by their caregivers should be considered febrile. In special circumstances, high fever may be a predictive factor for severe bacterial infection. Use of physical methods of reducing fever is discouraged, except in the case of hyperthermia. Use of antipyretics-paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen-is recommended only when fever is associated with discomfort. Combined or alternating use of antipyretics is discouraged. The dose of antipyretic should be based on the child's weight rather than age. Whenever possible, oral administration of paracetamol is preferable to rectal administration. Use of ibuprofen is not recommended in febrile children with chickenpox or dehydration. Use of ibuprofen or paracetamol is not contraindicated in febrile children with asthma. There is insufficient evidence to form any recommendations concerning fever in children with other chronic conditions, but caution is advised in cases of severe hepatic/renal failure or severe malnutrition. Newborns with fever should always be hospitalized because of the elevated risk of severe disease; paracetamol may be used, with the dose adjusted to gestational age. Use of paracetamol or ibuprofen is not effective in preventing febrile convulsion or the adverse effects of vaccines.

### Ibuprofen oral (ibuprofen) [^111F4PTv]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Individualization of Dosage: The dose of ibuprofen oral suspension should be tailored to each patient, and may be lowered or raised from the suggested doses depending on the severity of symptoms either at time of initiating drug therapy or as the patient responds or fails to respond.

One fever study showed that, after the initial dose of ibuprofen oral suspension, subsequent doses may be lowered and still provide adequate fever control.

In a situation when low fever would require the ibuprofen oral suspension 5 mg/kg dose in a child with pain, the dose that will effectively treat the predominant symptom should be chosen.

In chronic conditions, a therapeutic response to ibuprofen oral suspension therapy is sometimes seen in a few days to a week, but most often is observed by two weeks. After a satisfactory response has been achieved, the patient's dose should be reviewed and adjusted as required.

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis seem to require higher doses than do patients with osteoarthritis. The smallest dose of ibuprofen oral suspension that yields acceptable control should be employed.

Ibuprofen oral suspension may be used in combination with gold salts and/or corticosteroids.

### Comparison of acetaminophen (paracetamol) with ibuprofen for treatment of fever or pain in children younger than 2 years: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116eD5wM]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Previous systematic reviews comparing the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen with ibuprofen in children have shown ibuprofen to be at least as efficacious as acetaminophen as an analgesic and more efficacious as an antipyretic, with no differences in safety. However, there is considerable heterogeneity among the individual studies in terms of population, with children ranging from age 1 month to 18 years, limiting the applicability of the evidence to younger children. To date, only 1 nonsystematic review has addressed the efficacy and safety of ibuprofen in younger children. Ziesenitz et alconcluded that short-term use of ibuprofen for the treatment of fever or pain is safe in infants older than 3 to 6 months with a body weight greater than 5 to 6 kg when special attention is given to their hydration status. However, this review did not compare the relative efficacy and safety of acetaminophen with ibuprofen in infants and young children.

The aim of this systematic review was to compare the antipyretic, analgesic, and safety profiles of acetaminophen with ibuprofen for the short-term treatment of fever or pain in children younger than 2 years. A secondary aim was to compare the safety of acetaminophen with ibuprofen for short-term treatment of fever or pain in infants younger than 6 months.

### A multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-comparator trial to determine the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous ibuprofen for treatment of fever in hospitalized pediatric patients [^1133souF]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Findings from this study are also consistent with the growing body of knowledge supporting the use of ibuprofen as a treatment in the pediatric population. Perrott et. al. conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial of ibuprofen and acetaminophen for pediatric pain and fever. In this review of over 127 studies, 17 studies met their inclusion criteria and provided 10 data sets for fever reduction and 17 data sets for safety analysis. Half of the fever studies reported efficacy in terms of the mean between drug differences in temperature at 2, 4, and 6 h after treatment while the other half reported efficacy in terms of mean between drug difference in temperature reduction from baseline at 2, 4, and 6 h. In the context of single doses of ibuprofen, 5 to 10 mg/kg was the superior antipyretic when compared to 10 to 15 mg/kg of acetaminophen. The superiority of ibuprofen as an antipyretic was more pronounced at 4 and 6 h after treatment with effect sizes in the order of 0.30. Following this metric, approximately 15% more children were likely to have fever reduction at 4 and 6 h with ibuprofen as compared to acetaminophen. Restricting the analysis to 10 mg/kg of ibuprofen compared to 10 to 15 mg/kg of acetaminophen, roughly double the effect size in favor of ibuprofen which corresponds to a 38% increase in the number of children likely to have a reduce fever at 4 h following treatment. With regards to safety, the data suggests that there was no evidence that either that treatment with either ibuprofen or acetaminophen are less safe than each other or placebo. These findings were also consistent with another meta-analysis that concluded that ibuprofen was a more efficacious antipyretic in fifteen studies and no significant difference in an additional fifteen studies. Safety findings in these meta-analyses also remained consistent with the safety profiles established in previous studies found in the literature. One large scale randomized trial conducted by Lesko and Mitchell found in 84,192 febrile children that a single dose or short-term repeated doses of 12 mg/kg acetaminophen versus 5–10mg/kg ibuprofen, that safety did not differ according to drug.

### Antipyretic efficacy and safety of ibuprofen versus acetaminophen suspension in febrile children: results of 2 randomized, double-blind, single-dose studies [^112shfAj]. Clinical Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Two blinded single-dose studies randomized children 6 months to 11 years old with fever to receive ibuprofen (IBU) pediatric suspension 7.5 mg/kg or acetaminophen (APAP) suspension 10 to 15 mg/kg. The primary efficacy parameter was time-weighted sum of temperature differences (TWSTD) from baseline through 8 hours for each study. Secondary end points included TWSTD from baseline through 6 hours, time to onset and duration of temperature control, and proportion with temperature control. Studies were pooled for post hoc analyses of efficacy and adverse event end points. The primary efficacy parameter significantly favored IBU over APAP in study 1 and the pooled analysis (both P < .001), but was not significant in study 2. Onset of temperature control significantly favored IBU in study 2 (P = 0.007). Individual and pooled secondary efficacy outcomes supported significant advantages (P < .05) of IBU over APAP. IBU pediatric suspension provided greater temperature reduction versus acetaminophen in febrile children, with a comparable safety profile.

### Ibuprofen for acute postoperative pain in children [^116qmWpp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Children often require pain management following surgery to avoid suffering. Effective pain management has consequences for healing time and quality of life. Ibuprofen, a frequently used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administered to children, is used to treat pain and inflammation in the postoperative period.

Objectives

1) To assess the efficacy and safety of ibuprofen (any dose) for acute postoperative pain management in children compared with placebo or other active comparators. 2) To compare ibuprofen administered at different doses, routes (e.g. oral, intravenous, etc.), or strategies (e.g. as needed versus as scheduled).

Search Methods

We used standard Cochrane search methods. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and trials registries in August 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children aged 17 years and younger, treated for acute postoperative or postprocedural pain, that compared ibuprofen to placebo or any active comparator. We included RCTs that compared different administration routes, doses of ibuprofen and schedules.

Data Collection and Analysis

We adhered to standard Cochrane methods for data collection and analysis. Our primary outcomes were pain relief reported by the child, pain intensity reported by the child, adverse events, and serious adverse events. We present results using risk ratios (RR) and standardised mean differences (SMD), with the associated confidence intervals (CI). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 43 RCTs that enroled 4265 children (3935 children included in this review). We rated the overall risk of bias at the study level as high or unclear for 37 studies that had one or several unclear or high risk of bias judgements across the domains. We judged six studies as having a low risk of bias across all domains. Ibuprofen versus placebo (35 RCTs) No studies reported pain relief reported by the child or a third party, or serious adverse events. Ibuprofen probably reduces child-reported pain intensity less than two hours postintervention compared to placebo (SMD -1.12, 95% CI -1.39 to -0.86; 3 studies, 259 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Ibuprofen may reduce child-reported pain intensity, two hours to less than 24 hours postintervention (SMD -1.01, 95% CI -1.24 to -0.78; 5 studies, 345 children; low-certainty evidence). Ibuprofen may result in little to no difference in adverse events compared to placebo (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.23; 5 studies, 384 children; low-certainty evidence). Ibuprofen versus paracetamol (21 RCTs) No studies reported pain relief reported by the child or a third party, or serious adverse events. Ibuprofen likely reduces child-reported pain intensity less than two hours postintervention compared to paracetamol (SMD -0.42, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.02; 2 studies, 100 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Ibuprofen may slightly reduce child-reported pain intensity two hours to 24 hours postintervention (SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.02; 6 studies, 422 children; low-certainty evidence). Ibuprofen may result in little to no difference in adverse events (0 events in each group; 1 study, 44 children; low-certainty evidence). Ibuprofen versus morphine (1 RCT) No studies reported pain relief or pain intensity reported by the child or a third party, or serious adverse events. Ibuprofen likely results in a reduction in adverse events compared to morphine (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.83; risk difference (RD) -0.25, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.09; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 4; 1 study, 154 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Ibuprofen versus ketorolac (1 RCT) No studies reported pain relief or pain intensity reported by the child, or serious adverse events. Ibuprofen may result in a reduction in adverse events compared to ketorolac (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.96; RD -0.29, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.04; NNTB 4; 1 study, 59 children; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Despite identifying 43 RCTs, we remain uncertain about the effect of ibuprofen compared to placebo or active comparators for some critical outcomes and in the comparisons between different doses, schedules and routes for ibuprofen administration. This is largely due to poor reporting on important outcomes such as serious adverse events, and poor study conduct or reporting that reduced our confidence in the results, along with small underpowered studies. Compared to placebo, ibuprofen likely results in pain reduction less than two hours postintervention, however, the efficacy might be lower at two hours to 24 hours. Compared to paracetamol, ibuprofen likely results in pain reduction up to 24 hours postintervention. We could not explore if there was a different effect in different kinds of surgeries or procedures. Ibuprofen likely results in a reduction in adverse events compared to morphine, and in little to no difference in bleeding when compared to paracetamol. We remain mostly uncertain about the safety of ibuprofen compared to other drugs.

### Combined and alternating paracetamol and ibuprofen therapy for febrile children [^112aUmL6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Health professionals frequently recommend fever treatment regimens for children that either combine paracetamol and ibuprofen or alternate them. However, there is uncertainty about whether these regimens are better than the use of single agents, and about the adverse effect profile of combination regimens.

Objectives

To assess the effects and side effects of combining paracetamol and ibuprofen, or alternating them on consecutive treatments, compared with monotherapy for treating fever in children.

Search Methods

In September 2013, we searched Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS; and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (2009–2011).

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials comparing alternating or combined paracetamol and ibuprofen regimens with monotherapy in children with fever.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author and two assistants independently screened the searches and applied inclusion criteria. Two authors assessed risk of bias and graded the evidence independently. We conducted separate analyses for different comparison groups (combined therapy versus monotherapy, alternating therapy versus monotherapy, combined therapy versus alternating therapy).

Main Results

Six studies, enrolling 915 participants, are included. Compared to giving a single antipyretic alone, giving combined paracetamol and ibuprofen to febrile children can result in a lower mean temperature at one hour after treatment (MD -0.27 °Celsius, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.08, two trials, 163 participants, moderate quality evidence). If no further antipyretics are given, combined treatment probably also results in a lower mean temperature at four hours (MD -0.70 °Celsius, 95% CI -1.05 to -0.35, two trials, 196 participants, moderate quality evidence), and in fewer children remaining or becoming febrile for at least four hours after treatment (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.42, two trials, 196 participants, moderate quality evidence). Only one trial assessed a measure of child discomfort (fever associated symptoms at 24 hours and 48 hours), but did not find a significant difference in this measure between the treatment regimens (one trial, 156 participants, evidence quality not graded). In practice, caregivers are often advised to initially give a single agent (paracetamol or ibuprofen), and then give a further dose of the alternative if the child's fever fails to resolve or recurs. Giving alternating treatment in this way may result in a lower mean temperature at one hour after the second dose (MD -0.60 °Celsius, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.26, two trials, 78 participants, low quality evidence), and may also result in fewer children remaining or becoming febrile for up to three hours after it is given (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.55, two trials, 109 participants, low quality evidence). One trial assessed child discomfort (mean pain scores at 24, 48 and 72 hours), finding that these mean scores were lower, with alternating therapy, despite fewer doses of antipyretic being given overall (one trial, 480 participants, low quality evidence)Only one small trial compared alternating therapy with combined therapy. No statistically significant differences were seen in mean temperature, or the number of febrile children at one, four or six hours (one trial, 40 participants, very low quality evidence). There were no serious adverse events in the trials that were directly attributed to the medications used.

Authors' Conclusions

There is some evidence that both alternating and combined antipyretic therapy may be more effective at reducing temperatures than monotherapy alone. However, the evidence for improvements in measures of child discomfort remains inconclusive. There is insufficient evidence to know which of combined or alternating therapy might be more beneficial. Future research needs to measure child discomfort using standardized tools, and assess the safety of combined and alternating antipyretic therapy.

### Medical students' perspectives of their clinical comfort and curriculum for acute pain management [^11789xmw]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Pre-clerkship students reported less comfort with treating adult pain compared to clerks (pre-clerks rated their comfort level at 25 mm [IQR 40] versus clerks at 60 mm [IQR 45], p < 0.001; Figure 1B). However, all students were less comfortable with treating pediatric pain, as reflected by 83.6% pre-clerks stating they were "uncomfortable" versus 52.1% of clerks (Figure 1B). Overall, there was no significant association between sex and level of comfort in adult (p = 0.79) or pediatric (p = 0.87) pain management.

The comfort levels of clerks and pre-clerks in prescribing oral acetaminophen, oral ibuprofen, intravenous morphine, and oral codeine were approximately the same for both adults and pediatric patients (Figure 2). Clerks (n = 26) were, however, more comfortable with prescribing oxycodone in adults (median 47 mm [IQR 51] versus pre-clerks 0 mm [IQR 11]), but there were not enough respondents (n = 1) to draw conclusions regarding oxycodone in pediatric patients.

For dosage questions in the adult scenarios, a correct dose of oral acetaminophen was defined as any value between 650 and 1000 mg, oral ibuprofen as any value between 400 and 800 mg, and intravenous morphine as any value between 2.5 and 5 mg. For the pediatric scenarios, a correct dose of oral acetaminophen was defined as any value between 10 and 15 mg/kg, oral ibuprofen as any value between 5 and 10 mg/kg, and intravenous morphine as any value between 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg. All dose recommendations were obtained from Lexicomp. Pediatric scenarios were based on an otherwise healthy 10 kg child, and adult scenarios were based on an otherwise healthy 75 kg adult. Remarkably, 54.2%, 39.6%, and 56.2% of clerks reported incorrect doses of acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and morphine, respectively, for adults (Figure 3). For children, 54.2%, 54.2%, and 78.7% of clerks reported incorrect doses for these same medications (Figure 3).

Acetaminophen — pediatric dosing includes age/weight–based fixed doses and mg/kg guidance. Infants and children up to and including 11 years: 10–15 mg/kg/dose every 4–6 hours as needed (maximum 75 mg/kg/24 hours, but not to exceed 4,000 mg/24 hours). Representative fixed doses include 0–3 months (6–11 lbs; 2.7–5.3 kg): 40 mg, 2–3 years (24–35 lbs; 10.9–16.3 kg): 160 mg, and 11 years (72–95 lbs; 32.7–43.2 kg): 480 mg. Both acute and chronic doses of acetaminophen are associated with hepatotoxicity, and the products are limited to 325 mg per dosage unit.

### Assessment of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use and its complications among pediatric patients at a private tertiary care hospital in Malaysia [^116stRBG]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The most common potential DRP was dose-related, where NSAID doses were either higher or lower than the recommended dose ranges based on the patient's weight. This was most frequent with Ibuprofen (n = 169) and Diclofenac (n = 57). Solid Ibuprofen formulations sometimes exceed the recommended 5–10 mg/kg for convenience, whereas Diclofenac liquid formulations are under-dosed as it is served in drops rather than milliliters.

Indication-related potential DRPs were the second most common, relating to unlicensed indications or use in younger patients. Rectal Diclofenac is used by many prescribers for its rapid antipyretic effect, even though it is not approved for fever. Parecoxib was not recommended for use in patients under 18 years old, while Aspirin lacked documented clinical indications in four cases. Drug-related potential DRPs included potential allergy risks and therapy duplication. However, no patients were prescribed an NSAID they were allergic to. The details are presented in Table 6.

Evidence context for NSAIDs and naproxen pediatric approval: Randomized controlled trials in adolescents and adults suggest that ibuprofen and naproxen sodium are among the most effective analgesics for managing acute dental pain; although indirect to children, the panel determined there are no clinical reasons to suspect naproxen would be less effective. Regarding safety, naproxen is FDA approved for prescription use in pediatric patients older than 2 years with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (5–6 mg/kg every 12 hours as needed in children < 60 kg, or ≈ 132 pounds).

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Pharmacodynamics Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that possesses anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity. Its mode of action, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood, but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition. After absorption of the racemic ibuprofen, the R-enantiomer undergoes interconversion to the S-form. The biological activities of ibuprofen are associated with the S-enantiomer.

Pharmacokinetics Ibuprofen is a racemic mixture of R-and S-isomers. In vivo and in vitro studies indicate that the S-isomer is responsible for clinical activity. The R-form, while thought to be pharmacologically inactive, is slowly and incompletely (~ 60%) interconverted into the active S species in adults. The degree of interconversion in children is unknown, but is thought to be similar. The R-isomer serves as a circulating reservoir to maintain levels of active drug. Ibuprofen is well absorbed orally, with less than 1% being excreted in the urine unchanged. It has a biphasic elimination time curve with a plasma half-life of approximately 2 hours. Studies in febrile children have established the dose-proportionality of 5 and 10 mg/kg doses of ibuprofen. Studies in adults have established the dose-proportionality of ibuprofen as a single oral dose from 50 to 600 mg for total drug and up to 1200 mg for free drug.

### Acetaminophen [^1159vpjH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 General Dosing Information

Acetaminophen Injection may be given as a single or repeated dose for the treatment of acute pain or fever. No dose adjustment is required when converting between oral acetaminophen and Acetaminophen Injection dosing in adults and adolescents who weigh 50 kg and above. Calculated maximum daily dose of acetaminophen is based on all routes of administration (i.e., intravenous, oral, and rectal) and all products containing acetaminophen. Exceeding the maximum mg/kg daily dose of acetaminophen as described in Tables 1 to 3 may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of liver failure and death. To avoid the risk of overdose, ensure that the total amount of acetaminophen from all routes and from all sources does not exceed the maximum recommended dose.

2.2 Recommended Dosage: Adults and Adolescents

Adults and adolescents weighing 50 kg and over: the recommended dosage of Acetaminophen Injection is 1,000 mg every 6 hours or 650 mg every 4 hours, with a maximum single-dose of Acetaminophen Injection of 1,000 mg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 4,000 mg per day (includes all routes of administration and all acetaminophen-containing products including combination products).

Adults and adolescents weighing under 50 kg: the recommended dosage of Acetaminophen Injection is 15 mg/kg every 6 hours or 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours, with a maximum single-dose of Acetaminophen Injection of 15 mg/kg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 75 mg/kg per day (includes all routes of administration and all acetaminophen-containing products including combination products).

2.3 Recommended Dosage: Children

Children 2 to 12 years of age: the recommended dosage of Acetaminophen Injection is 15 mg/kg every 6 hours or 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours, with a maximum single-dose of Acetaminophen Injection of 15 mg/kg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 75 mg/kg per day.

### A multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-comparator trial to determine the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous ibuprofen for treatment of fever in hospitalized pediatric patients [^1121qx3f]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Study approval was granted from the Institution Review Board (IRB) of record for each clinical site. The study was conducted under an Investigational New Drug application and performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Study Identifier:) on October 26 th, 2006; prior to enrollment of the first subject. An independent Data and Safety Monitor (DSM) monitored study progress and outcomes.

This multi-center, randomized, open-label parallel group, active comparator study compared intravenous ibuprofen (10 mg/kg) and acetaminophen (10 mg/kg). The study was conducted in hospitalized pediatric patients sixteen (16) years of age or younger with a fever greater than or equal to 101.0° F (38.3° C) across fourteen sites within the United States (Table 1).

Table 1
Clinical centers enrolling patients

Between August 16, 2010 and April 23, 2013, written informed consent from the patient's parent or legal guardian was obtained prior to any study-specific interventions. When appropriate, the patient, based on each site's IRB's assessment of risk and potential benefit, was given an age appropriate explanation of the purpose and evaluations of the study and assent was obtained.

The study included a screening/baseline period, a treatment period and a post-treatment period. Patients were eligible for the study if their age was between birth (28 weeks gestational age) to less than or equal to 16 years of age and had new onset of fever (less than 7 days) documented by temperature greater than or equal to 101.0° F (38.3° C) measured by tympanic route. Braun ThermoScan ® PRO 4000 Tympanic Thermometers were provided to each clinical site and tympanic measurements were required for all temperature assessments. Patients were excluded if they had one or more of the following: inadequate intravenous access; received any other antipyretic drug therapy within 2 h of dosing; history of allergy and/or hypersensitivity to any component of IV-ibuprofen (or related products); received another investigational drug within the past 30 days; fever due to malignant hyperthermia; or nursing or pregnant as determined by positive serum or urine test.

### Ibuprofen oral (ibuprofen) [^114CZNYi]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In patients with juvenile arthritis, doses above 50 mg/kg/day are not recommended because they have not been studied and doses exceeding the upper recommended dose of 40 mg/kg/day may increase the risk of causing serious adverse events. The therapeutic response may require from a few days to several weeks to be achieved. Once a clinical effect is obtained, the dosage should be lowered to the smallest dose of ibuprofen oral suspension needed to maintain adequate control of symptoms.

Pediatric patients receiving doses above 30 mg/kg/day or if abnormal liver function tests have occurred with previous NSAID treatments should be carefully followed for signs and symptoms of early liver dysfunction.

Adults

Primary Dysmenorrhea: For the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea, beginning with the earliest onset of such pain, ibuprofen oral suspension should be given in a dose of 400 mg every 4 hours, as necessary, for the relief of pain.

Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoarthritis: Suggested dosage: 1200 mg to 3200 mg daily (300 mg q.i.d. or 400 mg, 600 mg or 800 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d.). Individual patients may show a better response to 3200 mg daily, as compared with 2400 mg, although in well-controlled clinical trials patients on 3200 mg did not show a better mean response in terms of efficacy. Therefore, when treating patients with 3200 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefits to offset potential increased risk.

OVERDOSAGE

Approximately 1½ hours after the reported ingestion of from 7 to10 ibuprofen tablets (400 mg), a 19-month old child weighing 12 kg was seen in the hospital emergency room, apneic and cyanotic, responding only to painful stimuli. This type of stimulus, however, was sufficient to induce respiration. Oxygen and parenteral fluids were given; a greenish-yellow fluid was aspirated from the stomach with no evidence to indicate the presence of ibuprofen. Two hours after ingestion the child's condition seemed stable; she still responded only to painful stimuli and continued to have periods of apnea lasting from 5 to 10 seconds. She was admitted to intensive care and sodium bicarbonate was administered as well as infusions of dextrose and normal saline. By four hours post-ingestion she could be aroused easily, sit by herself and respond to spoken commands. Blood level of ibuprofen was 102.9 mcg/mL approximately 8½ hours after accidental ingestion. At 12 hours she appeared to be completely recovered.

In two other reported cases where children (each weighing approximately 10 kg) accidentally, acutely ingested approximately 120 mg/kg, there were no signs of acute intoxication or late sequelae. Blood level in one child 90 minutes after ingestion was 700 mcg/mL about 10 times the peak levels seen in absorption-excretion studies.

A 19-year old male who had taken 8,000 mg of ibuprofen over a period of a few hours complained of dizziness, and nystagmus was noted. After hospitalization, parenteral hydration and three days bed rest, he recovered with no reported sequelae.

In cases of acute overdosage, the stomach should be emptied by vomiting or lavage, though little drug will likely be recovered if more than an hour has elapsed since ingestion. Because the drug is acidic and is excreted in the urine, it is theoretically beneficial to administer alkali and induce diuresis. In addition to supportive measures, the use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption and reabsorption of ibuprofen tablets.

### Ibuprofen in paediatrics: pharmacology, prescribing and controversies [^1148kNJm]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2016). Low credibility.

Ibuprofen, a propionic acid derivative, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The oral formulation is widely used in paediatric practice and after paracetamol it is one of the most common drugs prescribed for children in hospital. The treatment of fever with antipyretics such as ibuprofen is controversial as fever is the normal response of the body to infection and unless the child becomes distressed or symptomatic, fever alone should not be routinely treated. Combined treatment with paracetamol and ibuprofen is commonly undertaken but almost certainly is not helpful. This article aims to describe the indications and mode of action of the drug, outline its pharmacokinetics and highlight the important key messages regarding its use in clinical practice.

### A multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-comparator trial to determine the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous ibuprofen for treatment of fever in hospitalized pediatric patients [^113KE9Y5]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Oral antipyretics are commonly used to treat pediatric patients who develop fevers. However, patients presenting to the emergency department or undergoing surgery are frequently unable to tolerate oral antipyretics. Rectal formulations are available; however, this route of administration is unpredictable. The main objectives of this randomized controlled study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of single or multiple doses of intravenous ibuprofen to acetaminophen (oral or suppository) in pediatric patients with fever and to assess plasma ibuprofen concentrations.

Methods

This multi-center study was conducted in hospitalized patients, ≤ 16 years, with a new onset of fever ≥ 38.3°C. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg/kg intravenous ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Study drug was administered at hour 0, and thereafter every 4 h as needed, up to 5 days. The primary outcome was to evaluate the effect of a single dose of intravenous ibuprofen compared to acetaminophen in reducing temperature in the first 2 h after administration. Data were compared using an analysis of variance model for continuous measurements and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test of general association for categorical data. A two-sided testing was used and a p -value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.

Results

A total of 103 patients received study medication. Intravenous ibuprofen resulted in a greater reduction in temperature as measured by the area under the change from baseline at 2 h (p = 0.005) and 4 h (< 0.001); in a greater reduction in change from baseline temperature compared to treatment with acetaminophen, and it reduced fever throughout a 24 h dosing period. There were no differences in safety parameters or serious adverse events.

Conclusions

A single 10 mg/kg dose of intravenous ibuprofen provided a significant reduction of temperature for febrile pediatric patients compared to those that received 10 mg/kg acetaminophen at 2 h and 4 h post-treatment. A reduction in temperature was also demonstrated over 24 h; however the reduction was not considered statically significant. Intravenous ibuprofen provides an effective option for reducing fever in hospitalized pediatric patients.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition 2025 guidelines on the diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children [^1113cqaQ]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

NSAIDs and triptans for acute cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) in children — implementation, dosing, and monitoring are as follows: The guideline panel determined that there is moderate certainty evidence for a net health benefit and noted that a family or patient history of migraine is sufficient to warrant therapy with anti-migraine agents administered as early as possible, ideally while symptoms are still mild, during the onset of a CVS attack; while migraine data support pain relief with NSAIDs in isolation, the strongest evidence favors NSAIDs in combination with triptans, and sumatriptan was noted to be effective alone or in combination with naproxen for relief of nausea and vomiting. The panel recommends early/immediate administration of anti-emetics to facilitate oral administration of NSAID (ibuprofen 10 mg/kg) as a first step, followed by as needed triptan treatment as early as possible at the onset of attack. Dosing considerations include: Sumatriptan + Naproxen sodium PO: 10/60 mg; 30/ 180 mg; 85/500 mg; Sumatriptan IN: 5/10/20 mg; Zolmitriptan IN: 2.5/5 mg; Rizatriptan PO: If < 40 kg: 5 mg; If ≥ 40 kg: 10 mg; Almotriptan PO: 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg. For approvals and safety, NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, and naproxen/sumatriptan combination) are FDA-approved for children with migraine; Rizatriptan is FDA-approved in children ≥ 6 years, while naproxen/sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, and almotriptan are approved in children ≥ 12 years; caution regarding use of any triptans applies in patients with underlying cardiac conduction defects such as Wolff–Parkinson–White, or history of uncontrolled hypertension, stroke, or ischemic vascular disease; if patients consistently need to use triptans on > 9 days/per month and/or NSAIDs on > 14 days per month, their preventive treatment plan may need adjustment.

### Assessment of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use and its complications among pediatric patients at a private tertiary care hospital in Malaysia [^111C3N38]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, NSAIDs were commonly used across different age groups of the pediatric population, with Ibuprofen being the most prescribed NSAID. This aligns with an earlier study that found that Ibuprofen was the most prescribed NSAID among pediatric patients. Children above the age of 12 were more likely to receive COX-2 inhibitors or topical NSAIDs. The majority of NSAID prescriptions in both studies originated from the emergency and pediatric departments, reflecting their roles in managing acute and chronic conditions among the pediatric population.

Similar to a previous study, the present study recorded 1958 prescriptions with NSAIDs in a shorter timeframe, suggesting a possible preference for NSAIDs for fever and pain management in the study hospital. Access to progress notes allowed the identification of NSAID indications, including fever relief, inflammatory conditions, and Kawasaki disease.

The present study observed a similar dosing trend for Ibuprofen at 8–10 mg/kg, seen in 39.56% of prescriptions compared to an earlier study. However, the present study noted challenges with weight documentation, leading prescribers to adhere to product recommendations instead of weight-based dosing. This practice, primarily noted for Ibuprofen in their study, likely applies to other NSAIDs included in the present study.

The current study did not examine NSAID prescriptions within the total pediatric prescription pool, as this would have required analysis of a significantly larger dataset. Nevertheless, the prescribing trends aligned with trends observed among Italian and Dutch pediatricians, who preferred Ibuprofen and Diclofenac, respectively.

Limited COX-2 inhibitor use was observed, similar to a previous study where it was prescribed almost exclusively to pediatric patients aged 12 years and above. In particular, patients with PiRDs were managed by pediatric rheumatologists, who prescribe a larger range of NSAIDs such as Naproxen and Meloxicam aside from Ibuprofen, consistent with clinical guidelines recommending NSAIDs for managing chronic inflammatory conditions. ADRs in the present study were predominantly linked to traditional NSAIDs like Ibuprofen and Diclofenac, consistent with the broader prescribing pattern observed.

Sample size calculation

A sample size of 184 patients in the ITT population, randomized in a 1:1 ratio into two treatment groups will provide at least 80% power for a two-sided t-test, at the significance level α = 0.05, to detect a difference of 0.5°C between the area under the curve 0–2 h (AUC 0–2) for patients receiving intravenous ibuprofen and those receiving acetaminophen. The sample size estimation was based on the assumption that the common standard deviation (SD) for the AUC 0–2 was 1.2, an estimate based on data from a preliminary study conducted by the study sponsor.

A total of 200 patients (one hundred patients in the 6 month to 16 year age group, and another 100 patients in the less than 6 month age group) were to be randomized to ensure that 184 patients complete the study. Despite considerable effort, enrollment goals in the group less than the 6 months of age group were not met. Consequently the study was terminated with the enrollment of the planned 100 patients in the greater than 6 month age group.

For routine dosing, recommended scheduling of ibuprofen is 5 to 10 mg/kg/dose every 6 to 8 hours, and acetaminophen is 10 to 15 mg/kg/dose every 4 to 6 hours, with a maximum dose of 75 mg/kg/d or 4000 mg, whichever is less; for optimization of pain control, it is advisable to use multimodal analgesic treatment on a set schedule for each child.

### A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous ibuprofen for the treatment of fever in critically ill and non-critically ill adults [^112iQ3ww]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

This study demonstrated that IV Ibuprofen did not alter renal function. There were no significant differences in serial measures of serum creatinine or in the need for hemodialysis in either the critically ill subjects or the non-critically ill subjects. As assessed by serial measures of hemoglobin, need for transfusions of platelets and need for red cells, there was no indication that IV ibuprofen was associated with bleeding in either the critically ill or non-critically ill groups as compared to the placebo group.

This safety pattern has been described for IV ibuprofen in other hospital settings. Bernard et al. performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of IV ibuprofen (10 mg per kilogram of body weight (maximal dose, 800 mg), given every six hours for eight doses) in 455 patients who had sepsis, defined as fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and acute failure of at least one organ system. Serum creatinine and urinary output were measured serially over a five-day period to evaluate the effects of the study treatment on renal function, and no significant differences were detected between the groups. Hemodialysis was required for the first time in 6 of 224 ibuprofen-treated patients (3 percent) and 13 of 231 placebo-treated patients (6%, P = 0.11). Gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in nine patients in the ibuprofen group and 16 patients in the placebo group.

### Improved closure of patent ductus arteriosus with high doses of ibuprofen [^115zx5se]. Pediatric Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is associated with various complications of prematurity. Cyclooxygenase-inhibitors are the first-line intervention for closure of the PDA. However, the rates of PDA closure still are unsatisfactory. Therefore, an individual trial was performed by changing the strategy for treating neonates with ibuprofen to induce the closure of PDA. In a retrospective study, patients receiving 20, 10, and 10 mg/kg bodyweight ibuprofen (group 1) were compared by chart review with those receiving 10, 5, 5 mg/kg (group 2). The rate of PDA closure, the incidence of side effects related to the use of ibuprofen, and the need for surgical intervention for closure of the PDA were analyzed. A higher rate of closure after three doses in group 1 could be observed (60.9 vs 52.6%; p = 0.75), which was not significant but indicated a clear positive trend. If closure of the PDA was unsuccessful, intravenous ibuprofen was continued for an additional 2 days. After 5 days, 91.3% of PDA in group 1 was closed compared with 68.4% PDA in group 2. In summary, only 8.7% of the group 1 neonates needed surgical closure of PDA after insufficient medicamentous closure compared with 31.6% in group 2 (p = 0.25). Although not statistically significant, a clear positive trend for using the higher-dose medication can be seen. More work dealing with the limitations of a retrospective study must be done. Based on the data from this study, high-dose ibuprofen seems able to increase the rate of effective medicamentous PDA closure without any further unwanted side effects.

Adverse effects

The most common adverse effects were diarrhoea and vomiting, which were equally distributed between groups (table 5). The overall number of children experiencing adverse events was, however, too small to make meaningful comparisons between treatments. Five children were admitted to hospital (constituting serious adverse events): one child in the paracetamol group, three in the ibuprofen group, and one in the paracetamol plus ibuprofen group. On independent review none was considered to be related to the study process or drugs.

Dosing of study drugs

All 52 children in each of the three groups were given, as per protocol, their first dose of study drug under nurse supervision (table 6). The recommended maximum four doses of paracetamol or placebo in the first 24 hours was received by 65% of children given paracetamol, 46% given ibuprofen, and 42% given paracetamol plus ibuprofen, with this recommended maximum exceeded by 12%, 6%, and 8%, respectively. The corresponding percentages receiving the recommended maximum three doses of ibuprofen or placebo in 24 hours were 73%, 75%, and 71% and those exceeding this recommended maximum were 13%, 12%, and 13%. All percentages were much lower at 48 hours.

Blinding

The success of blinding was assessed at the nurse's visit at 48 hours, when parents were asked to guess treatment allocation. Taking "I don't know" responses to either drug as failure to guess correctly, allocation was guessed correctly by 16 (31%) parents in the paracetamol group, 17 (33%) in the ibuprofen group, and 9 (17%) in the paracetamol plus ibuprofen group, compared with the 33% expected by chance. Excluding "I don't know" responses increased these percentages to 50% (32 parents), 53% (n = 32), and 43% (n = 21), respectively.

### Ibuprofen dosing measurement accuracy using infants' versus children's ibuprofen: a randomized crossover comparison [^1144JcwG]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Ibuprofen liquid comes in two pediatric concentrations: 200mg/5mL for infants and 100mg/5mL for children. This study aimed to investigate the misdosing of ibuprofen liquid products by comparing administration accuracy with differing pediatric concentrations and dosages.

Methods

Subject selection included 116 volunteers. Participants were provided with the children's ibuprofen package including the dosing cup, the infants' ibuprofen package including the infant dosing dropper, and a 5mL syringe. Each subject drew up a specified dose of infants' ibuprofen and children's ibuprofen and deposited each sample into a graduated cylinder. The dose (70 or 100mg) and order of concentration usage (infants' first or children's first) were randomized.

Results

A total of 116 subjects, with a mean age of 32 ± 14 years, participated in the study. Mean absolute dosing errors for all trials, including those who made no errors, were significantly higher for infants' ibuprofen compared to children's ibuprofen: 39 vs. 27mg (p = 0.036). A total of 31% of all ibuprofen dosage experiments (71 of 232 trials) had greater than 50% error of the assigned dose.

Conclusion

Dosage errors using infants' ibuprofen were significantly higher than the children's ibuprofen. This suggests that removing the infant form from consumer availability may help reduce dosing errors when administering ibuprofen to pediatric patients.

Impact

Pediatric misdosing is a significant problem with over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen. A previous study found that 51% of patients under the age of 10 were inaccurately dosed with antipyretic medication, including ibuprofen, with an increased incidence in infants. We found significantly more dosing errors with the infant concentration (200mg/5mL) as opposed to the children's concentration (100mg/5mL), 39 vs. 27mg, respectively (p = 0.036). We believe that this research is beneficial to pediatric patient caregivers, clinicians, and policymakers to identify the problem of inaccurate ibuprofen dosing and to propose a way to mitigate this by having one concentration easily accessible.

Awareness of overdose-misuse risk of antipyretics

Correctly, oral administration of paracetamol was preferred to rectal administration by 73.1% of paediatricians (n = 351) and rectal administration was considered only in the presence of vomiting by 56.2% (n = 270) of paediatricians. However, 24.3% (n = 117) of paediatricians declared to prefer rectal administration because it seems to be more practical. The half (n = 240; 50.0%) of the paediatricians declared to use a higher pro-kilo dosage of paracetamol when it is administered rectally. Most of them (n = 273; 56.8%) used to give information about fever management at the first vaccinations, with a written prescription (n = 294; 61.2%). Alternate use of ibuprofen and paracetamol was adopted by 130/480 (27.0%) of paediatricians. Contrary to the guidelines recommendations, preventive use of paracetamol or ibuprofen was recommended for the prevention of febrile convulsion in febrile children by 60.6% (n = 291) of paediatricians.

### Comparison of acetaminophen (paracetamol) with ibuprofen for treatment of fever or pain in children younger than 2 years: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114n8V57]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this study, ibuprofen use was associated with reduced temperature and less pain within the first 24 hours than acetaminophen use. The lack of analgesic outcome data within 4 hours of use weakens the clinical importance of these findings. The 2 medications appear to have similar safety profiles in the short term, with very low rates of adverse events overall. The evidence regarding the risk of serious bacterial infection remains inconclusive, and there are limited data on younger infants and on longer-term adverse events. Large, randomized trials are needed to address these knowledge gaps, designed to include and report on the subgroup of infants younger than 6 months and to investigate the safety of acetaminophen and ibuprofen as a primary end point, with long-term follow-up and monitoring for adverse events.

### A multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-comparator trial to determine the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous ibuprofen for treatment of fever in hospitalized pediatric patients [^115KZmaQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Fever, often the earliest and most visible signs of a disease process can increase the metabolic rate and exert harmful effects of the disease process. Many healthcare providers agree that fever in children is usually not damaging and the significance of fever is often defined by its duration and the debilitating accompanying symptoms. Fever needs to be treated with an antipyretic which is rapidly effective, well tolerated and in as much as possible, fulfills the highest requirement of safety.

Oral ibuprofen and acetaminophen are the most commonly used antipyretics in the hospital setting. One systematic review found that both these medications have similar tolerability and safety profiles in terms of gastrointestinal symptoms, asthma and renal adverse effects. Aspirin, though highly effective, is contraindicated due to its association with Reye's syndrome. However, hospitalized patients with endotracheal intubation, sedation, reduced level of consciousness, reduced gastric motility, nausea, and vomiting, or a recent or intraoperative procedure make oral or rectal antipyretic preparations undesirable due to their inability to administer or unpredictability of the absorption. In addition, as the drug may not be equally distributed throughout the suppository, splitting a suppository may not provide a predictable or reliable dose. Additionally, different rectal preparations have substantially different absorption characteristics causing variations in bioavailability. Intravenous antipyretic, given their route of administration and path of absorption have proven superior to oral antipyretics at reducing fever rapidly.

This randomized, open-label study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous ibuprofen in febrile hospitalized pediatric patients. In this population of hospitalized pediatric patients, intravenous ibuprofen was more effective than acetaminophen in reducing temperature after a single dose of either medication.

Overall, the most common adverse event reported during the study was vomiting, while the most common adverse event reported in the ibuprofen treated patients was infusion site pain. Serial measurement of chemistry, hematology, and coagulopathy indicate that for the duration of exposure to intravenous ibuprofen, there were no clinically significant renal, gastrointestinal, or bleeding effects of intravenous ibuprofen in the 120 h after dosing or 1 week following study initiation.

The clearance and volume of distribution increased with age which was expected when taking into consideration the common-size related change in clearance for small chemical entities. In addition, the mean plasma concentration–time pattern and the pattern of maximum observed concentration and time of observed C max are consistent with the values found in adult patients treated with intravenous ibuprofen (Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. unpublished).

### Fever and antipyretic use in children [^111uu2gQ]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Fever in a child is one of the most common clinical symptoms managed by pediatricians and other health care providers and a frequent cause of parental concern. Many parents administer antipyretics even when there is minimal or no fever, because they are concerned that the child must maintain a "normal" temperature. Fever, however, is not the primary illness but is a physiologic mechanism that has beneficial effects in fighting infection. There is no evidence that fever itself worsens the course of an illness or that it causes long-term neurologic complications. Thus, the primary goal of treating the febrile child should be to improve the child's overall comfort rather than focus on the normalization of body temperature. When counseling the parents or caregivers of a febrile child, the general well-being of the child, the importance of monitoring activity, observing for signs of serious illness, encouraging appropriate fluid intake, and the safe storage of antipyretics should be emphasized. Current evidence suggests that there is no substantial difference in the safety and effectiveness of acetaminophen and ibuprofen in the care of a generally healthy child with fever. There is evidence that combining these 2 products is more effective than the use of a single agent alone; however, there are concerns that combined treatment may be more complicated and contribute to the unsafe use of these drugs. Pediatricians should also promote patient safety by advocating for simplified formulations, dosing instructions, and dosing devices.

Naproxen — dosing (over 2 years of age) is weight-based and given every 12 hours. For < 60 kg, 5–6 mg/kg every 12 hours as needed; for > 60 kg, 250–375 mg every 12 hours as needed. Maximum daily dose 1,000 mg/day. Dosage expressed as 200 mg naproxen base is equivalent to 220 mg naproxen sodium, and for acute pain, naproxen sodium may be preferred because of increased solubility leading to faster onset, higher peak concentration, and decreased adverse drug events.

Table 6
Adverse events occurring in ≥ 3 patients

N number, AE adverse event, ALT alanine transaminase, AST aspartate transaminase

1 p -value = 0.321; 2 p -value > 0.999

There were no differences between treatment groups in regards to the change from baseline to endpoint for pulse rate, respiratory rate, and systolic or diastolic blood pressures. Nor were there significant changes between treatment groups in regards to the change from baseline to endpoint for clinical chemistry, hematology or coagulation safety laboratory assessment.

Out of the three subjects under 6 months of age, a 5 and 3 month old received acetaminophen while a 1 month old received intravenous ibuprofen. The subject receiving ibuprofen had a 2.0° C temperature decrease while a 3 month old receiving acetaminophen had a 1.9° C decrease. The 5 month old receiving acetaminophen did not have temperature assessments. There were no safety concerns in the three patients.

Plasma concentration values from patients receiving intravenous ibuprofen were used to calculate pharmacokinetics parameters (Table 7). In the 43 patients that received ibuprofen, the AUC from time zero to 4 h (AUC 0–4) and maximum plasma concentration (C max) ranged from 22.96 to 162.0.6 microgram*hours/milliliter (mcg*hr/mL) and 15.91 to 96.31 microgram/milliliter (mcg/mL). The median time of observed maximum concentration was 10 min (Fig. 4), which corresponds to the end of the infusion. The elimination half-life was short and ranged from 0.79 to 2.87 with a mean of 1.55 h. The overall exposure increased with age. As expected, clearance and volume of distribution increased with age.

### Antipyretic effect of oral dipyrone (metamizole) compared to oral ibuprofen in febrile children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114UaVM4]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Numerous exogenous pyrogens and endogenous molecules cause fever, a common aftereffect of infection and an important factor of the host's defense mechanism. The appropriate management of high temperature in children requires adequate temperature measurement and precise use of antipyretic medications. Dipyrone is characterized by analgesic and antipyretic properties intending it to the clinical practice use in many countries; yet, it is panned in others due to some adverse effects shedding light on its safety profile. Ibuprofen is commonly used drug for also its analgesic and antipyretic efficacies over different age groups. These two drugs had comparable safety profiles with regard to serious adverse effects, particularly gastrointestinal hemorrhage in overdose conditions and the risk of anaphylactic reactions. It is known that both drugs have the potential to induce anaphylactic reactions; in such cases, ibuprofen may worsen symptoms of pre-existing asthma, while metamizole can trigger bronchospasm.

The given pooled findings of this investigation did not reveal any appreciable significant differences in the antipyretic effectiveness of oral dipyrone compared to that of oral ibuprofen across various time intervals in the pediatric population, according to the available data. These results demonstrate that dipyrone and ibuprofen have comparable antipyretic effectiveness in febrile children. Dipyrone and ibuprofen's antipyretic effects have already been studied in observational studies and a randomized trial. Each one showed a peak temperature drop of around 1 °C which contrasts with the outcomes of previous clinical studies. The discrepancy in sample sizes across the studies and the vast range of patient ages might be to blame for the variation in the temperature decrease mean.

If no clinically significant improvement is seen two hours after treatment, the antipyretic therapy is declared ineffective. The peak of antipyretic activity is predicted to occur 2–4 h after delivery when the recommended doses are employed, such as 15 mg/kg for dipyrone and 10 mg/kg for ibuprofen. Consequently, if no reduction in fever is observed within this time frame, it suggests a need to explore additional antipyretic options, despite both molecules having shown efficacy.

Primary Outcomes

Moderate-quality evidence from randomized studies showed that compared with acetaminophen, ibuprofen was associated with reduced temperature within 4 hours (4 studies, with 435 participants; SMD, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.67; p = 0.01; I² = 49%) (Table and Figure 2). Very low-quality evidence from nonrandomized studies showed that ibuprofen and acetaminophen had similar antipyretic profiles within 4 hours (2 studies, with 123 participants; SMD, −0.04; 95% CI, −0.40 to 0.31; p = 0.81; I² = 0%) (Table; eFigure 1 in the Supplement). None of the included studies reported pain outcomes within 4 hours from treatment onset. Subgroup analyses for fever reduction within 4 hours comparing lower and higher dosages of ibuprofen and acetaminophen did not alter the results (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Data were not available for the remainder of the planned subgroup analyses. In sensitivity analysis, exclusion of 2 studies at high risk of bias, did not alter the results.

The effect of CALDOLOR on fever was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind studies in adults and in one open-label study in pediatric patients.

In a multi-center study, 120 hospitalized patients (88 men, 32 women) with temperatures of 101°F or greater were randomized to CALDOLOR 400 mg, 200 mg, 100 mg or placebo, administered every 4 hours for 24 hours. Each of the three CALDOLOR doses, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg, resulted in a statistically greater percentage of patients with a reduced temperature (< 101°F) after 4 hours, compared to placebo (65%, 73%, 77% and 32%, respectively). The dose response is shown in the figure below.

Figure 1: Temperature Reduction by Treatment Group, Hospitalized Febrile Patients

In a single-center study, 60 hospitalized patients (48 men, 12 women) with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria having temperatures
 ≥ 100.4°F were randomized to CALDOLOR 400 mg or placebo, administered every 6 hours for 72 hours of treatment. There was a significant reduction in fever within the first 24 hours of treatment, measured as the area above the temperature 98.6°F vs. time curve for patients treated with CALDOLOR.

In a multi-center, open-label study, 100 hospitalized pediatric patients 6 months of age and older with temperatures of 101.0ºF or greater were randomized and treated with 10 mg/kg of CALDOLOR or a low dose of an active comparator every 4 hours as needed for fever.

Efficacy was demonstrated as a statistically significant greater reduction in temperature for the primary endpoint, an area under the curve analyses of temperature versus time for the first 2 hours, as well as over the entire dosing interval. Seventy-four percent of CALDOLOR treated patients became afebrile (temperature < 99.5ºF) by the end of first dosing interval.

### Paracetamol plus ibuprofen for the treatment of fever in children (PITCH): economic evaluation of a randomised controlled trial [^113aEY6m]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Cost consequences analysis

We carried out a cost consequences analysis at 48 hours and five days from baseline for the NHS and for parents and carers. We recorded a range of benefits at both time points, including the child's temperature, discomfort, activity, appetite, and sleep. These were treated as individual outcomes and also combined to provide an indication of whether the child had "fully recovered". This was based on parents reporting that the child was "normal" for him or her with respect to discomfort, activity, appetite, and sleep and on the child having a temperature < 37.2°C. Thus "fully recovered" is in effect "returned to normal for that child".

Cost effectiveness analysis

We used the combined outcome of "fully recovered" in a cost effectiveness analysis at 48 hours to estimate the cost per extra child returning to "normal for that child" and to indicate the relative efficiency of each treatment at a point before it was anticipated that most children would have recovered fully.

Data collection and unit costs

A research nurse collected data from parents and carers on resource use and out of pocket expenses by means of a face to face questionnaire at 48 hours and by telephone at day 5. Table 1shows the source of costing and unit costs. We valued primary care contacts in accordance with Curtis and Netten, and we used the NHS tariffand Department of Health reference costsfor secondary care and ambulance services. We valued visits to the walk-in centre and contact with NHS Direct in accordance with information from published national evaluations. For prescribed drugs, we used the costs reported in the British National Formulary, and we used the AA schedule of motoring costsfor valuing travel by car. Parents who reported loss of income were asked how many days of work had been affected, and this was valued using a national wage rate. We costed the study drugs as though parents had bought them over the counter. Throughout the trial children received doses of study medicines according to their weight. We costed the consumption of medicines accordingly. All resources were valued in pounds sterling at 2006 prices using an appropriate inflation index.

### The effect of ibuprofen exposure and patient characteristics on the closure of the patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants [^112va1Tj]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients and data

Data on a clinical cohort of preterm infants (n = 298) who all received ibuprofen for the treatment of PDA were available for analysis. Data from part of this cohort (n = 43) were also used for the development of a recently published population pharmacokinetic (PK) model that is described in more detail in the next section. All patients had confirmed PDA based on an echocardiographic ultrasound prior to treatment initiation. Treatment with ibuprofen was initiated if the PDA was judged as hemodynamically significant by the clinical team (pediatric cardiologist and neonatologist) according to the local protocol and there was no contraindication for ibuprofen (i.e. hepatic or renal failure, severe thrombocytopenia or other known clotting disorders, recent intraventricular hemorrhage or other bleeding, sepsis, suspected or confirmed necrotizing enterocolitis, or severe hyperbilirubinemia). For infants born before June 2015, the protocol for ibuprofen treatment consisted of a loading dose of 10 mg/kg bodyweight on day 1 followed by 2 maintenance doses of 5 mg/kg on days 2 and 3 (also written as 10‐5‐5 mg/kg). After June 2015, a new dosing regimen was applied that accounts for the maturation of ibuprofen clearance with PNA. Loading and maintenance doses were adapted to PNA, resulting in 10‐5‐5 mg/kg for PNA < 70 hours, gradually increasing per day up to 20‐10‐10 mg/kg if PNA was above 196 hours. Ibuprofen was administered intravenously or orally using the same dosages, and an ibuprofen cycle consisting of three doses could be repeated as judged to be clinically deemed necessary. Typically, an ultrasound was made after the third dose to assess the status of the PDA. To prevent unnecessary burden for the patient, the attending physician could postpone or cancel an ultrasound after three doses if the outcome was expected to be clinically irrelevant (apparent signs for open ductus such as a persistent murmur or low diastolic blood pressure or no signs of a clinically relevant ductus). If necessary, ibuprofen treatment could be continued for an additional 3 to 6 days. For the purpose of this analysis, all ultrasounds were re‐assessed by one experienced clinician (author J.d.K.) who determined whether PDA was closed or not. Additionally, the diameter of the ductus, the diameter of the left pulmonary artery, the ratio between the diameter of the ductus and the left pulmonary artery, the maximal diastolic velocity, ratio between atrium to aortic valve ratio, flow through the left pulmonary artery, and flow through the aorta were documented for each ultrasound. For each patient, the Z ‐score for birthweight (Z Birthweight‐for‐GA) was calculated based on birthweight, GA, and Dutch perinatal growth curves. The cohort has been previously described by de Klerk et al.

### Comparison of acetaminophen (paracetamol) with ibuprofen for treatment of fever or pain in children younger than 2 years: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113VHr69]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

A strength of this review is the inclusion of several important clinical outcomes that have direct relevance to pediatric patient care. We identified both randomized and observational studies to address our review questions. Consequently, a degree of heterogeneity was found across studies with respect to study setting, sample size, drug dosages, and treatment duration. However, this diversity reflects the use of acetaminophen and ibuprofen in routine clinical practice and may strengthen the applicability of our review findings to patients with differing illnesses in various clinical settings.

A key limitation already alluded to is the small number of participants (ie, 796) who could be included in the analgesic analysis, with only 4 studies, reporting pain outcomes, none of which reported our primary outcome of pain within 4 hours of treatment onset. Furthermore, the small sample size in many of the studies included made the comparison of adverse events difficult because of the low rates reported across most studies. Using study authors' definitions of adverse events could have led to inconsistent adverse events data across studies. Additionally, only 9 studies, investigated safety as a primary outcome, and it is possible that there is measurement bias during adverse event data collection in the remainder of the studies. Randomized studies in our review were typically short, providing limited data on adverse events at more than 28 days. Many of the long-term adverse events captured in the review were from observational studies, with their inherent biases. Thus, results of this review pertaining to safety outcomes should be interpreted accordingly.

### Ibuprofen for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm or low birth weight (or both) infants [^116HP8Uf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Indomethacin is used as standard therapy to close a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) but is associated with reduced blood flow to several organs. Ibuprofen, another cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, may be as effective as indomethacin with fewer adverse effects.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of ibuprofen compared with indomethacin, other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor(s), placebo, or no intervention for closing a patent ductus arteriosus in preterm, low-birth-weight, or preterm and low-birth-weight infants.

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 10), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 30 November 2017), Embase (1980 to 30 November 2017), and CINAHL (1982 to 30 November 2017). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of ibuprofen for the treatment of a PDA in preterm, low birth weight, or both preterm and low-birth-weight newborn infants.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data collection and analysis conformed to the methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

We included 39 studies enrolling 2843 infants. Ibuprofen (IV) versus placebo: IV Ibuprofen (3 doses) reduced the failure to close a PDA compared with placebo (typical relative risk (RR); 0.62 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.86); typical risk difference (RD); -0.18 (95% CI -0.30 to -0.06); NNTB 6 (95% CI 3 to 17); I² = 65% for RR and I² = 0% for RD; 2 studies, 206 infants; moderate-quality the evidence). One study reported decreased failure to close a PDA after single or three doses of oral ibuprofen compared with placebo (64 infants; RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.62; RD -0.44, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.23; NNTB 2, 95% CI 2 to 4; I² test not applicable). Ibuprofen (IV or oral) compared with indomethacin (IV or oral): Twenty-four studies (1590 infants) comparing ibuprofen (IV or oral) with indomethacin (IV or oral) found no significant differences in failure rates for PDA closure (typical RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.24; typical RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.06; I² = 0% for both RR and RD; moderate-quality evidence). A reduction in NEC (necrotising enterocolitis) was noted in the ibuprofen (IV or oral) group (18 studies, 1292 infants; typical RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.94; typical RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.01; NNTB 25, 95% CI 14 to 100; I² = 0% for both RR and RD; moderate-quality evidence). There was a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of infants with oliguria in the ibuprofen group (6 studies, 576 infants; typical RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.54; typical RD -0.09, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.05; NNTB 11, 95% CI 7 to 20; I² = 24% for RR and I² = 69% for RD; moderate-quality evidence). The serum/plasma creatinine levels 72 hours after initiation of treatment were statistically significantly lower in the ibuprofen group (11 studies, 918 infants; MD -8.12 µmol/L, 95% CI -10.81 to -5.43). For this comparison, there was high between-study heterogeneity (I 2 = 83%) and low-quality evidence. Ibuprofen (oral) compared with indomethacin (IV or oral): Eight studies (272 infants) reported on failure rates for PDA closure in a subgroup of the above studies comparing oral ibuprofen with indomethacin (IV or oral). There was no significant difference between the groups (typical RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.27; typical RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.09; I² = 0% for both RR and RD). The risk of NEC was reduced with oral ibuprofen compared with indomethacin (IV or oral) (7 studies, 249 infants; typical RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.73; typical RD -0.13, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.05; NNTB 8, 95% CI 5 to 20; I² = 0% for both RR and RD). There was low-quality evidence for these two outcomes. There was a decreased risk of failure to close a PDA with oral ibuprofen compared with IV ibuprofen (5 studies, 406 infants; typical RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.56; typical RD -0.22, 95% CI -0.31 to -0.14; NNTB 5, 95% CI 3 to 7; moderate-quality evidence). There was a decreased risk of failure to close a PDA with high-dose versus standard-dose of IV ibuprofen (3 studies 190 infants; typical RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.61; typical RD - 0.26, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.15; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 7); I² = 4% for RR and 0% for RD); moderate-quality evidence). Early versus expectant administration of IV ibuprofen, echocardiographically-guided IV ibuprofen treatment versus standard IV ibuprofen treatment, continuous infusion of ibuprofen versus intermittent boluses of ibuprofen, and rectal ibuprofen versus oral ibuprofen were studied in too few trials to allow for precise estimates of any clinical outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Ibuprofen is as effective as indomethacin in closing a PDA. Ibuprofen reduces the risk of NEC and transient renal insufficiency. Therefore, of these two drugs, ibuprofen appears to be the drug of choice. The effectiveness of ibuprofen versus paracetamol is assessed in a separate review. Oro-gastric administration of ibuprofen appears as effective as IV administration. To make further recommendations, studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of high-dose versus standard-dose ibuprofen, early versus expectant administration of ibuprofen, echocardiographically-guided versus standard IV ibuprofen, and continuous infusion versus intermittent boluses of ibuprofen. Studies are lacking evaluating the effect of ibuprofen on longer-term outcomes in infants with PDA.

### Premarketing surveillance of ibuprofen suppositories in febrile children [^113eFcqw]. Clinical Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

In many countries, ibuprofen is available only in oral formulations. The authors aimed to investigate parental satisfaction and possible adverse reactions among children receiving newly marketed ibuprofen suppositories, prior to their arrival at the pharmaceutical points of distribution. Children needing antipyretic medication were recruited from 11 pediatric wards and clinics in Israel. Each patient received ibuprofen suppositories (5–10 mg/kg/dose) after completing a data collection form. After 3 to 7 days of treatment, information regarding parent satisfaction, possible adverse reactions, and concomitant use of drugs was obtained. Overall, 490 children completed the study. Parents' satisfaction was high (4.5 ± 0.47 on a scale of 1–5), and 92.2% reported that they would use the medication in the future. Adverse reactions were reported in 8 patients (1.63%, 95% confidence interval = 1.77–3.25), the most common being diarrhea. Rectal administration of ibuprofen suppositories is well tolerated and overall satisfaction and the repeated expected use were high.

### Quantifying the intensity of adverse events with ibuprofen and oxycodone: an observational cohort study [^1113SCyi]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

Study design and setting

This study is a secondary analysis of a prospective observational cohort study performed at the Stollery Children's Hospital (Edmonton, Alberta) emergency department (ED), which had an annual ED census of 27 000 at the time of study.

Participants

Patients were recruited from June 2010 to July 2014. Eligibility criteria included all children aged 4–16 years who incurred a limb fracture within 24 hours of presentation and were prescribed either ibuprofen or oxycodone for at-home pain management. These, along with acetaminophen, were the three most frequently used outpatient analgesic medications in our institution at the time. We excluded children who were prescribed both oxycodone and ibuprofen at discharge, used daily medications for chronic pain, could not speak English, could not self-report pain due to cognitive impairment and/or could not be reached by telephone for follow-up. For inclusion in this substudy, participants must have used their prescribed medication on day 1 after ED discharge. Both the decision to prescribe ibuprofen or oxycodone and the recommended dosing were at the discretion of the treating physician. Recommended dosing was 10 mg/kg/dose (maximum 600 mg) for ibuprofen and 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/dose (maximum 10 mg) for oxycodone.

Recruitment

Both consent and assent were obtained from caregivers and children, respectively. A research assistant interviewed each family daily for the first 3 days after discharge (with day 1 being the end of the first 24 hours after ED discharge); pain scores (using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised), medication use, dosage, AEs and functional outcome impairment were collected.

Data collection and management

Demographic (ie, age, sex) and clinical (ie, fracture type, procedural sedation) characteristics were collected from participants using structured medical record review. A trained data specialist was responsible for data entry and validation using OpenClinica. MedDRA was used to code AEs, as per Health Canada recommendations for AE reporting.
