## Question

How should MGUS be treated in a patient with a history of myeloma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a new MGUS-like monoclonal protein in a patient with a prior history of multiple myeloma, distinguishing secondary MGUS from biochemical relapse or MGCS and outlining monitoring and treatment triggers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the differential diagnosis unique to post-myeloma patients. Then, I should verify the absence or presence of myeloma-defining events or M-protein–mediated organ damage. Next, I should review validated MGUS risk stratification models and how they apply longitudinally. After that, I need to determine management pathways for secondary MGUS, asymptomatic MGUS, MGCS, and biochemical relapse. Finally, I should confirm multidisciplinary oversight and special considerations such as transplant timing, maintenance, and amyloidosis screening.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and key possibilities in an MM survivor with a small M protein: this could represent secondary MGUS related to immune reconstitution (classically after ASCT), a biochemical relapse heralding recurrent MM, or MGUS of clinical significance where a small clone is toxic to organs despite not meeting MM criteria; I should be careful not to equate a new M spike with inevitable progression without corroborating features [^111F66dq] [^111qkdNQ]. Wait, let me verify the data on secondary MGUS: the Blood 2011 series found secondary MGUS in 6.6% overall and 22.7% post-ASCT with better overall survival than those without this phenomenon, which supports the notion that this may be a favorable immune reconstitution marker rather than progression, so I should not rush to treat solely based on this finding [^111F66dq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check for myeloma-defining events or end-organ damage first because that alone determines the need to treat. I will now examine CRAB features and the 2014 IMWG "SLiM" biomarkers: hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, lytic bone lesions plus any of clonal marrow plasma cells ≥ 60%, involved:uninvolved FLC ratio ≥ 100, or more than one focal lesion on MRI, since any of these would reclassify the patient as active MM despite a small M protein [^114T5mNA]. Next, I should review for MGCS red flags such as peripheral neuropathy, AL amyloidosis, MIDD, or cryoglobulinemia where even a modest clone warrants therapy to prevent organ loss; efficient control of the clone generally improves organ function, so I must keep a low threshold to pursue targeted workup if suspected [^111qkdNQ]. I should confirm baseline labs and imaging: CBC, creatinine, calcium, SPEP/UPEP with immunofixation, serum FLC, and symptom-directed imaging; if MGCS or AL is suspected, tissue biopsy and organ-specific biomarkers are indicated [^112duMU4] [^116bkfsy] [^113vTGar].

> Let me think about risk stratification next, because even if there is no organ damage, the follow-up cadence depends on risk. I need to ensure I apply validated models such as the Mayo scheme using M-protein concentration, heavy-chain isotype, and FLC ratio to categorize progression risk, acknowledging that IgM behaves differently and that FLC interpretation must consider renal function [^114B4W1v] [^115sZz4d] [^116SarbZ]. I should double-check longitudinal data: upstaging to a higher-risk category over time increases progression hazards five- to thirteen-fold, which should prompt intensified surveillance in practice rather than immediate therapy in the absence of myeloma-defining events [^116Tr7kW].

> Now, for management pathway A, secondary MGUS is most common post-ASCT; I should confirm this is a new band of a different isotype than the original clone and that the patient lacks clinical or SLiM-CRAB progression. Treatment is no therapy; I need to ensure careful monitoring instead, such as M protein and FLC every three months for a year after first detection, then every six to twelve months, with annual clinical review for CRAB signs; this approach aligns with the observation that secondary MGUS correlates with superior survival and likely reflects immune reconstitution rather than relapse [^111F66dq].

> For management pathway B, if this represents asymptomatic MGUS or residual low-level disease after deep response, I should verify risk and tailor surveillance. In low-risk MGUS, it is reasonable to repeat testing at six months and, if stable, extend to every two to three years; for intermediate- and high-risk MGUS, I should confirm a baseline marrow and imaging and monitor at six-month intervals initially, recognizing that BSH and IMWG support risk-adapted intensity to detect emerging symptomatic disease early while avoiding overt investigation in very low-risk states [^114B4W1v] [^111LKe6K] [^1134QEuq] [^112R5sdx]. Let me reconsider special phenotypes: in light-chain MGUS, I should double-check renal function and consider six-month creatinine and FLC monitoring given renal vulnerability despite lower malignant transformation rates [^112hckh2].

> For management pathway C, MGCS is different; I need to ensure that signs such as amyloid cardiomyopathy, nephrotic-range proteinuria from MIDD, or painful sensory neuropathy linked to the monoclonal protein are promptly recognized. Here, treatment is indicated to eradicate or suppress the culprit clone, commonly with bortezomib- or daratumumab-based myeloma regimens adapted to the disease biology and organ risk, because timely control improves organ outcomes; I should confirm organ-response tracking, such as cardiac biomarkers in AL or renal metrics in MIDD, every three months [^111qkdNQ] [^111mtyTq] [^117Ds8eA].

> For management pathway D, if this is biochemical relapse of prior MM with rising M protein alone, I should verify that the patient is asymptomatic and without CRAB or SLiM features, because observation is appropriate until clinical progression; both NCCN and ASCO/CCO permit watchful waiting in slowly progressive, asymptomatic relapse, with intervention triggered by sustained biomarker rises or evolving end-organ involvement, and I should remember that biochemical progression often precedes clinical events by months, underscoring the need for close interval monitoring [^112rCbM4] [^114Wm1dK] [^113wv6uv]. I should confirm documentation of IMWG-defined progression, including a ≥ 25% increase from nadir in M protein or FLC plus absolute criteria in two consecutive measurements, before labeling a true biochemical relapse that would prompt earlier imaging or marrow reassessment even if therapy is not yet initiated [^111bUdGt].

> I need to ensure multidisciplinary oversight for any MGUS or MGCS decisions in an MM survivor, given the nuances of interpreting paraprotein kinetics post-therapy, the need to integrate imaging and marrow data, and potential eligibility for clinical trials; BSH emphasizes MDT involvement when contemplating any systemic therapy for MGUS-spectrum entities to avoid overtreatment and to harmonize follow-up [^111J14uZ].

> Next, I should review special considerations. Stem cell transplant timing matters; if relapse risks are high and the patient remains transplant-eligible with adequate remission duration after the first ASCT, a salvage ASCT can be considered at first biochemical or early clinical relapse rather than waiting for catastrophic organ damage, particularly when remission exceeded three years after initial ASCT and maintenance [^114pLxei]. Maintenance therapy after ASCT should generally continue unless toxicity, as lenalidomide maintenance improves outcomes and bortezomib is considered for high-risk disease; I should confirm current maintenance when interpreting low-level paraproteins and potential oligoclonal bands post-ASCT [^113kWiUv]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the PANGEA study demonstrated that continuous therapy itself delays progression in MGUS, but let me correct that: PANGEA is a personalized risk prediction model using time-varying biomarkers to estimate progression risk and is not a therapeutic trial, so I should use it for risk assessment, not as evidence for maintenance in MGUS [^1144ZtMD]. Finally, I should double-check for occult AL amyloidosis whenever neuropathy, nephrotic syndrome, or unexplained heart failure coexists with a monoclonal protein, since delayed diagnosis carries high early mortality and prompt clone control can be life-saving [^117Ds8eA].

> Putting this together into a practical algorithm, I should first exclude SLiM-CRAB and MGCS; if either is present, treat as active MM or MGCS promptly. If absent and the pattern is consistent with secondary MGUS, I will observe with three-month labs for a year then six- to twelve-month intervals. If the profile is de novo MGUS after MM therapy, I will stratify risk by M protein, isotype, and FLC ratio, using low-intensity follow-up for low-risk and six-month surveillance with baseline marrow and imaging for higher-risk. If biochemical relapse is suspected, I will confirm IMWG progression on two measurements, intensify surveillance every one to three months, and initiate treatment upon clinical criteria or rapid biochemical acceleration, documenting trends and ruling out MGCS along the way [^111F66dq] [^111LKe6K] [^112CFRAQ] [^114B4W1v].

> As a final check on monitoring triggers, I should escalate evaluation if there is a progressive rise in M protein or FLC, new anemia, rising ESR, renal impairment, hypercalcemia, bone pain, or new focal lesions on imaging; for low-risk MGUS, six-month recheck then every two to three years is acceptable if stable, whereas intermediate- or high-risk MGUS and light-chain MGUS require at least six- to twelve-month surveillance with consideration of secondary care follow-up and periodic formal risk reassessment [^112CFRAQ] [^115CTYvt] [^113WDeFy]. Hold on, I should verify imaging thresholds: in higher-intermediate or high-risk MGUS, baseline whole-body imaging is reasonable to exclude smoldering or overt MM, with modality selection tailored to availability and clinical suspicion, and repeat imaging if symptoms evolve or laboratory changes suggest occult progression [^112R5sdx] [^114tzmWT].

MGUS after myeloma generally does not require immediate treatment unless there is evidence of progression or organ damage [^111LKe6K]. Management is **observation only**, with regular monitoring of M-protein, free light chains, and clinical assessment for progression or MGCS [^112CFRAQ] [^115CTYvt] [^111qkdNQ]. If progression to active myeloma or MGCS occurs, **treat according to standard myeloma protocols** [^114Wm1dK] [^11753KyQ]. Secondary MGUS after myeloma is common and usually indolent, but **persistent or rising M-protein warrants closer follow-up** [^111F66dq] [^112CFRAQ].

---

## Clinical significance of MGUS after myeloma

Secondary MGUS is common after myeloma therapy, especially post-transplant [^111F66dq], and is **usually indolent** and does not require treatment unless progression or organ damage occurs [^111LKe6K]. Secondary MGUS has been associated with **improved survival** [^111F66dq] in some cohorts, possibly reflecting more indolent biology or effective prior therapy [^113hET62].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation and monitoring

Patients with MGUS after myeloma should undergo **regular monitoring** to detect progression or organ damage [^115CTYvt]:

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, creatinine, calcium, serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), immunofixation [^116bkfsy], and serum free light chain assay [^111LKe6K] [^112CFRAQ].

- **Imaging**: Whole-body imaging (MRI or low-dose CT) [^114tzmWT] if symptoms or laboratory abnormalities suggest progression [^113vTGar].

- **Bone marrow biopsy**: Perform if there is suspicion of progression based on clinical or laboratory findings [^113QNho5] [^1134QEuq].

---

## Indications for treatment

Treatment is indicated **only** if there is evidence of progression to active myeloma or development of MGCS [^111qkdNQ]. Progression to active myeloma is defined by **CRAB criteria** (hypercalcemia, renal impairment, anemia, bone lesions) [^111bUdGt] or **myeloma-defining events** [^111LKe6K], and **MGCS** denotes organ damage attributable to the monoclonal protein, such as AL amyloidosis or monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS) [^111qkdNQ] [^117Ds8eA].

---

## Treatment strategies upon progression

If progression occurs, treatment should **follow standard myeloma protocols**, considering prior therapies, patient comorbidities, and disease characteristics [^11753KyQ]:

- **Proteasome inhibitors**: Bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib [^11648iuZ].

- **Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs)**: Lenalidomide, pomalidomide [^112iELjT].

- **Monoclonal antibodies**: Daratumumab, isatuximab [^115is1ej].

- **Corticosteroids**: Dexamethasone [^114Wm1dK].

- **Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT)**: Consider in eligible patients [^113kWiUv].

- **Novel therapies**: CAR T-cell therapy, bispecific antibodies for heavily pretreated or refractory disease [^117CkV7N].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

The prognosis of secondary MGUS after myeloma is **generally favorable** [^111F66dq], with low risk of progression if appropriately monitored [^111LKe6K]. However, persistent or rising M-protein levels may indicate higher risk and warrant **closer follow-up** [^111F66dq] [^112CFRAQ].

---

## Current guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **observation and regular monitoring** in MGUS after myeloma, with treatment reserved for documented progression or organ damage [^111LKe6K]. Multidisciplinary team involvement is recommended for complex cases or when systemic therapy is considered [^111J14uZ].

### Monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance: A novel concept with therapeutic implications [^111qkdNQ]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy is a common condition, particularly in the elderly. It can indicate symptomatic multiple myeloma or another overt malignant lymphoid disorder requiring immediate chemotherapy. More frequently, it results from a small and/or quiescent secreting B-cell clone, is completely asymptomatic, and requires regular monitoring only, defining a monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS).

Sometimes, although quiescent and not requiring any treatment per se, the clone is associated with potentially severe organ damage due to the toxicity of the monoclonal immunoglobulin or other mechanisms. This latter situation is increasingly observed but still poorly recognized and frequently undertreated, although it often requires rapid specific intervention to preserve involved organ function.

To improve early recognition and management of these small B-cell clone-related disorders, we propose to introduce the concept of monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance (MGCS). This report identifies the spectrum of MGCSs that are classified according to mechanisms of tissue injury. It highlights the diversity of these disorders, for which diagnosis and treatment are often challenging in clinical practice and require a multidisciplinary approach. Principles of management, including main diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, are also described. Importantly, efficient control of the underlying B-cell clone usually results in organ improvement. Currently, it relies mainly on chemotherapy and other anti-B-cell/plasma cell agents, which should aim at rapidly producing the desired outcomes.

### Diagnosis and management of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: A review [^111LKe6K]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Nearly 5% of adults have the precursor malignant condition monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS). Management focuses on differentiating MGUS from more serious conditions to determine additional diagnostic testing, monitoring, and potential therapy.

- **Observations**: MGUS is defined by the absence of end-organ damage or symptoms, a small amount of monoclonal immunoglobulin (M protein), and a low volume of plasma cells. MGUS must be distinguished from overt malignant diseases like multiple myeloma (MM), immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, and monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance (MGCS), all of which cause organ damage or symptoms. Although testing for M proteins is often prompted by clinical findings (e.g. osteoporosis or autoimmune disease), recent evidence from screened populations suggests that previous MGUS disease associations were likely overestimated and that testing for M proteins should be reserved for when malignant disease or MGCS is suspected.

	- The risk of progression to malignant disease ranges from 0.5% to 1%, meaning most patients have indolent disease. Guideline-concordant management of MGUS is determined by the predicted risk of progression to malignant disease, which depends on the subtype of immunoglobulin, M protein concentration, and free light chain ratio. Patients with low-risk MGUS can safely defer bone marrow biopsy and advanced imaging, and should undergo periodic laboratory monitoring. Intermediate- and high-risk MGUS should trigger bone marrow biopsy and bone imaging to detect overt MM and shorter monitoring intervals.

### Incidence, clinical course, and prognosis of secondary monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance in patients with multiple myeloma [^111F66dq]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

During the course of multiple myeloma (MM), new monoclonal proteins of an isotype distinct from the original clone, referred to as secondary monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), have been described. We report on the frequency, characteristics, and outcome of secondary MGUS. Of the 1,942 patients with MM, 128 (6.6%) developed secondary MGUS, at a median of 12 months from the diagnosis of MM. The median duration of secondary MGUS was 5.9 months. Secondary MGUS was more common in patients after stem cell transplantation than in those who had not undergone such treatment (22.7% vs. 1.6%, P < .001). Overall survival was significantly superior in MM patients who developed secondary MGUS compared with the rest of the cohort (73 vs. 38 months, respectively; P < .001). The time of onset and the duration of secondary MGUS, as well as failure to resolve spontaneously, had an effect on overall survival and require further study.

### Longitudinal assessment of established risk stratification models in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^116Tr7kW]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). High credibility.

The risk of progression of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) into multiple myeloma and related plasma cell disorders can be determined by three major risk stratification models: Mayo2005, Sweden2014, and NCI2019. This retrospective study of 427 patients with MGUS, diagnosed according to the 2014 International Myeloma Working Group criteria, aimed to describe and analyze the longitudinal applicability of these risk models. In all three models, the majority of patients remained at their baseline risk group, whereas a small number of patients migrated to a different risk group. Proportions of patients among risk groups remained stable over time (e.g. Mayo2005 model, low-risk group at baseline: 43%; after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 years: 40%, 37%, 37%, 43%, 44%, and 43%). All three risk models reliably distinguished risk of progression at baseline, upon yearly reassessment (e.g. 1 year from diagnosis), and in time-dependent analyses. Upstaging to a high-risk category was associated with an increased risk of progression in all three models (Mayo2005: hazard ratio [HR] = 5.43, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.21–24.39, p = 0.027; Sweden2014: HR = 13.02, 95% CI 5.25–32.28, p < 0.001; NCI2019: HR = 5.85, 95% CI 2.49–13.74, p < 0.001). Our study shows that MGUS risk stratification models can be applied longitudinally to repeatedly determine and improve individual risk of progression. Patient migration to higher risk categories during follow-up should prompt more frequent monitoring in clinical routine.

### Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering (asymptomatic) multiple myeloma: IMWG consensus perspectives risk factors for progression and guidelines for monitoring and management [^114B4W1v]. Leukemia (2010). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) was identified in 3.2% of 21,463 residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, 50 years of age or older. The risk of progression to multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, AL amyloidosis, or a lymphoproliferative disorder is approximately 1% per year. Low-risk MGUS is characterized by having an M protein of less than 15 g/l, IgG type, and a normal free light chain (FLC) ratio. Patients should be followed with serum protein electrophoresis at six months and, if stable, can be monitored every 2–3 years or when symptoms suggestive of a plasma cell malignancy arise. Patients with intermediate and high-risk MGUS should be followed in six months and then annually for life.

The risk of smoldering (asymptomatic) multiple myeloma (SMM) progressing to multiple myeloma or a related disorder is 10% per year for the first five years, 3% per year for the next five years, and 1–2% per year for the next ten years. Testing should be conducted 2–3 months after the initial recognition of SMM. If the results are stable, the patient should be followed every 4–6 months for one year and, if stable, every 6–12 months.

These recommendations were developed by a panel of clinical experts on multiple myeloma, based on evidence from published data through August 2017. Expert consensus was used to suggest recommendations where sufficient data were lacking. The final recommendations were classified based on the GRADE criteria, which incorporate the strength and quality of evidence. Based on discussions at the 2017 EMN Trialist meeting in Baveno, Italy, guidelines were prepared and circulated among all panel members. The manuscript subsequently underwent revision in three rounds until the EMN experts reached consensus. In line with the guidelines of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, authorship was based on active contribution during discussion, writing, and revision of the guidelines.

### The clinical relevance and management of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and related disorders: Recommendations from the European Myeloma Network [^1141vpCV]. Haematologica (2014). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance is one of the most common pre-malignant disorders. IgG and IgA monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance are precursor conditions of multiple myeloma; light-chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance of light-chain multiple myeloma; and IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and other lymphoproliferative disorders. Clonal burden, as determined by bone marrow plasma cell percentage or M-protein level, as well as biological characteristics, including heavy chain isotype and light chain production, are helpful in predicting risk of progression of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance to symptomatic disease.

Furthermore, alterations in the bone marrow microenvironment of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance patients result in an increased risk of venous and arterial thrombosis, infections, osteoporosis, and bone fractures. In addition, the small clone may occasionally be responsible for severe organ damage through the production of a monoclonal protein that has autoantibody activity or deposits in tissues. These disorders are rare and often require therapy directed at eradication of the underlying plasma cell or lymphoplasmacytic clone.

In this review, we provide an overview of the clinical relevance of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. We also give general recommendations on how to diagnose and manage patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.

### Multiple myeloma [^11753KyQ]. Lancet (2021). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematological malignancy in high-income countries. It typically begins as asymptomatic precursor conditions, either monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or smoldering multiple myeloma, where initiating genetic abnormalities such as hyperdiploidy and translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain are already present. The introduction of immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors, and CD38-targeting antibodies has extended survival. However, the majority of patients will ultimately die from their disease, with some succumbing to treatment-related complications.

Disease progression and subsequent relapses are characterized by subclonal evolution and increasingly resistant disease. Patients with multiple myeloma often present with hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, or osteolytic bone lesions. A comprehensive diagnostic investigation is necessary to differentiate between symptomatic multiple myeloma requiring treatment and precursor states. Risk stratification using both patient-specific factors (e.g. performance status) and disease-specific factors (e.g. presence of high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities) is critical for prognosis and defining the optimal treatment strategy.

Research strategies focus on the use of minimal residual disease assays to guide therapy, refining immunotherapeutic approaches, and early interception of disease in smoldering multiple myeloma.

### Longitudinal assessment of established risk stratification models in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^112eKxhq]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). High credibility.

The risk of progression of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) into multiple myeloma and related plasma cell disorders can be determined by three major risk stratification models, namely Mayo2005, Sweden2014, and NCI2019. This retrospective study of 427 patients with MGUS diagnosed according to the 2014 International Myeloma Working Group criteria aimed to describe and analyze the longitudinal applicability of these risk models.

In all three models, the majority of patients remained at their baseline risk group, whereas small numbers of patients migrated to a different risk group. The proportions of patients among risk groups remained stable over time:

- **Example**:
	- **Mayo2005 model, low-risk group**:
		- **Baseline**: 43%
		- **After 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 years**: 40%, 37%, 37%, 43%, 44%, and 43%

All three risk models reliably distinguished risk of progression at baseline, upon yearly reassessment (e.g. 1 year from diagnosis), and in time-dependent analyses. Upstaging to a high-risk category was associated with an increased risk of progression in all three models:

- **Mayo2005**:
	- Hazard Ratio (HR) = 5.43
	- 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.21–24.39
	- p = 0.027
- **Sweden2014**:
	- HR = 13.02
	- 95% CI = 5.25–32.28
	- p < 0.001
- **NCI2019**:
	- HR = 5.85
	- 95% CI = 2.49–13.74
	- p < 0.001

Our study shows that MGUS risk stratification models can be applied longitudinally to repeatedly determine and improve individual risk of progression. Patient migration to higher risk categories during follow-up should prompt more frequent monitoring in clinical routine.

### Investigation and management of the monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: A British Society for Haematology good practice paper [^115CTYvt]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, specifically in terms of follow-up, the BSH 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining appropriate blood tests — such as CBC, creatinine, serum calcium, paraprotein, and serum free light chain levels — six months after diagnosis and annually thereafter in patients with newly diagnosed MGUS. It is advised to consider extending the interval for those with low-risk MGUS and to reduce further investigations in patients with a short life expectancy.

### New developments in myeloma treatment and response assessment [^111bUdGt]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic neoplasm characterized by the clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. It is almost always preceded by an initial monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, which then develops into asymptomatic, or smoldering, MM, an intermediate clinical stage between monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and MM.

The definition of symptomatic MM, a clinical stage requiring treatment, was traditionally based on the presence of organ damage related to plasma cell growth as defined by the CRAB criteria (calcium elevation, renal insufficiency, anemia, and bone lesions). This definition was revised in 2014 by the International Myeloma Working Group, integrating new prognostic biomarkers to avoid delaying treatment of high-risk smoldering-MM–classified patients and prevent the establishment of harmful bone lesions or renal impairment.

New biomarkers have been defined that are associated with an 80% probability of progression toward positive MM CRAB criteria within two years, making it possible to identify patients requiring therapy. These biomarkers include:

- **Clonal bone marrow plasma cell percentage**: At least 60%.
- **Serum free light chain ratio**: At least 100, involved or uninvolved.
- **Bone focal lesions (FL) on MRI assessment**: More than one lesion.

Given that even an asymptomatic bone lesion must be considered a treatment criterion, the role of imaging has increased over the last few decades. Modern morphologic or hybrid imaging techniques have replaced the conventional methods.

### Multiple myeloma [^112sKLF2]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) constitutes 1% of malignant diseases and 15% of hematological malignancies. In virtually all patients, MM is preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The cause of monoclonal gammopathies and the mechanisms of progression are unknown. The diagnosis of MM requires the presence of an M-protein in serum and/or urine, increased bone marrow plasma cells, and related organ or tissue impairment. Cytogenetic status, serum β2-microglobulin, and response to therapy are key prognostic factors.

- **Treatment of younger patients**: Should include a triple-agent induction regimen (i.e. bortezomib/thalidomide/dexamethasone), autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), and consolidation and maintenance incorporating novel agents along with sequential minimal residual disease studies to determine for how long treatment is still of benefit. Allogeneic transplantation with reduced-intensity conditioning is promising but remains experimental.

- **Patients not eligible for ASCT**: The best initial regimens are melphalan/prednisone/thalidomide (MPT), melphalan/prednisone/bortezomib (MPV), and lenalidomide/dexamethasone.

- **Relapsing patients**: The choice of salvage therapy should depend on: (i) the components of initial therapy, (ii) the degree and duration of response, (iii) type of relapse: aggressive versus indolent, (iv) previous toxicities, and (v) age and performance status. A sequential approach is preferred over a combination of multiple agents.

Supportive measures include the use of bisphosphonates and erythropoietin according to the updated guidelines.

### From myeloma precursor disease to multiple myeloma: New diagnostic concepts and opportunities for early intervention [^117UxE4Y]. Clinical Cancer Research (2011). Low credibility.

Since monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) was first described more than 30 years ago, the definition of the entity has evolved. Today, three distinct clinical MGUS subtypes have been defined: non-immunoglobulin M (IgM; IgG or IgA) MGUS, IgM MGUS, and light chain MGUS. Each subtype is characterized by unique intermediate stages and progression events. Strong evidence indicates that multiple myeloma is consistently preceded by a precursor state at the molecular level, emphasizing the urgent need to understand the mechanisms regulating the transformation from precursor to full-blown multiple myeloma.

If such knowledge becomes available, it will allow clinicians to define high-risk and low-risk precursor patients for more tailored clinical management. Additionally, it would provide insights into the individual patient's disease biology, facilitating targeted and individualized treatment strategies. According to clinical guidelines, patients diagnosed with MGUS and smoldering myeloma should not be treated outside of clinical trials. However, it is reasonable to believe that high-risk precursor patients may become candidates for early treatment strategies in the near future. In this review, we discuss novel insights from recent studies and propose future directions relevant to clinical management and research.

### How I manage monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^112zY9TQ]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is, in many ways, a unique hematologic entity. Unlike most hematologic conditions in which the diagnosis is intentional and credited to hematologists, the discovery of MGUS is most often incidental and made by non-hematologists. MGUS is considered an obligate precursor to several lymphoplasmacytic malignancies, including immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis, multiple myeloma, and Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Therefore, long-term follow-up is generally recommended. Despite its high prevalence, there is surprisingly limited evidence to inform best clinical practice both at the time of diagnosis and during follow-up.

We present seven vignettes to illustrate common clinical management questions that arise during the course of MGUS. Where evidence is present, we provide a concise summary of the literature and clear recommendations on management. Where evidence is lacking, we describe how we practice and provide a rationale for our approach. We also discuss the potential harms associated with MGUS diagnosis, a topic that is rarely, if ever, broached between patients and providers, or even considered in academic debate.

### Personalised progression prediction in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or smouldering multiple myeloma (PANGEA): a retrospective, multicohort study [^1144ZtMD]. The Lancet Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Patients with precursors to multiple myeloma are dichotomized as having monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or smouldering multiple myeloma based on monoclonal protein concentrations or bone marrow plasma cell percentage. Traditional risk stratifications utilize laboratory measurements at diagnosis but do not incorporate time-varying biomarkers. Our objective was to develop a stratification algorithm for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smouldering multiple myeloma that employed accessible, time-varying biomarkers to model the risk of progression to multiple myeloma.

In this retrospective, multicohort study, we included patients aged 18 years or older with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or smouldering multiple myeloma. We assessed several modeling approaches to predict disease progression to multiple myeloma using a training cohort from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA (annotated from November 13, 2019, to April 13, 2022). The PANGEA models were developed using data on biomarkers including monoclonal protein concentration, free light chain ratio, age, creatinine concentration, bone marrow plasma cell percentage, and hemoglobin trajectories from medical records to predict progression from precursor disease to multiple myeloma. The models underwent validation in two independent cohorts from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece (from January 26, 2020, to February 7, 2022; validation cohort 1), and University College London, UK (from June 9, 2020, to February 7, 2022; validation cohort 2).

### Smoldering multiple myeloma current treatment algorithms [^113GvRPG]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is an asymptomatic condition that occupies a space between monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and multiple myeloma (MM) along the spectrum of clonal plasma cell proliferative disorders. It is not a biologic intermediate stage between MGUS and MM, but rather represents a heterogeneous clinically defined condition in which some patients (approximately two-thirds) have MGUS (pre-malignancy), and some (approximately one-third) have MM (biologic malignancy). Unfortunately, no single pathologic or molecular feature can reliably distinguish these two groups of patients. For purposes of practice and clinical trials, specific risk factors are used to identify patients with SMM in whom malignant transformation has already likely occurred (high-risk SMM). Patients with newly diagnosed high-risk SMM should be offered therapy with lenalidomide or lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (Rd) for 2 years, or enrollment in clinical trials. Patients with low-risk SMM should be observed without therapy every 3–4 months.

### Changing paradigms in diagnosis and treatment of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) [^114HJohn]. Leukemia (2020). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a highly heterogeneous disease that exists along a continuous disease spectrum, starting with premalignant conditions such as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) that inevitably precede MM. Over the past two decades, significant progress has been made in the genetic characterization and risk stratification of precursor plasma cell disorders. Indeed, the clinical introduction of highly effective and well-tolerated drugs raises the question: would earlier therapeutic intervention with novel therapies in MGUS and SMM patients alter their natural history, providing a potential curative option?

In this review, we discuss the epidemiology of MGUS and SMM and models for risk stratification that predict MGUS and SMM progression to MM. We further discuss genetic heterogeneity and clonal evolution in MM and the interplay between tumor cells and the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Finally, we provide an overview of the recommendations for the management of MGUS and SMM and discuss the open controversies in the field in light of promising results from early intervention clinical trials.

### Impact of optimal follow-up of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance on early diagnosis and prevention of myeloma-related complications [^112cj4HN]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is associated with a long-term risk of progression to multiple myeloma (MM) or related malignancy. To prevent serious myeloma-related complications, lifelong annual follow-up has been recommended, but its value is unknown. We reviewed all patients from southeastern Minnesota seen at Mayo Clinic between 1973 and 2004 with MGUS who subsequently progressed to MM.

Of 116 patients, 69% had optimal follow-up of MGUS. Among these, abnormalities on serial follow-up laboratory testing led to the diagnosis of MM in 16%, whereas MM was diagnosed only after serious MM-related complications in 45%. In the remaining cases, the mechanisms leading to MM diagnosis included workup of less serious symptoms (25%), incidental findings during the workup of unrelated medical conditions (11%), and unknown factors (3%).

High-risk MGUS patients (≥ 1.5 g/dL and/or non-IgG MGUS) were more likely to be optimally followed (81% vs. 64%) and to be diagnosed with MM secondary to serial follow-up testing (21% vs. 7%). This retrospective study suggests that routine annual follow-up of MGUS may not be required in low-risk MGUS. Future studies are needed to replicate and expand our findings and to determine the optimal frequency of monitoring in higher-risk MGUS patients.

### Outcomes after biochemical or clinical progression in patients with multiple myeloma [^113wv6uv]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematologic malignancy, originating from clonal plasma cells. Even with various approaches, MM remains incurable, and eventually nearly all patients relapse after first-line therapy. At relapse, patients may present with increasing serum and/or urine monoclonal protein alone (biochemical progression [BP]) or may present with clinical features suggestive of progression, including CRAB symptoms (C: hypercalcemia; R: renal failure; A: anemia; B: bone disease). More specifically, these symptoms are hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia that cannot be attributed to another cause, new or evolving bone lesions, and/or soft tissue plasmacytomas, but they may not meet the criteria for BP. BP precedes clinical progression (CP) by a median of 5.1 months (range, 2–24 months). Approximately one quarter of patients, even when they are closely monitored during complete remission (CR), can develop unanticipated CP with end organ damage. Conversely, some patients present with indolent, asymptomatic BP that might not be treated for a long time. Recognizing and understanding different progression patterns is crucial not only to better understand the disease biology but also for counseling the patient and implementing salvage therapy, especially in the BP phase.

The true prevalence of different patterns of progression and their clinical significance to the outcome is not well understood, because clinical trial data from patients' relapse characteristics vary from study to study on account of different enrollment criteria.

### The role of diagnosis and clinical follow-up of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance on survival in multiple myeloma [^113hET62]. JAMA Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is consistently preceded by the precursor state, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The average annual risk of progression from MGUS to multiple myeloma is 0.5% to 1.0%. Guidelines suggest life-long clinical follow-up of individuals diagnosed with MGUS depending on risk stratification. However, the impact of diagnosing and conducting clinical follow-up of MGUS on MM survival is unclear.

The objective of this study is to estimate the impact of prior knowledge of MGUS diagnosis and comorbidities on MM survival.

We conducted a population-based study including all patients with MM diagnosed in Sweden (n = 14,798) from 1976 to 2005, with follow-up until 2007. Of these, 394 (2.7%) had previously been diagnosed with MGUS. Information on comorbidities was gathered for all patients. We calculated survival rates from the time of MM diagnosis, comparing patients with versus those without prior knowledge of MGUS. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk factors for death. Chi-square tests were used to evaluate differences in comorbidities.

- **Exposures**: Prior knowledge of MGUS among MM patients. In a sub-analysis, monoclonal (M)-protein concentration and type were used as exposure.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Risk of death and comorbidities.

Results indicated that patients with MM with prior knowledge of MGUS had significantly better overall survival (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77–0.96; p < 0.01) than those without prior knowledge of MGUS. The median survival for MM patients with prior MGUS knowledge was 2.8 years.

### Differential diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^113itTDc]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is an asymptomatic plasma cell disorder occurring in 4.2% of adults over 50 years of age, which can progress into symptomatic diseases either through proliferation of the plasma cell clone, giving rise to multiple myeloma and other lymphoplasmacellular neoplasms, or through organ damage caused by the monoclonal protein, as seen in light-chain amyloidosis and related conditions.

- **Differential diagnosis**: Differential diagnosis of asymptomatic and symptomatic monoclonal gammopathies is the determinant for starting therapy. The criteria for determining end-organ damage should include markers of organ injury caused by the monoclonal protein.

- **Patient assessment**: Patient assessment and optimal follow-up are now performed using risk stratification models that should also take into account the risk of developing AL amyloidosis. Patients with low-risk MGUS (approximately 40% of all MGUS patients) need limited assessment and very infrequent follow-up.

- **Novel developments**: The ongoing development of novel molecular biomarkers and advanced imaging techniques will improve the identification of high-risk patients who may benefit from early therapeutic intervention through innovative clinical trials.

### Observation or treatment for smoldering multiple myeloma? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies [^113FFGLf]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). High credibility.

When discussing potential treatment benefits for patients with otherwise asymptomatic disease, the risk/benefit balance should be considered. As anticipated, our analysis showed an increased frequency of severe toxicities in patients who received active treatment compared to controls. Importantly, though, two studies that assessed quality of life indices did not show significant differences between the treatment and observation groups. Furthermore, treatment did not increase the incidence of SPMs.

In addition to the above, the decision to provide anti-myeloma treatment in asymptomatic patients with precursor disease entails ethical considerations, in light of potential overtreatment in individuals who may never develop symptomatic MM. However, high-risk patients also have an increased risk of presenting with end-organ damage at the time of myeloma progression, even if they are on active surveillance.

Furthermore, the AQUILA study showed that significantly fewer patients required anti-myeloma therapy in the daratumumab group (~20%) than in the observation group (~40%) at 3 years from study entry. Therefore, early intervention prevents/delays a significant number of patients from needing intensive anti-myeloma therapy.

For those reasons, it is essential both to evaluate long-term results of ongoing clinical trials and to refine the stratification systems in order to define the true high-risk patients. The incorporation of genomic, proteomic, and immunophenotypic features in combination with clinical and laboratory parameters may be useful in this direction.

### Familial monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and multiple myeloma: Epidemiology, risk factors, and biological characteristics [^116ZSVDY]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), a precursor to multiple myeloma (MM), is one of the most common premalignant conditions in the general population. The cause of MGUS is largely unknown. Recent studies show that there is an increased prevalence of MGUS in blood relatives of persons with lymphoproliferative and plasma cell proliferative disorders, suggesting the presence of shared underlying genetic influences.

In the past few years, additional studies have examined risk factors and biologic characteristics that may contribute to the increased prevalence of MGUS among relatives of probands with MGUS, MM, and other blood malignancies. This article reviews the known epidemiology and risk factors for familial MGUS and myeloma, the risk of lymphoproliferative disorders, and other malignancies among blood relatives of patients with MGUS and MM, and discusses future directions for research.

The presence of monoclonal proteins is common, with prevalence in the United States around 5%, increasing with age. Although most patients are asymptomatic, most cases are caused by a clonal plasma cell disorder. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) are asymptomatic precursor conditions with a variable risk of progression to multiple myeloma. In recent years, significant progress has been made to better understand the factors leading to symptom development and progression to myeloma. This review summarizes the diagnosis treatment guidelines for MGUS and SMM and highlights recent advances that underscore a shifting paradigm in the evaluation and management of plasma cell precursor conditions.

### European myeloma network recommendations on tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma: What to use and when [^114T5mNA]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

The classification and differential diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies are based on clinical, biological, and radiological criteria but remain challenging in certain cases. Multiple myeloma (MM) is the most common malignant gammopathy and is associated with a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms. In the past decade, the treatment options for patients with MM have increased considerably. Together with improved supportive care, these new regimens significantly prolong the survival of both younger and older patients.

The 2014 revision of the diagnostic criteria for MM allows the initiation of treatment in patients defined only by biomarkers, annotated as SLIM criteria [bone marrow (BM) infiltration > 60%, involved/uninvolved serum free light-chain (SFLC) ratio > 100 or > 1 focal lesion > 5 mm as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)], without waiting for conventional CRAB criteria (hypercalcemia, renal impairment, anemia, bone disease) to occur. Both the SLIM biomarker and CRAB criteria are listed in Figure 1.

Given the recent evolution in diagnosis and response assessment, members of the European Myeloma Network (EMN) agreed to review and recommend diagnostic and response criteria to allow their discriminating use in daily practice and care of patients.

- **Figure 1: Differential diagnosis** between monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, smoldering myeloma, and multiple myeloma. The discrimination between these monoclonal gammopathies is based on:

### Multiple myeloma precursor disease [^1145g1Mm]. JAMA (2010). Low credibility.

Recent data indicate that multiple myeloma is consistently preceded by the precursor states of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering myeloma. Currently, multiple myeloma is a clinical diagnosis based on manifestations including hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, and bone lesions, whereas MGUS and smoldering myeloma are diagnosed based on laboratory abnormalities. Clinical markers allow for more individualized risk stratification and counseling of these patients. However, there is a dearth of biomarkers and molecular imaging techniques capable of:

- **Identifying high-risk disease biology**: Accurately identifying patients with disease biology corresponding with a high risk of progression.
- **Understanding transformation mechanisms**: Elucidating the mechanism of transformation to multiple myeloma.
- **Framework for targeted therapies**: Forming a framework for the development of targeted therapies.

This case presentation and review discusses the understanding of myeloma precursor disease and future opportunities for improving personalized management of patients with MGUS or smoldering myeloma, as well as the potential for developing early treatment strategies designed to delay and prevent the development of multiple myeloma.

The incidence of multiple myeloma is about 1.8 per 100,000. Approximately 3%–5% of adults over 50 years of age are diagnosed with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The prevalence is higher if the diagnosis is based on an abnormal ratio of serum free light chains. In fact, 300–500 people out of 10,000 receive a diagnosis of this pre-malignant disorder when using the faulty criterion of an abnormal light chain ratio. Diagnoses based on an abnormal light chain ratio are incorrect in 96% of instances.

However, a large number of people are subjected to psychological trauma and financial toxicity by undergoing repeated and invasive testing. If strict criteria requiring the presence of monoclonal immunoglobulin were applied, only about 10 people per 10,000 might have MGUS, and only one person may progress to multiple myeloma in 10 years. Even that one person gains no benefit from an 'early' diagnosis. Thus, there is only harm and no benefit from screening for MGUS.

### Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smoldering myeloma: New insights into pathophysiology and epidemiology [^111QgWuT]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Routine screening for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is not indicated. Despite this fact, MGUS is a common finding in medical practice. Almost all individuals diagnosed with MGUS represent incidental cases diagnosed when physicians order serum protein electrophoresis, immunofixation, or both, as part of the work-up of a number of common symptoms and laboratory abnormalities.

In the absence of reliable molecular predictors of outcome, the detection of an early precursor state typically imposes a complex situation for the patient and the responsible physician, usually leading to many questions that lack clear answers. In recent years, several novel insights have been gained in the area of multiple myeloma (MM) precursor disease. This review focuses on results from recent investigations and discusses implications for diagnostic work-up, clinical management, and patient counseling.

More specifically, it sheds light on the following commonly asked questions by patients and physicians:

- **Risk of progression**: What is the risk of progression from precursor to full-blown MM, and are there ways to risk-stratify patients?
- **Precursor state necessity**: Is MM always preceded by a precursor state, and is there anything that could or should be done to delay or prevent progression?
- **Development of precursor diseases**: Why do some individuals develop MM precursor diseases, and is there a reason to screen the family?

### Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smoldering multiple myeloma: biological insights and early treatment strategies [^117KxVm1]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

After decades of virtually no progress, multiple myeloma survival has improved significantly in the past 10 years. Indeed, multiple myeloma has perhaps seen more remarkable progress in treatment and patient outcomes than any other cancer during the last decade. Recent data show that multiple myeloma is consistently preceded by a precursor state (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [MGUS]/smoldering multiple myeloma [SMM]). This observation provides a framework for prospective studies focusing on transformation from precursor disease to multiple myeloma and for the development of treatment strategies targeting "early myeloma".

- **Biological insights in MGUS/SMM**: This review discusses biological insights in MGUS and SMM, providing an update on clinical management.
- **Integration of novel markers**: The integration of novel biological markers, molecular imaging, and clinical monitoring of MGUS/SMM could facilitate the development of early treatment strategies for high-risk SMM (early myeloma) patients in the future.

### Observation or treatment for smoldering multiple myeloma? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies [^114mwEo3]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). High credibility.

The present meta-analysis was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, with the study protocol discussed and agreed upon in advance by all authors. A systematic search was conducted independently by two authors in the Medline, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane databases from conception until December 16th, 2024. The focus was on randomized clinical trials evaluating therapeutic approaches for patients with smoldering multiple myeloma (sMM). The search algorithm encompassed key terms on the disease and the prespecified study characteristics, including "smoldering multiple myeloma", "treatment", "therapy", "management", "observation", "watch and wait", "active surveillance", "monitoring", "active monitoring", and "placebo".

Eligible articles included peer-reviewed full texts of randomized clinical trials on anti-myeloma therapies for sMM. These trials were controlled with observation or no anti-myeloma treatment comparator arms and reported survival outcomes, such as progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and/or time to progression to symptomatic disease (TTP) in terms of effect outcomes between arms. These were the main outcomes of the study. Secondary outcomes included key safety characteristics, such as grade 3–4 adverse events in total or grade 3–4 hematological adverse events. Case-control, cohort, and cross-sectional studies, case series, case reports, reviews, in vitro, and animal studies were not included in this meta-analysis.

The present systematic review and meta-analysis was registered.

### Observation or treatment for smoldering multiple myeloma? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies [^113k2b9r]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). High credibility.

Guidelines for the management of smoldering multiple myeloma (sMM) primarily advocate for observation rather than immediate treatment, given the historically indolent nature of the disease in many patients. The standard of care involves regular monitoring with periodic laboratory studies every 3 to 4 months and yearly imaging assessments with whole-body low-dose computed tomography (WBLDCT) and/or whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WBMRI) to detect progression to symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM). However, some patients will ultimately behave as having a pre-malignant monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), while others may progress to malignant MM.

- **Risk-adapted approach**: Consensus recommendations suggest a risk-adapted approach where low- and intermediate-risk patients undergo observation, while high-risk patients may be considered for participating in clinical trials evaluating early treatment strategies. This conservative strategy is based on the premise that early treatment could expose patients to unnecessary toxicities without proven long-term survival benefits. However, the optimal approach to patients with sMM is evolving as novel prognostic markers and therapeutic interventions emerge.

Recent evidence suggests that early therapeutic intervention with anti-myeloma regimens, particularly for patients with high-risk sMM, may delay disease progression and improve survival outcomes. These findings challenge the traditional watch-and-wait approach and raise important questions regarding both patient selection and the optimal timing of intervention. In this context, this meta-analysis aims to synthesize available data from randomized clinical trials on early therapeutic interventions for sMM.

### Diagnosis and management of smouldering myeloma: A British Society for Haematology good practice paper [^111UJWdx]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma is a bone marrow-based plasma cell tumour that develops from asymptomatic precursor conditions, smouldering myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance. All are characterized by the presence of a monoclonal protein in the blood. Diagnosis and distinction between these conditions are based on blood tests, bone marrow biopsy, and cross-sectional imaging.

There are various risk stratification models that group patients with smouldering myeloma into risk groups based on the risk of progression to symptomatic disease. Management is mainly observational for patients with smouldering myeloma, although clinical trials for high-risk disease may be available. Restaging is required if there is evidence of progression.

### Monoclonal gammopathy of increasing significance: Time to screen [^1163z5bT]. Haematologica (2023). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy (MG) is a frequently detected clonal B-cell or plasma-cell disorder. Importantly, every multiple myeloma (MM) case is preceded by MG. Although clinical algorithms now allow earlier treatment of patients with biomarkers of malignancy before MM-induced tissue damage (CRAB) occurs, most patients are still diagnosed late. It is important to revisit how MG should be managed in clinical practice and whether screening is required.

As the prevalence of MG and other medical co-morbidities both rise with increasing age, the degree of contribution of MG to disease states other than malignant progression is often unclear. This can lead to monitoring lapses and underrecognition of the organ dysfunction that can occur with monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance (MGCS). Therefore, models of progression to MM and/or MGCS require further refinement.

While MG is currently detected incidentally, a case for screening has been made with ongoing studies in this area. Screening has the potential benefit of earlier detection and prevention of both MGCS and delayed MM presentations, but important drawbacks include the psychosocial impact on individuals and resource burden on healthcare services.

MG terminology should transition alongside our increasing understanding of the condition and genomic characterization that have already begun to revise the MG nomenclature. The biology of MG has been poorly understood and is often inferred from the biology of MM, which is unhelpful. We review the literature and case for MG screening in this paper.

### Immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis diagnosis and treatment algorithm 2021 [^117Ds8eA]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). High credibility.

For the cancer provider following patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or smoldering multiple myeloma, it is important to keep in mind that these patients are not monitored solely for the development of myeloma. Some develop lymphoma or Waldenström macroglobulinemia, and a small percentage develop light chain amyloidosis. At Mayo Clinic, 9% of all patients seen with a monoclonal gammopathy are ultimately proven to have light chain amyloidosis. Even adjusting for referral bias, 3–4% of all patients with monoclonal proteins have light chain amyloidosis. Furthermore, if a provider does not see one patient with AL amyloidosis for every five patients with multiple myeloma, it is likely the diagnosis is being overlooked.

The ongoing rates of early mortality in newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis suggest there continue to be significant delays in diagnosis. Nearly 20% of patients succumb to the disease within six months of diagnosis, and this statistic has shown no improvement in 40 years, suggesting that patients who are diagnosed at an advanced state cannot be helped despite major advances in therapy for this disease.

### Revised free light chain reference intervals enhance risk stratification in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and reduce overdiagnosis [^114Hp7Bx]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is an asymptomatic precursor condition of multiple myeloma (MM) and other lymphoproliferative disorders. The prevalence of MGUS increases with age and is found in approximately 4.2% of the population over 50 years of age. Although all cases of MM are preceded by MGUS, only a minority (approximately 1% annually) of those with MGUS progress to malignant lymphoproliferative disease.

An early diagnosis of MM or a precursor state may decrease the risk of irreversible organ damage as seen in late-stage disease and improve treatment outcomes. Furthermore, MM patients with an acute disease presentation have a poorer prognosis compared to patients diagnosed in an outpatient setting. Therefore, guidelines recommend follow-up and/or more thorough examination (for example, bone marrow sampling) of individuals with MGUS at high risk of progression. To identify high-risk patients, the Mayo Clinic risk stratification model is used to guide work-up and follow-up of MGUS.

An abnormal free light chain (FLC) ratio increases the risk of MGUS progression independently of other risk factors and is incorporated in the Mayo Clinic risk stratification model. Besides monoclonal gammopathies, the serum FLC is affected by age and renal function, which must be considered when interpreting FLC levels and ratios. The first reference intervals for FLC were defined in a smaller cohort of 282 individuals with normal kidney function and later for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with estimated glomerular rate (eGFR) < 60.

### Complete response in myeloma extends survival without, but not with history of prior monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or smouldering disease [^1161oAYe]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Complete response (CR) is still considered an important surrogate marker for outcome in multiple myeloma (MM). Long-term survival after transplantation, however, has been observed in a substantial proportion of patients who never achieved CR. The tandem transplant trial, Total Therapy 2, enrolled 668 patients, who were randomized upfront to thalidomide (THAL) or no THAL. Fifty-six patients were identified as having had, for at least six months prior to initiation of therapy, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS, n = 21), smouldering MM (SMM, n = 22), or solitary plasmacytoma of bone (SPC, n = 13).

The clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with such 'evolved' MM (E-MM) and those with 'unknown' prior history (U-MM) were compared. Fewer patients with MGUS/SMM-E-MM had anemia or renal failure; CR was lower (22% vs. 48%), but four-year estimates of event-free survival (54% vs. 56% with U-MM) and overall survival (65% vs. 70% with U-MM) were similar to those with SPC-E-MM or U-MM. In the latter group, achieving CR was associated with prolonged survival. In comparison with U-MM, E-MM evolved from MGUS/SMM was associated with a lower CR rate without adversely affecting survival. In contrast, CR was an independent favorable feature for survival in U-MM.
