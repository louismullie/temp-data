## Question

Cause if fibromyalgia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the cause of fibromyalgia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether there is a single identifiable cause or a multifactorial model. Then, I should verify the core pathophysiological mechanism, especially central sensitization. Next, I will examine genetic predisposition, followed by environmental and psychosocial triggers. After that, I need to review neurobiological and neuroendocrine abnormalities, including neuroinflammation and small fiber pathology. Finally, I will synthesize a biopsychosocial model and clarify what remains unknown, making sure to check for conflicting evidence and correct any overstatements as I go.

> Let me first confirm the overarching answer: there is no single cause of fibromyalgia. Instead, it reflects a multifactorial interplay of predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors that converge on abnormal central pain processing, so I should avoid implying a unitary etiology and emphasize heterogeneity and subtypes [^116FzV9V] [^117C9Xeh].

> I will now examine the core mechanism, and I need to ensure I am precise here: the most consistently supported pathophysiology is central sensitization, meaning amplification of pain signals within the CNS with hyperalgesia and allodynia, often accompanied by impaired descending inhibitory control. Wait, let me verify that this is indeed the prevailing view across high-quality sources, and yes, multiple authoritative reviews and guidelines converge on central sensitization as central to fibromyalgia pathophysiology [^114ecN9W] [^111FmLVG].

> Next, I should review genetic predisposition. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a strong heritability signal because estimates vary by age and phenotype, but I should confirm that familial aggregation and modest heritability of the fibromyalgia score have been demonstrated, with higher heritability in younger individuals, which supports a genetic vulnerability that interacts with environmental factors rather than a Mendelian cause [^113SUBGW] [^116iDeJA].

> Now, I need to check environmental and psychosocial triggers. Adverse childhood experiences, trauma, and major life stressors are repeatedly associated with fibromyalgia risk, and I should double-check that these associations persist after adjustment, which they do in large observational datasets, indicating stress-related pathways likely contribute to onset in susceptible individuals [^113GRkaS] [^113KrUBj].

> Let me consider neurobiological abnormalities beyond central sensitization. I should confirm evidence for neurotransmitter imbalances, including serotonergic and noradrenergic deficits and glutamatergic excitation, and I should also verify structural and functional brain changes such as reduced gray matter in pain-modulating regions and altered network connectivity. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought opioidergic transmission was uniformly reduced, but I should correct that — some data suggest opioidergic systems may be dysregulated rather than globally deficient, so I will qualify that claim to avoid overstatement [^116rVGif] [^115zMSvv] [^116q4Y8T].

> I will now examine neuroendocrine and autonomic dysregulation. I need to ensure I mention HPA axis alterations and autonomic imbalance as plausible contributors to symptom maintenance, and yes, reviews describe stress-responsive systems as perturbed in fibromyalgia, aligning with the stress-related clinical phenotype and the observed comorbidity with mood and functional disorders [^116iDeJA] [^117LpcPB].

> But wait, what about inflammation and autoimmunity? I should confirm whether fibromyalgia is an autoimmune disease — current evidence does not support classification as an autoimmune disorder, yet there are signals of low-grade inflammation and immune activation in subsets, including elevated pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and emerging hypotheses around micro-inflammation and neuroinflammation. Hold on, I should verify that these findings are heterogeneous and not universal, which they are, so any inflammatory contribution likely reflects subtypes rather than a single inflammatory cause [^111xcYAP] [^114NAmHe] [^111Vrqwb].

> Next, I should review peripheral contributors. Small fiber neuropathy has been reported in a subset of patients, and I need to ensure I frame this as supportive but not universal evidence that peripheral nociceptive drivers can feed into central sensitization. Additionally, peripheral pain generators may coexist and amplify symptoms, so I should emphasize that peripheral and central mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and may interact bidirectionally [^111a3mKn] [^116rxCXJ] [^114oSMjr].

> Let me synthesize a working model. Fibromyalgia likely arises when genetic vulnerability predisposes to stress-sensitive neurobiological systems, environmental stressors or trauma trigger maladaptive neuroplastic changes, and central sensitization with neuroendocrine and autonomic dysregulation perpetuate symptoms. I should confirm that this biopsychosocial model is consistent with contemporary reviews, and yes, it aligns with current conceptualizations emphasizing individualized, multidimensional pathogenesis and the need for tailored multimodal care [^116FzV9V] [^117C9Xeh].

> Finally, I need to clarify what remains unknown. There is no validated biomarker for diagnosis or etiologic stratification, no single causal pathway has been proven, and heterogeneity suggests multiple subtypes with distinct mechanisms. I should double-check that guidelines and primers consistently highlight these gaps and the ongoing debate, which they do, reinforcing that our current understanding is probabilistic and mechanism-based rather than causally definitive [^116FzV9V] [^117C9Xeh] [^113eYp2c].

Fibromyalgia is caused by **central sensitization** [^114ecN9W] — abnormal amplification of pain signals in the brain and spinal cord — driven by genetic predisposition [^113SUBGW], chronic stress or trauma [^113KrUBj], and neurochemical imbalances (notably serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine) [^116rVGif] [^114nuVA9]. It is not an autoimmune or inflammatory disease, but low-grade neuroinflammation and immune dysregulation may contribute in some patients [^116rVGif] [^114NAmHe] [^1139f7qW]. Triggers include physical or emotional trauma, infections, and repetitive injuries [^11599m8F]; risk is higher with female sex, family history, mood disorders, and sleep disturbances [^11599m8F] [^111FeUfn]. The condition reflects a complex interplay of neural, psychological, and environmental factors rather than a single cause [^117C9Xeh].

---

## Central sensitization and abnormal pain processing

Central sensitization is the **core mechanism** [^1123zrQS], characterized by heightened sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia) and pain from non-painful stimuli (allodynia) [^116rVGif]. It involves abnormal pain processing in the brain and spinal cord, with altered neurotransmitter levels (serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine) and impaired descending inhibitory pathways [^notfound].

---

## Genetic predisposition

Genetic factors contribute to fibromyalgia risk; **familial aggregation** and twin studies indicate heritability [^notfound]. Polymorphisms in genes regulating neurotransmitters (e.g. COMT, SLC6A4) and pain pathways have been implicated [^112XpF7m].

---

## Neurochemical imbalances

Imbalances in neurotransmitters — including serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine — are implicated in fibromyalgia [^116rVGif] [^114nuVA9]. These neurotransmitters modulate pain perception, mood, and sleep; their dysregulation contributes to pain amplification and associated symptoms [^116rVGif].

---

## Psychological and emotional factors

Chronic stress, anxiety, depression, and trauma are strongly associated with fibromyalgia [^11599m8F]. Stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous system, altering pain processing and increasing susceptibility to chronic pain [^117LpcPB].

---

## Environmental and lifestyle factors

Environmental and lifestyle factors — including physical trauma, repetitive injuries, infections, and obesity — increase fibromyalgia risk [^1139f7qW]. Sleep disturbances, sedentary behavior, and poor diet may exacerbate symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Immune system dysregulation and neuroinflammation

Although fibromyalgia is not classified as an autoimmune disease, **low-grade neuroinflammation** and immune dysregulation have been observed in some patients [^111xcYAP]. Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, TNF-alpha) and immune cell activation may contribute to central sensitization and symptom persistence [^114NAmHe].

---

## Summary of contributing factors

| **Factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Central sensitization | Amplification of pain signals in CNS; hyperalgesia, allodynia [^114ecN9W] |
| Genetic predisposition | Familial aggregation; genetic polymorphisms [^113SUBGW] |
| Neurochemical imbalances | Serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine dysregulation [^116rVGif] |
| Psychological factors | Chronic stress, anxiety, depression, trauma [^111FeUfn] |
| Environmental factors | Physical trauma, infections, obesity, sleep disturbances [^11599m8F] |
| Immune dysregulation | Low-grade neuroinflammation, cytokine abnormalities [^114NAmHe] |

---

Fibromyalgia arises from a **multifactorial interplay** of central sensitization, genetic predisposition, neurochemical imbalances, psychological stress, environmental triggers, and immune dysregulation. No single cause explains all cases; effective management requires a comprehensive, individualized approach addressing these interconnected factors [^112NPA7J].

### The phenotypic and genetic signatures of common musculoskeletal pain conditions [^112XpF7m]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Musculoskeletal pain conditions, such as fibromyalgia and low back pain, tend to coexist in affected individuals and are characterized by a report of pain greater than expected based on the results of a standard physical evaluation. The pathophysiology of these conditions is largely unknown, we lack biological markers for accurate diagnosis, and conventional therapeutics have limited effectiveness. Growing evidence suggests that chronic pain conditions are associated with both physical and psychological triggers, which initiate pain amplification and psychological distress; thus, susceptibility is dictated by complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Herein, we review phenotypic and genetic markers of common musculoskeletal pain conditions, selected based on their association with musculoskeletal pain in previous research. The phenotypic markers of greatest interest include measures of pain amplification and 'psychological' measures (such as emotional distress, somatic awareness, psychosocial stress and catastrophizing). Genetic polymorphisms reproducibly linked with musculoskeletal pain are found in genes contributing to serotonergic and adrenergic pathways. Elucidation of the biological mechanisms by which these markers contribute to the perception of pain in these patients will enable the development of novel effective drugs and methodologies that permit better diagnoses and approaches to personalized medicine.

### An evolutionary stress-response hypothesis for chronic widespread pain (fibromyalgia syndrome) [^111Y2F4X]. Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The study aimed to seek a unifying biological basis for the phenomena encompassed in fibromyalgia syndrome (chronic widespread pain and associated morbidities).

Setting

While much progress has been made in the last decade in understanding chronic widespread pain, its pathogenesis remains stubbornly obscure and its treatment difficult. Two themes are gaining currency in the field: that chronic widespread pain is the result of central sensitization of nociception, and that chronic pain is somehow related to activation of a global stress response.

Design

In this article we merge these two ideas within the perspective of evolutionary biology to generate a hypothesis about the critical molecular pathway involved in chronic stress response activation, namely substance P and its preferred receptor, neurokinin-1 (NK-1R), which has many empirically testable implications.

Conclusion

Drawing on diverse findings in neurobiology, immunology, physiology, and comparative biology, we suggest that the form of central sensitization that leads to the profound phenomenological features of chronic widespread pain is part of a whole-organism stress response, which is evolutionarily conserved, following a general pattern found in the simplest living systems.

### Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^115kpu6R]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a chronic functional illness that presents with widespread musculoskeletal pain as well as a constellation of symptoms including fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, sleep difficulties, stiffness, anxiety, and depressed mood. The diagnosis of fibromyalgia, similar to other functional disorders, requires that organic diseases are not causing the symptoms. Systemic and rheumatic diseases can be ruled out by a patient history, physical examination, and laboratory investigations. Because there are no specific laboratory tests for fibromyalgia, the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria have been used in clinical settings; however, they are not ideal for individual patient diagnosis. Clinicians should be aware of limitations inherent in using tender points in the diagnosis of fibromyalgia. The multiple symptoms of fibromyalgia often overlap with those of related disorders and may further complicate the diagnosis. One of the most challenging diagnostic dilemmas that clinicians face is distinguishing fibromyalgia from other central pain disorders (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, migraine). Screening questions based on published criteria can be used as a first approach in diagnosing functional illnesses. Numerous studies report a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders in patients with fibromyalgia. Therefore, a careful history and evaluation should be taken for the presence of primary mood disturbances. To date, there is no "gold standard" for diagnosing fibromyalgia. Until a better clinical case definition of fibromyalgia exists, all diagnostic criteria should be interpreted with caution, considered rudimentary, and subject to modification.

### Pediatric fibromyalgia [^111QQtdW]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is an idiopathic chronic pain syndrome defined by widespread nonarticular musculoskeletal pain and generalized tender points. The syndrome is associated with a constellation of symptoms, including fatigue, nonrefreshing sleep, irritable bowel, and more. Central nervous system sensitization is a major pathophysiologic aspect of fibromyalgia; in addition, various external stimuli such as trauma and stress may contribute to development of the syndrome. Fibromyalgia is most common in midlife, but may be seen at any age. This article reviews the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, etiology, management, and outcome of pediatric fibromyalgia.

### The American College of Rheumatology preliminary diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia and measurement of symptom severity [^1123FAmk]. Arthritis Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia" for fibromyalgia.

The diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia serve as a clinical tool for identifying patients with this chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and tenderness in localized areas. The criteria are designed to provide a standardized approach to diagnosis, facilitating early intervention and management.

The primary components of the diagnostic criteria include the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) and the Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) score. The WPI assesses the number of areas in which the patient has experienced pain over the past week, while the SSS score evaluates the severity of three common symptoms: fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and cognitive symptoms.

The diagnostic criteria are met if the patient has a WPI of 7 or more and an SSS score of 5 or more, and these symptoms have been present at a similar level for at least three months, with no other disorder that would otherwise explain the pain. Alternatively, the criteria are also met if the patient has a WPI between 3 and 6 and an SSS score of 9 or more, with the same conditions regarding symptom duration and exclusion of other disorders.

These criteria provide a comprehensive and objective measure for diagnosing fibromyalgia, ensuring that patients receive appropriate care and treatment.

The diagnostic tool for fibromyalgia helps determine if a person meets the criteria for a diagnosis by evaluating specific conditions. Here's how it works:

- The tool considers the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) and Symptom Severity (SS) scale scores in two scenarios:

- WPI of 7 or more and an SS score of 5 or more.
- WPI between 3 and 6 and an SS score of 9 or more.

- It also considers whether the symptoms have persisted at a similar level for at least three months.

- Additionally, it verifies that no other disorder explains the pain.

To determine if the diagnostic criteria are met, the tool checks the following conditions:

- The first condition is met if WPI is 7 or more, SS score is 5 or more, symptoms have persisted for three months, and no other disorder explains the pain.

- The second condition is met if WPI is between 3 and 6, SS score is 9 or more, symptoms have persisted for three months, and no other disorder explains the pain.

If either of these conditions is satisfied, the tool concludes that the diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia are met. Otherwise, it concludes that they are not met. This approach systematically uses established measurements to assess whether a fibromyalgia diagnosis is justified based on pain index, severity, duration, and exclusion of other disorders.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for fibromyalgia, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, NFGAP 2013 guidelines recommend to establish the diagnosis of FM as early as possible by a primary care physician without requiring confirmation by a specialist, and communicate this diagnosis to the patient. Avoid obtaining repeated investigations after diagnosis unless required by new-onset symptoms or signs on physical examination.

### Specialized, pro-resolving mediators as potential therapeutic agents for alleviating fibromyalgia symptomatology [^111Dpf32]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To present a hypothesis on a novel strategy in the treatment of fibromyalgia (FM).

Design

A narrative review.

Setting

FM as a disease remains a challenging concept for numerous reasons, including undefined etiopathogenesis, unclear triggers, and unsuccessful treatment modalities. We hypothesize that the inflammatome, the entire set of molecules involved in inflammation, acting as a common pathophysiological instrument of gut dysbiosis, sarcopenia, and neuroinflammation, is one of the major mechanisms underlying FM pathogenesis. In this setup, dysbiosis is proposed as the primary trigger of the inflammatome, sarcopenia as the peripheral nociceptive source, and neuroinflammation as the central mechanism of pain sensitization, transmission, and symptomatology of FM. Whereas neuroinflammation is highly considered as a critical deleterious element in FM pathogenesis, the presumed pathogenic roles of sarcopenia and systemic inflammation remain controversial. Nevertheless, sarcopenia-associated processes and dysbiosis have been recently detected in individuals with FM. The prevalence of pro-inflammatory factors in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood has been repeatedly observed in individuals with FM, which supports the idea of a role of the inflammatome in FM pathogenesis. As such, failed inflammation resolution might be one of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Accordingly, the application of specialized, inflammation pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) seems most suitable for this goal.

Conclusions

The capability of various SPMs to prevent and attenuate pain has been repeatedly demonstrated in laboratory animal experiments. As SPMs suppress inflammation in a manner that does not compromise host defense, they could be attractive and safe candidates for the alleviation of FM symptomatology, probably in combination with anti-dysbiotic medicine.

### Fibromyalgia and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113w2nCo]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

The main strength of our study is the thorough systematic search of the literature to identify all available studies on the subject. All included studies were of good quality and included a large number of patients (188 751). Both all-cause mortality and specific causes of mortality were assessed. The main limitation of our study is different definitions of fibromyalgia that were used in the included studies, most of them including a mixed population of patients who were diagnosed using varying criteria. On the other hand, as mentioned above, this situation approaches a real-life situation with a heterogeneous cohort of fibromyalgia patients in terms of diagnostic criteria. Most studies included patients with both primary and secondary types of fibromyalgia, which could certainly have an impact on mortality. All of the included studies had participants with comorbidities. More than that, unadjusted effect measures were extracted from the included studies. Thus, our study does not address the question of whether fibromyalgia per se, or the degree of comorbidity, is associated with mortality, which is a very important issue. Since comorbidities are probably the link between the fibromyalgia and mortality and causes of death, further studies that address this point are crucial. Although most of the studies on specific-cause mortality used the same risk ratio (SMR), leading to a homogeneous effect measure, one studythat assessed suicide mortality used HR. Another limitation is the small number of studies that assessed each cause of mortality. The degree of heterogeneity between the studies was significant for most types of mortality, but when the number of studies is less than 20, I 2 should be interpreted with caution.

### Is fibromyalgia associated with a unique cytokine profile? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114NAmHe]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis of circulating cytokine levels in patients with fibromyalgia provides the best available evidence for the existence of a cytokine profile in the peripheral blood associated with diffuse chronic pain in the absence of underlying organic pathology. Our findings suggest that there is an association between fibromyalgia and both a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile (comprising increased TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8 levels) and an anti-inflammatory signature (characterized by increased IL-10 levels). Both increased and decreased levels of various pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines have been reported in individual studies, and therefore these meta-analysis results strengthen the clinical evidence that fibromyalgia is accompanied by a distinct cytokine profile.

It is well recognized that peripheral immune activation contributes to pathological pain through initial activation of the pattern recognition receptors expressed on immune cells following peripheral nerve injury or inflammation. In addition, peripheral nociceptors involved in pathological pain have been shown to express cytokine and chemokine receptors; this provides supporting evidence for direct immune activation of neuronal activity leading to enhanced excitability to subsequent stimulation, a phenomenon described as peripheral sensitization. Similarly to peripheral neurons, dorsal horn neurons express receptors for many pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-17, which when activated can impact the neuronal function (e.g. pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β enhance excitatory synaptic transmission and suppress inhibitory synaptic transmission in neurons of spinal cord). In contrast, although there is limited evidence for IL-10 receptor expression within the neural tissues, it has been postulated that the anti-inflammatory properties of IL-10 could be exploited as a potential therapeutic target for pain modulation.

### Narrative review: the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia [^112dUPwt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Primary fibromyalgia is a common yet poorly understood syndrome characterized by diffuse chronic pain accompanied by other somatic symptoms, including poor sleep, fatigue, and stiffness, in the absence of disease. Fibromyalgia does not have a distinct cause or pathology. Nevertheless, in the past decade, the study of chronic pain has yielded new insights into the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia and related chronic pain disorders. Accruing evidence shows that patients with fibromyalgia experience pain differently from the general population because of dysfunctional pain processing in the central nervous system. Aberrant pain processing, which can result in chronic pain and associated symptoms, may be the result of several interplaying mechanisms, including central sensitization, blunting of inhibitory pain pathways, alterations in neurotransmitters, and psychiatric comorbid conditions. This review provides an overview of the mechanisms currently thought to be partly responsible for the chronic diffuse pain typical of fibromyalgia.

### Fibromyalgia and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113d1Em9]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fibromyalgia is a poorly understood disease whose prevalence has increased over the years. The diagnostic criteria have evolved since 1990 in parallel with an enhanced understanding of its clinical manifestations, from widespread pain and tender points on clinical examination, to fibromyalgia as a polysymptomatic disorder in the 2010 and 2011 criteria, and to the 2016 criteria that incorporates modified widespread pain, with improved specificity. There is a growing understanding that fibromyalgia coexists with other health problems including other rheumatic diseases, and gastrointestinal, neurologic and mental health disorders. A recent study showed a positive association between the number of comorbid conditions and the severity of fibromyalgia symptoms. In light of the high burden of comorbidity, fibromyalgia patients could suffer from increased mortality. This hypothesis is strengthened by reports of the association of the widespread pain — the central criteria for fibromyalgia — and increased mortality rates for all-causes, cardiovascular and cancer mortality, and suicide attempts. To date there is no consensus as to whether fibromyalgia is associated with increased mortality. The purpose of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the existing literature on the association between clinical fibromyalgia and mortality, either all-cause or specific, and to pool the results in a meta-analysis.

### Is fibromyalgia associated with a unique cytokine profile? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111xcYAP]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Implications of all available evidence

In view of relatively poor level of evidence for a consistent cytokine signature associated with fibromyalgia, our research highlights the limited number of high-quality studies evaluating fibromyalgia patient groups, and the contradictory evidence provided by many of the studies assessing the same cytokine. Although the meta-analysis of eligible studies showed both increased pro-inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokine signatures, supporting the potential role for neuro-inflammation in the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia, further research is required to explore the potential role of a systemic cytokine profile in predicting disease severity or response to treatment in fibromyalgia patients. Whilst it is generally accepted that peripheral immune cells traffic to local sites of nerve damage, they are also involved in the development of pathological pain through migration to other tissues relevant for pain processing mechanisms. Harnessing the increased endogenous anti-inflammatory signalling potential associated with chronic pain may offer additional opportunities for pain therapeutic strategies.

### Potential dietary links to central sensitization in fibromyalgia: past reports and future directions [^116McEHF]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

### Basic information about fibromyalgia… [^11599m8F]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia Fibromyalgia is a condition that causes pain all over the body, also called widespread pain. Fibromyalgia also causes sleep problems, fatigue, and emotional and mental distress. People with fibromyalgia may be more sensitive to pain than people without fibromyalgia. This is called abnormal pain perception processing. Fibromyalgia affects about 4 million US adults, about 2% of the adult population. The cause of fibromyalgia is not known, but it can be effectively treated and managed. What are the risk factors for fibromyalgia. Known risk factors include: Age. Fibromyalgia can affect people of all ages, including children. However, most people are diagnosed during middle age and you are more likely to have fibromyalgia as you get older. Lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. If you have lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, you are more likely to develop fibromyalgia.

There are other characteristics that have been linked to fibromyalgia, but more research is needed to confirm these relationships. These possible risk factors include:

- Sex. Women are twice as likely to have fibromyalgia as men.
- Stressful or traumatic events, such as adverse childhood experiences, car accidents, or post-traumatic stress disorder.
- Repetitive injuries. Injury from repetitive stress on a joint, such as frequent knee bending.
- Illness.
- Family history.
- Obesity. More hospitalizations. If you have fibromyalgia you are twice as likely to be hospitalized as someone without fibromyalgia. Lower quality of life. Women with fibromyalgia may experience a lower quality of life. Higher rates of major depression. Adults with fibromyalgia are more than 3 times more likely to have major depression than adults without fibromyalgia.

The most common symptoms of fibromyalgia are
- Pain and stiffness all over the body
- Fatigue and tiredness
- Depression and anxiety
- Sleep problems
- Problems with thinking, memory, and concentration
- Headaches, including migraines Other symptoms may include:

- Tingling or numbness in hands and feet
- Pain in the face or jaw, including disorders of the jaw known as temporomandibular joint syndrome
- Digestive problems, such as abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, and even irritable bowel syndrome.

### Can myofascial trigger points involve nociplastic pain? A scoping review on animal models [^1161jTfd]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Involvement of CNS

Only one included study on nociplastic pain investigated the CNS involvement.Álvarez et al showed alterations in astrocyte activation in the spinal cord. The authors concluded that pain might cause subsequent synthesis and release of inflammatory mediators causing those changes. Therefore, increased neuronal activity can cause chronic pain by activating astrocytes. Widyadharma in his review suggested that alterations in astrocyte activation and reactive astrogliosis are sufficient in MTrPs creation. Models used by Álvarez et al were previously described as fibromyalgia pain models. In human studies, there was a confirmation that conditions like fibromyalgia are said to have greater comorbidity, eg higher number of MTrPs. In this case, it is in line with De las Peñas et al that myofascial trigger points are rather comorbidity in nociplastic states than the cause. It would be interesting to investigate this hypothesis, especially if myofascial trigger points itself can cause changes in CNS without previously induced conditions like fibromyalgia. This topic still remains unclear and needs further investigation.

Critical Appraisal of the Models

We conducted a critical appraisal based on SYRCLE's risk of bias tool for animal studies (detailed assessment available in). Answers to most signalling questions in our opinion was unclear. This increases the risk of bias. In the case of the works of Álvarez et al and Huang et al, this may be because the guidelines were created after the models had already been established. When creating new studies/models, it is important to follow the guidelines to improve the value and reliability of the study.

### Management of peripheral pain generators in fibromyalgia [^116rxCXJ]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a widespread chronic pain disorder that is characterized in part by central sensitization and increased pain response to peripheral nociceptive and non-nociceptive stimuli. Part of the comprehensive pain management of patients with fibromyalgia should include a thoughtful evaluation and search for peripheral pain generators that either are associated with fibromyalgia or are coincidentally present. The identification and treatment of these pain generators lessens the total pain burden, facilitates rehabilitation and decreases the stimuli for ongoing central sensitization.

### Central sensitisation in chronic pain conditions: latest discoveries and their potential for precision medicine [^114ecN9W]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Chronic pain is a leading cause of disability globally and associated with enormous health-care costs. The discrepancy between the extent of tissue damage and the magnitude of pain, disability, and associated symptoms represents a diagnostic challenge for rheumatology specialists. Central sensitisation, defined as an amplification of neural signalling within the CNS that elicits pain hypersensitivity, has been investigated as a reason for this discrepancy. Features of central sensitisation have been documented in various pain conditions common in rheumatology practice, including fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, upper extremity tendinopathies, headache, and spinal pain. Within individual pain conditions, there is substantial variation among patients in terms of presence and magnitude of central sensitisation, stressing the importance of individual assessment. Central sensitisation predicts poor treatment outcomes in multiple patient populations. The available evidence supports various pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies to reduce central sensitisation and to improve patient outcomes in several conditions commonly seen in rheumatology practice. These data open up new treatment perspectives, with the possibility for precision pain medicine treatment according to pain phenotyping as a logical next step. With this view, studies suggest the possibility of matching non-pharmacological approaches, or medications, or both to the central sensitisation pain phenotypes.

### Pathophysiologic mechanisms of fibromyalgia and its related disorders [^117LpcPB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

This article reviews current findings regarding the pathophysiologic abnormalities that contribute to the enhanced pain responses of individuals with fibromyalgia as well as the relationships between fibromyalgia and commonly co-occurring disorders. Risk factors for fibromyalgia or enhanced pain responses include genetic and family influences, environmental triggers, and abnormal neuroendocrine and autonomic nervous system function. These risk factors also are associated with several disorders that frequently co-occur with fibromyalgia, such as major depressive disorder, migraine, and irritable bowel syndrome. Indeed, fibromyalgia and these co-occurring conditions may be part of a group of affective spectrum disorders that share important common, and perhaps heritable, causal factors. Recent research strongly suggests that alterations in central processing of sensory input also contribute to the cardinal symptoms of fibromyalgia, persistent widespread pain and enhanced pain sensitivity. Exposure to psychosocial and environmental stressors, as well as altered autonomic nervous system and neuroendocrine responses, also may contribute to alterations in pain perception or pain inhibition. Understanding the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia and co-occurring disorders may help clinicians provide the most appropriate treatment to their patients.

### Presentation and diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^111io4UK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Because of substantial symptomatic overlap with several other conditions, fibromyalgia is difficult to detect and diagnose. The hallmark symptom of fibromyalgia is widespread pain, but patients often complain of only specific or localized pain symptoms, complicating the diagnosis. Assessing pain symptoms is the first step in the diagnostic process and must include performing a differential diagnosis and identifying comorbid illnesses. New diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia allow primary care physicians to bypass a time-consuming 18-point physical examination and, instead, use assessment tools.

Comprehensive search of the professional literature — systematic review currency and scope decisions are specified as follows: IOM (2011a) standards require the use of one or more systematic reviews for guideline development, and the panel aimed to use reviews that are at most 3 years old so that the reviews are not more than 5 years old at the time of approval and publication, given that a systematic review is considered outdated after 5 years. For the current guideline, the panel used a systematic review of noninvasive nonpharmacological treatments for chronic noncancer pain, then, after reviewing public comments and identified systematic reviews, it decided to exclude headaches and also excluded fibromyalgia as outside the scope of the guideline. Due to gaps in comparisons, approaches, and outcomes in the first review, two more reviews were identified and used, and the panel followed best practices of using reviews current within the past 5 years.

### Is fibromyalgia an autoimmune disorder? [^116xpWBt]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a multifactorial syndrome which includes not only widespread pain and stiffness, now recognized as major symptoms, but also numerous other somatic, emotional, and neuropsychic manifestation. The lack of specific validated biological and instrumental biomarkers has made FM a condition of unexplained medical significance, and its pathophysiology remains controversial and subject to debate. The current hypothesis regarding the pathogenesis of FM proposes that its development is influenced by various mechanism, including genetic predisposition, stressful life events, inflammatory processes, and cognitive-emotional factors. However, despite the extensive research conducted to date, the available data do not provide a clear understanding of the pathogenesis of FM. In this article, we report the opposing viewpoints of two leading experts who debate the question of whether FM is an autoimmune disease, based on scientific data regarding this condition. Both perspectives are discussed and the latest evidence on the pathophysiology of FM is reported to provide a comprehensive understanding of this complex syndrome.

### How fMRI analysis using structural equation modeling techniques can improve our understanding of pain processing in fibromyalgia [^114aokoR]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is one pain condition that has been studied in this manner, resulting in some progress in our understanding of this condition. Fibromyalgia is a complex chronic pain syndrome affecting 2–5% of the population. Typically, symptoms of FM manifest as widespread pain that fluctuates in intensity and location throughout the body, fatigue and/or sleep disturbances, and cognitive deficits which are often described as "fibro-fog". Although FM has been extensively investigated using multiple methods, including fMRI (see Cagnie et al and Dehghan et al for an overview of fMRI findings), the underlying mechanisms of this disorder are still relatively unknown. Without a proper understanding of the etiology, diagnosis and treatment remain difficult.

The designs of previous fMRI studies of FM have varied, but most aimed to elicit similar subjective levels of pain in both their healthy control (HC) and FM study groups. In order to achieve a similar level of pain in both study groups, the intensity of the stimuli needed to be higher in the HC groups, as hyperalgesia is a common symptom of FM. However, over half of these studies reported little to no significant differences in pain processing between the HC and FM groups within cortical regions, even though the average stimulus intensities used for each study group were significantly different. Three explanations for this paradox have been proposed. First, the abnormalities associated with FM may be found in the lower brainstem/spinal cord, and thus conventional brain fMRI studies were unable to detect the differences between the HC and FM groups. Spinal fMRI is not yet as widely-used as brain fMRI, so data to support this theory are limited, however evidence supporting this explanation does exist. Second, the cause of FM could lie within the periphery, therefore brain fMRI studies could not detect the differences between the study groups. Evidence both for and against this theory has been discussed in the literature. Lastly, it is possible that differences within cortical regions do exist, but the standard approaches to fMRI data analysis are unable to detect them.

### Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^111TCDsZ]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Since the publication of the American College of Rheumatology Classification Criteria for Fibromyalgia 18 years ago, there have been an ever-increasing number of research articles and reviews. From the National Library of Medicine alone there are more than 10,000 articles related to fibromyalgia. The major clinical manifestations of fibromyalgia have not changed, but their prevalence, associations, relative importance to the patient, and scientific underpinnings are increasingly better understood. This article provides an update on fibromyalgia symptomatology and looks at issues that need to be considered in the development of updated diagnostic guidelines. There is still no gold standard for making a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, but there is an increasing consensus for the development of new guidelines for diagnosis that modifies the currently proscribed tender point evaluation.

6.1 Versus Fibromyalgia

MPS and fibromyalgia are two common pain syndromes that often present with overlapping symptoms, making differential diagnosis challenging due to the absence of validated gold‐standard criteria. The clinical distinction between them currently relies on a thorough patient history and physical examination.

A key determinant in differentiating MPS from fibromyalgia is the nature of the tender regions and the pattern of pain presentation. MPS is typically characterized by regionally distributed pain associated with discrete MTrPs. These MTrPs are located within taut bands of muscle fibers and, when compressed, produce stereotypical referred pain patterns. They may elicit a local twitch response upon snapping palpation (i.e. rapid compression across muscle fibers) and are often responsive to local treatments.

In contrast, fibromyalgia patients present with widespread pain lasting longer than 3 months, without clear localization to specific muscles, and with symmetrically distributed tender regions within soft tissues. These tender regions are sites of exquisite tenderness but differ from MTrPs in several ways: they are not located within taut bands of muscle fibers, do not elicit a local twitch response upon snapping palpation, do not give rise to pain at distant sites upon local stimulation, and are generally unresponsive to local treatments targeting specific points. This suggests that maladaptive central processing may be an important underlying mechanism driving the clinical features of fibromyalgia.

The underlying pathophysiology further distinguishes the two conditions. MPS involves localized peripheral tissue changes, including elevated levels of inflammatory mediators in MTrPs. Conversely, tender regions in fibromyalgia do not typically exhibit these inflammatory changes, supporting the notion of central sensitization rather than peripheral tissue pathology.

Differentiating MPS from fibromyalgia is complicated by several factors. The nonspecific nature of localized tender regions and associated pain is common to various clinical conditions. Moreover, MPS, although primarily a regional pain syndrome, can become widespread and persist for more than 3 months, mirroring the chronicity of fibromyalgia. Consequently, patients may exhibit characteristics and symptoms that satisfy criteria for both syndromes. Clinically, we recommend considering the following classification: regional pain without central sensitization, regional pain with central sensitization, and widespread pain (which has central sensitization).

### Fibromyalgia and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11131P9S]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

We tried to identify studies that assessed an association between clinical fibromyalgia and mortality rates. Thus, patients in the current cohort had 'tender points' on physical examination (1990 criteria), or suffered from other somatic symptoms that comprise the 'symptom severity scale' (2010, 2011 or 2016 criteria), in addition to chronic widespread pain. So, although the diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia have evolved over the years, our meta-analysis approaches a real-life situation with a mixed population of patients that were diagnosed over the years by different fibromyalgia criteria.

Due to significant heterogeneity across the studies, which were also small in number, no clear conclusions can be drawn from the available data. However, it is possible that for the subgroup of patients diagnosed by the 1990 criteria there is no increased risk for mortality, and for those diagnosed by later versions the risk is increased. As only minimally adjusted effect measures were extracted from the included studies (age and sex, where possible), our study was not designed to address the question of whether fibromyalgia per se, or its degree of comorbidity, is the reason for this increase. As for specific-cause mortality, an impressive finding is the highly increased SMR for suicide mortality, with all the studies demonstrating an increased risk. A recent systematic review on over 390 000 fibromyalgia patients described a prominently increased suicidal ideation rate and suicide attempts among fibromyalgia patients. The physical and especially the psychiatric comorbidities, that are characteristic of fibromyalgia patients, are possible explanations for this finding. The finding of increased mortality associated with accidents can stem from fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, and the concentration difficulties that accompany fibromyalgia, and are a component of its diagnostic criteria since 2010. More and more evidence supports immune system involvement and inflammation in fibromyalgia pathophysiology, which can explain the finding of increased mortality from infections. Physical comorbidity may be an additional explanation. The results of our meta-analysis point to decreased cancer mortality, without heterogeneity between the studies. Previous meta-analyses, that examined cancer mortality among patients who suffer from chronic widespread pain, showed increased mortality in one study, and no difference in mortality in another. We believe that a logical explanation for the finding of decreased cancer mortality in fibromyalgia patients is extensive utilisation of health services, including imaging tests that can serve as secondary prevention or early detection for these patients. Mortality from heart disease was not increased in our study. The results of meta-analyses on the association of chronic pain with heart/cardiovascular mortality varied, with a borderline increase in mortality in one study, no difference in mortality in another, and a significant increase in mortality in the third, although the criteria of pain distribution were different in those studies. Contrary to our finding of no association between fibromyalgia and cerebrovascular mortality, one meta-analysisfound an increased mortality rate, but it included participants with chronic, not necessarily widespread, pain. Similar to findings from meta-anlyses on chronic pain, in our study fibromyalgia was not associated with increased respiratory mortality. No other meta-analysis assessed an association of widespread pain or fibromyalgia with liver disease and this association was not statistically significant in our meta-analysis. A potential explanation for the interesting finding of decreased in-hospital mortality for perioperative or opioid use disorder is the disproportionate extent of medical surveillance for fibromyalgia patients.

### Fibromyalgia: an update on clinical characteristics, aetiopathogenesis and treatment [^116FzV9V]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances and functional symptoms. The etiopathogenesis, diagnostic criteria and classification criteria of fibromyalgia are still debated and, consequently, so are the strategies for treating this condition. Fibromyalgia is the third most frequent musculoskeletal condition, and its prevalence increases with age. However, although diagnosis has improved with the evolution of more accurate diagnostic criteria, a considerable proportion of physicians still fail to recognize the syndrome. Many factors contribute to the development of fibromyalgia in a unique manner: genetic predisposition, personal experiences, emotional-cognitive factors, the mind-body relationship and a biopsychological ability to cope with stress. The multiple components of the pathogenesis and maintenance of the condition necessitate a multi-modal treatment approach. Individually tailored treatment is an important consideration, with the increasing recognition that different fibromyalgia subgroups exist with different clinical characteristics. Consequently, although an evidence-based approach to fibromyalgia management is always desirable, the approach of physicians is inevitably empirical, and must have the aim of creating a strong alliance with the patient and formulating shared, realistic treatment goals.

### Neurogenic neuroinflammation in fibromyalgia and complex regional pain syndrome [^115ePvWV]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2015). Medium credibility.

Although fibromyalgia and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) have distinct clinical phenotypes, they do share many other features. Pain, allodynia and dysaesthesia occur in each condition and seem to exist on a similar spectrum. Fibromyalgia and CRPS can both be triggered by specific traumatic events, although fibromyalgia is most commonly associated with psychological trauma and CRPS is most often associated with physical trauma, which is frequently deemed routine or minor by the patient. Fibromyalgia and CRPS also seem to share many pathophysiological mechanisms, among which the most important are those involving central effects. Nonetheless, peripheral effects, such as neurogenic neuroinflammation, are also important contributors to the clinical features of each of these disorders. This Review highlights the differing degrees to which neurogenic neuroinflammation might contribute to the multifactorial pathogenesis of both fibromyalgia and CRPS, and discusses the evidence suggesting that this mechanism is an important link between the two disorders, and could offer novel therapeutic targets.

### Onset of chronic pain triggered by a lifestyle-change-based weight loss and exercise regimen [^114iUZnM]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Exercise and weight loss are commonly recommended to patients with chronic pain; these interventions can relieve extra stress on the joints, reduce the perception of pain and combat comorbidities such as obesity, anxiety and depression. However, exercise can also exacerbate existing pain, presenting challenges for adherence to exercise and weight loss regimens. Here, we summarise the unique case of a patient who presented with chronic pain that developed during a natural weight loss regimen. The patient sought assessment due to diffuse pain that commenced after significant weight loss and was exacerbated with continued adherence to lifestyle modifications. He received a diagnosis of fibromyalgia and is currently being treated with nerve blocks and local anaesthetic injections of trigger points. This case of onset of fibromyalgia and chronic pain following lifestyle changes and weight loss underscores the need for further research aiming to understand the complex relationship between exercise, weight loss and chronic pain.

### Pathophysiology of fibromyalgia [^116iDeJA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

This article reviews the biologic, genetic, and environmental factors that may contribute to the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia. As an affective spectrum disorder, fibromyalgia may share these causal factors with a number of related and co-occurring pain conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome or temporomandibular disorder. There is strong evidence that cardinal pain symptoms of fibromyalgia may be due to alterations in central processing of sensory input, along with aberrations in the endogenous inhibition of pain. Genetic research has shown familial aggregation of fibromyalgia and other related disorders such as major depressive disorder. Exposure to physical or psychosocial stressors, as well as abnormal biologic responses in the autonomic nervous system and neuroendocrine responses, may also contribute to dysfunctional pain processing. As fibromyalgia research continues to progress, it is expected that the pathophysiology of this disorder will be further elucidated, leading to more rational and targeted strategies for the treatment of patients with this condition.

### Functional MRI in rheumatic diseases with a focus on fibromyalgia [^114d2MVW]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Pain is the most common symptom in rheumatic diseases. However, the severity of pain does not correlate with pathology. The lack of an objective test for pain results in clinicians consider pain in patients with fibromyalgia as psychological. Research over the last two decade using functional neuroimaging especially functional MRI scan have demonstrated objectively that patients with fibromyalgia were not malingering. Pain processing is complex and multiple regions of the brain are involved. One consistent finding is decrease activity in regions of the brain involved in pain inhibitory pathways suggesting this is one of the fundamental pathophysiology processes in fibromyalgia.

### CSF levels of apolipoprotein C1 and autotaxin found to associate with neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia [^111ktDas]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pain conditions such as fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain cause substantial suffering, disability, and great societal costs. In addition, they are difficult to treat, and sometimes difficult to diagnose.–Progress has been made in clinical classification and diagnostic criteria for neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia, but there is a need for better understanding of the pathophysiology and for more effective treatments.–Currently, there are no biological tests on which to base pain diagnoses, treatment choices or to understand the pathophysiology of the individual pain patient. Such markers that reflect the pathophysiology of individual pain patients would be important tools for pain clinicians, scientists, and pharmaceutical companies to aid in diagnosis, treatment selection, and to guide and monitor the development of new treatments. Although cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection is an invasive procedure, CSF is in direct contact with the brain and spinal cord and changes in CSF protein levels may reflect pathological processes in the central nervous system.

Neuropathic pain is often described as a particularly unpleasant form of painwith shooting, shock-like, aching, cramping, crushing, smarting, and burning features. Neuropathic pain is caused by lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous systemand affects 1–10% of the general population. – Previous investigations of CSF from neuropathic pain patients have typically analyzed one or a few interesting markers (mainly proteins) in small sample cohorts. Several studies have found differences in the levels of one or more proteins including inflammatory markers between neuropathic pain patients and controls – while other studies showed no significant differences.

Fibromyalgia affects around 2% of the population and is characterized by widespread pain and generalized hyperalgesia for mechanical pressure. Fibromyalgia patients often suffer from psychological distress, sleep and memory disturbances, and fatigue. There are many theories behind pathophysiology of FM, but the etiology is still uncertain. The current view is that the clinical presentation of fibromyalgia depends on central phenomena rather than peripheral dysfunction and substantial evidence exists for abnormalities in sensory signaling, including reduction of descending control and changes in key neurotransmitters associated with central sensitization. However, altered levels of cytokines, anti-inflammatory lipids, and prominent alterations both in muscle tissue and circulating proteins have been reported – as well as small nerve fiber impairment in FM. A wide range of proteins including inflammatory markers were found altered in the CSF of fibromyalgia patients. –

### Is fibromyalgia a discrete entity? [^112CQJCD]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is defined as chronic widespread pain (CWP) with allodynia or hyperalgesia to pressure pain, and is classified as one of the largest group of soft tissue pain syndromes. Its pathogenesis is not entirely understood, although it is currently believed to be the result of a central nervous system (CNS) malfunction that increases pain transmission and perception. There are no instrumental tests to confirm the diagnosis, but many of the differential diagnoses can be excluded by means of an extensive clinical examination and patient history. Although fibromyalgia is a recognisable clinical entity, it would seem appropriate to consider the entire range of tenderness and distress in clinic patients in order to tailor treatment on an individual basis.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a syndrome of unknown aetiology characterised by chronic pain, fatigue, and disturbed sleep. This review presents and summarises the 2020 literature on FM by retrieving all articles indexed in PubMed between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2020. The attention of the scientific community towards FM is constantly growing, and this year's review is focused on the diagnostic, pathogenetic and therapeutic aspects of this syndrome. In particular, the treatment options for FM, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, have been extensively studied.

### Fibromyalgia and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115qK319]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Study selection

The search for suitable studies was conducted in two phases according to the a priori inclusion and exclusion criteria. The following criteria were used to include papers in the systematic review: (1) original research that assessed associations between fibromyalgia and mortality (either all-cause or specific-cause); (2) the definition or the diagnosis of fibromyalgia was made as detailed above; and (3) the study provided effect measures (hazard ratio (HR), standardised mortality ratio (SMR), odds ratio (OR)) quantifying the relationship between fibromyalgia and mortality.

The following criteria were used to exclude papers from the review: (1) studies that were not original research, for example, reviews or case reports; (2) papers that related to widespread pain, either short- or long-term; and (3) not a fibromyalgia diagnosis.

In the first phase, all the abstracts were evaluated for inclusion and exclusion criteria. This phase was carried out by a single investigator (YTG). In the second phase, both investigators read the full texts of the selected abstracts chosen in the first phase and conducted a comprehensive, independent review of all the papers in their bibliographies to identify potentially relevant papers. In cases of disagreement the paper was discussed until a joint decision was reached.

Data extraction

The two investigators independently extracted data relevant to the study aim. All discrepancies were resolved by discussion. The data recorded included the authors and the year of publication, the age and origin of the participating patients, the sample size of the study population, the method of diagnosis of fibromyalgia, the type of fibromyalgia, the method of mortality confirmation, the type of assessed mortality (all-cause, specific causes), and quantitative assessment of mortality (HR, SMR, OR).

The effect measures (HR, SMR, OR) extracted from the eligible studies were adjusted for age and sex, but not for other potential confounding factors, such as the Charlson score or concomitant psychiatric conditions, since the main aim of the review was to assess whether there is an increased mortality risk in fibromyalgia patients, and not whether fibromyalgia per se, in fully adjusted effect measures, leads to increased mortality.

### Traumatic experiences, major life stressors, and self-reporting a physician-given fibromyalgia diagnosis [^113KrUBj]. Psychiatry Research (2010). Low credibility.

The contribution of stress to the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia has been the subject of considerable debate. The primary purpose of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between traumatic and major life stressors and a fibromyalgia diagnosis in a large group of older women and men. Data were from the federally funded Biopsychosocial Religion and Health Study, and subjects were 10,424 of the 10,988 survey respondents-two-thirds women and one-third men-providing responses to a fibromyalgia question. Average age was 61.0 ± 13.5 years. A physician-given fibromyalgia diagnosis in a subject's lifetime was reported by 3.7% of the sample, 4.8% of the women and 1.3% of the men. In two multivariable logistic regression models (all respondents and women only, controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education), two traumatic experience types (sexual and physical assault/abuse) were associated with a fibromyalgia diagnosis. Two other trauma types (life-threatening and emotional abuse/neglect) and major life stress experiences were not. The highest odds ratios in both models were those for sexual assault/abuse followed by physical assault/abuse. The relationship between age and fibromyalgia was curvilinear in both models (odds ratios rising until approximately age 63 and declining thereafter). In the all-subjects model, being a woman increased the odds of a fibromyalgia diagnosis, and in both models, fibromyalgia was associated with being White (versus non-White) and lower education. We recommend that researchers investigate the relationship between stress and fibromyalgia in concert with genetic and biomarker studies.

### Heritability of the fibromyalgia phenotype varies by age [^113SUBGW]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Many studies suggest a strong familial component to fibromyalgia (FM). However, those studies have nearly all been confined to individuals with primary FM, i.e. FM without any other accompanying disorder. The current 2011 and 2016 criteria for diagnosing FM construct a score using a combination of the number of painful body sites and the severity of somatic symptoms (FM score). This study was undertaken to estimate the genetic heritability of the FM score across sex and age groups to identify subgroups of individuals with greater heritability, which may help in the design of future genetic studies.

Methods

We collected data on 26,749 individuals of European ancestry undergoing elective surgery at the University of Michigan (Michigan Genomics Initiative study). We estimated the single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability of FM score by age and sex categories using genome-wide association study data and a linear mixed-effects model.

Results

Overall, the FM score had an estimated heritability of 13.9% (SE 2.9%) (P = 1.6 × 10–7). Estimated FM score heritability was highest in individuals ≤ 50 years of age (23.5%; SE 7.9%) (P = 3.0 ×10–4) and lowest in individuals > 60 years of age (7.5%; SE 8.1%) (P = 0.41). These patterns remained the same when we analyzed FM as a case-control phenotype. Even though women had an ~30% higher average FM score than men across age categories, FM score heritability did not differ significantly by sex.

Conclusion

Younger individuals appear to have a much stronger genetic component to the FM score than older individuals. Older individuals may be more likely to have what was previously called "secondary FM". Regardless of the cause, these results have implications for future genetic studies of FM and associated conditions.

### Characterizing classes of fibromyalgia within the continuum of central sensitization syndrome [^115kfNR8]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

FM may be represented as a disease continuum, with identifiable classes and subclasses based on pain and symptom severity, specific comorbidities, and use of clinical procedures. Patients demonstrated increases in symptom severity and region of pain by class, suggesting that the FM continuum tracks with disease progression over time. Additional studies are warranted to evaluate and better define the classes by severity with the goal of informing potential approaches to patient evaluation and management. Such an understanding and characterization of how FM patients progress through their disease may enhance diagnosis and help optimize treatment, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes and reductions in the health care system burden.

### Fibromyalgia position paper [^113eYp2c]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia syndrome is one of the most common causes of chronic widespread pain, but pain accompanies a wide range of ancillary symptoms. To date, its aetiopathogenesis remains elusive, and diagnosis is exquisitely clinical, due to the lack of biomarkers or specific laboratory alterations in fibromyalgia patients. This position paper has the purpose to summarise the current scientific knowledge and expert opinions about the main controversies regarding fibromyalgia syndrome, namely: (i) fibromyalgia definition and why it is still not recognised in many countries as a distinct clinical entity; (ii) fibromyalgia severity and how to evaluate treatment outcome; (iii) how to treat fibromyalgia and which is a correct approach to fibromyalgia patients.

Finally, we acknowledge that there is ongoing debate about the aetiology and diagnosis of CFS and FM, in particular the relevance or not of 'organic' and 'non-organic' factors. There is considerable debate, particularly with regard to CFS, about how to define and diagnose the condition, and indeed whether there may be a number of different conditions present within groups of patients diagnosed with CFS. We accept that these debates are important and as yet unresolved and that heterogeneity in the CFS and FM populations reviewed here might have reduced the power of studies to identify consistent deficits.

### Fibromyalgia: mechanisms and potential impact of the ACR 2010 classification criteria [^112CczJq]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2012). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by chronic widespread pain in the presence of widespread tenderness, and multiple somatic symptoms. Since the publication of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 classification criteria for fibromyalgia, research has proliferated and, in a relatively short period, investigators have begun to unravel the etiology and long-term impact of this complex condition. Although the ACR 1990 criteria have been central to fibromyalgia research during the past two decades, a number of practical and philosophical objections have been raised in relation to them. Principally these objections have centered on the use (or lack thereof) of the tender point examination, the lack of consideration of associated symptoms, and the observation that fibromyalgia might represent the extreme end of a pain continuum. In developing the ACR 2010 criteria, experts have sought to address these issues and to simplify clinical diagnosis. An implicit aim was to facilitate more rigorous study of etiology. The purpose of this Review is to summarize research to date that has described the epidemiology, pathology and clinical course of fibromyalgia, and to assess the probable impact of the ACR 2010 criteria on future research efforts.

### Awareness and knowledge of fibromyalgia among French rheumatologists and general practitioners [^115YBrsp]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and fatigue. Its prevalence is estimated to be at 3.4% in women and 0.5% in men. It is a major cause of morbidity. Our objective was to evaluate, using a self-questionnaire sent by mail, the level of knowledge of French physicians, general practitioners, and rheumatologists on fibromyalgia and to analyse their therapeutic approach.

Methods

The demographic characteristics of a sample of general practitioners and rheumatologists were compared to those of the overall data available. This comparison demonstrated the good representativeness of our sample.

Results

Fibromyalgia was considered as a disease by 23% of rheumatologists and 33% of general practitioners. While on average, each rheumatologist followed 30 fibromyalgia patients, each general practitioner followed 6.1 patients (i.e., 2 to 5% of their practice's patient base). Among rheumatologists, 6.4% made no distinction between this disease and depression vs. 13.1% of general practitioners. The diagnosis of fibromyalgia was made based on tenderness that occurs in precise, localized areas of the body (trigger points) by 94% of rheumatologists and 79.1% of general practitioners. Of general practitioners and rheumatologists, 93.7% and 73.7% respectively, have not received any medical school training on fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome.

Conclusion

Given the lack of medical school training and continuing professional education concerning fibromyalgia (rare use of pain rating scales, confusion in the classification of rheumatic diseases), there is an urgent need to initiate an explicit teaching effort on chronic pain, and on fibromyalgia in particular.

### Research recommendations following the discovery of pain sensitizing IgG autoantibodies in fibromyalgia syndrome [^115kcu1n]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Aab Research

There was a high level of stakeholder agreement that the recent Aab findings should be repeated by independent researchers and research laboratories. It was acknowledged that the current findings already incorporate some degree of replication from two independent laboratories and two distinct patient cohorts.

Stakeholders considered characterisation of Aab targets as a key relevant objective for Aab research going forward, with a high consensus level. There was also a good level of agreement that for each identified Aab target the antibody pathogenicity should be investigated; it was noted that specific Aab associated with a disease can sometimes be without a clear pathogenetic role.

Stakeholders considered it important to research if and how Aab can cause central phenomena that characterize FMS, and to further investigate Aab binding in the central nervous system (CNS). Stakeholders acknowledge that no evidence for CNS binding has been identified but advised that this may not exclude binding at lower intensities or to distinct, small regions.

Immunology

There was strong agreement that immune parameters should be assessed during FMS flares versus non-flare periods; the dominant antibody subclasses and their titres should be studied. It was thought possible that key parameters such as antibody levels or plasmablast populations may differ during flare times. This is also a method to facilitate generation of antibodies in vitro, from patient B cells. Stakeholders also agreed that the mechanisms underpinning the production of non-inflammatory Aab should be investigated.

In clinical trials, Aab serum levels — alongside the above immunological parameters — should be ascertained both at baseline and post-intervention; this includes both pharmaceutical, and non-pharmaceutical intervention (e.g. behavioural) trials.

### Evidence for abnormal pain processing in fibromyalgia syndrome [^114DfZ2k]. Pain Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia syndrome.

Design

Review of the literature available on Medline (1965–2001).

Results

Fibromyalgia syndrome is a chronic pain syndrome that predominantly afflicts women. It is characterized by widespread pain, insomnia, fatigue, and the presence of multiple tender points. Despite intensifying research, the etiology of fibromyalgia has remained unclear. Importantly, neither infections, trauma, nor psychiatric abnormalities consistently precede the onset of pain in patients with this syndrome. There is, however, mounting evidence for central pain processing abnormalities in almost all fibromyalgia patients. These anomalies include hyperalgesia, allodynia, abnormal temporal summation of second pain, neuroendocrine abnormalities, and abnormal activation of pain-related brain regions.

Conclusions

Multiple abnormal findings in fibromyalgia patients strongly indicate a neuropathic pain syndrome, reminiscent of complex regional pain syndrome or postherpetic neuralgia. In addition, fibromyalgia syndrome seems to share similar characteristics with these neuropathic pain syndromes, including ineffective response to many analgesics.

### Fibromyalgia syndrome and serotonin [^112iBJav]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Although disturbances in the musculoskeletal system, in the neuroendocrine system and in the central nervous system (CNS) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), the primary mechanisms underlying the etiopathogenesis of FMS remain elusive. It has been postulated that disturbances in serotonin metabolism and transmission, along with disturbances in several other chemical pain mediators, are present in patients with FMS. In this article we review published studies on the pathophysiological role of serotonin in FMS. Although studies that indirectly measured the function of serotonin in the CNS in FMS revealed some abnormalities in the metabolism and transmission of serotonin, the role of serotonin in the pathophysiology of syndrome remains inconclusive and warrants more studies.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a complex syndrome characterised by chronic pain, fatigue and functional symptoms. Widespread pain is often its most typical feature, whereas other manifestations may be associated to various extents. Its aetiopathogenesis is still a matter of debate, but various pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies are currently available for its treatment. We review the literature concerning the most recent findings relating to the aetiopathogenesis, assessment and treatment of FM published between January 2016 and January 2017.

### Fibromyalgia: a critical digest of the recent literature [^113DzVFA]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a common syndrome characterised by widespread pain and a constellation of other symptoms and overlapping conditions that contribute to complicate the diagnosis, the assessment and the treatment. Furthermore, the etiological causes for the moment only consist of assumptions, and the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms still remain to be clarified. For the above-mentioned reasons, with the present review we sought to provide an overview of the literature on fibromyalgia from both the pre-clinical and clinical studies indexed in PubMed during the last year, classifying original articles and reviews into etiopathogenesis, assessment and therapy.

### Terminology, criteria, and definitions in complex regional pain syndrome: challenges and solutions [^112Rs42S]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Both disorders also exhibit evidence of central sensitization and both disorders show significant changes in central pain-related regions of the brain. The parallels between fibromyalgia and CRPS lead one to indicate that the two disorders exist on the same spectrum. Improved understanding of the pathophysiology of CRPS will allow for better classification of CRPS.

Comment

The literature on fibromyalgia, regional pain syndrome, and CRPS tend to ignore contributions and observations from each of the other entities. Divide and conquer in this setting does not work. Understanding and incorporation of knowledge from each of these clinically-defined disorders is likely to enhance classification of the whole group and hence improve understanding of these important and high impact chronic pain disorders.

### Fibromyalgia: one year in review 2023 [^111hB9qW]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic syndrome characterised by widespread pain that affects millions of people worldwide. This article discusses various aspects of FM described in scientific papers published in 2022 and indexed in the PubMed database, including the most recent diagnostic acquisitions (especially in relation to the juvenile form of FM), risk factors, co-morbidities and objective measures. Emphasis is placed on the importance of identifying FM early and improving diagnostic methods (e.g. physical measurements, including walking test performance, hand grip force, and autonomic tests). The article also considers hypotheses concerning the pathophysiology of FM, including the role of inflammation, gut dysbiosis, and neuroinflammation, and possible treatment options, including medications such as antioxidants and kinin antagonists, neurostimulation, and mind-body interventions. Although ketamine, vitamin D, and hormone therapy have shown promise in reducing FM symptoms, further research is needed to optimise their use. Neurostimulation techniques, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, transcranial direct-current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation, have been investigated in terms of their efficacy in reducing pain and improving the quality of life. Finally, the role of nutrition is discussed as study findings suggest that weight control, modified high-antioxidant diets, and nutritional supplementation can help to alleviate the symptoms of FM.

### Fibromyalgia pain: do we know the source? [^114oSMjr]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) is a chronic pain condition of unknown origin. Multiple abnormalities have been described, including peripheral tissue and central nervous system changes. The relation of these mechanisms, however, is likely bidirectional. FMS pain clearly depends on peripheral nociceptive input as well as abnormal central pain processing. This review will focus on the role of peripheral nociceptive input for pain in FMS.

Recent Findings

There is strong evidence for abnormal central pain processing in FMS. Sensitized spinal cord neurons in the dorsal horn are responsible for augmented pain processing of nociceptive signals from the periphery. In addition, glial activation, possibly by cytokines and excitatory amino acids may play a role in the initiation and perpetuation of this sensitized state.

Summary

Nociceptive input clearly plays an important role in FMS. Acute or repetitive tissue injury has been associated with FMS pain. Cytokines related to such injuries may be responsible for long-term activation of spinal cord glia and dorsal horn neurons, thus resulting in central sensitization. A better understanding of these important neuro-immune interactions may provide relevant insights into future effective therapies.

### The safety and efficacy of low-dose naltrexone in patients with fibromyalgia: a systematic review [^1139f7qW]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic, centralized, pain sensitivity syndrome, mainly characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, nonrestorative sleep, mood issues, deconditioning, and cognitive impairments. The prevalence of FM is approximately 2–8% worldwide with a higher prevalence for women. Age, sex, family history, and certain conditions/factors (rheumatoid arthritis, systematic lupus erythematous, repetitive injuries, stressful or traumatic events, and preceding infections) are associated risk factors for the development of FM. Individuals with FM report a wide range of somatic and psychological symptoms, which contribute to significant symptom burden and functional impairment. The annual associated direct costs, per patient, range from $ 1750 to $ 35,920 in the USA.

The underlying mechanisms for FM continue to be investigated, with a greater focus on the pathophysiological process known as central sensitization. 5 Central sensitization involves the amplification of both central and peripheral pain and sensory processing in the ascending and descending sensory pathways, due to a variety of antecedent triggers (including pain, infection, inflammation, or prolonged stressors). Recent research has focused on the underlying trigger of neuroinflammation as a potential contributor to the development of central sensitization in the setting of FM. Increased blood–brain barrier permeability is an important feature of neuroinflammation, which results in increased leukocyte relocation into the central nervous system. Recent immunological evidence indicates that inflammation-driven pathways play an important role in the pathogenesis of FM. Immune cells such as macrophages, glial cells, monocytes, mast cells, and neutrophils as mediators of inflammation, may have a role in the development of an inflammatory substrate in FM.

### Is fibromyalgia associated with a unique cytokine profile? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112emksf]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pain is an experienced symptom, representing a protective mechanism against a real or potential bodily harm. Pathological pain is defined as an amplified response to normally innocuous stimuli or to acute pain, which is maladaptive and has no biological significance. Pain becomes chronic when it persists for 3 months or longer. Idiopathic chronic pain syndromes (CPS) can be diffuse (e.g. fibromyalgia) or localized (e.g. tension headache, bladder pain syndrome). The prevalence of chronic pain overall ranged between one-third to one-half of the UK population, whilst a pooled analysis found that diffuse CPS affect 11.2–16.5% of the population. Localized CPS are also common — e.g. tension headache, has an estimated prevalence of 38.3%, with 43.3% of people affected reporting significant disability. Despite the significant disease burden of CPS, the pathophysiology is poorly understood.

Idiopathic CPS have no universally accepted anatomical, structural or chemical aetiologies. Due to this, they have been shrouded in controversy, with many believing them to have a significant psychosomatic component. Both, peripheral and central sensitization, are involved in the pathogenesis of chronic pain. Peripheral sensitization is defined by augmented sensitivity to various stimuli after a peripheral nerve insult or lesion due to neurogenic inflammation affecting the low velocity unmyelinated C-fibres and low threshold myelinated Aδ-fibres that transmit pain signals. Increased input from peripheral nociceptors can trigger a prolonged but reversible increase in the excitability and synaptic efficacy of nociceptive pathway neurons.

In contrast with peripheral sensitization, central sensitization arises from the second-order neurons within the dorsal horn in the spinal cord and brain and is characterized by increased synaptic efficacy and reduction in inhibition, leading to a central amplification of the pain response.

### Abnormal pain modulation in patients with spatially distributed chronic pain: fibromyalgia [^113y2G97]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Many chronic pain syndromes are associated with hypersensitivity to painful stimuli and with reduced endogenous pain inhibition. These findings suggest that modulation of pain-related information may be linked to the onset or maintenance of chronic pain. The combination of heightened pain sensitivity and reduced pain inhibition seems to predispose individuals to greater risk for increased acute clinical pain. It is unknown whether such pain processing abnormalities may also place individuals at increased risk for chronic pain. Psychophysical methods can be used for the evaluation of pain sensitivity and pain inhibition. Long-term prospective studies that could yield insight into the role of heightened pain sensitivity and pain disinhibition for the development of chronic pain disorders like fibromyalgia in the general population are lacking, however.

### Mechanisms underlying development of spatially distributed chronic pain (fibromyalgia) [^116CV7N4]. Pain (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic fibromyalgia (FM) pain is prevalent (estimated as high as 13%), predominantly affects women, and is associated with a variety of focal pain conditions. Ongoing FM pain is referred to deep tissues and is described as widespread but usually is maximally located within a restricted region such as the shoulders. Palpation of deep tissues reveals an enhanced nociceptive sensitivity that is not restricted to regions of clinical pain. Similarly, psychophysical testing reveals allodynia and hyperalgesia for cutaneous stimulation at locations beyond regions of clinical pain referral. The combination of widely distributed clinical pain and generalized hypersensitivity is highly disabling, but no satisfactory treatment is regularly prescribed. A thorough understanding of mechanisms will likely be required to develop and document adequate therapies. The generalized hypersensitivity associated with FM has focused considerable interest on central (CNS) mechanisms for the disorder. These include central sensitization, central disinhibition and a dysfunctional hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. However, the central effects associated with FM can be produced by a peripheral source of pain. Chronic nociceptive input induces central sensitization, magnifying pain, and it activates the HPA and the sympathetic nervous system. Chronic sympathetic activation indirectly sensitizes peripheral nociceptors and sets up a vicious cycle. Thus, it appears that central mechanisms of FM pain are dependent on abnormal peripheral input(s) for development and maintenance of this condition. A substantial literature defines peripheral-CNS-peripheral interactions that are integral to FM pain. These reciprocal actions and related phenomena of relevance to FM pain are reviewed here, leading to suggestions for testing of therapeutic approaches.

### Fibromyalgia: an overview [^116rVGif]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is the diagnosis given to individuals with chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain for which no alternative cause, such as tissue inflammation or damage, can be identified. Fibromyalgia is now believed to be, at least in part, a disorder of central pain processing that produces heightened responses to painful stimuli (hyperalgesia) and painful responses to nonpainful stimuli (allodynia). Aberrations in central pain processing may also be partly responsible for symptoms experienced in several chronic pain disorders that coaggregate with fibromyalgia, which is itself a product of genetic and environmental factors. Thus, aberrational central pain processing is implicated in irritable bowel syndrome, temporomandibular disorder, chronic low back pain, and certain other chronic pain disorders. Fibromyalgia and related disorders appear to reflect deficiencies in serotonergic and noradrenergic, but not opioidergic, transmission in the central nervous system. The heightened state of pain transmission may also be owing to increases in pronociceptive neurotransmitters such as glutamate and substance P. In some cases, psychological and behavioral factors are also in play. Although the overlapping symptomatology between fibromyalgia and related disorders may present diagnostic challenges, proper examination and observation can help clinicians make an accurate diagnosis. In recent years, the vastly improved understanding of the mechanism underlying fibromyalgia and the related spectrum of diseases has fostered rapid advances in the therapy of these chronic pain disorders by both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions.

### Characterizing classes of fibromyalgia within the continuum of central sensitization syndrome [^114NpKJ8]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Fibromyalgia (FM) is considered a chronic, musculoskeletal pain condition of clinical complexity that likely arises from a dysfunction of central pain processing pathways. It is typically accompanied by sleep disturbance, anxiety/depression, and cognitive effects in addition to the cardinal symptoms of widespread musculoskeletal pain, joint stiffness, and fatigue. The well-recognized burdens associated with FM include impairment of daily function and reductions in quality of life from the patient perspective, as well as a range of comorbid conditions, high health care resource utilization, and associated costs from the clinical and economic perspectives, with these burdens increasing as FM severity increases.

Diagnosing FM remains challenging, since neither imaging techniques nor laboratory tests are currently available that can clinically identify or confirm an FM diagnosis. Criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) have traditionally been used for clinical diagnosis and severity classification of FM. The 2010 ACR criteria, which relied on scales that evaluated the extent of widespread pain (Widespread Pain Index) and the severity of specific somatic symptoms (symptom severity scale) have recently been updated to include a generalized pain criterion.

Currently, there is no specific single International Classification of Diagnoses Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) billing code for FM, and the generally accepted diagnosis code that has been used in the medical literature is 729.1, even though this code is designated as "Myositis and Myalgia, unspecified" and can include other conditions. Thus, when used in clinical or database studies, a diagnosis based strictly on this code may inaccurately reflect the actual number of patients with FM. A previous analysis compared FM characteristics among patients identified in a community-based chronic pain cohort based on this ICD-9 coding with characteristics of patients identified using novel predictive modeling, with the models based on diagnoses and characteristics relevant to FM that were considered potential predictors. While characteristics of the populations were generally similar between the two methods of identifying patients, predictive modeling identified a larger FM population. However, FM has long been proposed as a disease that presents as a continuum rather than a homogeneous entity. Within this continuum, it has been considered that both chronicity and symptom subgroups contribute to the observed heterogeneity,–and that the presence of psychological and systemic components, in particular, potentially exacerbates the pain experience. While several of these studies were cluster analyses that identified clinical subgroups based on symptom presentation, a broader approach to characterizing the FM continuum has been lacking.

### Dynamic functional brain connectivity underlying temporal summation of pain in fibromyalgia [^116q4Y8T]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Abnormal central pain processing is a leading cause of pain in fibromyalgia (FM) and is perceptually characterized with the psychophysical measure of temporal summation of pain (TSP). TSP is the perception of increasingly greater pain in response to repetitive or tonic noxious stimuli. Previous neuroimaging studies have used static (i.e., summary) measures to examine the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) correlates of TSP in FM. However, functional brain activity rapidly and dynamically reorganizes over time, and, similarly, TSP is a temporally evolving process. This study was undertaken to demonstrate how a complete understanding of the neural circuitry supporting TSP in FM thus requires a dynamic measure that evolves over time.

Methods

We utilized novel methods for analyzing dynamic functional brain connectivity in patients with FM in order to examine how TSP-associated fluctuations are linked to the dynamic functional reconfiguration of the brain. In 84 FM patients and age- and sex-matched healthy controls, we collected high-temporal-resolution fMRI data during a resting state and during a state in which sustained cuff pressure pain was applied to the leg.

Results

FM patients experienced greater TSP than healthy controls (mean ± SD TSP score 17.93 ± 19.24 in FM patients versus 9.47 ± 14.06 in healthy controls; P = 0.028), but TSP scores varied substantially between patients. In the brain, the presence versus absence of TSP in patients with FM was marked by more sustained enmeshment between sensorimotor and salience networks during the pain period. Furthermore, dynamic enmeshment was noted solely in FM patients with high TSP, as interactions with all other brain networks were dampened during the pain period.

Conclusion

This study elucidates the dynamic brain processes underlying facilitated central pain processing in FM. Our findings will enable future investigation of dynamic symptoms in FM.

### Bidirectional two-sample mendelian randomization analysis reveals causal associations between modifiable risk factors and fibromyalgia [^1123zrQS]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

FM is a chronic diffuse pain syndrome characterized by multisite pain, severe fatigue, stiffness, sleep disturbances, cognitive deficits, and psychological problems. The prevalence of fibromyalgia worldwide ranges between 2% and 4% across all populations. Unlike nociceptive pain, which results from tissue damage, and neuropathic pain, which arises from nerve damage, nociplastic pain frequently lacks definitive evidence of tissue injury or identifiable pathology within the somatosensory system, and it is often caused by reversible changes in the nervous system. These changes increase the sensitivity of the system that controls which stimuli should be interpreted as pain and which should not. This type of pain is consistent with fibromyalgia as part of the classification group of central sensitization syndrome disorders. As a result, FM is classified as a type of nociplastic pain. The pathophysiology of FM is still poorly understood, but it is thought that augmented central nervous system (CNS) pain and sensory processing and altered pain modulation play prominent roles.

### Fibromyalgia: a new facet of the post-COVID-19 syndrome spectrum? Results from a web-based survey [^1158YZWi]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since its first appearance in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 — the pathogen responsible for COVID-19) — exhibited all its devasting potential, causing more than three million deaths worldwide. Apart from the clinical manifestations of the acute disease, the long-term consequences of COVID-19 are emerging as a new, overwhelming challenge for clinicians and healthcare systems. A postacute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS)is now clearly recognised and, in the near future, is expected to impose a serious burden on different medical specialties, given the pleiotropic nature of its clinical manifestations. Of note, musculoskeletal pain — the cardinal symptoms of fibromyalgia (FM), reported in one-third of patients with acute COVID-19 — is part of the complex spectrum of PACS, along with pulmonary, cardiovascular, haematological, renal, gastroenteric, dermatological, endocrine and neuropsychiatric sequelae.

The diagnosis of FM historically relied on the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, including widespread pain of at least 3 months' duration and tenderness on pressure at 11 or more of 18 specific tender points. In 2010, the ACR proposed a new set of clinical criteria for the diagnosis of FM based on a Widespread Pain Index (WPI) and a Symptom Severity (SS) scale; however, the tender point examination was withdrawn. The 2010 criteria underwent a revision in 2016that combined physician and questionnaire criteria and eliminated the previous recommendation regarding diagnostic exclusions. Furthermore, the ACR 2010 criteria have also been adapted for administration as a self-report questionnaire ('survey' criteria) to be used in epidemiological studies with good reliability and convergent and discriminant validity.

The pathogenesis of FM is still far to be fully understood. Pain augmentation/dysperception seems associated with exquisite neuromorphological modifications and imbalance between pronociceptive and antinociceptive pathways arising from an intricate interplay between genetic predisposition, stressful life events, psychological characteristics and emerging peripheral mechanisms, such as small fibre neuropathy or neuroinflammation. Strikingly, a role for infectious triggers — viral infections, in particular — has been also postulated.

### The polymorphism val158Met in the COMT gene: disrupted dopamine system in fibromyalgia patients? [^114nuVA9]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a syndrome characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by additional symptoms, such as fatigue, sleep disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, depression, and the inability to carry out normal daily activities. Affecting 1% to 5% of the population, the disease is more common in women than in men, with variable age of onset, possibly with some degree of heritability, and often other comorbid conditions. Because hyperalgesia and allodynia are usually found as prominent symptoms, a neurogenic origin with central manifestations and pain-processing dysfunctions was hypothesized. Peripheral abnormalities may contribute to increased nociceptive activity. Neuroendocrine and environmental factors and genetic predisposition are likewise suggested contributing to the symptomatology. Despite the advances in the understanding of the underlying pathological processes, assessment and diagnosis of FM with quantitative biomarkers still represent a gap in the clinical practice, with as many as 75% of people suffering from this syndrome remaining undiagnosed.

### A review of the incidence and risk factors for fibromyalgia and chronic widespread pain in population-based studies [^111FeUfn]. Pain (2020). Medium credibility.

This review identified prospective cohort studies in the general population, which showed incidence (23 papers) and risk factors (37 papers) for fibromyalgia and chronic widespread pain. Median incidence of physician diagnosed fibromyalgia in the general population was 4.3 per 1000 person-years (range = 0.33–18.8) but 14.0 (1.2–32.7) if medical illness was present. Median incidence of chronic widespread pain was 12.5 per 1000 person-years (7.2–81.6) but 67 per 1000 person years (14.8–124) for those with pre-existing pain. Risk factors included various childhood difficulties, female sex (except with pre-existing medical disorders), older/middle age, smoking, high body mass index, alcohol abstinence, and pre-existing medical disorders in adulthood. The strongest associations were with sleep disorders, headaches and other pains, depression, and illness behaviour. These data suggest strongly that there are many aetiological routes into fibromyalgia, and future research could be enhanced by studying the underlying mechanisms relating to these risk factors.

### Recognizing and diagnosing fibromyalgia [^1139Qtkb]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia affects an estimated 2% of the American population. Current understanding explains it as a neurologic disorder of central pain processing that causes the perception of pain in response to stimuli that in healthy individuals would not be painful. The recognition of fibromyalgia can lead to effective treatment with significant improvement in functioning. Unfortunately, because of the chronic nature of the pain condition and associated counterproductive behaviors and disability, patients and physicians may rapidly become frustrated with each other and abandon the pursuit of adequate diagnosis and treatment. If the physician instead recognizes the diagnostic pattern of pain and appreciates the real nature of the underlying pathology, then he or she can be of great benefit to patients and their families in managing this chronic disease.

### Ambroxol for the treatment of fibromyalgia: science or fiction? [^112sLMSd]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia appears to present in subgroups with regard to biological pain induction, with primarily inflammatory, neuropathic/neurodegenerative, sympathetic, oxidative, nitrosative, or muscular factors and/or central sensitization. Recent research has also discussed glial activation or interrupted dopaminergic neurotransmission, as well as increased skin mast cells and mitochondrial dysfunction. Therapy is difficult, and the treatment options used so far mostly just have the potential to address only one of these aspects. As ambroxol addresses all of them in a single substance and furthermore also reduces visceral hypersensitivity, in fibromyalgia existing as irritable bowel syndrome or chronic bladder pain, it should be systematically investigated for this purpose. Encouraged by first clinical observations of two working groups using topical or oral ambroxol for fibromyalgia treatments, the present paper outlines the scientific argument for this approach by looking at each of the aforementioned aspects of this complex disease and summarizes putative modes of action of ambroxol. Nevertheless, at this point the evidence basis for ambroxol is not strong enough for clinical recommendation.

### Fibromyalgia and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115vbdMM]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review of the literature on the association between fibromyalgia and mortality and to pool the results in a meta-analysis.

Methods

The authors searched the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases using the key words 'fibromyalgia' and 'mortality' to identify studies that addressed an association between fibromyalgia and mortality. Original papers that assessed associations between fibromyalgia and mortality (all or specific causes) and provided an effect measure (hazard ratio (HR), standardised mortality ratio (SMR), odds ratio (OR)) quantifying the relationship between fibromyalgia and mortality were included in the systematic review. Of 557 papers that were initially identified using the search words, 8 papers were considered eligible for the systematic review and meta-analysis. We used a Newcastle-Ottawa scale to assess the risk of bias in the studies.

Results

The total fibromyalgia group included 188 751 patients. An increased HR was found for all-cause mortality (HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.51), but not for the subgroup diagnosed by the 1990 criteria. There was a borderline increased SMR for accidents (SMR 1.95, 95% CI 0.97 to 3.92), an increased risk for mortality from infections (SMR 1.66, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.38), and suicide (SMR 3.37, 95% CI 1.52 to 7.50), and a decreased mortality rate for cancer (SMR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.97). The studies showed significant heterogeneity.

Conclusions

These potential associations indicate that fibromyalgia should be taken seriously, with a special focus on screening for suicidal ideation, accident prevention, and the prevention and treatment of infections.

### The rational management of fibromyalgia patients [^114bWZxr]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The exponential increase in pain research over the last 10 years has established fibromyalgia (FM) as a common chronic pain syndrome with similar neurophysiologic aberrations to other chronic pain states. As such, the pathogenesis is considered to involve an interaction of augmented sensory processing (central sensitization) and peripheral pain generators. The notion, that FM symptomatology results from an amplification of incoming sensory impulses, has revolutionized the contemporary understanding of this enigmatic problem and provided a more rational approach to treatment. To date, the management of FM has been mainly palliative, with the aims of reducing pain, improving sleep, maintaining function, treating psychologic distress and diminishing the impact of associated syndromes. The rapidly evolving neurophysiologic, psychophysiologic and molecular biologic basis for chronic pain states has already opened up new avenues for management which should be applicable to this difficult group of patients. Indeed, it is now possible to think about a "rational" approach to managing FM patients that was unthinkable just a few years ago.

### Fibromyalgia [^117C9Xeh]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a common illness characterized by chronic widespread pain, sleep problems (including unrefreshing sleep), physical exhaustion and cognitive difficulties. The definition, pathogenesis and treatment are controversial, and some even contest the existence of this disorder. In 1990, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) defined classification criteria that required multiple tender points (areas of tenderness occurring in muscles and muscle-tendon junctions) and chronic widespread pain. In 2010, the ACR preliminary diagnostic criteria excluded tender points, allowed less extensive pain and placed reliance on patient-reported somatic symptoms and cognitive difficulties. Fibromyalgia occurs in all populations worldwide, and symptom prevalence ranges between 2% and 4% in the general population. The prevalence of people who are actually diagnosed with fibromyalgia ('administrative prevalence') is much lower. A model of fibromyalgia pathogenesis has been suggested in which biological and psychosocial variables interact to influence the predisposition, triggering and aggravation of a chronic disease, but the details are unclear. Diagnosis requires the history of a typical cluster of symptoms and the exclusion of a somatic disease that sufficiently explains the symptoms by medical examination. Current evidence-based guidelines emphasize the value of multimodal treatments, which encompass both non-pharmacological and selected pharmacological treatments tailored to individual symptoms, including pain, fatigue, sleep problems and mood problems.

### Fibromyalgia patients have reduced hippocampal volume compared with healthy controls [^115zMSvv]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a disorder characterized by chronic, widespread pain in the muscles, ligaments, tendons, and other connective tissues. Approximately five million people in the United States suffer from FM; annual costs of the disease are estimated around $6,000 per person annually. The exact etiology of FM is unknown; however, evidence of abnormalities in brain structure has been reported.FM is currently thought of as a complex disorder involving multiple systems, including both peripheral and central nervous system components.

FM patients have been shown to have reductions in cortical gray matter volumes in numerous areas associated with the pain experience, including the insular and anterior cingulate cortices.–However, FM is a disorder characterized by numerous symptoms besides pain, such as sleep disturbance, mood disorders, and cognitive dysfunction. Morphometric changes in FM have been described in areas outside the typically reported cortical "pain regions", such as reduced gray matter in the amygdala.

Changes to limbic morphometry in regions such as the cingulate, amygdala, thalamus, and the parahippocampal gyrus, have previously been reported in patients with FM.–Although reports of alterations in hippocampal volume among chronic pain conditions are sparse, a pivotal role for the hippocampus in FM has been proposed. Using proton magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) spectroscopy, Wood et al found abnormal ratios of N-acetylaspartate to creatine in the right hippocampus of FM patients compared with healthy controls; significant correlations were observed between these abnormalities and FM symptom severity. While the cause for such changes is currently unknown, excessive excitatory neurotransmission in the hippocampus may occur in FM, which can lead to potential dysfunction and atrophy.

Hippocampal atrophy resulting from FM may, in turn, worsen or exacerbate FM symptomatology. For example, FM patients often report a subjective worsening of cognitive function characterized by short-term memory problems (ie, the "fibro fog"). Furthermore, the hippocampal atrophy and dysfunction may "feed forward", resulting in more severe pain, discomfort, and anxiety in FM patients, due to its central role in limbic circuits and pain modulation networks.

### Assessing and diagnosing fibromyalgia in the clinical setting [^1158amVz]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a common and disabling condition that may be difficult to assess and diagnose owing to its wide range of symptoms and common comorbidities. The most common symptoms of fibromyalgia include widespread pain over the whole body, pain at specific tender points, fatigue, memory and other cognitive problems, sleep and mood disturbances, and impaired functioning. Accurately diagnosing fibromyalgia may require diagnostic testing and physical examinations such as tender points examinations; however, patients with longstanding symptoms may be diagnosed according to a symptom-based fibromyalgia criteria checklist. This activity provides a sample assessment and diagnosis in a clinical situation.

### Update on fibromyalgia therapy [^117XpCts]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Primary fibromyalgia, a poorly-understood chronic pain syndrome, is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, nonrestorative sleep, fatigue, psychological distress, and specific regions of localized tenderness, all in the absence of otherwise apparent organic disease. While the etiology of fibromyalgia is unclear, accumulating data suggest that disordered central pain processing likely plays a role in the pathogenesis of symptoms. Although various pharmacological treatments have been studied and espoused for treating fibromyalgia, no single drug or group of drugs has proved to be particularly useful in treating fibromyalgia patients as a whole, and only one drug to date has earned U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for treating the syndrome in the United States. This review critically and systematically evaluates clinical investigations of medicinal and nonmedicinal treatments for fibromyalgia dating from 1970 to 2007.

### Is there a gender difference in maltreatment-associated fibromyalgia? [^113GRkaS]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor

I read with great interest Chandan et al. enlightening article describing the association of childhood maltreatment with the subsequent development of fibromyalgia and other similar maladies. Using a large UK primary care database, they found that, when compared to an unexposed cohort, maltreated children have significantly higher risk for fibromyalgia development later in life (aIRR = 2.06; 95%CI = 1.71–2.48). Fifty-eight percent of maltreated children were female. We are not told what percentage of abused children developing fibromyalgia were women. This seems to be an important point considering fibromyalgia a female-predominant illness. Around 90% of fibromyalgia patients seeking medical care are women.

Fibromyalgia is clearly a stress-related disorder. The key issue in fibromyalgia research is to define how different stressful circumstances including childhood abuse could lead to chronic pain, and why females are predominantely affected.

Our research proposes fibromyalgia as a stress-related sympathetically-maintained neuropathic pain syndrome. The recently recognized link between fibromyalgia and small fiber neuropathy reinforces this pathogenetic model. We propose dorsal root ganglia as the key site where different afferent stress-derived signals are converted into neuropathic pain. There is marked sexual dimorphism in stress-evoked dorsal root ganglia phenotypic changes and also in stress-evoked painful neuropathy. Chandan et al. excellent research could advance our knowledge on the gender differences in stress-evoked fibromyalgia and similar syndromes. Would be important to know if maltreated children developing fibromyalgia were mostly women.

### Fibromyalgia and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1167BDju]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data sources and searches

The authors searched PubMed, Scopus, and the Web of Science electronic databases in August 2022 to identify studies that addressed associations between fibromyalgia and mortality. The search was conducted using the key words 'fibromyalgia' and 'mortality'. There was no limitation by date or language of publication. To identify additional studies, we reviewed the bibliographies of the full text papers that were included in the systematic review.

To ensure that the studies introduced into the review included patients with fibromyalgia, we selected studies that used the following fibromyalgia definitions:

In studies in which the diagnosis of fibromyalgia was extracted from medical records, the International Classification of Diseases and Injuries (ICD) codes 729.1 (for version 9) and M79.7 (for version 10) were used.
In studies in which the diagnosis of fibromyalgia was verified by interview/physical examination, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (versions 1990, 2010, 2011, or 2016), or referring rheumatologist diagnosis by criteria in effect at the time of enrolment, if before 1990, were used.

Although the criteria for fibromyalgia have evolved over the years and may identify different sets of patients, the strategy adopted was deemed appropriate since the aim of our review focused on question of whether clinical, real-life cohorts of fibromyalgia patients suffer from excess mortality. In real-life clinical practice, fibromyalgia patients are a mixed population, diagnosed in different years by different criteria relevant at the time of diagnosis, who were diagnosed by rheumatologists or family physicians.

### The pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of fibromyalgia [^111WTaCt]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Research in fibromyalgia has increased understanding of the possible genetic and environmental factors that could be involved in the etiology of fibromyalgia. There is now substantial evidence for augmentation of central pain processing in fibromyalgia. Because the clinical presentation of fibromyalgia is heterogeneous, treatment recommendations must be individualized for each patient. The rapid growth of trials in fibromyalgia in recent years has resulted in new evidence-based approaches to pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment.

### Biomedical models of fibromyalgia [^111BtMVe]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Fibromyalgia (FM) and chronic widespread pain (CWP) are common, but the etiology of these disorders remains poorly understood. A large body of data indicates a neurobiological basis for these disorders, but this information has not been effectively transmitted to many medical professionals.

Methods

Contemporary data on the epidemiologic characteristics of FM and CWP are reviewed, and evidence for a neurobiological basis for these disorders is presented. In addition, possible predisposing, triggering, and maintaining factors for the development of these disorders are discussed.

Results

Approximately 10% of the population have CWP, and approximately 4% have FM. The tender point criteria for FM have resulted in the common misconception among health care professionals that this spectrum of disorders is limited to women with high degrees of psychological distress. A hallmark of FM is the presence of non-nociceptive, central pain. There is evidence of centrally augmented pain processing, which can be detected both with sensory testing and by more objective measures (e.g., evoked potentials, functional neuroimaging).

Discussion

An appreciation of the neurobiological basis for these disorders, and an understanding of some of the abnormalities of pain processing present in patients with FM, will hopefully provide greater understanding of these patients. It may also serve to decrease the level of frustration and improve the care experience of both chronic pain patients and physicians.

### A systematic review of the association between fibromyalgia and functional gastrointestinal disorders [^117KssQb]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Both functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) and fibromyalgia are poorly understood syndromes significantly impacting quality of life and contributing to high levels of work absenteeism. The two conditions are associated with increased visits to physicians and impose a substantial financial burden, – with healthcare-associated costs reaching up to quadruple that of a reference population.

The FGID were defined in 1989 as 'a variable combination of chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms not explained by structural or biochemical abnormalities. This may include syndromes attributed to the oesophagus, stomach, biliary tree, small or large intestines, or anus'. Both fibromyalgia and FGID are more commonly identified in women, with fibromyalgia estimated to affect 3.98% (95% CI: 2.8–5.2) of women and 0.01 (95% CI: 0.04–0.06) of men. With few exceptions, the broad range of FGID are more prevalent in women, with medically diagnosed IBS affecting approximately four times as many women as men.

It is thought that both fibromyalgia and FGID are attributable to sympathetic dysfunction with resultant central sensitisation. Both conditions were recently categorised as 'Central Sensitivity Syndromes'. While a common etiology has been proposed, there is currently no compelling evidence to support a targeted intervention.

Fibromyalgia accounts for about 15% of all referrals to rheumatology clinics and has a global prevalence of around 2% with wide variation (0.2–6.6%) depending on the country and assessment tool used.– Reports consistently concur a higher prevalence for females – up to 10-fold that of males. The higher prevalence rates in women have been contested as being driven primarily by selection bias and that rates in men and women are possibly quite similar.

The major feature of fibromyalgia is chronic widespread pain (CWP) and is typically accompanied by a range of symptoms including fatigue, headache, sleep and cognitive disturbances, as well as digestive disorders, including IBS.

Introduction

Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) is a chronic and multidimensional condition predominantly characterized by chronic widespread pain (CWP), fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairments. It is a relatively common, ranking as the third most prevalent musculoskeletal disease, with global prevalence ranging from 1.78% to 4% of the general population.FMS is most frequently observed in women aged 20 to 60, with a female-to-male ratio approximately between 2:1 and 7:1. The syndrome often presents with multiple comorbidities, which complicating the syndrome and influencing treatment outcomes. As a result, FMS is frequently misdiagnosed, with average diagnostic delays of around 2.3 years. Moreover, the economic burden of FMS is significant, impacting both healthcare systems and patients' quality of life. Studies from Europe and North America indicate that FMS patients face a significant disease burden not only in terms of healthcare costs — which are estimated to be three times higher than for non-FMS individuals — but also in terms of lost productivity and reduced quality of life.

The pathophysiological mechanism remains uncertain and multifactorial, involving factors like central sensitization, abnormal peripheral nociception, autoimmune, inflammatory, and hormonal dysregulation. Despite being recognized as a legitimate syndrome by numerous health organizations, there remains significant debate regarding its pathophysiology, diagnosis, and classification. Recent studies have identified small fiber neuropathy in patients with FMS, which, coupled with the observed efficacy of antiepileptic drugs typically used for neuropathic pain, has prompted a re-evaluation of FMS's neuropathic pain characteristics and the exploration of new treatment strategies.

A 2014 meta-analysis suggested that pharmacologic treatments for FMS, which primarily address pain, show limited effectiveness in managing the condition's multidimensional nature. In contrast, non-pharmacologic approaches offer broader benefits across multiple symptom domains. A 2020 review highlights the necessity of multi-modal treatment approaches, given the complexity of the condition. Consequently, according to the latest EULAR recommendations for FMS, multicomponent therapies are supported (Evidence Ia, Grade A), and nonpharmacological interventions are prioritized as the initial treatment (Evidence IV, Grade D).

Individuals with fibromyalgia generally experience chronic widespread pain, which can be accompanied by further symptoms including fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety and depressive episodes. As the recognition and diagnosis of fibromyalgia has improved, the availability of therapeutic options for patients has increased. Furthermore, research into the neurobiological mechanisms that contribute to the chronic pain and concomitant symptoms experienced by patients with fibromyalgia has advanced our understanding of this debilitating disorder. In this Review, we aim to provide an overview of existing pathophysiological concepts. The roles of biological and psychological stress, genetic factors, and pain and sensory processing in the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia and related conditions are discussed. In addition, pharmacological treatments, including monoamine modulators, calcium channel modulators and γ-aminobutyric acid modulators, as well as nonpharmacological treatment options are considered.

### A review of etiological biomarkers for fibromyalgia and their therapeutic implications [^111Vrqwb]. Pain Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Fibromyalgia is a complex condition that has long puzzled the medical community. Hypotheses to explain the chronic widespread pain associated with the disease have evolved significantly over the years. However, research efforts to identify disease-specific biomarkers and develop effective treatments have been largely unsuccessful.

Objectives

The goals of this study were to review potential etiological biomarkers for fibromyalgia, focusing on micro-inflammation and metabolic syndrome, and to discuss the clinical implications of the review findings.

Study Design

A narrative review.

Methods

Relevant literature was obtained via Medline/PubMed, using the following search terms: fibromyalgia[ti] ("metabolic syndrome" OR "metabolic disease" OR biomarker*[ti] OR micro-inflammation OR sub-inflammation OR "low-level inflammation" OR "low-grade inflammation"). Results were filtered for the English language and screened for inclusion in the review.

Results

Articles included in the review covered the topics of pain, immune response/inflammation, micro-inflammation, metabolic syndrome, gut dysbiosis, oxidative stress, and stress response. Various molecules have been proposed as pain biomarkers for fibromyalgia, including neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, growth factors, and cytokines with possible etiological relevance. Recent genome-wide expression profiling suggests connections among low-level inflammation, termed "micro-inflammation", and the upregulation of genes involved in antibacterial and innate immune system response as well as those involved in clinical features, including high body mass index (BMI) and comorbid depression, in a subgroup of fibromyalgia patients. A set of 5 differentially expressed inflammatory genes have been identified as potential biomarkers of a micro-inflammation fibromyalgia subtype. Proposed triggers of micro-inflammation include bacterial disease and gut dysbiosis. Metabolic syndrome may be causative or consequential, while comorbid depression may be associated with dysbiosis and/or micro-inflammation through the gut-immune-brain axis. A potential new treatment approach based on this information has been proposed.

Limitations

External validation of potential etiological biomarkers is needed. Further investigations to ascertain the involvement of metabolic syndrome and gut dysbiosis and support the proposed treatment paradigm are warranted.

Conclusion

Fibromyalgia is likely the result of multiple causative factors, genetic and environmental. To date, no clear, reliable etiological biomarker for fibromyalgia has been identified. The considerable variability among patients suggests the presence of multiple disease subtypes with different pathophysiological mechanisms. Effective treatment therefore requires a multimodal, multidisciplinary approach that targets each individual patient's pathophysiological features. The proposed treatment paradigm attempts to address multiple factors that have been implicated more recently in the development and maintenance of fibromyalgia, such as micro-inflammation, metabolic syndrome, and gut dysbiosis.
