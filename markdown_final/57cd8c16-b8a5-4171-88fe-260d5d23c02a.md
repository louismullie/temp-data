## Question

What is the most effective framework for learning the significance of lung sounds during a stethoscope-based physical examination?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the most effective framework for learning the significance of lung sounds during a stethoscope-based physical examination. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the end-goals and competencies for trainees. Then, I should appraise the traditional, lecture-based baseline. Next, I will evaluate simulation-based training evidence. After that, I need to assess digital stethoscopes and AI-driven feedback and their educational value and limits. Then, I should consider peer-teaching and standardized-patient models for scalability. Finally, I will synthesize a hybrid, evidence-informed framework, acknowledge gaps, and provide a concise, clinically grounded recommendation aligned with guideline priorities and feasibility constraints.

> Let me first confirm the goal and scope so I do not misalign the framework. The objective is not only sound recognition but also interpretation and application in real cases, which means mapping acoustic patterns to pathophysiology and integrating findings with history, imaging, and the rest of the physical examination to guide diagnosis and management, a principle emphasized in both educational reviews and diagnostic teaching literature [^112RPaf8] [^112d9WXC] [^1133kK1g].

> Wait, let me verify the baseline we are trying to improve upon. Traditional methods rely on prerecorded libraries of normal and adventitious sounds with basic instruction on stethoscope placement and correlating to pathophysiology; while scalable, this has well documented inter-listener variability and limited durability when used alone, and structured time for pulmonary auscultation in training programs has historically been sparse, especially outside internal medicine residencies [^112RPaf8] [^1173XgGp] [^notfound]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about reliability; multiple studies show inconsistent recognition of key lung sounds among clinicians and allied professionals, underscoring the need for objective feedback in training to reduce variability and drift over time [^111FHSN8] [^1143BtZq] [^113c5ywe].

> Next, I should review the evidence for simulation-based training, and I need to check whether benefits extend beyond immediate post-tests. In a prospective single-center randomized study of paramedic students, a modified stethoscope linked to standardized patients (Ventriloscope) outperformed audiotape and lecture on post-test scores and, importantly, demonstrated superior 4-week retention, suggesting contextual, real-time auscultation practice improves acquisition and durability of skills compared with passive listening; this aligns with similar gains seen when simulated heart sounds are paired with small-group debriefing in cardiac auscultation education [^116ic4uM] [^117M5yNY]. Hmm, wait a minute, this is small and single-center, so effect estimates may be imprecise, but the consistency across immediate and follow-up endpoints is reassuring for educational effect size despite low credibility [^116ic4uM].

> I will now examine digital stethoscope and AI-enabled feedback as educational force-multipliers rather than replacements. Let me consider what they add: recordability, visual spectrograms, sharability for debriefing, and algorithmic classification that can provide immediate, objective feedback on features like wheezes or crackles, thereby making subtle acoustic patterns visible to trainees and reducing subjective bias during practice [^111scfXf] [^113a3fZd]. I should confirm feasibility and performance signals; systematic review data for computerized lung sound analysis suggest around 80% sensitivity and 85% specificity for wheezes and crackles, which is sufficiently accurate to be pedagogically useful, and analogous work in digital cardiac auscultation shows validated, clinician-level performance for murmur detection, illustrating how AI feedback can scaffold novice interpretation during training sessions [^113a3fZd] [^111YN4V2]. But wait, what if we overstate clinical readiness; much of the pulmonary AI literature remains protocol-level or early development, even though attention maps and standardized acquisition pipelines proposed in recent protocols can structure debriefings and reduce bias during training [^117QFSoC] [^116m3WSX].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations so trainees are not misled by overconfident tools. Most AI studies are single-center with small datasets and uncertain generalizability across microphones, environments, and populations; noise, mixed sound sources, and heterogeneity in labels degrade accuracy, so these tools should be framed explicitly as adjuncts for feedback and visualization, not as gold standards, until multi-institutional validation matures [^113QM4fA] [^117QFSoC] [^115goMpG]. Let me double-check the broader technology trajectory; reviews emphasize that recent digital and wearable stethoscopes enable storage and sharing that are highly advantageous for education, yet careful study design is still required to ensure reliability across tasks and settings [^111scfXf].

> Next, I should review scalable human teaching models because faculty time is the rate-limiting step. Trained standardized patients and peer instructors can deliver well-rated, cost-effective physical exam teaching, and by extension, in lung-sound curricula this approach can multiply practice opportunities and provide immediate feedback using structured checklists and digital recordings, while mastery-based assessment paradigms from thoracic ultrasound education reinforce the need to verify competence before progression [^116F3nHp] [^116A4EaM]. Let me reconsider the risk of variable quality in peer-led sessions; pairing peers with recorded exemplars and AI visualizations can anchor feedback to common references and mitigate drift during unsupervised practice [^111scfXf] [^113a3fZd].

> I need to synthesize these strands into a hybrid, evidence-informed framework. Let me outline the phases succinctly and verify each has evidence support: preclinical preparation with curated audio and brief pathophysiology primers to build mental templates; simulation-based practice using a modified stethoscope on standardized patients to provide contextual, real-time feedback; digital augmentation with spectrograms and algorithmic prompts to deliver objective, immediate feedback and enable debriefing; peer-teaching small groups to increase volume and reinforce skills; and clinical correlation plus competency assessment using case discussions tied to imaging and OSCE-style stations with remediation and spaced boosters for retention, repeating follow-up checks at set intervals to counteract skill decay [^112RPaf8] [^116ic4uM] [^113a3fZd] [^116F3nHp] [^1133kK1g]. Wait, I should verify the retention piece; the RCT's 4-week follow-up signal supports implementing scheduled reassessments and booster sessions to maintain competence over time [^116ic4uM].

> Now, I should justify why this hybrid is likely the most effective approach rather than any single component. First, it directly addresses the central weakness of traditional teaching by adding hands-on, contextual practice that has shown superior short- and intermediate-term outcomes. Second, it leverages objective visualization and algorithmic feedback to mitigate inter-listener variability repeatedly documented across clinicians. Third, it is scalable and cost-sensitive by integrating peer instruction. Finally, it aligns with calls from professional societies to revitalize auscultation through structured, modernized training programs [^116ic4uM] [^111FHSN8] [^1143BtZq] [^116F3nHp] [^113uhK4F]. Hold on, I should verify one point I almost misattributed; when citing variability I initially thought only of physician studies, but physiotherapist concordance data also highlight moderate agreement, reinforcing the case for objective augmentation during training [^1143BtZq].

> I should acknowledge residual uncertainties and avoid overclaiming. Evidence quality is limited by small, single-center designs in both simulation and AI studies, generalizability from paramedic students to medical learners is not guaranteed, and AI models require larger, diverse, well-annotated datasets and standardized acquisition to function as dependable educational references, so institutions should treat these tools as adjunctive rather than definitive until higher-quality validation is available [^116ic4uM] [^113a3fZd] [^117QFSoC] [^116m3WSX]. Let me also note that while diagnostic frameworks emphasize integrated clinical reasoning, we still need rigorous trials comparing the hybrid against its components to quantify incremental benefits on both recognition accuracy and clinical decision-making fidelity [^112d9WXC].

> For implementation, I need to ensure the program is competency based, data driven, and feasible. A practical rollout would start with a pilot cohort collecting pre, post, and spaced follow-up assessments using standardized recordings and OSCE-style stations, pair simulation sessions with digital capture for debriefing, and embed case-linkage to imaging and labs to drive sound-to-disease reasoning, similar to mastery approaches in thoracic ultrasound; objective analyzers and curated libraries can provide anchor standards for feedback and remediation while faculty oversight focuses on higher-order integration and clinical safety [^116A4EaM] [^111iY5t1] [^112RPaf8]. I should double-check that institutional priorities align; contemporary guideline perspectives emphasize structured education and integration of physical findings with the broader diagnostic workup, which this design explicitly operationalizes [^1133kK1g].

> Final synthesis, keeping it concise and clinically actionable. The most effective framework to learn the clinical significance of lung sounds is a structured, blended program that couples preparatory audio-pathophysiology primers with simulation using a modified stethoscope on standardized patients, augments practice with digital recordings and algorithmic feedback for objective, immediate guidance, scales sessions via peer-led small groups under faculty oversight, and cements competence through case-based correlation, OSCE-style assessment, and spaced boosters for retention, aligning with calls to modernize auscultation training while addressing inter-listener variability and resource constraints [^112RPaf8] [^116ic4uM] [^113a3fZd] [^116F3nHp] [^113uhK4F] [^1133kK1g].

The best framework for learning lung sounds is a **structured, multimodal approach** that integrates didactic teaching, high-fidelity simulation [^112RPaf8], and deliberate practice with expert feedback [^116ic4uM], reinforced by digital auscultation and AI tools for objective analysis and self-assessment [^113a3fZd]. This strategy **improves recognition** [^117M5yNY], reduces inter-listener variability, and supports retention. Digital stethoscopes and AI also provide objective [^113a3fZd], shareable recordings for ongoing learning [^111scfXf] and telemedicine [^1171spbh]. Consistent use of **standardized terminology** [^113c5ywe] and integration with clinical context [^1133kK1g] are essential for accurate interpretation and clinical decision-making.

---

## Core components of the framework

### Didactic instruction and standardized terminology

Didactic instruction should begin with **structured lectures or online modules** [^113VXk1Z] covering normal and abnormal lung sounds, their acoustic features [^1131bGYL], and associated pathophysiology. Standardized terminology should employ **consistent terms** (e.g. crackles, wheezes, rhonchi, stridor, pleural rubs) to reduce confusion [^113c5ywe] and improve communication.

---

### Simulation-based training

Use **high-fidelity simulators** [^112RPaf8] to replicate normal and abnormal lung sounds in realistic clinical scenarios, enabling safe, repetitive practice. Deliberate practice entails **repeated, focused practice** with **immediate expert feedback** [^116ic4uM] to refine auscultation skills and reduce errors [^117M5yNY].

---

### Digital auscultation and AI-assisted analysis

Digital stethoscopes enable recording, storing, and sharing lung sounds [^111scfXf] for **objective analysis** and **self-assessment** [^113a3fZd], reducing subjectivity and inter-listener variability. AI-assisted analysis classifies lung sounds and provides **objective feedback**, enhancing learning and **diagnostic accuracy** [^111iY5t1].

---

### Clinical integration and contextual learning

Prioritize **clinical context** [^112d9WXC] by integrating auscultation findings with patient history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests [^1133kK1g] to improve interpretation and decision-making. Also emphasize **bedside teaching** [^115EsvKt] through supervised rounds that apply auscultation skills in real clinical settings, reinforcing learning and building confidence.

---

### Continuous assessment and feedback

Use **Objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs)** [^116A4EaM] to assess auscultation skills objectively and identify areas for improvement [^116gKSgd], and provide **regular feedback** from experienced clinicians and peers to refine skills and maintain proficiency [^1173XgGp].

---

## Advantages of the proposed framework

- **Improved accuracy** combines subjective and objective methods to enhance recognition and interpretation of lung sounds [^113a3fZd].

- **Reduced variability** results from standardized terminology and objective analysis, which reduce inter-listener variability.

- **Enhanced retention** comes from repetitive practice and feedback that improve long-term retention of auscultation skills [^116ic4uM].

- **Clinical relevance** reflects integration with clinical context, ensuring practical applicability and better patient outcomes [^1133kK1g].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Resource availability** may be constrained; access to high-fidelity simulators and digital stethoscopes can be limited in some settings [^112RPaf8].

- **Training requirements** include additional training and familiarity to use digital and AI tools effectively [^111scfXf].

- **Subjectivity** persists; despite objective tools, interpretation can remain subjective, especially in complex cases [^113c5ywe].

---

## Future directions

- **AI integration** involves continued development of AI algorithms to improve accuracy and provide real-time feedback [^115goMpG].

- **Telemedicine** includes expansion of digital auscultation and AI tools for remote training and clinical assessment [^114C5yWs].

- **Personalized learning** uses adaptive learning platforms tailored to individual learner needs and progress.

The best framework for learning lung sounds is a **structured, multimodal approach** combining didactic instruction, simulation-based training, digital auscultation, AI-assisted analysis, and clinical integration [^113uhK4F]. This comprehensive strategy improves accuracy [^113a3fZd], reduces variability, and enhances retention. Digital and AI tools also provide objective feedback and support telemedicine [^111scfXf].

### Technology for enhancing chest auscultation in clinical simulation [^112RPaf8]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

The ability to use an acoustic stethoscope to detect lung and/or heart sounds and then communicate one's interpretation of those sounds is an essential skill for many medical professionals. Interpretation of lung and heart sounds, in the context of history and other examination findings, often aids the differential diagnosis. Bedside assessment of changing auscultation findings may also guide treatment. Learning lung and heart auscultation skills typically involves listening to pre-recorded normal and adventitious sounds, followed by laboratory instruction to guide stethoscope placement and correlating the sounds with the associated pathophysiology and pathology.

Recently, medical simulation has become an important tool for teaching prior to clinical practice and for evaluating bedside auscultation skills. When simulating cardiovascular or pulmonary problems, high-quality lung and heart sounds should be able to accurately corroborate other findings such as vital signs, arterial blood gas values, or imaging. Digital audio technology, the Internet, and high-fidelity simulators have increased opportunities for educators and learners. We review the application of these technologies and describe options for reproducing lung and heart sounds, as well as their advantages and potential limitations.

### Improved auscultation skills in paramedic students using a modified stethoscope [^116ic4uM]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The Ventriloscope® (Lecat's SimplySim, Tallmadge, OH) is a modified stethoscope used as a simulation training device for auscultation.

- **Objective**: To test the effectiveness of the Ventriloscope as a training device in teaching heart and lung auscultatory findings to paramedic students.

- **Methods**: A prospective, single-hospital study conducted in a paramedic-teaching program. The standard teaching group learned heart and lung sounds via audiocassette recordings and lecture, whereas the intervention group utilized the modified stethoscope in conjunction with patient volunteers. Study subjects took a pre-test, post-test, and a follow-up test to measure recognition of heart and lung sounds.

- **Results**: The intervention group included 22 paramedic students and the standard group included 18 paramedic students. Pre-test scores did not differ using two-sample t-tests (standard group: t [16] = -1.63, p = 0.12) and (intervention group: t [20] = -1.17, p = 0.26). Improvement in pre-test to post-test scores was noted within each group (standard: t [17] = 2.43, p = 0.03; intervention: t [21] = 4.81, p < 0.0001). Follow-up scores for the standard group were not different from pre-test scores of 16.06 (t [17] = 0.94, p = 0.36). However, follow-up scores for the intervention group significantly improved from their respective pre-test score of 16.05 (t [21] = 2.63, p = 0.02).

- **Conclusion**: Simulation training using a modified stethoscope in conjunction with standardized patients allows for realistic learning of heart and lung sounds. This technique of simulation training achieved proficiency and better recognition.

### Computerized lung sound analysis as diagnostic aid for the detection of abnormal lung sounds: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113a3fZd]. Respiratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The standardized use of a stethoscope for chest auscultation in clinical research is limited by its inherent inter-listener variability. Electronic auscultation and automated classification of recorded lung sounds may help prevent some of these shortcomings.

We sought to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies implementing computerized lung sound analysis (CLSA) to aid in the detection of abnormal lung sounds for specific respiratory disorders.

We searched for articles on CLSA in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and ISI Web of Knowledge through July 31, 2010. Following a qualitative review, we conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of CLSA for the detection of abnormal lung sounds.

Of 208 articles identified, we selected eight studies for review. Most studies employed either electret microphones or piezoelectric sensors for auscultation, and Fourier Transform and Neural Network algorithms for analysis and automated classification of lung sounds. Overall sensitivity for the detection of wheezes or crackles using CLSA was 80% (95% CI 72–86%) and specificity was 85% (95% CI 78–91%).

While quality data on CLSA are relatively limited, analysis of existing information suggests that CLSA can provide a relatively high specificity for detecting abnormal lung sounds such as crackles and wheezes. Further research and product development could promote the value of CLSA in research studies or its diagnostic utility in clinical settings.

### The coming era of a new auscultation system for analyzing respiratory sounds [^111scfXf]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Auscultation with a stethoscope has been an essential tool for diagnosing patients with respiratory disease. Although auscultation is non-invasive, rapid, and inexpensive, it has intrinsic limitations such as inter-listener variability and subjectivity, and the examination must be performed face-to-face. Conventional stethoscopes could not record respiratory sounds, making it impossible to share the sounds. Recent innovative digital stethoscopes have overcome these limitations and enabled clinicians to store and share sounds for education and discussion. The recordable stethoscope has made it possible to analyze breathing sounds using artificial intelligence, particularly neural networks. Deep learning-based analysis with an automatic feature extractor and convolutional neural network classifier has been applied for the accurate analysis of respiratory sounds.

Advances in battery technology, embedded processors with low power consumption, and integrated sensors have made the development of wearable and wireless stethoscopes possible. These can help examine patients living in areas with a shortage of doctors or those who need isolation. There are still challenges to overcome, such as the analysis of complex and mixed respiratory sounds and noise filtering, but continuous research and technological development will facilitate the transition to a new era of wearable and smart stethoscopes.

### Multi-channel lung sounds intelligent diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1172WRry]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Previous studies primarily focused on the recognition and classification of abnormal lung sounds. For example, wavelet analysis combined with the BP neural network was used to realize the automatic recognition of wheezing, crackles, and other abnormal lung sounds; EMD decomposition was used to identify crackles. However, considering that different respiratory diseases may have the same abnormal lung sounds, these sounds cannot be used to diagnose the severity of COPD. For example, while COPD is a common cause of wheezing, asthma, bronchitis, and laryngitis may also cause wheezing. Using multi-dimensional features to diagnose COPD has high accuracy and can save diagnosis and treatment costs to some extent. Nevertheless, it is challenging to quickly diagnose the severity of COPD due to the large amount of information required and the need for experienced doctors.

Few studies on COPD diagnosis based on lung sounds focus on separating the digital auscultation records of COPD patients from healthy subjects. Altan et al. investigated how lung sounds could be used to diagnose COPD severity. First, they combined the three-dimensional feature-extraction technique with DBN to classify COPD0 and COPD4. After that, they used a 3D second-order difference plot to extract characteristic abnormalities in lung sounds and then used the deep extreme learning machine classifier to complete the five classifications of COPD severity. Compared to their research, our study has the advantage of being more suitable for clinical needs and establishes a channel selection model based on the reliefF algorithm.

### A snapshot of pulmonary medicine at the turn of the century: The American Thoracic Society membership [^113tvkKk]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The Membership Committee developed a survey to describe the characteristics of the American Thoracic Society, assessing demographics, training, professional activities, and needs of its diverse membership, including a growing international segment. This effort aimed to determine how the Society reflects the state of pulmonary medicine in the United States. A self-administered survey was mailed to active members. Of the members who responded, 80% reside in the United States or Canada, while the remainder come from 90 different countries. The majority of North American respondents (79%) were white, non-Hispanic, with 17% of respondents being female. Female respondents were generally younger, averaging 42 years, compared to 47 years for males.

- **Demographics and professional activities**: Sixty-five percent of respondents identified clinical practice as their major activity, 20% focused on research, and 5% on teaching. More women (33%) than men (22%) identified themselves as researchers. The majority of respondents (69%) have a medical school faculty affiliation.

The American Thoracic Society represents a global organization with diverse clinical expertise and scientific interests. The majority of respondents are clinicians; however, the membership has a strong academic bent, with most reporting academic affiliations and describing teaching as a secondary activity.

### From Laënnec's stethoscope to the magic of imaging, big data and artificial intelligence: A timeline of precision medicine for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115EsvKt]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Although the practice of anamnesis dates back to the teachings of Hippocrates, it was Sir William Osler who, in the latter part of the 19th century, shifted medical education from formal lectures to more practical instruction within medical wards and at the bedside. His innovative approach to establishing a formal residency over several years, emphasizing extensive direct patient contact in wards and clinics, remains a foundational method in training medical doctors. Osler's famous dictum, "Listen to your patient, he is telling you the diagnosis", encapsulates the most crucial skill for the precise diagnosis of any illness. Moreover, he was a pioneer of bedside teaching, emphasizing the importance of a "thorough history and physical examination" by conducting rounds with a small group of students or residents.

### Development and evaluation of a deep learning-based pulmonary hypertension screening algorithm using a digital stethoscope [^111Qg7xC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

Use of digital health devices and deep learning algorithms could enable pulmonary hypertension (PH) screening to be performed at the point of care. This minimizes dependency on listener skills and avoids the need for expensive testing, in addition to identifying patients who have PH before severe and sometimes irreversible signs and symptoms appear. The algorithm could also rule out patients without PH, thereby helping to reduce the number of unnecessary echocardiograms and saving significant time and money for both patients and providers. The technology described here has significant potential applications in the public health sector to screen for heart disease worldwide.

### The 200th anniversary of the stethoscope: Can this low-tech device survive in the high-tech 21st century [^113uhK4F]. European Heart Journal (2016). High credibility.

In 1816, Laennec discovered that auscultation of the heart and lungs could effectively be performed by placing a hollow cylinder (initially made of a roll of paper) between the chest of the patient and the ear of the examiner. This was the first step in the development of the stethoscope, which was a breakthrough in the diagnosis and management of cardiac and pulmonary patients. Technical improvements of the stethoscope followed, and in cardiac patients, auscultation soon became a major diagnostic tool.

In the second half of the 20th century, new powerful non-invasive diagnostic modalities were developed, and the interest in auscultation declined. As a result, the auscultatory skills of students and physicians at all levels of training decreased to a disappointingly low level. We now must decide whether we should stimulate the use of and proficiency in auscultation or if we should accept the further decline and eventual abolishment of this component of the physical examination. Reviewing the literature and considering the setting in which the patients are presented, including the availability of advanced diagnostic facilities, we conclude that the time-honored stethoscope, despite its limitations, still has potential as a patient-friendly, effective, and economical instrument in medical practice.

However, new initiatives are required to train students, physicians, and allied health professionals in cardiac auscultation to avoid misinterpretations that may harm patients and generate extra costs. To be successful, such programs will require wide support from the medical community.

### Endobronchial intubation detected by insertion depth of endotracheal tube, bilateral auscultation, or observation of chest movements: randomised trial [^111DLFH8]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

**Practical implications**: Particularly for clinicians with less experience in airway management, among single tests, the best way of excluding inadvertent endobronchial intubation with the highest sensitivity is by observing the cm scale printed on each endotracheal tube. The sensitivity of this simple clinical test exceeds lung auscultation by 23%. Furthermore, the tube depth seems to be almost independent of the user's experience and can be used by clinicians even at the beginning of their training with high sensitivity and specificity. When all three bedside tests were combined — namely, bilateral auscultation of the lungs, observation and palpation of symmetrical chest movements, and referencing the endotracheal tube cm scale — sensitivity was higher than observing the cm scale alone. Anaesthetists in their first year of training correctly diagnosed endobronchial intubation by auscultation in less than half of the cases. This result is consistent with the findings of Brunel et al, who found that 60% of endobronchial intubations confirmed by chest radiography in patients in an intensive care unit occurred despite equal breath sounds on examination. The observed poor detection rate suggests that patients intubated by less experienced clinicians are at risk for endobronchial-related complications, including atelectasis formation or barotrauma caused by over-inflation of the intubated lung.

### Validation of an interventional pulmonary examination [^116gKSgd]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Interventional pulmonology (IP) is an emerging subspecialty with a dedicated 12 months of additional training after traditional pulmonary and critical care fellowships across the country. A multiple-choice question (MCQ) examination was developed to measure the didactic knowledge acquired in IP fellowships.

- **Methods**: Interventional pulmonologists from 10 academic centers developed an MCQ-based examination on a proposed curriculum for IP fellowships. The 75 multiple-choice question examination was proctored, time-limited (120 min), and computer-based. The examination was administered to IP faculty, IP fellows in their last month of fellowship, graduating pulmonary and critical care fellows in their last month of training, and incoming first-year pulmonary and critical care fellows.

- **Results**: The mean score for IP faculty was 87% (range, 83%-94%), 74% for IP fellows (range, 61%-81%, SD 5.09, median 76%), 62% for graduating pulmonary and critical care fellows (range, 52%-73%), and 50% for incoming pulmonary/critical care fellows (range, 35%-65%). There was a graduated increase in mean scores with the level of IP training. Scores differed significantly across the four groups (P = 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: A validated MCQ examination can measure IP knowledge. There is a difference in IP knowledge based on IP training exposure.

### Deep learning diagnostic and severity-stratification for interstitial lung diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in digital lung auscultations and ultrasonography: Clinical protocol for an observational case-control study [^117QFSoC]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

- **Overview of the DeepBreath binary classification model**: Top to bottom: data collection. Every patient will have 10 lung audio recordings corresponding to 1 per 10 anatomical sites (LAS, RAS: Left and Right Anterior Superior; LAI, RAI: Left and Right Anterior Inferior; LPS, RPS: Left and Right Posterior Superior; LPI, RPI: Left and Right Posterior Inferior; Left and Right Lateral).

	- **Pre-processing**: A band-pass filter is applied to clips before transformation to log-mel spectrograms, which are batch-normalised and augmented, and then fed into an audio classifier. Here, a CNN outputs both segment-level prediction and attention values, which are aggregated into a single clip-wise output for each site. These are then aggregated by concatenation to obtain a feature vector of size for every patient, which is evaluated by logistic regression. Finally, patient-level classification is performed by thresholding to get a binary output. The segment-wise outputs of the audio classifier are extracted for further analysis.

Exploring the synergy of clinical data with breath sounds: Clinical data will be explored for its predictive capacity in the above tasks and added to the breath sound analysis either as a support vector machine (SVM) or in conditional feature extraction upstream of the neural network.

### Reproducibility of dynamically represented acoustic lung images from healthy individuals [^116DUJP2]. Thorax (2008). Low credibility.

For this study, subjects were asked to take regular deep breaths at a respiratory rate of 12–15 breaths per minute. Subjects received feedback on their breathing intensity through a graphic display and, if necessary, were asked to modify their breathing. The fact that intra-subject values were reproducible verifies the feasibility of this technique. Moreover, Gavriely and colleagues have demonstrated that increasing flow rate causes parallel upward shifts in lung sound spectral curves with no change in the shape and pattern of the chest wall spectra. This observation, combined with the results of the study, suggests that the relative distribution of normal breath sounds is not significantly affected by flow rate. This is important as a relative breath sound distribution that varies with flow rate may indicate respiratory disease. We plan to explore the effects of variation in breathing depth, pattern, and rate on the reproducibility of acoustic lung images in health and disease states in future studies.

We chose to validate the VRIxp in healthy individuals because of the expectation that lung sounds will change little over time. It is a necessary prerequisite for any investigative tool that it should generate reproducible data from individuals in whom there is no change in lung health status. Further work is required to investigate the differences seen with acoustic lung imaging in respiratory disease and to demonstrate that reproducible images can be obtained from individuals with stable chronic respiratory disease. A recent study by Dellinger and colleagues…

### The analysis of lung sounds in infants and children with a history of wheezing/asthma using an automatic procedure [^114p1yLf]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

In this report, we demonstrated the reliability of a new software program that utilizes ML algorithms to perform lung sound analysis in infants and children. Compared to previous methods, the new software program is able to more accurately classify three-year-old infants with a history of wheezing and/or asthma, and is superior in that it is fully automated. It is preferable that a diagnosis can be made even during a healthy period with resting breathing.

In recent years, lung sound analysis techniques have been proposed as a safe and simple approach that can be used to evaluate airway changes in children. Previous reports have shown that lung sound parameters change during histamine and methacholine inhalation tests and that there is a strong relationship between changes in lung sound parameters and airway narrowing in asthmatic patients.

One major problem with these analysis methods is that lung sounds are affected by airflow; however, we previously developed reliable methods that are not affected by airflow by utilizing lung sound spectrum curves. Using this method, it was possible to investigate airway hyperresponsiveness and reversibility using lung sounds in children with asthma and to study the factors that cause asthma in healthy infants.

As described above, it is clear that the lung sound analysis parameters are useful biomarkers of lung function in children. However, another problem with conventional methods is that the operations of lung sound analysis are not fully automated. Before starting the lung sound analysis, two or more pediatric pulmonology experts are required to…

### Deep learning diagnostic and risk-stratification pattern detection for COVID-19 in digital lung auscultations: Clinical protocol for a case-control and prospective cohort study [^114KrPvm]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In order to generate a human baseline for sound-based diagnostic and risk stratification interpretation, lung sounds will be randomly selected and blinded for outcomes. Several clinicians, including residents, fellows, professors, and pulmonologists, will evaluate them, classifying each as either COVID-positive or COVID-negative, both with and without the availability of clinical and demographic information. Following this, clinicians will be provided only the COVID-positive samples to stratify their risk, again with and without access to clinical symptomology and demographic information collected on day 0, prior to any diagnostic tests.

Lung sounds will also be annotated by expert consensus for audible pathology types, such as wheezing, crackles, and rhonchi. A kappa statistic for interrater concordance will be computed for each evaluation, and a ROCAUC will be reported according to the outcome. The distribution of discriminative sound patterns identified by the clinical experts will be explored using unsupervised machine learning. Specifically, clustering on k-means will be employed to group sounds into k number of clusters, optimized using the Elbow method. By clustering objective sound patterns in a vector space, and reporting the distribution of human labels within these clusters, alignment between objective patterns and human interpretation will be visualized.

### Respiratory noises: How useful are they clinically [^113c5ywe]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Although clinicians place considerable weight on the identification of the various forms of noisy breathing, there are serious questions regarding both the accuracy (validity) and the reliability (repeatability) of these noises. To avoid diagnostic errors, clinicians need to consider the whole constellation of symptoms and signs and not focus on the specific "type" of noise. Given the high error rate with "parent-reported wheeze", there is a need to reexamine the extensive literature on the epidemiology of wheeze in infants and young children, as parent-reported wheeze is often unconfirmed by a clinician. It is clear that we need more high-quality research evidence to better understand the clinical utility of these noises and their natural history.

### Respiratory sounds in healthy people: A systematic review [^1131bGYL]. Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

There is a lack of systematized information on respiratory sounds of healthy people. This impairs health professionals from differentiating respiratory sounds of healthy people from those with respiratory diseases, which may affect patients' diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to characterize the respiratory sounds of healthy individuals.

- **Methods**: The Web of Knowledge, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCOPUS databases were searched, and studies using computerized analyses to detect/characterize respiratory sounds in healthy people were included. Data were extracted using a structured table format.

- **Results**: Sixteen cross-sectional studies assessing respiratory sounds in 964 subjects (aged 1 day–70 years) were included. Thirteen studies investigated normal respiratory sounds (frequency, intensity, and amplitude), and three explored adventitious respiratory sounds (crackles and wheezes). The highest sound frequencies were observed at the trachea (inspiration: 447–1323 Hz; expiration: 206–540 Hz). Women (444–999 Hz) and infants (250–400 Hz) presented the highest frequencies at maximum power. Inspiratory sounds were more intense at the left posterior lower lobe (5.7–76.6 dB), and expiratory sounds were more intense at the trachea (45.4–85.1 dB). However, studies establishing direct comparisons between inspiratory and expiratory sounds showed that inspiratory sounds presented the highest intensities (p < 0.001). Amplitude was higher at the left upper anterior chest (1.7 ± 0.8 V) and lower at the right posterior lower lobe (1.2 ± 0.7 V). Crackles were the adventitious respiratory sound most frequently reported.

### Deep learning diagnostic and severity-stratification for interstitial lung diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in digital lung auscultations and ultrasonography: Clinical protocol for an observational case-control study [^114B164N]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Several studies have assessed the broad adoption and impact of deep learning to help diagnose COPD, the third leading cause of death worldwide. The vast majority developed predictive models to cover a wide range of objectives, the main ones being the diagnosis and severity classification of the disease. A 2022 review of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in COPD yielded 156 articles relevant to the application of AI in COPD research, including 56 concerning diagnosis, 65 on its prognosis, 54 on COPD severity classification, and 17 on the management of the disease. Most studies have used a variety of features, including patient physiological characteristics, comorbidities, symptoms, vital signs, biomarkers, genomic information, pulmonary function tests, CT images, hospitalization information, and/or breath sounds. Regardless of the methods chosen, COPD remains an incurable and progressive disease, and diagnosis at the early risk stage is important.

In this sense, the work of Altan et al. is innovative. The deep learning algorithms they used to analyze multiple lung auscultation points for the early diagnosis of COPD achieved high classification performance rates. Achieving this with a method as conventional as lung auscultation can reduce the need for additional, more extensive, time-consuming, expensive, or invasive diagnostic tests.

Conversely, research regarding IPF and NSIP is scarce and has focused mostly on datasets collected through radiological, genomic, or functional tests. Pancaldi et al. described the use of an AI algorithm to detect the presence of velcr…

### The analysis of lung sounds in infants and children with a history of wheezing/asthma using an automatic procedure [^115LizrP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Basic details of the new lung sound analysis software program are significant. The original lung sound analysis software program (Murata Manufacturing Co. Ltd, Version 1.6) can automatically:

- **Inspiratory sound selection**: Select the subject's typical inspiratory sounds suitable for the analysis from breath sound samples on the lung sound spectrogram.
- **Parameter analysis**: Analyze the lung sound parameters of the selected inspiratory sounds.

The first 10 seconds of the acquired spectrogram image (10 seconds or more) of each subject were automatically selected, and each parameter was automatically calculated and then saved as individual data. To avoid external noises and crying sounds, the examiner can select the optimal 10 seconds to start the automatic analysis. The selection of inspiratory sound samples mentioned above and the creation of an appropriate power spectrum for inspiratory sounds were automatically analyzed using the ML algorithm.

The lung sound data were transformed into a spectrogram automatically. From the spectrogram, multiple sound source components are extracted using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), and the exact time when inspiration is relatively strong is determined from each component. The power spectrum at this time was smoothed using Bayesian estimation. Simultaneously, new lung sound parameters were calculated.

### Physicians' ability to recognize adventitious lung sounds [^111FHSN8]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Low credibility.

Lung auscultation is an important tool for diagnosing respiratory diseases. However, the ability of observers to recognize respiratory sounds varies considerably and depends on the sound. The present study aimed to assess the auscultatory skills of healthcare professionals and medical students.

- **Methods**: A total of 295 physicians (185 pediatricians, 69 pulmonologists, and 41 physicians of general/internal medicine and subspecialties), 55 residents, and 50 medical students participated in the survey. They listened to five audio-recorded respiratory sounds and described them in free-form answers.

- **Results**: The rates of correct answers were 55.2% for fine crackles, 74.5% for coarse crackles, 72.2% for wheezes, 18.75% for squawks, and 11.25% for pleural friction rub. The medical specialty was correlated with the correct answers and both pediatricians and physicians of general/internal medicine and subspecialties recognized fewer sounds compared with respiratory physicians [odds ratio (OR): 0.37; confidence interval (CI): 0.22–0.62; p < 0.001 and OR: 0.47; CI: 0.22–0.99, p = 0.048, respectively]. Years of experience were negatively correlated with the number of correct answers (OR: 0.73; CI: 0.62–0.84; p = 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Gaps remain in both terminology and recognition of lung sounds among a wide population of Greek physicians. Less experienced physicians perform better on lung auscultation, indicating that continuing education with critical feedback should be offered.

### The analysis of lung sounds in infants and children with a history of wheezing/asthma using an automatic procedure [^1167MY2B]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

An early diagnosis and intervention are important for childhood asthma. High-pitched continuous sounds, such as wheezing, are considered indicators of bronchial constriction. Repeated wheezing is an important factor in diagnosing asthma. Clinically, the evaluation of bronchial hyperresponsiveness using bronchoconstrictors has been used as an objective method that leads to a definitive asthma diagnosis. However, the diagnosis of asthma in wheezy infants remains difficult for all physicians because infants and preschool children are unable to spontaneously perform common lung function tests.

In recent years, studies on airway condition using lung sound analysis, which is expected to be a safe, simple, and repeatable method, have been progressing. It has been reported that lung sounds are sensitive to changes in the airway condition and that lung sound analyses can be applied to the clinical evaluation of airway changes, even in infants and preschoolers. In addition, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have dramatically improved techniques for extracting information related to clinical diseases from lung sounds.

However, in conventional lung sound analysis systems, operations related to the analysis have not been automated. To analyze the lung sound spectrum, two or more experts visually determined the highest frequency in each spectrum or the zero point on the Y-axis of the spectrum. Although these previous methods also provide a certain degree of reproducibility from lung sound samples to the calculation of parameters, they remain complex and time-consuming.

### Deep learning diagnostic and severity-stratification for interstitial lung diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in digital lung auscultations and ultrasonography: Clinical protocol for an observational case-control study [^116m3WSX]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The clinical assessment of lung auscultation and lung ultrasound scans (LUS) involves reviewing data by external experts. They will interpret the information using standardized report forms to note the binary presence or absence of several anomalies. There will also be a text field for other notable routine findings in chest X-ray films, usually conducted in two incidences: posterior-anterior and lateral. Additionally, lung auscultation audio clips, representing 10 anatomic regions and lasting 30 seconds each, and LUS images, also covering 10 anatomic regions with 5-second video clips each, will be utilized.

The analysis will be blinded; the assessor will not have access to the linked clinical data or the associations between various imaging modalities. Identifiers will be scrambled between media sources, ensuring chest X-ray images are reviewed independently of the patient's LUS images, auscultation audio, clinical data, etc. These blinding and standardization procedures are expected to minimize performer and study management bias, ensuring objective interpretation.

### The teaching of chest auscultation during primary care training: Has anything changed in the 1990s [^1173XgGp]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

To survey the teaching time and importance given to cardiopulmonary auscultation during internal medicine (IM) and family practice (FP) residencies, and to compare practices to those of the early 1990s, a nationwide mail survey of IM and FP program directors (PDs) was conducted.

- **Setting**: All Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited IM and FP residencies participated.

A total of 538 of 939 PDs (57.5%) responded to the survey. In contrast to the early 1990s, when no significant difference in teaching practices existed between IM and FP programs, more IM residencies than FP residencies taught cardiopulmonary auscultation in 1999. Specifically, 48% of IM residencies and 29.2% of FP residencies taught cardiac auscultation, while 23.7% of IM residencies and 12.2% of FP residencies taught pulmonary auscultation [p < 0.001 for both comparisons].

Across the decade, there was a notable increase in the percentage of IM programs offering structured education in chest auscultation, with cardiac auscultation seeing an increase from 27.1% to 48% [p < 0.001] and pulmonary auscultation increasing from 14.1% to 23.7% [p < 0.02]. However, there were no significant changes for FP residencies. IM PDs placed more clinical importance on auscultation and expressed a greater desire for expanded teaching than FP program counterparts.

The study indicates a significant gain over the last decade in the percentage of IM residencies offering structured teaching of cardiopulmonary auscultation. This same gain did not occur for FP programs. Whether these differences in attitudes and teaching practices will translate into…

### Deep learning diagnostic and severity-stratification for interstitial lung diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in digital lung auscultations and ultrasonography: Clinical protocol for an observational case-control study [^115goMpG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

We will develop DeepBreath, a deep learning algorithm to detect the acoustic signatures of IPF, NSIP, and COPD from lung sounds. While several state-of-the-art approaches will be tested, the general framework is summarized below.

- **AI algorithms**: Digital lung auscultations will first be cleaned to crop non-biological frequencies and amplitudes generated by ambient noise not filtered by the stethoscope's active noise canceling. The sounds will then be divided into overlapping time windows of between 1 and 10 seconds and transformed to Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). Several data augmentation techniques will be explored, such as amplitude scaling, pitch shift, and random time shift. The effect of each pre-processing method will be tested, and the best performing approach according to sensitivity and specificity will be reported. This dataset will then be fed into various deep learning networks (such as convolutional neural networks, Long Short-Term Memory models [LSTM], Transformer architectures, etc). A prediction on each segment will then be aggregated to represent a patient (including all anatomic sites) and binary classification into positive versus negative for diagnostic results will be performed for ILD or control subjects, ILD or COPD, and (if ILD-positive) IPF or NSIP. The same prediction will also be made using LUS images.

- **Diagnostic and risk stratification algorithms**: Risk stratification will use multiclass or regression according to scales obtained from clinical interpretation of LUS, lung function tests, HRCT imagery, K-BILD or CAT, and SF-36 quality of life.

### Deep learning diagnostic and risk-stratification pattern detection for COVID-19 in digital lung auscultations: Clinical protocol for a case-control and prospective cohort study [^1171spbh]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Lung auscultation is fundamental to the clinical diagnosis of respiratory disease. However, auscultation is a subjective practice, and interpretations vary widely between users. The digitization of auscultation acquisition and interpretation is a particularly promising strategy for diagnosing and monitoring infectious diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), where automated analyses could help decentralize care and better inform decision-making in telemedicine. This protocol describes the standardized collection of lung auscultations in COVID-19 triage sites and a deep learning approach to diagnostic and prognostic modeling for future incorporation into an intelligent autonomous stethoscope benchmarked against human expert interpretation.

- **Methods**: A total of 1000 consecutive patients, aged ≥ 16 years and meeting COVID-19 testing criteria, will be recruited at screening sites and amongst inpatients of the internal medicine department at the Geneva University Hospitals, starting from October 2020. COVID-19 is diagnosed by RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab, and COVID-positive patients are followed up until outcome (i.e. discharge, hospitalization, intubation, and/or death). At inclusion, demographic and clinical data are collected, such as age, sex, medical history, and signs and symptoms of the episode. Additionally, lung auscultation will be recorded with a digital stethoscope at 6 thoracic sites in each patient. A deep learning algorithm (DeepBreath) using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and support vector machine classifier will be trained on collected data.

### The analysis of lung sounds in infants and children with a history of wheezing/asthma using an automatic procedure [^111bBvhb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Lung sound analysis parameters have been reported to be useful biomarkers for evaluating airway condition. We developed an automatic lung sound analysis software program for infants and children based on lung sound spectral curves of frequency and power by leveraging machine learning (ML) technology.

- **Methods**: To put this software program into clinical practice, in Study 1, the reliability and reproducibility of the software program using data from younger children were examined. In Study 2, the relationship between lung sound parameters and respiratory flow (L/s) was evaluated using data from older children. In Study 3, we conducted a survey using the ATS-DLD questionnaire to evaluate clinical usefulness. The survey focused on the history of wheezing and allergies among healthy 3-year-old infants, and then measured lung sounds. The clinical usefulness was evaluated by comparing the questionnaire results with the results of the new lung sound parameters.

- **Results**: In Studies 1 and 2, the parameters of the new software program demonstrated excellent reproducibility and reliability and were not affected by airflow (L/s). In Study 3, infants with a history of wheezing showed lower FAP 0 and RPF 75p (p < 0.001 and p = 0.025, respectively), and higher PAP 0 (p = 0.001) than healthy infants. Furthermore, infants with asthma/asthma-like bronchitis showed lower FAP 0 (p = 0.002) and higher PAP 0 (p = 0.001) than healthy infants.

- **Conclusions**: Lung sound parameters obtained using the ML algorithm were able to accurately assess the respiratory condition of infants.

### Deep learning algorithm for automated cardiac murmur detection via a digital stethoscope platform [^116Lks7f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The stethoscope is an iconic medical instrument nearly synonymous with Western medicine. It is easy to handle, inexpensive, and its use is universally accepted, even expected, as part of a physical examination. Yet, for the stethoscope to be a useful tool, it requires that the provider both hears and correctly interprets the diagnostic sounds of the patient. Although nearly all providers can perform the act of auscultation with minimal training, interpretation of the heart sounds is difficult, even for specialists. Interrater reliability in detecting a classic finding, the "murmur", is fair at best (κ = 0.3–0.48), and the ability to identify the underlying pathological feature is even worse. Moreover, these challenges are further exacerbated by a noisy and rushed environment, which is the norm in modern practice. Despite the paucity of data in this area, anecdotally, these conclusions ring true for a wide spectrum of medical providers. Because cardiac auscultation remains a cornerstone of the physical examination, diagnostic assistance of its interpretation could therefore be of great use.

### Identifying target audiences: who are the guidelines for? Article 1 in integrating and coordinating efforts in COPD guideline development. An official ATS/ERS workshop report [^112Cfyks]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Low credibility.

Professional societies, like many other organizations around the world, have recognized the need to use rigorous processes to ensure that health care recommendations are informed by the best available research evidence. Different clinical practice guidelines addressing the management of the same disease may vary widely in the evidence used and the format of the recommendations, with the result that not all are appropriate for all audiences. This is the first of a series of 14 articles that clinicians, methodologists, and researchers from around the world prepared to advise those developing guidelines in respiratory and other diseases about the potential impact of identifying the target audiences for their clinical practice guidelines.

- **Methods**: In this review, we address the following questions: (1) Which audiences are interested in a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) guideline? (2) How many audiences can be addressed in a single COPD guideline? (3) What is the purpose of the guidelines? (4) Who should be included on the guideline panel? We collected information by searching PubMed and reviewing information from groups that are currently making and using respiratory disease guidelines, as well as from workshop discussions. Our conclusions are based on available evidence, consideration of what guideline developers are doing, and the opinions of those who attended the workshop.

- **Results and conclusions**: Clinicians desire COPD and other guidelines that are concise, use evidence from practices similar to theirs, and whose authors have expertise in providing them.

### Deep learning diagnostic and severity-stratification for interstitial lung diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in digital lung auscultations and ultrasonography: Clinical protocol for an observational case-control study [^116XTw2D]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Each patient will provide 10 audio recordings of 30 seconds. Samples will be considered at the patient level with all 10 recordings. In deep learning, sample size calculation is an intractable problem that is usually discovered through empirical investigation. The number of samples required to reach a certain performance criterion depends on the characteristics of the dataset, the diversity and number of the classes, the degree of data augmentation possible, and the complexity of the learning algorithm. Thus, sample size calculations cannot rely on the traditional statistical heuristics often used in biostatistics.

Rather, sample size estimations in deep learning are mostly made by analogy. Evaluating existing knowledge on similar datasets, we find that the expected proportion of velcro-like crackles in interstitial idiopathic pneumonia (IIP) patients is nearly 100%, whereas the prevalence of coarse crackles is 71% in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. The exclusivity of these sounds among groups is unknown, but overlap is assumed to be minimal and pathological sounds are absent by definition in non-ILD and non-COPD control subjects.

Assuming similar discriminative power compared to previous work by our group (personal communication) to distinguish between normal and pathological lung sounds in pneumonia from 80 patients in balanced classes (40 pathological; 40 controls) with eight auscultation sites of 30 seconds each, we estimate using the same number of patients in each class to achieve convergence at above 80% of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).

### Does training respiratory physicians in clinical respiratory physiology and interpretation of pulmonary function tests improve core knowledge [^114gxXYM]. Thorax (2018). Low credibility.

Lung function tests play a major role in respiratory medicine. However, training in lung function tests varies within the European Union. In this study, we have demonstrated that an internship in a lung function tests laboratory significantly improved the technical and diagnostic skills of French respiratory trainees.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1133kK1g]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, particularly with respect to history and physical examination, the GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend eliciting a detailed medical history in patients with known or suspected COPD. The following aspects should be considered:

- **Exposures**: Smoking, occupational exposures, and environmental exposures (household or outdoor).

- **Past medical history**: Early life events such as prematurity, low birth weight, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and passive smoking exposure during infancy. Additionally, a history of asthma, allergy, sinusitis, or nasal polyps, respiratory infections in childhood, HIV, and tuberculosis should be noted.

- **Family history**: COPD and other chronic respiratory diseases.

- **Pattern of symptom development**: COPD typically develops in adult life. Most patients notice increased breathlessness, more frequent or prolonged "winter colds", and some social restrictions for several years before they seek medical assistance.

- **Exacerbations**: History of exacerbations or previous hospitalizations for a respiratory disorder.

- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, musculoskeletal disorders, anxiety and depression, and malignancies.

- **Impact on patient's life**: Limitation of activity, missed work, and economic impact, as well as the effect on wellbeing, family routines, and sexual activity, including feelings of depression or anxiety.

- **Social factors**: Availability of social and family support.

### Concordance in discriminating recordings of different lung sounds between physiotherapists [^1143BtZq]. Respiratory Care (2020). Low credibility.

Auscultation is a fundamental part of the physical examination, but its utility has been questioned due to the low inter-rater concordance. We therefore sought to evaluate the concordance of the discrimination of lung sound recordings between experienced physiotherapists.

- **Methods**: Lung sound recordings were selected and validated by an expert panel when Fleiss κ concordance was > 0.75. Eleven recordings were played for subject recognition using a portable computer in their workplace. Results were analyzed using Fleiss κ when looking for concordance between physiotherapists. Univariate regression was performed to determine if there was an association with clinical training, years of experience, academic accomplishment, or university affiliation.

- **Results**: Sixty-nine physiotherapists with a median of 4 years of working experience (interquartile range 2–6 years) completed the study. There was moderate concordance (κ = 0.562; 95% CI 0.462–0.605) for overall lung sound recording discrimination. For continuous and noncontinuous lung sound recordings, discrimination concordance was substantial (κ = 0.63 and κ = 0.76, respectively). A bivariate analysis revealed that years of experience presented an inverse association with stridor recognition.

- **Conclusions**: Concordance between physiotherapists in discriminating recorded lung sounds was moderate. The ability to recognize stridor was inversely associated with years of work experience.

### Trained standardized patients can train their peers to provide well-rated, cost-effective physical exam skills training to first-year medical students [^116F3nHp]. Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Teaching physical examination skills effectively, consistently, and cost-effectively is challenging, with faculty time being the most expensive resource. One solution is to train medical students using lay physical examination teaching associates. In this study, we investigated the feasibility, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness of training medical students using teaching associates trained by a lay expert instead of a clinician.

- **Methods**: We used teaching associates to instruct students about techniques of physical examination. We measured students' satisfaction with this teaching approach. We also monitored the financial cost of this approach compared to the previously used approach in which faculty physicians taught physical examination skills.

- **Results**: Our program proved practical to accomplish and acceptable to students. Students rated the program highly, and we saved approximately $9,100, compared with our previous faculty-intensive teaching program.

- **Conclusions**: We believe that our program is popular with students, cost-effective, and generalizable to other institutions.

### Reproducibility of dynamically represented acoustic lung images from healthy individuals [^1147GjTP]. Thorax (2008). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: Acoustic lung imaging was first envisaged over three decades ago. However, considerable hurdles needed to be overcome to enable the concept to become reality. Lung sounds must be accurately recorded, and extraneous sounds removed. The resulting sound information needs to be presented in a clinically meaningful manner. Furthermore, results must be accurate and reproducible.

The majority of acoustic research has focused on the detection and interpretation of adventitious sounds. A small number of studies have assessed temporal consistency in breath sound recording in healthy adults. In the largest of these studies, Sanchez and Vizcaya recorded frequency spectra of lung sounds in 10 normal adults on seven occasions over a year using contact sensors over the suprasternal notch and the right posterior lower chest wall. No significant spectral differences between the measurements obtained from each individual were found.

The study was designed to demonstrate that the algorithms employed by the VRIxp device and the method of displaying acoustic data as a dynamic image are capable of generating reproducible images. We showed that acoustic lung images obtained using the VRIxp are highly reproducible across recordings from the same individual made at different times, when measured both quantitatively and qualitatively. Quantitatively, the degree of reproducibility, as determined by ICC, was very good for both total lung and regional lung assessment (ICC 0.86 and 0.83, respectively). We demonstrated a similar degree of reproducibility when dynamic lung images were obtained.

### Deep learning algorithm for automated cardiac murmur detection via a digital stethoscope platform [^111FkYfe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Deep learning approaches have shown great promise in medicine, using radiologic studies and echocardiograms to develop interpretative algorithms. They can even translate auxiliary data, unintended to be part of the original data set, into useful information. Stethoscope sound analysis has recently led to applications in lung and heart sound classification. For example, an independently developed algorithm focused on the binary distinction between pathologic and normal heart sounds has tested favorably in a pediatric cohort.

The 2016 PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge inspired a wide range of solutions by curating the largest public data set of normal and abnormal heart sounds. However, deep learning approaches often require a large amount of ground truth labeled data. Most prior research, and the top-performing submissions for this challenge, used traditional machine learning or shallow neural networks requiring hand-engineered features and manual tuning. These approaches made assumptions about temporal and spectral characteristics of heart sounds, which potentially limit their generalizability to widespread clinical use.

A central contribution of the work is an algorithm that learns the important features directly from the raw audio instead of them being prescribed. Because cardiologists are traditionally trained to identify valvular heart disease (VHD) by auscultation, we hypothesized that a deep learning approach could perform similarly, if not better, than these specialty providers and assist in the diagnosis of VHD.

### Effect of body position on lung sounds in healthy young men [^116eAbHY]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

The effect of body position on the generation of abnormal respiratory sounds, such as snoring and stridor, is well recognized. However, postural effects on normal lung sounds have been studied in less detail. This lack of clarity needs to be addressed if respiratory acoustic measurements are to be used effectively in clinical practice.

- **Methods**: Lung sounds and airflow were recorded in six healthy male subjects. Two acoustic sensors were placed over corresponding sites of the right and left chest, first anteriorly and then on the back. Subjects were studied in various positions: sitting, supine, prone, and lateral decubitus. Lung sound intensity (LSI) was determined at flows of 0.4 to 0.6 L/s and 0.8 to 1.2 L/s within frequency bands of 150 to 300 Hz and 300 to 600 Hz.

- **Results**: LSI was greater over the dependent lungs in the lateral decubitus positions. In the sitting position, LSI was greater on the left compared with the right posterior lung at the same airflow within the same frequency bands. Compared with sitting, neither the supine nor prone positions caused a significant change in LSI.

- **Conclusions**: Our study confirms previously reported asymmetries of normal lung sounds. The insignificant change of flow-specific LSI between the upright and horizontal positions in healthy subjects is encouraging for the clinical use of respiratory acoustic measurements. Further studies should address postural effects on lung sounds in patients with acute lung injury and other lung pathologies.

### Multi-channel lung sounds intelligent diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115rBDZW]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, preventable, and treatable disease characterized by continuous airflow restriction. Airflow restriction develops progressively and is related to the increased chronic inflammatory response to toxic particles or gases in the airway and lungs. COPD has high morbidity and mortality worldwide and has become the fourth leading cause of death in China and the third leading cause of death globally. According to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), in 2020, the prevalence of COPD was 11.7%, with approximately 3 million deaths each year. As populations age in high-income countries and as smoking increases in developing countries, it is roughly estimated that by 2060, over 5.4 million people will die each year from COPD and related diseases.

- **Severity of COPD**: The severity of COPD is graded according to FEV1/FVC, FEV1%, and symptoms. FEV1 refers to the forced expiratory volume in one second, and FVC refers to the forced vital capacity. FEV1/FVC is a sensitive index to evaluate airflow limitation, and FEV1% is a good indicator to evaluate COPD severity. The severity of COPD is classified into five grades by GOLD:
	- Patients with COPD0 have FEV1% higher than 85%
	- COPD1 have FEV1% higher than 80%
	- COPD2 have FEV1% between 50% and 80%
	- COPD3 have FEV1% between 30% and 50%
	- COPD4 have FEV1% less than 30%, or less than 50% but suffer from chronic respiratory failure.
	- Additionally, FEV1/FVC is less than 70% in all patients except those with COPD0.

However, studies have shown that the association between patients' health status, symptoms, and FEV1 may not be as straightforward as originally thought.

### Deep learning diagnostic and severity-stratification for interstitial lung diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in digital lung auscultations and ultrasonography: clinical protocol for an observational case-control study [^1162GWmp]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Interstitial lung diseases (ILD), such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are severe, progressive pulmonary disorders with a poor prognosis. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is important to enable patients to receive appropriate care at the earliest possible stage to delay disease progression and prolong survival. Artificial intelligence-assisted lung auscultation and ultrasound (LUS) could constitute an alternative to conventional, subjective, operator-related methods for the accurate and earlier diagnosis of these diseases. This protocol describes the standardized collection of digitally acquired lung sounds and LUS images of adult outpatients with IPF, NSIP, or COPD and a deep learning diagnostic and severity-stratification approach.

- **Methods**: A total of 120 consecutive patients (≥ 18 years) meeting international criteria for IPF, NSIP, or COPD and 40 age-matched controls will be recruited in a Swiss pulmonology outpatient clinic, starting from August 2022. At inclusion, demographic and clinical data will be collected. Lung auscultation will be recorded with a digital stethoscope at 10 thoracic sites in each patient and LUS images using a standard point-of-care device will be acquired at the same sites. A deep learning algorithm (DeepBreath) using convolutional neural networks, long short-term memory models, and transformer architectures will be trained on these audio recordings and LUS images to derive an automated diagnostic tool.

### Teaching of pulmonary auscultation in pediatrics: a nationwide survey of all U.S. accredited residencies [^113VXk1Z]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2003). Low credibility.

Structured teaching of pulmonary auscultation is greatly underrepresented during internal medicine (IM) or family practice (FP) training. It is not known, however, whether this underrepresentation applies to the other major field of primary care, pediatrics. To answer this question, we surveyed all accredited U.S. residencies in pediatrics by mailing a one-page questionnaire to 174 pediatrics program directors and comparing results to those previously gathered from internal medicine and family practice residencies.

Pediatrics directors' response rate was 62%. More pediatrics than family practice residencies offered structured teaching of pulmonary auscultation (21.5% vs. 9.7%, P < 0.004). When compared to internal medicine programs, this difference showed a trend toward significance (21.5% for pediatrics and 14.1% for internal medicine, P = 0.08).

- **Teaching modalities**: Included lectures (91.2%); audiotapes (13%); seminars (8.3%); and miscellaneous (21.7%). University-affiliated residencies taught auscultation significantly more frequently than non-university-affiliated programs (25.4% vs. 10.5%, P = 0.07).

Pediatrics directors gave great importance to pulmonary auscultation and wished for more time devoted to its teaching (5.52 ± 0.84 and 5.01 ± 1.07, respectively, on a 1–6 scale, with 6 indicating the highest value). They also attributed great clinical importance to 13 commonly encountered pulmonary auscultatory events (all rated, on average, between 4–5.8 on a 1–6 scale, with 6 indicating highest importance).

In summary, training programs in pediatrics offered significant teaching resources for pulmonary auscultation.

### Automated lung sound analysis in patients with pneumonia [^111iY5t1]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

To determine whether objectively detected lung sounds were significantly different in patients with pneumonia compared to asymptomatic subjects, and to quantify the pneumonia findings for teaching purposes, a study was conducted at a community teaching hospital. We used a multi-channel lung sound analyzer to examine a learning sample of 50 patients diagnosed with pneumonia and 50 control subjects. Automated quantification and characterization of the lung sounds commonly recognized to be associated with pneumonia were used to generate an "acoustic pneumonia score". These were examined in the learning sample and then prospectively tested in 50 patients and 50 controls.

- **Results**: The acoustic pneumonia score averaged 13 in the learning sample and 11 in the test sample of pneumonia patients. The scores were 2 and 3 in the controls. The positive predictive value of a score higher than 6 was 0.94 in the learning sample and 0.87 in the test sample. The sensitivities in the two groups were 0.90 and 0.78, and the specificities were 0.94 and 0.88, respectively. Adventitious sounds were more common in pneumonia patients (inspiratory crackles 81% vs. 28%, expiratory crackles 65% vs. 9%, rhonchi 19% vs. 0%).

- **Conclusion**: Our lung sound analyzer found significant differences between lung sounds in patients with pneumonia and in asymptomatic controls. Computerized lung sound analysis can provide objective evidence supporting the diagnosis of pneumonia. We believe that the lung-sound data produced by our device will help to teach physical diagnosis.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^111jGieZ]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, specifically with respect to history and physical examination, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend evaluating and treating concomitant chronic diseases frequently occurring in patients with COPD. These include CVD, skeletal muscle dysfunction, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, depression, anxiety, and lung cancer. These conditions influence health status, hospitalizations, and mortality independently of the severity of airflow obstruction due to COPD.

### Lung sound analysis correlates to injury and recruitment as identified by computed tomography: an experimental study [^115PQAk9]. Intensive Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to assess how the analysis of the spectral characteristics of lung sounds can help in detecting lung injury and subsequent recruitment as verified by computed tomography (CT).

- **Methods**: Lung sounds were recorded at four locations (ventral and dorsal on the right and left side) in six ventilated pigs before and after unilateral oleic acid-induced lung injury during the sequential increase of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) from 0 to 20 cmH₂O. CT scans of the chest were used for comparison with lung aeration. Sound characteristics were compared by computer-aided analysis in the time and frequency domain as well as by clinicians.

- **Results**: The presence of lung injury and its location were detected by substantial acoustic spectral components above 500 Hz (frequency) and -70 dB (amplitude). Application of increasing PEEP gradually reduced the pathological components as CT analysis verified recruitment. At 20 cmH₂O PEEP, there was no further tidal recruitment of the injured lung, and the pathological sounds had disappeared, rendering the lung sounds of the injured lung similar to those of the control lung. This was mirrored by the clinicians' characterization of the sounds.

- **Conclusions**: Computer-aided analysis of lung sounds is suitable for detection of pathological lung sounds and may guide in the detection and recruitment of poorly/nonaerated lung.

### The coming era of a new auscultation system for analyzing respiratory sounds [^113QM4fA]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Many studies have been conducted in collaboration with doctors and machine learning experts, and it has become possible to discriminate lung sounds with a considerable level of accuracy. However, there is still a limitation that the analysis becomes less accurate when noises caused by the stethoscope itself, surrounding environment, other organ activities, and so on are mixed among the recorded sounds or when two or more breathing sounds are present at the same time. This should be resolved through additional research in the future.

### Deep learning diagnostic and risk-stratification pattern detection for COVID-19 in digital lung auscultations: Clinical protocol for a case-control and prospective cohort study [^114C5yWs]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Lung auscultation is fundamental to the clinical diagnosis of respiratory disease. However, auscultation is a subjective practice, and interpretations vary widely between users. The digitization of auscultation acquisition and interpretation is a particularly promising strategy for diagnosing and monitoring infectious diseases such as Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19), where automated analyses could help decentralize care and better inform decision-making in telemedicine. This protocol describes the standardized collection of lung auscultations in COVID-19 triage sites and a deep learning approach to diagnostic and prognostic modeling for future incorporation into an intelligent autonomous stethoscope benchmarked against human expert interpretation.

- **Methods**: A total of 1000 consecutive patients aged ≥ 16 years and meeting COVID-19 testing criteria will be recruited at screening sites and amongst inpatients of the internal medicine department at the Geneva University Hospitals, starting from October 2020. COVID-19 is diagnosed by RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab, and COVID-positive patients are followed up until outcome (i.e. discharge, hospitalization, intubation, and/or death). At inclusion, demographic and clinical data are collected, such as age, sex, medical history, and signs and symptoms of the episode. Additionally, lung auscultation will be recorded with a digital stethoscope at 6 thoracic sites in each patient. A deep learning algorithm (DeepBreath) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine classifier will be trained on…

### Deep learning algorithms to detect murmurs associated with structural heart disease [^111YN4V2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The success of cardiac auscultation varies widely among medical professionals, which can lead to missed treatments for structural heart disease. Applying machine learning to cardiac auscultation could address this problem; however, despite recent interest, few algorithms have been brought to clinical practice. We evaluated a novel suite of Food and Drug Administration-cleared algorithms trained via deep learning on over 15,000 heart sound recordings.

- **Methods and results**: We validated the algorithms on a data set of 2,375 recordings from 615 unique subjects. This data set was collected in real clinical environments using commercially available digital stethoscopes, annotated by board-certified cardiologists, and paired with echocardiograms as the gold standard. To model the algorithm in clinical practice, we compared its performance against 10 clinicians on a subset of the validation database. Our algorithm reliably detected structural murmurs with a sensitivity of 85.6% and specificity of 84.4%. When limiting the analysis to clearly audible murmurs in adults, performance improved to a sensitivity of 97.9% and specificity of 90.6%. The algorithm also reported timing within the cardiac cycle, differentiating between systolic and diastolic murmurs.

- **Conclusions**: Despite optimizing acoustics for the clinicians, the algorithm substantially outperformed the clinicians (average clinician accuracy, 77.9%; algorithm accuracy, 84.7%). The algorithms accurately identified murmurs associated with structural heart disease. Our results illustrate a marked contrast between the consistency of…

### Narrative review: Should teaching of the respiratory physical examination be restricted only to signs with proven reliability and validity [^112d9WXC]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

To review the reported reliability (reproducibility, inter-examiner agreement) and validity (sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios) of respiratory physical examination (PE) signs, and suggest an approach to teaching these signs to medical students, a review of the literature was conducted. We searched Paper Chase between 1966 and June 2009 to identify and evaluate published studies on the diagnostic accuracy of respiratory PE signs.

Most studies have reported low to fair reliability and sensitivity values; however, some studies have found high specificities for selected PE signs. None of the studies that we reviewed adhered to all of the STARD criteria for reporting diagnostic accuracy.

Possible flaws in study designs may have led to underestimates of the observed diagnostic accuracy of respiratory PE signs. The reported poor reliabilities may have been due to differences in the PE skills of the participating examiners, while the sensitivities may have been confounded by variations in the severity of the diseases of the participating patients.

Implications for practice and medical education: Pending the results of properly controlled studies, the reported poor reliability and sensitivity of most respiratory PE signs do not necessarily detract from their clinical utility. Therefore, we believe that a meticulously performed respiratory PE, which aims to explore a diagnostic hypothesis, as opposed to a PE that aims to detect a disease in an asymptomatic person, remains a cornerstone of clinical practice. We propose teaching the respiratory PE with a focus on exploring diagnostic hypotheses.

### The coming era of a new auscultation system for analyzing respiratory sounds [^114Qh7Jm]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Overall, studies have shown discrepancies in auscultation ability among doctors, particularly in the detailed classification of respiratory sounds. This suggests the potential for inaccurate diagnoses or incorrect treatments. To mitigate subjective interpretation and bridge the gap in auscultation capabilities between doctors, it would be beneficial to establish a system that can record and share auscultated sounds.

Another drawback of traditional auscultation is the limitation it poses for remote care. When doctors use a stethoscope, auscultation requires physical contact with the patient's body. Many patients with chronic diseases or limited mobility reside in nursing facilities or at home, often without a medical practitioner present. Additionally, there is an increasing demand for telemedicine among patients in hard-to-reach areas. However, it is challenging for doctors to examine these patients, making auscultation rarely feasible. If a stethoscope designed for easy use by non-specialists can be developed with data transmission technology, doctors would be able to assess patients' conditions remotely.

- **Deep-learning based analysis of respiratory sounds**: The development of a standardized system to accurately analyze respiratory sounds is necessary to overcome the subjectivity of human auscultation and the inconsistency in auscultation ability among doctors. Recently, machine learning-based AI techniques, particularly those utilizing deep learning networks, have been applied in various fields, including chest radiography and electroencephalography (EEG). These AI techniques enable us to obtain…

### Tracheal and lung sounds repeatability in normal adults [^11173jaR]. Respiratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Tracheal and lung sounds measurements for clinical applications depend on their intrasubject repeatability. Our objectives were to characterize tracheal and lung sounds and to investigate the temporal variability in normal adults. Tracheal sounds were studied in 7 subjects and lung sounds in 10 adults. Acoustic measurements were conducted on five occasions over a month for tracheal sounds and on seven occasions over a year for lung sounds. Sounds were recorded using contact sensors on the suprasternal notch and on the posterior right lower lobe. Subjects breathed through a pneumotachograph at flows of 0.9–1.1 l/s. Signals were low-pass filtered, amplified, and Fourier analysis was applied to sounds within a target flow range. We measured the frequencies below which 25% (F25), 50% (F median), 75% (F75), and 99% (SEF99) of the spectral power between 100 and 2000 Hz were found. There were no differences between the measurements obtained on different days when comparing each subject (P = ns, ANOVA). Our results show that the spectral pattern of tracheal and lung sounds is stable with low intrasubject variability.

### Objective structured clinical examination in basic thoracic ultrasound: A European study of validity evidence [^116A4EaM]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Basic thoracic ultrasound is a versatile and functional point-of-care ultrasound examination that may be useful in the diagnosis and management of a broad range of respiratory conditions, including pneumothorax, pleural effusion, cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, and pneumonia. A more comprehensive thoracic ultrasound examination can be performed by respiratory physicians, often requiring more time and experience but potentially providing information on lymph node status and pleural pathologies. Basic thoracic ultrasound can be used in several settings, for both adults and pediatric patients, with a high sensitivity and specificity of around 90%. However, as ultrasound findings are highly dependent on the skills of the operator, these high sensitivities and specificities may not be universal, although this has not been proven at the time of writing.

Previously, guidelines and recommendations for education and training in basic thoracic ultrasound have relied on an arbitrary number of ultrasound examinations that the trainee must perform or programs with a predefined duration of training. However, these approaches do not guarantee competence. Competence- and mastery learning-based education is likely the only way to ensure and reflect true competence. The principle of mastery learning is that all candidates can learn a skill; however, due to different learning paces, variations in training time, supervision, and guidance are required. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to assess competences using tests to ensure that the expected level is reached before proficiency is declared.

### Teaching cardiac auscultation using simulated heart sounds and small-group discussion [^117M5yNY]. Family Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Several educators have reported poor identification of abnormal cardiac sounds by primary care residents. Practice and review with cardiology patient simulators and prerecorded heart sounds have been shown to increase the accuracy of diagnosis by medical students and residents.

- **Methods**: The participants were 15 members of an urban family practice residency. The residents were presented with simulated heart sounds and were asked to identify them in a pretest and posttest. Between the tests, participants were invited to three separate teaching sessions that involved a discussion of cardiac auscultatory findings and a review of audiotaped similar heart sounds. Residents who were unable to attend the teaching sessions formed a control group.

- **Results**: The pretest identification rate was 36% for the heart sounds. This improved to 62% for all residents after the intervention. Higher rates of improvement were demonstrated by the residents who attended one or more teaching sessions, compared with the residents who attended no teaching sessions.

- **Conclusions**: Small-group discussion and repetitive auscultation of simulated heart sounds can improve the cardiac auscultatory proficiency of family practice residents.

### The analysis of lung sounds in infants and children with a history of wheezing/asthma using an automatic procedure [^113ufefs]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Lung sound analysis parameters have been reported to be useful biomarkers for evaluating airway condition. We developed an automatic lung sound analysis software program for infants and children based on lung sound spectral curves of frequency and power by leveraging machine learning (ML) technology.

- **Methods**: To put this software program into clinical practice:

	- **Study 1**: The reliability and reproducibility of the software program using data from younger children were examined.
	- **Study 2**: The relationship between lung sound parameters and respiratory flow (L/s) was evaluated using data from older children.
	- **Study 3**: We conducted a survey using the ATS-DLD questionnaire to evaluate clinical usefulness. The survey focused on the history of wheezing and allergies among healthy 3-year-old infants and then measured lung sounds. Clinical usefulness was evaluated by comparing the questionnaire results with the results of the new lung sound parameters.

- **Results**: In Studies 1 and 2, the parameters of the new software program demonstrated excellent reproducibility and reliability and were not affected by airflow (L/s). In Study 3, infants with a history of wheezing showed lower FAP 0 and RPF 75p (p < 0.001 and p = 0.025, respectively) and higher PAP 0 (p = 0.001) than healthy infants. Furthermore, infants with asthma/asthma-like bronchitis showed lower FAP 0 (p = 0.002) and higher PAP 0 (p = 0.001) than healthy infants.

- **Conclusions**: Lung sound parameters obtained using the ML algorithm were able to accurately assess the respiratory condition of infants.

### In defense of the stethoscope [^114K7BxH]. Respiratory Care (2008). Low credibility.

The stethoscope is widely considered to be an unreliable instrument. Many studies document significant observer variability in its use. Numerous other diagnostic tools are available that are generally regarded as providing more reliable diagnostic information. Some even argue that the teaching of this ancient art should be de-emphasized in medical schools. Yet, auscultation with an acoustic stethoscope can provide important, even life-saving, information.

The purpose of this article is to present evidence that supports the use of the stethoscope in clinical medicine. The argument for the stethoscope will be made by presenting relevant investigations, including clinical studies acknowledged to meet the criteria of evidence-based medicine. It will focus on studies that have employed computerized acoustic technology to correlate lung sounds with disease states. This technology has advanced in recent years, stimulating a resurgence of interest in auscultation.

Numerous studies have utilized objective methods that circumvent the problem of observer variability. There is now a good deal of scientific evidence to support the hypothesis that lung sounds contain clinically useful information. This technology also allows for the collection of this information more efficiently than was previously possible. Advances in educational technology have made it possible to impart information on auscultation much more easily than in the past. Contrary to predictions, the stethoscope is not likely to be relegated to the museum shelf in the near future.

### Reproducibility of dynamically represented acoustic lung images from healthy individuals [^113Z37T3]. Thorax (2008). Low credibility.

Qualitative assessments were conducted by six trained raters, comprising three pulmonologists and three radiologists, who analyzed representative dynamic images recorded during one complete breathing cycle from each of the 87 recordings available for assessment. The raters were blinded to subject identification, the time point at which the image was obtained, and the scores given by the other raters. Each image was scored according to several predefined features based on a preliminary study:

- **Dynamic appearance**: How the image changes over time.
- **Frame by frame image development**: The progression of the image in each frame.
- **Shape and area of maximum energy frame**: The single image equating to peak inspiration, focusing on its shape and area.
- **Overall image shape and spatial distribution of vibration energy**: The general structure and energy patterns of the image.
- **Overall impression of image**: The holistic assessment of the image.

These features were scored using categorical variables. To evaluate intra-rater reliability in the interpretation of recordings, 30 of the 87 images were randomly presented twice, resulting in a total of 117 dynamic images evaluated in the same order by each reader.
