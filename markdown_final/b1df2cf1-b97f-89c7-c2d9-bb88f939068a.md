## Question

Distant heart sounds

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "distant heart sounds", including their definition, pathophysiology, clinical significance, differential diagnosis, diagnostic approach, and management implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "distant heart sounds" mean in clinical practice. Then, I should verify the underlying mechanisms that make heart sounds muffled. Next, I will review the clinical contexts where this finding is most relevant, especially cardiac tamponade. After that, I need to check the diagnostic accuracy of bedside findings versus echocardiography. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise approach to evaluation and when to escalate to urgent intervention, making sure I anchor each step to guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misinterpret the term. "Distant heart sounds" refers to muffled, soft, or diminished intensity of the first and second heart sounds on auscultation, typically due to an insulating layer or mass effect that attenuates acoustic transmission from the heart to the chest wall, and it is a recognized component of Beck's triad in cardiac tamponade alongside hypotension and elevated jugular venous pressure [^9e3384c4] [^85d86728].

> I need to check the pathophysiology next. The most common mechanism is a large pericardial effusion that separates the heart from the chest wall and dampens conduction of heart sounds; other causes include obesity, emphysema, or mediastinal masses, but the classic and most clinically urgent association is with tamponade physiology where intrapericardial pressure rises and compresses the heart, impairing filling and output [^9e3384c4] [^85d86728].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about specificity. I should confirm the clinical significance. Distant heart sounds are most consequential when they occur in the context of suspected cardiac tamponade, where they form part of Beck's triad; however, I should double-check sensitivity because the triad is present in a minority of cases, so its absence does not exclude tamponade, and bedside findings alone are insufficient for diagnosis [^9e3384c4] [^e678cf85] [^594dce98].

> Next, I should review the differential so I don't anchor prematurely. Distant heart sounds can be seen with large pericardial effusions of any etiology (malignancy, idiopathic, autoimmune, infectious, postoperative, traumatic), but also with obesity, emphysema, and mediastinal pathology; importantly, in tamponade the rate of accumulation matters as much as the absolute volume, so acute effusions can cause hemodynamic compromise with smaller volumes, which explains why the triad may be incomplete early on [^9e3384c4] [^85d86728].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic performance of bedside findings versus imaging. Systematic review data show that while dyspnea, tachycardia, elevated JVP, and pulsus paradoxus are common in tamponade, none are sufficiently sensitive or specific to establish the diagnosis; echocardiography is the gold standard and can detect effusion, chamber collapse, and respirophasic flow variations that indicate hemodynamic compromise, and point-of-care ultrasound markedly improves detection even when clinical suspicion is low [^e678cf85] [^02754d51] [^594dce98].

> I will now examine a practical, stepwise approach. First, I should confirm the finding by ensuring optimal stethoscope placement, patient position, and quiet environment, and then correlate with vitals and JVP; if distant heart sounds are present with hypotension, tachycardia, elevated JVP, or dyspnea, I should immediately suspect tamponade and obtain urgent echocardiography, recognizing that a limited or focused study suffices to identify effusion and tamponade physiology when time is critical [^9e3384c4] [^6810ffee] [^e07e9a07].

> But wait, what if the patient is unstable and I need to act before a comprehensive echo? In that scenario, I should proceed with emergent pericardiocentesis guided by ultrasound, ideally with echo or fluoroscopy, because delays worsen outcomes; agitated saline can confirm needle position in the pericardial space, and surgical options are reserved for loculated effusions, purulent pericarditis, or failure of percutaneous drainage [^9e3384c4] [^334fd3fd].

> Let me reconsider the role of the physical examination so I don't overstate it. While distant heart sounds are a useful red flag, they are neither sensitive nor specific enough to rule in or out tamponade; thus, I should integrate them with the full clinical picture and rely on echocardiography for definitive diagnosis and procedural guidance, especially given the high stakes of missed tamponade [^e678cf85] [^594dce98].

> In summary, I should confirm that distant heart sounds reflect diminished intensity of S1/S2 and most urgently suggest a large pericardial effusion with possible tamponade; however, I need to ensure I do not rely on this single finding, and instead escalate promptly to bedside echocardiography and, if indicated, urgent pericardiocentesis, because timely recognition and intervention are lifesaving in tamponade [^9e3384c4] [^85d86728] [^e678cf85].

Distant heart sounds are a classic sign of **cardiac tamponade** [^9e3384c4], reflecting muffled S1/S2 due to pericardial fluid insulating the heart from the chest wall [^ea3cc8d3]. They are most often appreciated in the context of **Beck's triad** (hypotension, elevated JVP, distant heart sounds) [^85d86728], but this triad is present in only a minority of cases, so its absence does not exclude tamponade [^e678cf85]. Distant heart sounds are a **nonspecific finding** [^notfound] and can also occur with obesity, emphysema, or large pleural effusions; therefore, confirm with echocardiography [^e07e9a07] and manage emergently if tamponade is suspected [^9e3384c4].

---

## Pathophysiology

Distant heart sounds arise when **pericardial fluid** accumulates and separates the heart from the chest wall, attenuating acoustic transmission [^ea3cc8d3]. This insulation effect is most pronounced in cardiac tamponade, where rapid effusion compresses the heart and further dampens sounds [^9e3384c4].

---

## Clinical significance

Distant heart sounds are most clinically significant when associated with **cardiac tamponade**, where they form part of Beck's triad [^85d86728]. However, the triad is present in only about 10–40% of cases, so its absence does not exclude tamponade [^notfound]. Distant heart sounds are a **nonspecific finding** and can also occur with obesity, emphysema, or large pleural effusions [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic approach

When distant heart sounds are detected, the following **diagnostic approach** is recommended:

- **Confirm the finding**: Ensure proper stethoscope placement and patient positioning [^notfound].
- **Assess for tamponade**: Evaluate for hypotension, elevated JVP, and pulsus paradoxus [^e678cf85].
- **Echocardiography**: Perform urgent transthoracic echocardiography to confirm pericardial effusion and assess hemodynamic significance [^e07e9a07].
- **Additional imaging**: Consider chest X-ray, CT, or MRI if echocardiography is inconclusive or to identify underlying causes [^notfound].

---

## Management

If tamponade is confirmed, **immediate pericardiocentesis** is indicated to relieve compression and restore hemodynamic stability [^9e3384c4]. Supportive measures include oxygen, fluids, and close monitoring [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Subjectivity**: Auscultation is operator-dependent and influenced by patient factors (obesity, emphysema) [^notfound].
- **False negatives**: Distant heart sounds may be absent in early or low-volume effusions [^notfound].
- **False positives**: Distant heart sounds can occur without tamponade in chronic effusions or other conditions [^notfound].

---

Distant heart sounds are a **nonspecific but important** clinical finding, most concerning for cardiac tamponade when accompanied by hypotension and elevated JVP [^85d86728]. Confirm with echocardiography and manage emergently if tamponade is suspected [^e07e9a07].

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Physical examination — auscultated heart sound findings include third heart sound (S3), fourth heart sound (S4), rub, and heart murmur. Third heart sound (S3) is the presence of a third (mid-diastolic) heart sound and fourth heart sound (S4) is the presence of a fourth (late-diastolic) heart sound. A rub is an auscultated finding describing high or medium pitched and scratchy sound, generated by inflammation of the pericardial sac. A heart murmur is an auscultated finding describing a series of audible vibrations of varying intensity, frequency, quality, configuration, and duration created by turbulent blood flow in the heart or surrounding vessels. Each of these entries uses permissible values Yes, No, or Unknown.

### Initial field test of a cloud-based cardiac auscultation system to determine murmur etiology in rural China [^2b4aa135]. Pediatric Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

A system for collection, distribution, and long distant, asynchronous interpretation of cardiac auscultation has been developed and field-tested in rural China. We initiated a proof-of-concept test as a critical component of design of a system to allow rural physicians with little experience in evaluation of congenital heart disease (CHD) to obtain assistance in diagnosis and management of children with significant heart disease. The project tested the hypothesis that acceptable screening of heart murmurs could be accomplished using a digital stethoscope and internet cloud transmittal to deliver phonocardiograms to an experienced observer. Of the 7993 children who underwent school-based screening in the Menghai District of Yunnan Province, Peoples Republic of China, 149 had a murmur noted by a screener. They had digital heart sounds and phonocardiograms collected with the HeartLink tele auscultation system, and underwent echocardiography by a cardiology resident from the First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University. The digital phonocardiograms, stored on a cloud server, were later remotely reviewed by a board-certified American pediatric cardiologist. Fourteen of these subjects were found to have CHD confirmed by echocardiogram. Using the HeartLink system, the pediatric cardiologist identified 11 of the 14 subjects with pathological murmurs, and missed three subjects with atrial septal defects, which were incorrectly identified as venous hum or Still's murmur. In addition, ten subjects were recorded as having pathological murmurs, when no CHD was confirmed by echocardiography during the field study. The overall test accuracy was 91% with 78.5% sensitivity and 92.6% specificity. This proof-of-concept study demonstrated the feasibility of differentiating pathologic murmurs due to CHD from normal functional heart murmurs with the HeartLink system. This field study is an initial step to develop a cost-effective CHD screening strategy in low-resource settings with a shortage of trained medical professionals and pediatric heart programs.

### Cardiac tamponade [^9e3384c4]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2023). High credibility.

Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency caused by the progressive accumulation of pericardial fluid (effusion), blood, pus or air in the pericardium, compressing the heart chambers and leading to haemodynamic compromise, circulatory shock, cardiac arrest and death. Pericardial diseases of any aetiology as well as complications of interventional and surgical procedures or chest trauma can cause cardiac tamponade. Tamponade can be precipitated in patients with pericardial effusion by dehydration or exposure to certain medications, particularly vasodilators or intravenous diuretics. Key clinical findings in patients with cardiac tamponade are hypotension, increased jugular venous pressure and distant heart sounds (Beck triad). Dyspnoea can progress to orthopnoea (with no rales on lung auscultation) accompanied by weakness, fatigue, tachycardia and oliguria. In tamponade caused by acute pericarditis, the patient can experience fever and typical chest pain increasing on inspiration and radiating to the trapezius ridge. Generally, cardiac tamponade is a clinical diagnosis that can be confirmed using various imaging modalities, principally echocardiography. Cardiac tamponade is preferably resolved by echocardiography-guided pericardiocentesis. In patients who have recently undergone cardiac surgery and in those with neoplastic infiltration, effusive-constrictive pericarditis, or loculated effusions, fluoroscopic guidance can increase the feasibility and safety of the procedure. Surgical management is indicated in patients with aortic dissection, chest trauma, bleeding or purulent infection that cannot be controlled percutaneously. After pericardiocentesis or pericardiotomy, NSAIDs and colchicine can be considered to prevent recurrence and effusive-constrictive pericarditis.

### Technology for enhancing chest auscultation in clinical simulation [^3792a8d7]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

The ability to use an acoustic stethoscope to detect lung and/or heart sounds, and then to then communicate one's interpretation of those sounds is an essential skill for many medical professionals. Interpretation of lung and heart sounds, in the context of history and other examination findings, often aids the differential diagnosis. Bedside assessment of changing auscultation findings may also guide treatment. Learning lung and heart auscultation skills typically involves listening to pre-recorded normal and adventitious sounds, often followed by laboratory instruction to guide stethoscope placement, and finally correlating the sounds with the associated pathophysiology and pathology. Recently, medical simulation has become an important tool for teaching prior to clinical practice, and for evaluating bedside auscultation skills. When simulating cardiovascular or pulmonary problems, high-quality lung and heart sounds should be able to accurately corroborate other findings such as vital signs, arterial blood gas values, or imaging. Digital audio technology, the Internet, and high-fidelity simulators have increased opportunities for educators and learners. We review the application of these technologies and describe options for reproducing lung and heart sounds, as well as their advantages and potential limitations.

Methods to enhance clinical decision-making in telemedicine — sleep providers are encouraged to explore the resources available and, although not mandatory, may consider utilizing one or more of the following resources as needed/available. Patient presenters can facilitate the communication between the patient at the originating site and the provider at the distant site. Locally available providers may be utilized if clinically warranted, and sleep providers may consider hiring and developing their own local staff to support specific needs and serve as a local resource. Sleep providers may consider the use of questionnaires and self-care tools associated with diagnostic and treatment information, and information from these tools should be easily accessible to the provider. Detailed PAP download data may provide important insight, and methods to maximize physician access should be developed and encouraged, with clinical decisions based on PAP download data information being consistent with current standards of care. Use of peripheral devices and wearable technologies is described, including technologies such as electronic stethoscopes to auscultate heart and lung sounds. Sleep providers should consider using additional testing such as radiography, spirometry, electrocardiography and/or echocardiography, home oximetry, or other tests depending on specifics of the clinical situation.

### Deep learning algorithms to detect murmurs associated with structural heart disease [^44550cb2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Structural heart disease (SHD), encompassing both valvular and congenital heart disease, causes substantial morbidity and mortality around the globe. The prevalence of SHD grows as the world's population ages, especially with regard to calcific and degenerative valvular heart disease, meaning this burden only continues to increase. Ongoing advances in the treatment for SHD improve both lifespan and functional status, but only for those in whom the disease is identified.

Echocardiography remains the gold standard for diagnosis, because it is noninvasive and widely available in industrialized countries. However, it requires trained personnel and specialized equipment, which can make it expensive, inappropriate to use in the absence of suspected disease, and of health resource‐constrained environments. When present, clinically silent SHD portends a worse prognosis, suggesting that earlier detection of SHD could facilitate earlier treatment and ultimately improve patient outcomes. A detailed physical examination, including cardiac auscultation, is universally recommended in any clinical evaluation, where SHD is on the differential. Yet despite the ubiquity of the stethoscope in medical practice, heart sounds are difficult to reliably interpret, and perform poorly as a screening test for disease.,

To address these challenges, we and others have applied machine learning to the task of classifying heart sounds, particularly those that signify early SHD, such as murmurs. A variety of approaches have been entertained, including classical feature‐based machine learning, deep learning architectures such as 1‐ and 2‐dimensional convolutional neural networks, and the use of peak detection, autocorrelation, and state machines for heart sound segmentation. Two recent Computing in Cardiology challenges (2016 and 2022) focused on such tasks, illustrating the ongoing interest in the field. However, many previous data sets have been inconsistent in data collection protocols and definitions of ground truth, or contain only limited patient populations and disease categories, limiting the generalizability of the subsequent algorithms.

### The coming era of a new auscultation system for analyzing respiratory sounds [^414715d9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In this review, we will check the limitations of the existing auscultation method by checking the types of abnormal breathing sounds and the accuracy of analysis through the existing stethoscope. Next, we will introduce the new auscultation methods developed so far (AI-assisted analysis and wireless or attached stethoscopes) and the current status of breath sound analysis using them. Furthermore, we will suggest further research directions in the future.

Classification of abnormal respiratory sounds

Respiratory sounds are produced by the airflow in the respiratory tract and are divided into two categories: Normal or abnormal sound. Normal respiratory sound is made when there is no pulmonary disorder and consist of tracheal, bronchial, bronchovesicular, and vesicular sounds. Abnormal respiratory sounds are caused by diseases at the lung or bronchus. They can be described by the mechanism of production, location they are detected in, characteristics (such as continuity, range of pitch, timing mostly heard), and acoustic features (Table 1).

Table 1
Classification of abnormal lung sounds and related diseases

Crackles are short, discontinuous, explosive sounds heard during inspiration and sometimes on expiration. Fine crackles are generated by inspiratory opening of small airways and associated with interstitial pneumonia or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and congestive heart failure (CHF). Coarse crackles are produced by gas passing through intermittent airway opening and are related to secretory diseases such as chronic bronchitis and pneumonia.

Wheezes are generated in the narrowed or obstructed airway. They have high frequency (> 100–5000 Hz) and sinusoidal oscillation in sound analysis. They usually occur in obstructive airway diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Rhonchi are induced by the narrowing of airways, caused by the production of secretions, so rhonchi can disappear after coughing (Table 1).

Stridor is a high-pitched, continuous sound produced by turbulent airflow through a narrowed airway of upper respiratory tract. It is usually a sign of airway obstruction that requires prompt intervention. In patients with pleural inflammation such as pleurisy or pleural tumor, a visceral pleura becomes rough, and its friction with the parietal pleura generates crackling sounds, a friction rub (Table 1).

Although respiratory sounds are not difficult for a trained clinician to discern in usual cases, some sounds are ambiguous even for an expert to distinguish accurately. In addition, there are some cases where a mixture of several abnormal breathing sounds can be heard. Novel AI-assisted stethoscope can be useful for these challenging situations.

### Utility of store-and-forward pediatric telecardiology evaluation in distinguishing normal from pathologic pediatric heart sounds [^204e4515]. Clinical Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Because pediatric cardiologists can accurately diagnose innocent murmurs by physical exam alone, the authors developed a system for remote cardiac auscultation. They hypothesized that their system could accurately classify auscultatory findings as normal/innocent or pathologic. Patients undergoing evaluation underwent examination, echocardiography, and heart sound recording. Pediatric cardiologists evaluated the heart sounds and classified the case as either normal/innocent or pathologic. They reviewed103 heart sound data sets; 85% of the cases were accurately classified as either normal/innocent or pathologic, with a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 86%. However, when accounting for clinical diagnosis, reviewer uncertainty, and ECG abnormalities, the sensitivity and specificity improved to 91% and 88% (accuracy 89%), respectively. Degree of certainty with the telecardiology diagnosis correlated with correct interpretation (P < .005). Digital heart sound recordings evaluated via telemedicine can distinguish normal/innocent murmurs from pathologic ones. Such a system could improve the use of pediatric cardiology services.

### Lung ultrasound for the cardiologist [^26950b85]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

For a cardiologist, lung ultrasound is an add-on to transthoracic echocardiography, just as lung auscultation is part of a cardiac physical examination. A cardiac 3.5- to 5.0-MHz transducer is generally suitable because the small footprint makes it ideal for scanning intercostal spaces. The image quality is often adequate, and the lung acoustic window is always patent. The cumulative increase in imaging time is < 1 min for the 2 main applications targeted on pleural water (pleural effusion) and lung water (pulmonary congestion as multiple B-lines). In these settings, lung ultrasound outperforms the diagnostic accuracy of the chest radiograph, with a low-cost, portable, real-time, radiation-free method. A "wet lung" detected by lung ultrasound predicts impending acute heart failure decompensation and may trigger lung decongestion therapy. The doctors of tomorrow may still listen with a stethoscope to their patient's lung, but they will certainly be seeing it with ultrasound.

### Does this dyspneic patient in the emergency department have congestive heart failure? [^896d3544]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Dyspnea is a common complaint in the emergency department where physicians must accurately make a rapid diagnosis.

Objective

To assess the usefulness of history, symptoms, and signs along with routine diagnostic studies (chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP]) that differentiate heart failure from other causes of dyspnea in the emergency department.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE (1966-July 2005) and the reference lists from retrieved articles, previous reviews, and physical examination textbooks.

Study Selection

We retained 22 studies of various findings for diagnosing heart failure in adult patients presenting with dyspnea to the emergency department.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently abstracted data (sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios [LRs]) and assessed methodological quality.

Data Synthesis

Many features increased the probability of heart failure, with the best feature for each category being the presence of (1) past history of heart failure (positive LR = 5.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.1–8.0); (2) the symptom of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (positive LR = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5–4.5); (3) the sign of the third heart sound (S(3)) gallop (positive LR = 11; 95% CI, 4.9–25.0); (4) the chest radiograph showing pulmonary venous congestion (positive LR = 12.0; 95% CI, 6.8–21.0); and (5) electrocardiogram showing atrial fibrillation (positive LR = 3.8; 95% CI, 1.7–8.8). The features that best decreased the probability of heart failure were the absence of (1) past history of heart failure (negative LR = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.38–0.53); (2) the symptom of dyspnea on exertion (negative LR = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35–0.67); (3) rales (negative LR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.37–0.70); (4) the chest radiograph showing cardiomegaly (negative LR = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.23–0.48); and (5) any electrocardiogram abnormality (negative LR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.47–0.88). A low serum BNP proved to be the most useful test (serum B-type natriuretic peptide < 100 pg/mL; negative LR = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.07–0.16).

Conclusions

For dyspneic adult emergency department patients, a directed history, physical examination, chest radiograph, and electrocardiography should be performed. If the suspicion of heart failure remains, obtaining a serum BNP level may be helpful, especially for excluding heart failure.

### Unusual cause of pericardial effusion [^7042e517]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 65-year-old Egyptian lady suffering from non-alcoholic liver cirrhosis was referred to our unit for evaluation of a massive pericardial effusion. Few weeks before presentation, she suffered from progressive abdominal distention and dyspnoea. She denied fever, rigors or other cardiorespiratory symptoms. Examination revealed shrunken liver, spleenomegaly and ascites. Chest was clear to auscultation and heart sounds were distant. Chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly and clear lung fields. Abdominal ultrasound confirmed the results of abdominal examination. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a massive pericardial effusion (PEF) and rheumatic mitral stenosis. Chest tomography showed PEF and clear lung fields. One litre of exudate was removed via TTE-guided needle pericardiocentesis. A pericardio-peritoneal shunt was suspected, which was confirmed via a radioisotopic study. This case is among very few cases that reported PEF in a cirrhotic ascetic patient secondary to a radio-isotopically confirmed pericardio-peritoneal shunt in the literature.

### Assessing children's heart sounds at a distance with digital recordings [^d1b700f1]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to assess whether computer-stored digital sound recordings can be used to distinguish innocent from pathologic systolic murmurs.

Methods

Recordings of 55 children aged 1 month to 19 years were made remotely with the use of a digital stethoscope and were e-mailed to a computer in our center for later assessment. Eight-second recordings were made by a physician in 2 to 4 locations on the chest. Three cardiologists who were blinded to the diagnosis reviewed the recordings independently using stethophones to assess the splitting of the second heart sound and whether murmurs were innocent or pathologic. Diagnoses were confirmed with echocardiography.

Results

Seventeen children had innocent murmurs and 38 had pathologic murmurs. For the 3 cardiologists, sensitivity was 0.87 to 1.0, specificity was 0.82 to 0.88, negative predictive value was 0.75 to 1.0, and positive predictive value was 0.93 to 0.95. Assessment of splitting of second heart sound was highly accurate.

Conclusions

Digital recordings of children's heart sounds allow reliable differentiation between innocent and pathologic murmurs. Use of this technology may allow remote diagnosis of childhood murmurs and avoid the expense and stress of travel to pediatric cardiology centers for some children. Cardiologists who use recordings should assess their diagnostic accuracy before clinical application.

### International perception of lung sounds: a comparison of classification across some European borders [^0246e3a7]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lung auscultation is an old and well-known technique in clinical medicine. Adventitious lung sounds, such as wheezes and crackles, are helpful in the diagnosis of several lung and heart-related conditions. However, the diagnostic value of chest auscultation may be questioned due to variability in recognising lung sounds. In a scale from 0 to 1, a study by Spiteri et al found a kappa of κ = 0.41 for crackles and κ = 0.51 for wheezes when clinicians classified lung sounds. Similar results have been found in other studies. Lower agreement levels have also been found.

However, most of these agreement measures were based on clinicians sequentially listening to patients with a stethoscope. Clinicians working in the same hospital department have rated the sounds in these studies making the sample homogeneous and applicability of the results may be questioned. In addition, the use of such methods would be difficult to implement in large epidemiological studies due to logistical challenges. New methods are needed for clinical research in this area to generate evidence-based knowledge about the role that lung sounds have in a modern clinical setting.

Studies of interobserver agreement using lung sound recordings, rather than traditional auscultation, may be a good alternative. Recorded sounds may be presented with a visual display, and creating spectrograms of lung sounds is already an option in the software of electronic stethoscopes. Recording and visual display of lung sounds may be applied in large samples and classifications of the sounds may be repeated. However, we still do not know the reliability of such classifications.

The aim of the present study was to describe the interobserver agreement among an international sample of raters, including general practitioners (GP), pulmonologists and medical students, when classifying lung sounds in adults aged 40 years or older using audio recordings with display of spectrograms.

### A comprehensive nomogram integrating phonocardiogram and echocardiogram features for the diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^bd0709d0]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The basic diagnosis of HFpEF can be based on phenomena such as hemodynamic‐related congestion, myocardial stiffness, or elevated filling pressures, and the changes in the features of phonocardiogram (PCG) are a direct reflection of alterations in cardiac hemodynamics. Therefore, phonocardiography can overcome the limitations of human auditory perception in cardiac auscultation for HF screening, facilitating the identification of irregular patterns through visual examination and the extraction of objective features like amplitudes, frequencies, and time intervals in the heartbeat. Zheng et al. have shown the potential of PCG feature‐based least square support vector machine (LS‐SVM) for differentiating the patients with chronic HF from the healthy. Liu et al. He proposed an automated HFpEF diagnostic method using extreme learning machine (ELM) classifiers, employing the ratio of diastolic to systolic duration and multifractal features from PCG signals. The method demonstrated the effectiveness of heart sounds in HFpEF diagnosis. Luo et al. conducted an initial study to examine the correlation between PCG features derived from acoustic cardiography and early mitral inflow velocity and early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E/e ′) obtained from echocardiography in patients with suspected HFpEF. The study showed that the PCG feature, the interval from QRS onset to the first heart sound (QS1), can categorize E / e ′ in symptomatic patients suspected of HFpEF with a diagnostic performance comparable to that of NT‐proBNP. Considering that PCG is also advantageous due to its ease of collection, non‐invasiveness, low cost, and potential for remote monitoring, it is expected to provide supplementary information for the auxiliary diagnosis of HFpEF.

### Fine crackles on chest auscultation in the early diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a prospective cohort study [^8b94fd49]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Electronic/digital analyses of lung sounds are a promising diagnostic tool in the identification of ILD. A study reported that the digital analyses of lung sounds had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 77% in identifying 'velcro crackles' in a small sample of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ILD, while others found them useful to predict the presence of reticulation and honeycombing on HRCT in patients with fibrotic lung diseasesand even to differentiate crackles due to IPF from crackles due to congestive heart failure and pneumonia. However, digital analyses of lung sounds require further validation before they can be incorporated in routine clinical practice for the diagnosis of ILD.

The present study has a number of limitations: the clinicians performing chest auscultation were medical residents, respirology fellows, ILD fellows and an attending respirologist; however, we did not include primary care physicians; therefore, the findings may not apply to them.

Clinicians participating in the study were asked to perform the chest auscultation as they normally do during their clinical assessments, using their own stethoscopes, and to report 'fine crackles' if they sounded either like 'velcro' or like the sound produced by 'rubbing your hair between your fingers'. Lack of standardisation of a diagnostic test could decrease the internal validity of the results; despite this, in the present study, clinicians reported the presence of fine crackles in > 90% of patients regardless of their level of training or experience. Similarly, almost 90% of patients who had fine crackles on the initial clinic visit also had them at the subsequent visit, even though half of clinicians were different, supporting the external validity of our results. Our study was performed in a single centre in Canada, which could limit the generalisability of the results, but the clinicians participating in our study were trained in different medical schools in North America, Europe and the Middle East, which would also increase the external validity of our results.

Immediate post-implant assessment — post–cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) patients should be clinically evaluated for complications and lead stability, with attention to cardiopulmonary findings and the device pocket. Assessment after CRT implantation should include examination of vital signs and auscultation for pneumothorax, haemothorax, pericardial effusion, or heart failure worsening, and overnight observation may help assure lead stability and detect pocket haematoma.

### Artificial intelligence in congenital heart disease: current state and prospects [^5fd9371b]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Postnatal CHD screening

Initial screening in infants for CHD consists of a combination of cardiac auscultation, pulse oximetry, chest radiography, and electrocardiography. A computer-assisted auscultation software program allows the user to store and transmit heart sounds to dedicated platforms for AI-assisted analysis of murmurs. Gharehbaghi et aldescribed using combined support vector machine and hidden Markov models — supervised learning models used for classification — to identify innocent heart murmurs from a bicuspid aortic valve with an accuracy of 86.4%, better than pediatric cardiologists using conventional auscultation (Table 1). This software has not been accepted for clinical use because it was limited by small numbers and lack of widespread clinical deployment. Furthermore, it was also unclear how the data were split between training and testing data sets. A subsequent study by Gharehbaghi et alused a time growing neural network (a type of DL) to differentiate normal heart sounds from systolic murmurs from septal defects or valvular regurgitations. The study population was small, and the test data sets were not used to test the suitability of this methodology as a general clinical tool in the community. Gomez-Quintana et alused ML on neonatal phonocardiograms to determine the probability of patent ductus arteriosus or CHD in 265 newborns within the first 6 days of life (Table 1). The heart sounds were preprocessed and segmented, then followed by feature extraction. The features were fed into a boosted decision tree classifier to estimate the probability of patent ductus arteriosus or CHD from normal heart sounds. Finally, the patients were prioritized into the decision of getting echocardiograms to confirm the diagnosis. This study was the first to identify patent ductus arteriosus using a designed ML-based method and contrast it with an experienced neonatologist's auscultation skills as well as the gold standard of echocardiogram. The model area under the curve was 0.77 for the detection of patent ductus arteriosus. The authors suggested integrating pulse oximetry to the ML algorithms could improve their framework of a more comprehensive assessment of the performance of AI-augmented decision-making as a clinical decision support tool; however, there has yet to be wide uptake in clinical practice. Smart stethoscopes have been developed to help with clinical auscultation for detecting CHD heart sounds in remote areas where resources and pediatric cardiology expertise are limited. Quickly identifying abnormal heart sounds may help triage these patients with appropriate referral for CHD management.DL has been applied to chest radiographs of CHD patients to aid in the prediction of pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio (Table 1).DL has also been applied to electrocardiogram (EKG) readings to detect atrial septal defects. This DL algorithm that comprised CNN and long short-term memory models may be applicable to other CHD lesions to further aid EKG-based AI diagnostics for the pediatric population.

### Critical pitfall: another cause of wheezing [^f10e9878]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Description

An 87-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with progressive dyspnoea on effort over the previous 2 weeks. She had been treated for rheumatoid arthritis with oral prednisolone (5 mg/day) and tacrolimus (2 mg/day). At her first visit, vital signs and physical examination were normal except for slight rhonchi in anterior lung fields. Chest radiograph showed slight cardiomegaly, but no abnormal lesions were noted in either lung (figure 1A). Echocardiography demonstrated no evidence of congestive heart failure. She was thus diagnosed with cough variant asthma and/or asthma, and treated with inhaled budesonide (400 µg/day). However, 10 days later, she returned to our hospital because of increasing dyspnoea. She had tachypnoea (30 breaths/min), and intermittent wheezes emerged in both the cervical (online supplementary audio 1) and left tracheobronchial areas. Additionally, the left bronchovesicular sound (online supplementary audio 2) apparently decreased than that of right tracheobronchial area (online supplementary audio 3).

Figure 1
Chest radiograph taken at the first visit appeared normal except for slight cardiomegaly (A). Thoracic CT demonstrated that the mediastinal tumour compressed the left main bronchus, which partially invaded the bronchial lumen (B, C).

On the same day, thoracic CT revealed a mediastinal tumour (figure 1B, C) that compressed and/or partially invaded the left tracheal lumen, thereby generating the intermittent wheezes that radiated to the cervical area.

This case reminds us of the critical pitfalls for wheezing resembling asthmaand the power of careful auscultation for appropriate diagnosis.

Learning points

General physicians should always be aware of the possibility of tracheal/bronchial stenosis due to malignant neoplasms whenever they encounter patients who wheeze.
Auscultation can be changeable over a short interval of time, but careful auscultation should be performed for appropriate diagnosis.
The intensity of tracheobronchial sound from bilateral lung fields should be compared in patients with respiratory symptoms.

### Association between phonocardiographic third and fourth heart sounds and objective measures of left ventricular function… [^1cddd270]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

a confidence score between 0 and 1. 0 for each heart sound based on the intensity, persistence, and frequency content, with a value of at least
0. 5 indicating the presence of a diastolic heart sound. Data are presented as mean values and standard deviations for normally distributed continuous variables. Because BNP was highly right-skewed, this. patients with either diastolic sound detected by computerized phonocardiographic heart sound analysis did have significantly higher LVEDP and BNP levels and lower LVEF measurements compared with those without a diastolic heart sound, overall diagnostic accuracy was modest, as evidenced by low AUROCs. The low sensitivities and AUROCs we observed indicate that diastolic heart sounds. are not high-quality diagnostic tests for left ventricular dysfunction.

Finally, the specificities of each sound to detect abnormalities in the objective markers of left ventricular function were consistently high, with the S3 proving to be superior to the S4 in separating patients based on abnormal left ventricular hemodynamics. The auscultated third and fourth heart sounds. are known to be associated with abnormal left ventricular hemodynamics. 4, 18, 19 An auscultated gallop sound has been shown to be associated with a worse prognosis in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, 20, 21 in those with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, 6 and in those with overt heart failure. 6, 7. The test characteristics of any diastolic heart sound showed an increase in sensitivity but a reduction in specificity compared with using either heart sound alone. The test characteristics of the phonocardiogram may vary depending on the cutoff used to designate a positive S3 or S4. Our.

particular phonocardiogram was an audioelectrocardiographic tracing that created a computer-generated confidence score for each heart sound between 0 and 1. 0; a value of at least
0. 50 was prospectively specified as indicative of a diastolic heart sound. As demonstrated by the AUROCs, this cutoff generally yielded the highest accuracy. Reducing the cutoff to 0. 25 or higher, which likely includes the detection of some sounds not audible to the human ear, provided somewhat higher sensitivities for the presence of elevated LVEDP (54% for the S3 and 56% for.

### Chylopericardium following esophagectomy: a case report and systematic review [^ea3cc8d3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The signs and symptoms of chylopericardium depend on the length of time over which pericardial fluid accumulates. Chronic leakage of chyle is usually associated with systemic illnesses, such as malnutrition, metabolic derangements, and immunologic incompetence. However, acute leakage of chyle can lead to rapid pericardial fluid accumulation and increasing intrapericardial pressures, resulting in cardiac tamponade. This condition can be clinically manifested as Beck's triad, which is composed of hypotension, distended neck veins, and distant heart sounds. These symptoms arise from decreased cardiac output due to impaired ventricular filling, augmented pressure during diastole that prevents blood from returning to the right atrium from the body circulation, and the insulating effect of the pericardial fluid, respectively. It is worth noting that 3 out of the 4 reported cases, in addition to our case, developed pericardial tamponade post-surgery. These patients deteriorated rapidly and urgent interventions were warranted. Therefore, the insidious disease onset and rapid clinical progression may represent clinical characteristics of chylopericardium in the setting of post-esophagectomy.

Physical examination in patients with chest pain — key findings include the following: For aortic dissection, extremity pulse differential (30% of patients, type A), the combination of severe pain, abrupt onset + pulse differential + widened mediastinum on CXR confers ≥ 80% probability of dissection, the frequency of syncope > 10%, and AR occurs in 40%–75% (type A). Esophageal rupture may present with emesis, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax (20% patients), unilateral decreased or absent breath sounds. Specific clues can be helpful, and chest tenderness on palpation or pain with inspiration markedly reduce the probability of ACS.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^876e4e57]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Other qualities of dyspnea and overall perception — sensations of effort, tightness, and air hunger are more reliably characterized than others, and the mechanisms above do not adequately explain dyspnea from vascular problems such as congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension; pulmonary vascular receptors (J-receptors?) may play a role, but only suggestive evidence is available. Multiple distinguishable sensations seldom occur in isolation, and multiple uncomfortable sensations are often present and together produce the overall perception of dyspnea; even specific laboratory stimuli generally stimulate more than one afferent pathway. Assessment with magnitude scales may be more sensitive than binary choices, though reports of dyspnea are not as consistent as reports of colors or sounds.

### Phono-spectrographic analysis of heart murmur in children [^62f5875c]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Slight tricuspid leakage is a harmless finding. Mitral valve leakage and bicuspic aortic valve should be recognized because they require endocarditis prophylaxis. The patient with mitral leakage was a fearful retarded boy, and the recorded signal was weak in amplitude, which is why the highest frequencies were missed in the analysis, but the murmur was sustained until the beginning of the second heart sound, implying a pathological finding. The murmurs due to a bicuspic aortic valve without stenosis or with slight stenosis did not differ from the hyperkinetic aortic ejection murmur. The murmur of the patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy resembled vibratory innocent murmur. The difference between these murmurs was hardly seen in the spectrogram. Typically, the frequency of vibratory innocent murmur decreases within the systolic interval, while in this case of hypertropic cardiomyopathy it remained constant. The ECG finding was pathological, and the diagnosis was known beforehand. This particular murmur was rather loud, 31% in spectral analysis and 3/6 estimated clinically. However, 10 (20%) of vibratory murmurs were equal to or louder than 30% measured from phonogram.

As the examples show, the method did not recognize hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or mild aortic valve malformation and failed with the mitral leakage, because the recording was suboptimal. We recommend an echocardiography, when the vibratory or aortic ejection murmur is repeatedly found in adolescent age or when the recording is suboptimal. Naturally, young babies need always an echocardiography, because their pulmonary pressure may still be high and the results of heart sound analysis can be misleading.

Modern electronic stethoscopes are suitable for heart sound recording. Visual presentation of the auscultation finding provides an opportunity to study more objectively and quantitatively the timing, quality (frequency contents) and intensity of different heart sound and murmur components and helps us to understand and learn about the hemodynamics of the heart and the origin of cardiac murmurs.

Computer analysis is a powerful tool in teaching an unexperienced listener the art of auscultation. Furthermore, we believe that computer analysis can be a promising new diagnostic method that has a potential to reduce medical costs by eliminating unnecessary referrals, visits to specialists and echocardiograms, especially when the systolic murmur is weak. Recording of auscultation findings also makes teleconsultations possible and gives an opportunity to save cardiac or respiratory sounds, phonograms and spectrograms in electronic patient documents.

### Recurrent pericarditis and paradigm shift in cardiovascular imaging and targeted therapeutics [^6bd1d11a]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical diagnosis and multimodality imaging

The diagnostic criteria for recurrent pericarditis are similar those of acute pericarditis. It requires the initial pericardial attack and 2 out of the following 4 features: pleuritic chest pain worse with inspiration and when supine, electrocardiogram changes including ST-segment elevation or PR segment depression, a pericardial friction rub on auscultation or a new or worsening pericardial effusion. Recurrent pericarditis is further defined as having a relapse of symptoms following a symptom-free period of 4 to 6 weeks or longer after the initial episode of pericarditis. Patients with a known history of recurrent pericarditis on multiple anti-inflammatories may have some of these features masked. Hence, supportive findings such as elevated inflammatory markers (eg, high-sensitivity CRP) or imaging evidence of pericardial inflammation on CMR aid in the diagnosis. Incessant pericarditis is defined as persistent symptoms without a symptom-free period and is considered more aggressive than recurrent pericarditis.

### Heart murmurs in children: evaluation and management [^dd24d35d]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Up to 8.6% of infants and 80% of children have a heart murmur during their early years of life. The presence of a murmur can indicate conditions ranging from no discernable pathology to acquired or congenital heart disease. In infants with a murmur, physicians should review the obstetric and family histories to detect the possibility of congenital heart pathologies. Evaluation by a pediatric cardiologist is indicated for newborns with a murmur because studies show that neonatal murmurs have higher rates of pathology than in older children, and neonatal murmur characteristics are more difficult to evaluate during examination; referral is preferred over echocardiography. All infants, with or without a murmur, should have pulse oximetry screening to detect underlying critical congenital heart disease. In older children, most murmurs are innocent and can be followed with serial examinations if there are no findings of concern. Findings in older children that warrant referral include diastolic murmurs, loud or harsh-sounding murmurs, holosystolic murmurs, murmurs that radiate to the back or neck, or signs or symptoms of cardiac disease. Referral to a pediatric cardiologist is indicated when a pathologic murmur is suspected. Electrocardiography, chest radiography, and other tests should not be reflexively performed as part of all murmur evaluations because these tests can misclassify a murmur as innocent or pathologic, and they are not cost-effective. Emerging technologies include phonocardiography interpretation of murmurs and artificial intelligence algorithms for differentiating innocent from pathologic murmurs.

### Mitral stenosis [^82af923b]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Description

A previously healthy 29-year-old Mexican woman presented to an emergency department with transient hemiparaesthesias and dysarthria. There was no evidence of stroke on cross-sectional imaging of the head, and she was discharged without a clear diagnosis. Two days later, she returned with acute abdominal pain. Abdominal imaging revealed complete occlusion of the right renal artery, prompting emergency embolectomy. Following the procedure, she developed acute haemoptysis, dyspnoea and hypoxaemia. Chest imaging demonstrated evidence of pulmonary venous hypertension. Cardiac auscultation revealed an opening snap followed by a diastolic murmur with presystolic accentuation. These sounds were better appreciated in combination with phonocardiography, a technique supplanted by echocardiography in the 1970sthat visualised heart sounds (video 1). An echocardiogram confirmed the presence of mitral stenosis (MS), unifying the syndrome of embolic phenomena, haemoptysis and pulmonary hypertension. She underwent successful mitral valve replacement and has since returned to normal activities.

Video 1
Audio of the heart sounds combined with phonocardiography (top phonocardiogram from a contemporary electronic stethoscope, bottom from a mid-20th century antique phonocardiograph), recorded over the apex of the heart demonstrating: (1) an abrupt, high amplitude S1, (2) an opening snap, (3) the low rumbling diastolic murmur of MS and (4) presystolic accentuation of the murmur.

Despite the advances in developed countries, rheumatic heart disease remains the most common cause of MS worldwide. Early manifestations include dyspnoea and fatigue, but occasionally embolic phenomena are part of the initial presentation. Definitive diagnosis can be made with echocardiography, but careful cardiac auscultation remains an important step in the diagnostic pathway when any of the following four signs are present: (1) pronounced S1, (2) early diastolic opening snap, (3) rumbling diastolic murmur at the apex using the bell and (4) presystolic accentuation of the murmur. In this case, phonocardiography was used to facilitate recognition of these signs.

Learning points

Mitral stenosis due to rheumatic heart disease can present with embolic phenomena even in the absence of underlying atrial fibrillation.
Diastolic murmurs can be difficult to detect, but in the adult population carry a relatively narrow differential diagnosis of primarily aortic insufficiency and mitral stenosis.
Phonocardiography remains useful today as a learning tool to aid in the appreciation of heart sounds.

### Acute pericarditis [^945594c2]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Although acute pericarditis is most often associated with viral infection, it may also be caused by many diseases, drugs, invasive cardiothoracic procedures, and chest trauma. Diagnosing acute pericarditis is often a process of exclusion. A history of abrupt-onset chest pain, the presence of a pericardial friction rub, and changes on electrocardiography suggest acute pericarditis, as do PR-segment depression and upwardly concave ST-segment elevation. Although highly specific for pericarditis, the pericardial friction rub is often absent or transient. Auscultation during end expiration with the patient sitting up and leaning forward increases the likelihood of observing this physical finding. Echocardiography is recommended for most patients to confirm the diagnosis and to exclude tamponade. Outpatient management of select patients with acute pericarditis is an option. Complications may include pericardial effusion with tamponade, recurrence, and chronic constrictive pericarditis. Use of colchicine as an adjunct to conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy for acute viral pericarditis may hasten symptom resolution and reduce recurrences.

### When your patient clicks: a loud clicking sound as a key sign to the diagnosis [^c8c9eee7]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 19-year-old male patient was referred by his general practitioner with a new 'cardiac murmur'. For 1week, he had been able to provoke a clicking sound, which was in time with his heart beat and originated from his chest. The physical examination and laboratory tests were normal. The sound was initially interpreted as most likely due to a valve condition such as mitral valve prolapse, but a transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. A cardiac CT was obtained, which showed left-sided ventral pneumothorax. The Hamman's sign is a loud precordial pulse synchronous sound, which is often postural. It is pathognomonic for left-sided pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Hamman's sign as a presenting symptom is rare, but if present is key to diagnosis. The awareness of rare clinical findings is important and will prevent unnecessary diagnostic tests.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Physical examination findings in patients with chest pain — syndrome-specific clues: Acute coronary syndrome may present with diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, crackles, S3, and an MR murmur, and examination may be normal in uncomplicated cases. Pulmonary embolism can include pain with inspiration. Aortic dissection features severe pain with abrupt onset with pulse differential and a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray. Esophageal rupture may present with emesis, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, and unilateral decreased or absent breath sounds. Pericarditis can show fever, pleuritic chest pain increased in the supine position, and a friction rub. Myocarditis may include fever, chest pain, heart failure, and S3. Pneumothorax may present with dyspnea and pain on inspiration with unilateral absence of breath sounds. Costochondritis presents with tenderness of costochondral joints. Herpes zoster presents with pain in a dermatomal distribution, triggered by touch, with a characteristic unilateral dermatomal rash. Chest tenderness on palpation or pain with inspiration markedly reduce the probability of ACS.

### Does this patient have a pleural effusion? [^799533d0]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Context

Pleural effusion is a common finding among patients presenting with respiratory symptoms. The value of the bedside examination to detect pleural effusion is unclear.

Objective

To systematically review the evidence regarding the accuracy of the physical examination in assessing the probability of a pleural effusion.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE (1950-October 2008) and EMBASE (1980-October 2008) using Ovid to identify English-language studies conducted in a clinical setting. Additional studies were identified by searching the bibliographies of retrieved articles and contacting experts in the field.

Study Selection

We included prospective studies of diagnostic accuracy that compared at least 1 physical examination maneuver with radiographic confirmation of pleural effusion.

Data Extraction

Three authors independently appraised study quality and extracted relevant data. Data regarding participant recruitment, reference standard, diagnostic test(s), and test accuracy were extracted. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Data Synthesis

We identified 310 unique citations, but only 5 prospectively conducted studies met inclusion criteria (N = 934 patients). A random-effects model was used for quantitative synthesis. Of the 8 physical examination maneuvers evaluated in the included studies (conventional percussion, auscultatory percussion, breath sounds, chest expansion, tactile vocal fremitus, vocal resonance, crackles, and pleural friction rub), dullness to conventional percussion was most accurate for diagnosing pleural effusion (summary positive likelihood ratio, 8.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.2–33.8), while the absence of reduced tactile vocal fremitus made pleural effusion less likely (negative likelihood ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.12–0.37).

Conclusions

Based on the limited number of studies, dullness to percussion and tactile fremitus are the most useful findings for pleural effusion. Dull chest percussion makes the probability of a pleural effusion much more likely but requires a chest radiograph to confirm the diagnosis. When the pretest probability of pleural effusion is low, the absence of reduced tactile vocal fremitus makes pleural effusion less likely so that a chest radiograph might not be necessary depending on the overall clinical situation.

### Universal definition and classification of heart failure: a report of the Heart Failure Society of America, heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Japanese heart failure society and writing committee of the universal definition of heart failure [^d855c5a2]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

Universal definition of heart failure (HF) — common symptoms and signs are enumerated and an objective marker is proposed to complement symptom-based diagnosis. Common symptoms and signs of HF are listed in Table 6, with typical symptoms including breathlessness, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, fatigue (tiredness with increased time to recover after exercise), and ankle swelling; less typical symptoms include nocturnal cough, wheezing, bloated feeling, postprandial satiety, loss of appetite, decline in cognitive function or confusion (especially in the elderly), depression, and dizziness or syncope. Signs more specific for HF include elevated jugular venous pressure, third heart sound, summation gallop with third and fourth heart sounds, cardiomegaly with a laterally displaced apical impulse, hepatojugular reflux, and Cheyne Stokes respiration in advanced HF, whereas less specific signs include peripheral edema, pulmonary rales, unintentional weight gain (> 2 kg/week), weight loss in advanced HF with muscle wasting and cachexia, cardiac murmur, reduced air entry and dullness to percussion at lung bases suggestive of pleural effusion, tachycardia or irregular pulse, tachypnea, hepatomegaly/ascites, cold extremities, oliguria, and narrow pulse pressure. The current ACCF/AHA Classification of HF includes 2 presymptomatic stages, A and B; although the definition of the syndrome of HF is restricted to being a symptomatic clinical condition, a new categorization of Stages A and B into "at risk" and "pre-HF" is proposed. To strengthen diagnostic consistency, the incorporation of an objective measurement in addition to the symptoms in the HF definition is proposed.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the acute care setting: best practice [^7eeeb390]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular Morbidities

Cardiovascular morbidities are frequently present in patients experiencing ECOPDs, and thus a patient history is important to assess their presence or impact. Chest pain/discomfort, fluid retention, or irregular pulse suggest a cardiovascular cause as an alternative or contributing diagnosis to an ECOPD.

Acute HF

Acute HF is defined by worsening of dyspnea at rest (particularly while supine) or during exertion and/or fatigue, together with signs of fluid retention such as pulmonary congestion, increased jugular vein distension, or ankle swelling, with objective evidence of an abnormality of the structure or function of the heart. Some of these clinical findings can make distinguishing ECOPD from acute HF difficult. In addition, COPD is present in up to 50% of patients with HF, and HF occurs in roughly 20% of individuals with COPD because of overlapping risk factors (aging and smoking) and underlying mechanisms (systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and muscular atrophy). Furthermore, an HF diagnosis is often difficult to confirm in patients with preserved ejection fraction, which is common in patients with COPD. Hypoxemia and tachycardia in ECOPD can promote decompensation in HF, whereas pulmonary fluid retention in HF can worsen airway obstruction. In addition, wheezing is common in acute HF (approximately 30%), whereas COPD can mask the presence of basilar crackles. However, their presence, coupled with evidence of leg edema, elevated jugular venous pressure, and a third heart sound increases the likelihood of HF being the cause of, or a contributor to, the acute event.

### Guidelines for the appropriate use of bedside general and cardiac ultrasonography in the evaluation of critically ill patients-part II: cardiac ultrasonography [^594dce98]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Cardiac tamponade (Recommended for Expert Levels of Training) — We recommend that BCU should be performed to diagnose cardiac tamponade and to increase the effectiveness and safety of pericardiocentesis and guide performance of the procedure. Grade 1B. Classic physical examination findings of cardiac tamponade such as jugular venous distention, hypotension, and diminished heart sounds are usually absent; BCU can successfully identify this phenomenon even if not suspected clinically and can guide and assess effectiveness of pericardiocentesis, especially if contrast-enhanced ultrasound is used.

Chest trauma imaging — pleural ultrasound and cardiac assessment — Sonographic imaging of the pleural spaces has limitations because sound waves are reflected rather than transmitted by bone and air, making it more operator dependent, but it is inexpensive and typically more rapid than conventional radiology; at the present time, consider ultrasound of the pleural spaces to be an adjunct, not a replacement for the screening chest radiograph. The Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exam of the heart provides gross information on cardiac function and contractility, chest CT has low sensitivity for detection of blunt cardiac injury, and perform formal echocardiography for patients suspected to have serious blunt cardiac injury manifested by unexplained hypotension or arrhythmias.

### Does this patient with palpitations have a cardiac arrhythmia? [^a8a19a85]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Context

Many patients have palpitations and seek advice from general practitioners. Differentiating benign causes from those resulting from clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia can be challenging and the clinical examination may aid in this process.

Objective

To systematically review the accuracy of historical features, physical examination, and cardiac testing for the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia in patients with palpitations. Data Source, Study Selection, and

Data Extraction

MEDLINE (1950 to August 25, 2009) and EMBASE (1947 to August 2009) searches of English-language articles that compared clinical features and diagnostic tests in patients with palpitations with a reference standard for cardiac arrhythmia. Of the 277 studies identified by the search strategy, 7 studies were used for accuracy analysis and 16 studies for diagnostic yield analysis. Two authors independently reviewed articles for study data and quality and a third author resolved disagreements.

Data Synthesis

Most data were obtained from single studies with small sample sizes. A known history of cardiac disease (likelihood ratio [LR], 2.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33–3.11), having palpitations affected by sleeping (LR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.33–3.94), or while the patient is at work (LR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.19–3.96) slightly increase the likelihood of a cardiac arrhythmia. A known history of panic disorder (LR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.07–1.01) or having palpitations lasting less than 5 minutes (LR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.22–0.63) makes the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia slightly less likely. The presence of a regular rapid-pounding sensation in the neck (LR, 177; 95% CI, 25–1251) or visible neck pulsations (LR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.25–5.78) in association with palpitations increases the likelihood of a specific type of arrhythmia (atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia). The absence of a regular rapid-pounding sensation in the neck makes detecting the same arrhythmia less likely (LR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.03–0.19). No other features significantly alter the probability of clinically significant arrhythmia. Diagnostic tests for prolonged periods of electrocardiographic monitoring vary in their yield depending on the modality used, duration of monitoring, and occurrence of typical symptoms during monitoring. Loop monitors have the highest diagnostic yield (34%-84%) for identifying an arrhythmia.

Conclusions

While the presence of a regular rapid-pounding sensation in the neck or visible neck pulsations associated with palpitations makes the diagnosis of atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia likely, the reviewed studies suggest that the clinical examination is not sufficiently accurate to exclude clinically significant arrhythmias in most patients. Thus, prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring with demonstration of symptom-rhythm correlation is required to make the diagnosis of a cardiac arrhythmia for most patients with recurrent palpitations.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^6682d11b]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Right-sided heart failure (RHF) physical examination — patients with severe RHF may appear emaciated, tachypneic, and cyanotic, and typically have elevated jugular venous pressure with a prominent V wave from tricuspid regurgitation (TR); atrial fibrillation is common. Increased jugular venous pressure with inspiration (Kussmaul sign) may also be seen with a noncompliant right ventricle (RV). The abdominojugular reflex test, defined as a sustained rise of > 3 cm in the jugular venous pressure for at least 15 seconds with calm spontaneous respiration, may unmask subtle venous hypertension. For RHF secondary to pulmonary hypertension (PH), a prominent pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2) may be heard, whereas in congenital heart disease (CHD) P2 may be soft or even absent when there is a structural or postsurgical abnormality of the pulmonic valve (PV). A low-amplitude holosystolic murmur of TR may be present, the Carvallo sign may distinguish TR from mitral regurgitation, and in repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) a to-and-fro murmur of combined pulmonic stenosis (PS) and insufficiency may occur at the upper left sternal border with radiation to the lungs.

### Isolated right atrial rupture from blunt trauma: a case report with systematic review of a lethal injury [^df2915f9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis is one of suspicion and continued hemodynamic instability often prompts the search for a bleeding source. However, many patients with IRAR are initially hemodynamically stable, which has been attributed to the RA's lower intraluminal pressures. This "static" blood flow creates a more favorable environment for platelet aggregation and may sometimes form an intracardiac hematoma, can mimic the function of a bandage on the rupture site and may be beneficial by transiently decreasing blood loss and may relay a survival benefit.

The clinical presentations of BCRs are heterogeneous and vary depending on multiple factors including location and size. Cardiac tamponade is a common feature of BCR and its presence may be an important prognostic factor in IRAR and may have a protective effect on mortality, which was statistically significant. We observed a 6% mortality rate in patients with IRAR if they presented with cardiac tamponade (Table 2). This may be due to increased suspicion of a cardiac etiology when presented with cardiac tamponade, compared to potential delays in diagnosis and time to the operating room, associated with poorer outcomes, in patients that did not present with cardiac tamponade. However, the clinical findings of "Beck's triad" do not always present together, and up to 35% of cases do not present with cardiac tamponade (Table 1). Our patient developed profound hypotension but had weak carotid pulses with no jugular venous distension and auscultation of the heart was clear. However, the patient's rapid hemodynamic decline did not provide enough time for adjunctive testing. Furthermore, there were no findings on FAST suggestive of cardiac tamponade making the diagnosis of rupture more difficult.

Cardiovascular and respiratory conditions in acute care require rapid, critical decision making, often with limited clinical information. Focused cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS) can aid in diagnosis by providing information that may not be evident from a patient's medical history, physical examination, and ancillary tests. Eight cases are presented in which FOCUS drastically altered the management of patient care, shortened the differential diagnosis, or allowed for the development of a definitive diagnosis. In 3 cases, diagnoses that were not initially suspected were identified by FOCUS. In the remaining cases, uncommon yet critical diagnoses were established at early stages along the patients' courses of care.

Future Developments

Investigate to use LUS as first line diagnostic tool for monitoring of disease/conditions such as pleural effusion, chronic heart failure, and community acquired pneumonia.

The primary care physician/general practitioner (GP) in his/her office has limited diagnostic possibilities and often finds himself/herself in a situation where the medical history and physical examination need to be supplemented with additional examinations, including imaging examinations. Point‐of‐care US in the GP office is enjoying increasing popularity. The use of LUS at the stage of outpatient diagnostics is beneficial for not only the patient and physician, indeed given its cost‐effectiveness it should also be viewed in light of its potential for health care system costs reduction. Numerous examples of the use of US in the diagnostics of adults and children in outpatient treatment and even during home visits have been described. The use of US in the GP office reduces the time to make an accurate diagnosis, helps in making therapeutic decisions and may improve the patient's prognosis. Moreover, LUS used as point‐of‐care examination method may reduce disproportions in the quality of medical services depending on the place of residence and reduce the costs of patient care. In everyday practice, LUS can provide support for a quick differentiation of the causes of such common symptoms as dyspnea or cough. The main pathologies that can be quickly assessed with LUS are pleural fluid, cardiogenic or non‐cardiogenic pulmonary edema, subpleural consolidation in the course of pneumonia, and pneumothorax. Compared with the classic physical examination, LUS is characterized by greater accuracy in the assessment of changes in the course of lower respiratory tract infection and the presence of fluid in the pleural cavities. Moreover, compared with classic imaging examinations of the respiratory system (X‐ray and CT of the chest), LUS is characterized by high or comparable sensitivity and specificity in detecting pulmonary parenchyma pathology in various clinical situations. LUS is also used as a reference method in the diagnosis of the presence of free fluid in the pleural cavities.

### Recorded heart sounds for identification of ventricular tachycardia [^7795ec2d]. Resuscitation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The ECG discrimination of ventricular tachycardia (VT) vs. supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is both important and often difficult. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that recorded digital cardiac acoustical data reflect hemodynamic changes that can be used for VT detection.

Methods

We studied 57 subjects (42 males, mean age 57, range 24–83 years) who had undergone electrophysiological testing for known and suspected cardiac arrhythmias. Acoustic cardiography (Audicor, Inovise Medical, Inc.) was performed during each subject's electrophysiological study. We evaluated the ability of S1 intensity and S1 variability to discriminate between VT and supraventricular rhythm.

Results

The 57 subjects had 17 episodes of VT and 76 episodes of supraventricular rhythm — including 22 episodes of SVT. VT had a lower S1 intensity and higher S1 variability than supraventricular rhythm (2.63 ± 1.78 mV vs. 4.70 ± 5.03 mV and 0.45 ± 0.24 vs. 0.21 ± 0.11, respectively). Conversely, left bundle branch block, right bundle branch block or SVT did not affect either S1 intensity or its variability. Ventricular pacing increased S1 variability but did not affect S1 intensity. The sensitivity of S1 variability for detecting VT was 50% at 100% specificity.

Conclusion

VT is associated with both decreased S1 intensity and increased beat-to-beat S1 variability. The electronic recording and digital processing of digital heart sound data is useful for identifying VT and may facilitate the differential diagnosis of clinically important tachyarrhythmias, particularly in emergency situations where advanced techniques such as electrophysiology studies are not available.

AHF: a diagnostic and management challenge

AHF is a syndrome rather than a diagnosis per se, caused by a wide array of pathologies that result in a spectrum of disease severity ranging from breathlessness to cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. AHF is a highly lethal condition, and studies have shown that minimizing the 'time to appropriate therapy' — the initiation of treatment as soon as possible, including in the prehospital setting — is potentially beneficial in improving outcomes. AHF is variably defined as the rapid onset or acute worsening of symptoms and signs of heart failure that is associated with elevated plasma levels of natriuretic peptides. However, substantial diagnostic uncertainty is inevitable when relying only on traditional clinical findings, and currently a lack of specificity exists in routine investigations for this condition. Indeed, although patients often present with a suggestive history, clinical features (such as shock, and pulmonary or peripheral congestion), and/or symptoms related to the underlying potential cause, these traditional clinical features are frequently absent; over-reliance on these factors might delay diagnosis and implementation of appropriate therapy, or contribute to a missed diagnosis in up to 20% of patients. Furthermore, patients' clinical features might vary according to the site of initial medical contact and the management strategies employed.

The majority of patients with AHF present to emergency departments; however, many patient are also assessed and managed in other acute care settings such as in intensive care and inpatient cardiology units. Patients with AHF usually present with symptoms of congestion and breathlessness rather than cardiac arrest or shock. Symptoms of breathlessness account for 3–5% of emergency department attendances in Europe and the USA, and the major causes of breathlessness and their prevalence include AHF (50%), pneumonia or bronchitis (20%), exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma (20%), and pulmonary embolism (5–10%). Current guidelines recommend that clinical examination and investigations should be integrated to form the diagnosis, including the use of electrocardiogram (ECG), chest radiograph, and biomarkers such as natriuretic peptides, troponin, and D-dimer as indicated. Unfortunately, these data can be challenging to interpret, in particular in the 10–15% of patients in whom two concomitant diagnoses exist. Specifically, although included in the current definition of AHF, levels of natriuretic peptides can be elevated in respiratory disease and other acute conditions such as pulmonary embolism, sepsis, and anaemia –.

### Primary sarcoma of the heart: case report and literature review [^84b90c59]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Local recurrence without distant metastases occurred in the patient treated with adjuvant chemotherapy after primary presentation, 48 months after initial diagnosis. R1 surgery was performed followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (60Gy in 30 fractions). This patient is still alive more than 8 years after initial diagnosis (case 8). Three patients developed a local recurrence together with distant metastases, three patients developed distant metastases without signs of local recurrence. Median time between initial diagnosis and local recurrence and/or metastasis was 16 months with a range between 3 and 48 months. Median survival of these patients was 24 months (range 12–84 months) as from diagnosis. Three patients are alive after initial diagnosis with follow-up range from 12 to 86 months.

Primary cardiac tumors can arise in any part of the heart and symptoms depend on the location and on the extent of the tumor. The recognition of a primary cardiac sarcoma can be difficult, as was seen in our patients 1, 5 and 7. Dyspnea is the most frequent symptom, followed by chest pain, congestive heart failure and palpitations. For diagnosis echocardiography, preferably transesophageal, is a reliable and an inexpensive way to show tumor size, location, mobility and attachment. MRI, CT and PET/CT are complementary to achieve a differential diagnosis with benign cardiac tumors and to show the extra cardiac extent and possible distant metastases. Up to 80% of patients have distant metastasis at time of diagnosis.

### Coronary artery ostioplasty without a patch for congenital left main coronary artery ostial atresia [^25dcd741]. JTCVS Techniques (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Report

A 6-month-old male infant who was asymptomatic and in excellent general condition after birth had a sudden worsening of his condition over 4 weeks following an episode of pneumonia. On examination, the heart sounds were distant, and a grade II/VI systolic murmur was heard in the mitral area. Electrocardiography revealed sinus rhythm without the typical indicators of myocardial ischemia. Transthoracic echocardiography showed that the origin of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) was indistinct, with retrograde blood flow in the left anterior descending branch (Figure 1, A and B), combined with severe dilatation of the left ventricle and moderate mitral valve regurgitation. Therefore, an anomalous origin of the left coronary artery was suspected, and a diagnosis of anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) was considered. Cardiac computed tomography showed a possible connection of the LMCA to the distal left posterior wall of the main pulmonary artery, supporting the diagnosis of ALCAPA (Figure 1, C and D).

### What echocardiographic findings suggest a pericardial effusion is causing tamponade? [^02754d51]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pericardial tamponade is neither a clinical nor an echocardiographic diagnosis alone. The echocardiogram carries diagnostic value and should be performed when there is suspicion for tamponade based on the history and physical exam. A pericardial effusion uncovered on point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) may be mistaken for tamponade and thereby lead to inappropriate and invasive management with pericardiocentesis.

Objective

This narrative review will summarize the echocardiographic findings and associated pathophysiology that support the diagnosis of pericardial tamponade. It will provide a succinct description of the core findings for which emergency physicians should evaluate at the bedside, along with potential pearls and pitfalls in this evaluation. Labeled images and video clips are included.

Discussion

The core echocardiographic findings of pericardial tamponade consist of: a pericardial effusion, diastolic right ventricular collapse (high specificity), systolic right atrial collapse (earliest sign), a plethoric inferior vena cava with minimal respiratory variation (high sensitivity), and exaggerated respiratory cycle changes in mitral and tricuspid valve in-flow velocities as a surrogate for pulsus paradoxus.

Conclusion

The emergency physician must recognize and understand the core echocardiographic findings and associated pathophysiology that suggest pericardial tamponade. Together with the history and clinical exam, these findings can help make the overall diagnosis and determine management.

### Deep learning algorithms to detect murmurs associated with structural heart disease [^ae9833a4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Murmur Timing

We then assessed the murmur timing algorithm among the structural murmurs identified by both the expert annotators and the murmur detection algorithm. Owing to the low prevalence of diastolic murmurs (n = 3) in the Eko test data set, we also assessed murmur timing assignments in the Eko murmur timing data set, which includes 26 diastolic murmurs. We observed excellent sensitivity and specificity (97.5% and 100%, respectively) for systolic murmur detection in the test data set, and lower sensitivity and specificity, relative to the systolic murmur detection algorithm (80.8% and 89.8%, respectively) for diastolic murmur detection in the murmur timing data set (Table 10).

Clinician Comparisons

Assessment Against Independent Clinicians

To best assess the clinical usefulness of our tools, we directly compared the performance of our murmur classification algorithm in detecting a structural murmur against 10 independent clinicians given the same task. Notably, the clinicians were provided an idealized, distraction‐free listening environment to optimize their performance. Despite this, the algorithm performed significantly better than the average clinician (P < 0.001, 84.7% versus 77.9% accuracy; Table 11). Moreover, no individual clinician outperformed the algorithm (Table 11; Figure 3).

Pericardial effusion (Recommended for All Levels of Training) — We recommend that BCU should be performed to accurately diagnose pericardial effusion and to identify underlying causes. Grade 1C. BCU can detect the presence of pericardial effusion and identify signs of tamponade; in the early post–cardiac surgery period diagnosis may be difficult, and ultrasound of the chest should also be performed in such patients to assist with differential diagnosis of pericardial and left pleural effusions by orienting the collection relative to the position of the aorta.

### Etiology and diagnosis of systolic murmurs in adults [^477050ad]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

It is unknown whether echocardiography can provide insights into the origin of systolic murmurs and the modern value of bedside cardiovascular diagnosis.

Methods

The author examined 376 inpatients and compared their physical findings to transthoracic echocardiography, exploring the associations between echocardiography and systolic murmurs and investigating the diagnostic accuracy of physical examination for pathologic murmurs.

Results

Four echocardiographic variables predict the presence of systolic murmurs: peak aortic velocity (P < .001); mitral regurgitation severity (P < .001); mitral valve E-point velocity (P = 0.09); and absence of pericardial effusion (P = 0.09). When diagnosing murmurs, the most helpful finding is its distribution on the chest wall with respect to the 3(rd) left parasternal space, a landmark that distinguishes murmurs into 6 patterns. The "apical-base" pattern indicates increased aortic velocity (likelihood ratio [LR] 9.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]; 6.7–14): a delayed carotid upstroke (LR 6.8; 95% CI; 4.0–11.5); absent S2 (LR 12.7; 95% CI; 5.3–30.4); and humming quality to the murmur (LR 8.5; 95% CI; 4.3–16.5) further increase the probability of aortic valve disease. The "broad apical" murmur pattern suggests significant mitral regurgitation (LR 6.8; 95% CI; 3.9–11.9); and the "left lower sternal" murmur pattern indicates significant tricuspid regurgitation (LR 8.4; 95% CI; 3.5–20.3): additional bedside observations refine these diagnoses. Nonetheless, this study shows that some classic physical findings are no longer accurate, that physical examination cannot reliably distinguish severe aortic stenosis from less severe stenosis, and that classic physical findings, despite having proven value, are absent in many patients with significant cardiac lesions.

Conclusions

In the diagnosis of systolic murmurs, physical examination has limitations but also unappreciated value. A simple system using onomatopoeia and classifying systolic murmurs into 1 of 6 patterns is diagnostically helpful.

### Incidence and factors associated with recurrent pericarditis in lupus [^df4d2150]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Limitations

The retrospective analysis of this cohort study led to several limitations. First, recurrent pericarditis was defined as that occurring at least 6 weeks from the last recorded episode of pericarditis, in accordance with the European Society of Cardiology. However, given the retrospective nature of this study, there is a chance that some episodes of incessant pericarditis may have been incorrectly defined as recurrent. Given that patients with persistent symptoms are typically reevaluated in short course in our clinical practice, the likelihood that incessant pericarditis was inappropriately defined is very low.

Second, SELENA-SLEDAI criteria were used to diagnose pericarditis. The SELENA-SLEDAI definition of pericarditis is less stringent than that used by cardiology associations, such as the European Society of Cardiology, as well as other forms of the SLEDAI criteria, including SLEDAI-2K. According to the SELENA-SLEDAI definition, only 1 of the following criterion must be present for diagnosis: pericardial pain, auscultation of pericardial rub, presence of pericardial effusion on imaging, or ECG confirmation. Within our study cohort, patient-reported pericardial chest pain was used most often to diagnose pericarditis. Importantly, we found that 21 patients who were further evaluated via specific testing, including transthoracic echocardiogram, computed tomography chest imaging, or ECG, demonstrated findings indicative of pericarditis. They thereby fulfilled both SLEDAI and European Society of Cardiology criteria for the diagnosis of pericarditis. This suggests that clinical criteria alone may be a useful tool for diagnosing pericarditis among patients with SLE.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^e2e51e60]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea evaluation — clinical categories and diagnostic value of descriptors include two major patient categories: those with new onset of breathing discomfort for whom the underlying cause has not yet been determined and those with known cardiovascular, respiratory, or neuromuscular disease who are experiencing worsening dyspnea; for the former, evaluation focuses on discovering an underlying abnormality or diagnosis, and for the latter the goal is to discern deterioration of a known disorder or emergence of a new problem. In new-onset dyspnea, the history and physical examination remain the mainstays of diagnostic evaluation, and when diagnosis remains elusive, specialty referral (e.g., pulmonologist, cardiologist, or multidisciplinary dyspnea clinic) may help identify a potentially treatable underlying cause. In most cardiopulmonary diseases both increased ventilatory demand and altered ventilatory mechanics are present, whereas in some nonpathological circumstances (e.g., at altitude or during pregnancy) increased drive predominates; patient words or phrases describing the quality of breathing discomfort may provide insight into pathophysiological mechanisms, with chest tightness relatively specific for dyspnea due to bronchoconstriction, sensations of "air hunger" and "inability to get a deep breath" probably representing increased drive to breathe plus limited tidal volume and being common with dynamic hyperinflation and restrictive mechanics, and sensations of effort, suffocation, and rapid breathing characterizing CO2-induced panic attacks but being nonspecific; linguistic and cultural differences can affect symptom characterization, and some patients have difficulty grasping the concept of "quality" of their breathing sensations.

### Focused cardiac ultrasound in the emergent setting: a consensus statement of the American Society of Echocardiography and American College of Emergency Physicians [^6810ffee]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Medium credibility.

Focused cardiac ultrasound — global left ventricular systolic function assessment states that FOCUS can be used for global assessment of LV systolic function and relies on overall assessment of endocardial excursion and myocardial thickening, using multiple windows, including the parasternal, subcostal, and apical views; FOCUS is performed to assess global function and differentiates patients into "normal" or minimally impaired function versus "depressed" or significantly impaired function, and this descriptive nomenclature when used by non-echocardiographers has good correlation with echocardiographer interpretations; the goal of the focused exam is to facilitate clinical decision-making to decide if a patient with acute shortness of breath or chest pain has impaired systolic contractility and thus would benefit from pharmacologic therapies or other interventions; evaluation of segmental wall motion abnormalities and other causes of shortness of breath (e.g., valvular dysfunction) can be challenging and should be assessed by performing a comprehensive echocardiogram.

### Acute dyspnea in the office [^cbe447d6]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Respiratory difficulty is a common presenting complaint in the outpatient primary care setting. Because patients may first seek care by calling their physician's office, telephone triage plays a role in the early management of dyspnea. Once the patient is in the office, the initial goal of assessment is to determine the severity of the dyspnea with respect to the need for oxygenation and intubation. Unstable patients typically present with abnormal vital signs, altered mental status, hypoxia, or unstable arrhythmia, and require supplemental oxygen, intravenous access and, possibly, intubation. Subsequent management depends on the differential diagnosis established by a proper history, physical examination, and ancillary studies. Dyspnea is most commonly caused by respiratory and cardiac disorders. Other causes may be upper airway obstruction, metabolic acidosis, a psychogenic disorder, or a neuromuscular condition. Differential diagnoses in children include bronchiolitis, croup, epiglottitis, and foreign body aspiration. Pertinent history findings include cough, sore throat, chest pain, edema, and orthopnea. The physical examination should focus on vital signs and the heart, lungs, neck, and lower extremities. Significant physical signs are fever, rales, wheezing, cyanosis, stridor, or absent breath sounds. Diagnostic work-up includes pulse oximetry, complete blood count, electrocardiography, and chest radiography. If the patient is admitted to the emergency department or hospital, blood gases, ventilation-perfusion scan, D-dimer tests, and spiral computed tomography can help clarify the diagnosis. In a stable patient, management depends on the underlying etiology of the dyspnea.

### A 28-year-old man with chest and joint pains [^3bd1350f]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Introduction

A 28-year-old man with extensive travel history to developing countries was hospitalised for intermittent sharp chest pains, worst when supine and with inspiration. Two weeks prior to presentation, he had suffered a flu-like illness with a sore throat, which was resolving. Physical examination was notable for mild fever and tachycardia with cervical lymphadenopathy and painful bilateral knee and wrist effusions. Cardiac auscultation was remarkable for a soft early-peaking systolic murmur over the aortic area with a decrescendo early diastolic murmur along the left sternal edge. There was mild leucocytosis, elevation of serum troponin and acute-phase reactants with an ECG showing sinus tachycardia. Echocardiographic windows were extremely limited but suggested the presence of pericardial effusion and aortic regurgitation. Cardiac MRI was performed (figure 1). Viral, microbiological and autoimmune testing was remarkable only for significant elevation of antistreptolysin-O titres (1450IU rising to 1940IU, normal < 200IU). Pericardiocentesis revealed an exudative effusion, which was negative by cytology and microbiological analysis, including for tuberculosis and fungi.

### Does this patient with chest pain have acute coronary syndrome? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^3d4b6fdc]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

About 10% of patients with acute chest pain are ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Early, accurate estimation of the probability of ACS in these patients using the clinical examination could prevent many hospital admissions among low-risk patients and ensure that high-risk patients are promptly treated.

Objective

To review systematically the accuracy of the initial history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and risk scores incorporating these elements with the first cardiac-specific troponin.

Study Selection

MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched (January 1, 1995-July 31, 2015), along with reference lists from retrieved articles, to identify prospective studies of diagnostic test accuracy among patients admitted to the emergency department with symptoms suggesting ACS.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

We identified 2992 unique articles; 58 met inclusion criteria.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio (LR) of findings for the diagnosis of ACS. The reference standard for ACS was either a final hospital diagnosis of ACS or occurrence of a cardiovascular event within 6 weeks.

Results

The clinical findings and risk factors most suggestive of ACS were prior abnormal stress test (specificity, 96%; LR, 3.1 [95% CI, 2.0–4.7]), peripheral arterial disease (specificity, 97%; LR, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.5–4.8]), and pain radiation to both arms (specificity, 96%; LR, 2.6 [95% CI, 1.8–3.7]). The most useful electrocardiogram findings were ST-segment depression (specificity, 95%; LR, 5.3 [95% CI, 2.1–8.6]) and any evidence of ischemia (specificity, 91%; LR, 3.6 [95% CI,1.6–5.7]). Both the History, Electrocardiogram, Age, Risk Factors, Troponin (HEART) and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk scores performed well in diagnosing ACS: LR, 13 (95% CI, 7.0–24) for the high-risk range of the HEART score (7–10) and LR, 6.8 (95% CI, 5.2–8.9) for the high-risk range of the TIMI score (5–7). The most useful for identifying patients less likely to have ACS were the low-risk range HEART score (0–3) (LR, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.13–0.30]), low-risk range TIMI score (0–1) (LR, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.23–0.43]), or low to intermediate risk designation by the Heart Foundation of Australia and Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand risk algorithm (LR, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.19–0.31]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with suspected ACS presenting to emergency departments, the initial history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram alone did not confirm or exclude the diagnosis of ACS. Instead, the HEART or TIMI risk scores, which incorporate the first cardiac troponin, provided more diagnostic information.

### Current concepts of the genesis of heart sounds… [^fe54f1fe]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THIRD HEART SOUND The S3 occurs in early diastole, 130 to 180 msec after A2, and coincides with the end of rapid filling of the left ventricle. Ultrasonic studies have shown that the S3 occurs just as the LV septum and posterior free wall reach their greatest diastolic excursion; presumably, accelerating and decelerating forces are maximal at this time. The sound itself thus represents vibrations of LV structures and blood mass as the rapid inflow of left atrial blood is checked by the limits of LV diastolic expansion. Implications of an Audible S3 The presence of an audible S3 is normal in children and young adults. For unclear reasons, the S3 is rarely a normal finding in persons more than 30 to 35 years of age. It has been recognized for many years that the presence of a S3 in an adult generally has ominous implications. An. Abrams J. Current Concepts of the Genesis of Heart Sounds: II.

### Differential diagnosis of congenital ventricular septal defect and atrial septal defect in children using deep learning-based analysis of chest radiographs [^0f45abb3]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have shown that the use of artificial intelligence technology to assist in the detection of VSD or ASD has certain advantages. Gharehbaghi et al. used a machine learning method, a time growth neural network, to distinguish between VSD heart sound, atrioventricular valve regurgitation heart sound, and normal heart sound in children, and achieved accuracy and sensitivity of 86.7% and 83.3%, respectively. Liu et al. constructed The residual convolution recurrent neural network classification model based on deep learning to analyze children's heart sounds, which was able to preliminarily determine the type of left-to-right shunt CHD. Indeed, the diagnostic result of the model was better than expert auscultation, with an accuracy value of 0.940–0.994, which could improve the efficiency of CHD diagnosis. Toba et al. predicted the pulmonary-to-systemic circulation flow ratio of patients with CHD based on deep learning chest radiograph analysis, quantitatively and objectively, which may confer an opportunity to quantify otherwise qualitative and subjective findings of pulmonary vascularity in the clinical setting. Kim et al. provided highly reliable cardiovascular boundary measurement according to the deep learning algorithm to diagnose and quantitatively evaluate valvular heart disease. Based on chest radiographs, this study applied the deep learning method to the differential diagnosis of VSD and ASD, and the detection effect was better than that in the previous studies. The average accuracy and sensitivity for the total test cases reached more than 80%, indicating improved diagnostic efficiency. The fivefold cross-validation method showed that the four models had good differential diagnostic ability for VSD and ASD and good robustness.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Physical examination limits and lesion-specific clues — mitral, aortic, and tricuspid regurgitation: In left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, "patients with LV dysfunction and secondary MR often have very soft murmurs even when the MR is severe", and "it is also important to recognize that even mild degrees of MR… identify patients at considerable risk of heart failure and death in the setting of LV dysfunction and secondary MR". For aortic regurgitation (AR), "the diastolic murmur of AR is often barely audible or may be completely absent, and the only appreciable murmur may be a systolic outflow murmur related to the high SV", with "additional physical findings such as a wide pulse pressure or bounding carotid pulses" suggesting significant AR; "AR is often first identified on echocardiograms performed to investigate a systolic murmur". For tricuspid regurgitation (TR), "TR is also often not identified clinically prior to echocardiography but identified as an important concomitant lesion in patients with MR", and in primary TR, "there are often no clinical manifestations when the TR is mild", whereas "severe TR caused by primary disorders is almost invariably associated with a systolic murmur with respiratory variation, elevated V waves in the jugular venous pulse, and an RV heave as evidence of RV volume overload".

Limited transthoracic echocardiographic examination — definition and focused applications specify that "The Intersocietal Accreditation Commission defines a limited echocardiographic examination as follows: 'A limited study is generally only performed when the patient has recently undergone a complete examination and there is no clinical reason to suspect any changes outside the specific area of interest. A limited study generally examines a single area of the heart or answers a single clinical question'. For pericardial effusion, "a repeat study for evaluation of a pericardial effusion is commonly performed to serially follow the progress of treatment", and, if significant, "the study should include imaging and Doppler data to make a full assessment of the hemodynamic significance of the effusion", whereas "if no effusion remains, views to evaluate for tamponade physiology are not necessary". For LV function, "the limited examination for LV function may be performed at variable time intervals… when there is a focused clinical question regarding a change in LV function". For pulmonary hypertension, "echocardiography can be used to provide indirect measures of PA pressures and information regarding RV function, hypertrophy, and size", and "accurate assessment of pulmonary pressures and RV function is important to monitor the effect of treatment", with views serving as "a starting point", and additional images added if "unexpected or new pathology" is present.

### Does this patient with a pericardial effusion have cardiac tamponade? [^e678cf85]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Cardiac tamponade is a state of hemodynamic compromise resulting from cardiac compression by fluid trapped in the pericardial space. The clinical examination may assist in the decision to perform pericardiocentesis in patients with cardiac tamponade diagnosed by echocardiography.

Objective

To systematically review the accuracy of the history, physical examination, and basic diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade.

Data Sources

MEDLINE search of English-language articles published between 1966 and 2006, reference lists of these articles, and reference lists of relevant textbooks.

Study Selection

We included articles that compared aspects of the clinical examination to a reference standard for the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade. We excluded studies with fewer than 15 patients. Of 787 studies identified by our search strategy, 8 were included in our final analysis.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed articles for study results and quality. A third reviewer resolved disagreements.

Data Synthesis

All studies evaluated patients with known tamponade or those referred for pericardiocentesis with known effusion. Five features occur in the majority of patients with tamponade: dyspnea (sensitivity range, 87%-89%), tachycardia (pooled sensitivity, 77%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 69%-85%), pulsus paradoxus (pooled sensitivity, 82%; 95% CI, 72%-92%), elevated jugular venous pressure (pooled sensitivity, 76%; 95% CI, 62%-90%), and cardiomegaly on chest radiograph (pooled sensitivity, 89%; 95% CI, 73%-100%). Based on 1 study, the presence of pulsus paradoxus greater than 10 mm Hg in a patient with a pericardial effusion increases the likelihood of tamponade (likelihood ratio, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.8–6.3), while a pulsus paradoxus of 10 mm Hg or less greatly lowers the likelihood (likelihood ratio, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.01–0.24).

Conclusions

Among patients with cardiac tamponade, a minority will not have dyspnea, tachycardia, elevated jugular venous pressure, or cardiomegaly on chest radiograph. A pulsus paradoxus greater than 10 mm Hg among patients with a pericardial effusion helps distinguish those with cardiac tamponade from those without. Diagnostic certainty of the presence of tamponade requires additional testing.

### The role of lung ultrasound in COVID-19 disease [^b4eda912]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Fundamentals of lung ultrasonography examinations

Thoracic and lung ultrasonography have increased in importance over the past decade, particularly in the setting of point of care ultrasonography (POCUS).

A lung ultrasonography examination was first executed more than half century ago. Excepting echocardiography and obstetrical use, ultrasonography has predominantly been a tool used by radiologists and the lung wasn´t considered suitable for this imaging technology historically. Nonetheless, since 1991, intensivists have been using ultrasonography in a variety of settings, including in vascular access, to detect free fluid in body cavities and, to a lesser extent, in lung assessment.

Severe dyspnoea is a common presenting initial sign in the emergency room and the ICU. The variety of thinkable differential diagnoses is extensive; after history-taking, physical examination and determination of the vital parameters, prompt bedside emergency ultrasonography can be helpful. Focused pulmonary ultrasonography is a significant component of emergency ultrasonography beside dedicated ultrasonography of the abdomen and heart. While recommendations exist for elective chest ultrasonography and point of care pulmonary ultrasonography, emergency pulmonary ultrasonography has not yet been extensively adopted in everyday practice. In experienced hands, pulmonary ultrasonography shows brilliant diagnostic accurateness in identifying pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pulmonary venous congestion and consolidation, compared to clinical examination and CXR.

In the diagnosis of lung pathologies, ultrasonography artefacts arising from the chest wall and pleural surface can provide valuable information and may correlate with the existing lung pathophysiology. There are two major ultrasonographic artefact patterns that a clinician may detect: "A-lines" and "B-lines" in rare cases even "C-lines" are visible.

A-lines are reverberation artefacts triggered by oscillating tissue with an air interface, causing the ultrasonography waves to be reflected strongly and to reverberate. Among the probe and lung surface, the ultrasonography waves bounce back and forth. A-lines are parallel horizontal repetition lines of the pleural surface, appearing deeper on the display screen (Fig. 1). Due to the fact that this is a classic reverberation artefact, the distance from the skin to the pleural surface equals the distance from the pleural line to the first A-line, the first A-line to the second A-line, and so forth. The A-profile is shaped by intact ("dry") lung parenchyma containing air when it is combined with normal lung sliding. If sliding is absent, it is intensely suggestive of a pneumothorax.

Figure 14 — Use of clinical and laboratory evaluations in determining euvolemia at discharge — categorizes congestion severity across none, mild, moderate, and severe/worst using clinical findings and technical tests with explicit thresholds. Jugular venous pulsation (JVP) and hepatojugular reflux (HJR) are graded as " < 8 and no HJR", " < 8", "8–10 or HJR+", "11–15", and " > 16". Hepato megaly is categorized as "Absent", "Liver edge", "Moderate pulsatile enlargement", and "Massive enlargement and tender", and edema as "None", "+1", "+2", and "+3/+4". Functional capacity by six-minute walk test (6 MWT) spans " > 400 m", "300–400 m", "200–300 m", "100–200 m", and " < 100 m". Chest X-ray ranges from "clear" or "cardiomegaly" to signs including "- pulmonary venous congestion", "- small pleural effusions", and "- Interstitial or alveolar edema", with the note that "Chest X-ray can be clear, but presence of abnormalities suggests higher degree of congestion". Technical congestion metrics include vena cava imaging categorized as "None of two", "One of two", or "Both", where the findings are "- Max diameter > 2.2 cm" and "- collapsibility < 50%", and lung ultrasound thresholds of " < 15 B-lines when scanning 28-sites", "15–30 B-lines when scanning 28-sites", and " > 30 B-lines when scanning 28-sites".

### Misconceptions and facts about pericardial effusion and tamponade [^4d204c78]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Several common misconceptions can make the clinical diagnosis of subacute pericardial tamponade challenging. Widely known physical findings of pericardial tamponade lack sensitivity and specificity. Interpretation of echocardiographic signs requires good understanding of pathophysiology. Over-reliance on echocardiography may result in over-utilization of pericardial drainage procedures. Awareness of these misconceptions with an integrative approach to both clinical and imaging data will help clinicians to assess the hemodynamic impact of pericardial effusion and the need for drainage.

### The diagnostic value of physical examination and additional testing in primary care patients with suspected heart failure [^768e5d9b]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Early diagnosis of nonacute heart failure is crucial because prompt initiation of evidence-based treatment can prevent or slow down further progression. To diagnose new-onset heart failure in primary care is challenging.

Methods and Results

This is a cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study with external validation. Seven hundred twenty-one consecutive patients suspected of new-onset heart failure underwent standardized diagnostic work-up including chest x-ray, spirometry, ECG, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) measurement, and echocardiography in specially equipped outpatient diagnostic heart failure clinics. The presence of heart failure was determined by an outcome panel using the initial clinical data and 6-month follow-up data, blinded to biomarker data. Of the 721 patients, 207 (28.7%) had heart failure. The combination of 3 items from history (age, coronary artery disease, and loop diuretic use) plus 6 from physical examination (pulse rate and regularity, displaced apex beat, rales, heart murmur, and increased jugular vein pressure) showed independent diagnostic value (c-statistic 0.83). NT-proBNP was the most powerful supplementary diagnostic test, increasing the c-statistic to 0.86 and resulting in net reclassification improvement of 69% (P < 0.0001). A simplified diagnostic rule was applied to 2 external validation datasets, resulting in c- statistics of 0.95 and 0.88, confirming the results.

Conclusions

In this study, we estimated the quantitative diagnostic contribution of elements of the history and physical examination in the diagnosis of heart failure in primary care outpatients, which may help to improve clinical decision making. The largest additional quantitative diagnostic contribution to those elements was provided by measurement of NT-proBNP. For daily practice, a diagnostic rule was derived that may be useful to quantify the probability of heart failure in patients with new symptoms suggestive of heart failure.

### Guidelines and recommendations for targeted neonatal echocardiography and cardiac point-of-care ultrasound in the neonatal intensive care unit: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^f290708d]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2024). High credibility.

Cardiac point-of-care ultrasound (cPOCUS) and targeted neonatal echocardiography (TNE) — screening and management for pericardial effusion: cPOCUS or standard TNE should be routinely used to evaluate infants with suspected pericardial effusion or tamponade physiology or those with sudden unexplained deterioration with hemodynamic compromise; the size of the effusion does not always align with the degree of hemodynamic significance and rate of accumulation may be more important, and dilation of the inferior cava, RV diastolic collapse, and variability in atrioventricular valve inflow are additional signs of hemodynamic significance; recommendations state that pericardial effusion should be ruled out in any infant with sudden unexplained deterioration with hemodynamic compromise, especially when a central line is in situ, that this should be differentiated from pleural effusion, and that pericardiocentesis should be performed under ultrasound guidance when pericardial effusion results in hemodynamic compromise or tamponade physiology, or occasionally for diagnostic purposes.

1.4.1 Recommendation 5

Discuss clinical urgency and level of echocardiography with a clinician.

1.4.1.1 Background to Recommendation 5

The need for clinical collaboration is greater for inpatient than for outpatient requests since the presentation may be acute, not necessarily associated with a murmur and the dangers of progression much higher.

There can be no safe target time‐delays and every case must be considered individually.

No level of echocardiography is universally applicable. A combination of a basic/level 1 study can be used to exclude life‐threatening pathology and a minimum standard study performed at greater leisure if required.

1.4.1.1.1 Examples of Indications Suitable for an Initial Basic/Level 1 Study

Incidental murmur in a patient admitted with a nonvalve problem for example, neck of femur fracture. It is reasonable to perform a basic/level 1 study in patients with a murmur as an emergency if identifying HVD will change management.

After insertion of an electrical device or other invasive intervention a basic/level 1 study is frequently sufficient to exclude a new pericardial effusion.
In an acutely unwell patient, a basic/level 1 study may indicate the need for immediate life‐saving treatment.

1.4.1.1.2 Examples of Indications Suitable for a Focussed Study

Predischarge after cardiac surgery to detect pathology that might require immediate management for example, large pericardial effusion or LV dysfunction or prosthetic valve dysfunction.

1.4.1.1.3 Examples of Indications Requiring a Minimum Standard Study

Patients with known HVD admitted with heart failure.
Murmur after acute myocardial infarction since it may indicate mitral regurgitation or a VSD.
Urgent echocardiography should be done if there is unexplained LV failure or shock since these might complicate critical HVD.

1.4.1.1.4 Examples of Studies Often Not Indicated

Fever with a low clinical likelihood of infective endocarditis (see recommendation 6).
Recent TTE with no evidence of clinical deterioration.

### Focused cardiac ultrasound: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^19c7acea]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Focused cardiac ultrasound (FCU) — referral and communication: Although an FCU evaluation may facilitate initial management, all patients with abnormal findings not previously documented on echocardiography should be referred for a comprehensive echocardiographic examination, and a physician with only FCU expertise does not have the image acquisition or interpretation expertise to completely evaluate a symptomatic cardiac patient; when FCU fails to detect prespecified abnormalities in symptomatic patients, referral for comprehensive echocardiography is probably warranted. In dyspnea, FCU may rapidly and accurately exclude a large pericardial effusion or significant left ventricle (LV) systolic dysfunction, but other cardiac pathologies missed by FCU must be considered. Patients who undergo or witness FCU should be informed that it provides "early" or "preliminary" information and is not equivalent to a diagnostic echocardiographic study; they and their families should be told that significant abnormal findings will be confirmed with a complete diagnostic echocardiogram, should understand that an echocardiogram will be performed as soon as practical if warranted, and should understand that a post-FCU echocardiogram is not a duplicate or repeated examination but a comprehensive evaluation.

In the 1700 s, Lazzaro Spallanzani, an Italian physiologist and priest, completed a set of experiments to explain how bats are able to fly at night. Spallanzani hypothesized that bats relied on the bouncing of sound, not their vision, to navigate. Subsequent investigators expanded these principles to practical use, developing sonar for the detection of objects in the water and radar to detect aircraft. It was Karl Theodore Dussik, an Austrian neuropsychiatrist at the University of Vienna, who in 1947 first used ultrasonic beams to diagnose brain tumors and dilatation of the ventricles The application of ultrasonography to most organs of the body has made this technique the most widely applied noninvasive tool in the medical armamentarium. Although not specifically used for the diagnosis of COPD, it does help in the differential diagnosis of conditions that may resemble COPD exacerbations, namely, heart failure, pneumonia, pneumothorax, and pleural effusions.

### 2025 concise clinical guidance: an ACC expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of pericarditis: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^c639a310]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Characteristic imaging features in pericarditis (Table 4) — on CCT, noncalcified pericardial thickening (> 3 mm) and enhancement of thickened visceral and parietal pericardial surfaces on late postcontrast scans are described; on CMR, thickening of pericardium at T1-weighted black-blood images (> 3 mm), enhancement of pericardium on late gadolinium enhancement and T2-short tau inversion recovery sequences consistent with active inflammation and neovascularization, high signal intensity on T2-weighted black-blood images suggestive of exudative pericardial effusions, and loss of normal sliding between pericardial layers are noted; on TTE, pericardial effusion with or without CTP is present in 40%-50% of cases and a sign of constrictive pericarditis (often transient) may be seen; CT attenuation values of pericardial effusion on noncontrast CT may help distinguish exudative from transudative fluid.

2017. 1428. An obese woman in her 60s with a medical history of poorly controlled diabetes presented to the emergency department with 24 hours of stuttering chest pain at rest and with exertion. She had been to an emergency department at a different hospital the night prior presenting for the same symptoms; however, she left that hospital against medical advice. There was no history of syncope or of palpitations. On physical examination, her vital signs showed a normal heart rate with elevated blood pressure of 152/89 mm Hg. Physical examination revealed a paradoxical split S2 heard best at the left sternal border with a soft 1/6 systolic murmur best heard at the sternal border as well. The heart sounds were distant on examination.

There were rales at the lung bases bilaterally, and there was mild pitting edema at the distal lower extremities bilaterally. An echocardiogram performed the year prior had shown a normal ejection fraction with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. The presenting electrocardiogram is shown in the Figure.
