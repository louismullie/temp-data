## Question

How many right triangles with a height of 2 inches and a width of two inches could fit inside a square with 2-inch sides?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many right triangles with a height of 2 inches and a width of 2 inches can fit inside a square with 2-inch sides. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact dimensions and orientation of the triangle. Then, I should verify the area of the triangle and the area of the square to see if a simple area ratio gives a reasonable estimate. Next, I will consider whether the triangle can actually be placed within the square without exceeding the boundaries, and if so, how many orientations are possible. Finally, I will reconcile any discrepancies between area-based estimates and geometric feasibility to arrive at the correct count.

> Let me first confirm the triangle's dimensions and orientation. A right triangle with height 2 inches and width 2 inches is an isosceles right triangle with two legs of 2 inches each and a hypotenuse of about 2.83 inches, and its area is ½ × base × height = ½ × 2 × 2 = 2 square inches [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the square's constraints. The square has sides of 2 inches, so its area is 2 × 2 = 4 square inches, and its maximum diagonal is about 2.83 inches, which matches the triangle's hypotenuse length, suggesting the triangle could potentially fit along the diagonal if oriented correctly [^notfound].

> I will now examine whether the triangle can be placed inside the square. If I align the two 2-inch legs along adjacent sides of the square, the right angle sits at a corner and the hypotenuse lies along the diagonal, which fits exactly within the 2 × 2 square without extending beyond the boundaries, so at least one triangle can fit [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about fitting more than one. My first instinct is to say two triangles might fit because 4 square inches divided by 2 square inches per triangle equals 2, but wait, I should double-check the geometry before concluding that two can coexist without overlap or boundary violations [^notfound].

> Let me consider alternative orientations. If I rotate the triangle so that the hypotenuse is horizontal or vertical, the required bounding box exceeds 2 inches in both dimensions, so that won't fit. Similarly, placing the triangle with a leg along a side but shifted inward leaves insufficient room for a second triangle without overlap, given the 2-inch limit on each side of the square [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought I could fit two triangles by cutting the square along the diagonal, but I should verify that. Cutting the square along a diagonal produces two congruent right triangles, each with legs of 2 inches and area 2 square inches, which matches the description, so yes, exactly two such triangles fit by dividing the square along either diagonal, and they share the diagonal as a common side without overlap [^notfound].

> I should confirm there isn't a way to fit more than two. Because each triangle requires a 2 × 2 bounding box when aligned with the axes, and any rotation that would allow tighter packing would force the triangle outside the square, the maximum number that can fit without overlap is two, achieved by the diagonal bisection of the square [^notfound].

> Final answer: Two right triangles with height 2 inches and width 2 inches can fit inside a square with 2-inch sides, by dividing the square along a diagonal into two congruent isosceles right triangles [^notfound].

Two right triangles with a height of 2 inches and a width of 2 inches can fit inside a square with 2-inch sides. This is because each triangle has an area of 2 square inches, and the square has an area of 4 square inches, so two triangles fit exactly. Geometrically, the triangles can be placed with their right angles at opposite corners and their hypotenuses along the square's diagonal, fitting perfectly without overlap [^notfound].

## Area-based analysis

- **Area of the square**: The area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one of its sides. For a square with 2-inch sides, the area is:

[
\\text{Area}_{\\text{square}} = 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ square inches}
]

- **Area of one right triangle**: The area of a right triangle is given by half the product of its base and height. For a triangle with a height of 2 inches and a width of 2 inches, the area is:

[
\\text{Area}_{\\text{triangle}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2 \\text{ square inches}
]

- **Number of triangles based on area**: Dividing the area of the square by the area of one triangle gives the maximum number of triangles that can fit based on area alone:

[
\\text{Number of triangles} = \\frac{\\text{Area}_{\\text{square}}}{\\text{Area}_{\\text{triangle}}} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2
]

Thus, based on area, **two right triangles** can fit inside the square.

---

## Geometric verification

Beyond area, we should confirm that two such triangles can actually be placed within the square without overlapping. Consider the following arrangement:

- **Placement of triangles**: Place one triangle with its right angle at the bottom-left corner of the square, extending its legs along the bottom and left sides. Place the second triangle with its right angle at the top-right corner, extending its legs along the top and right sides. The hypotenuses of both triangles will lie along the square's diagonal, meeting at the center.

- **Verification of fit**: Each triangle has legs of 2 inches, matching the square's side length, so the triangles fit perfectly along the sides. The hypotenuse of each triangle is (2\\sqrt{2}) inches, which is the length of the square's diagonal, confirming that the triangles fit diagonally as well.

---

## Conclusion

Two right triangles with a height of 2 inches and a width of 2 inches can fit inside a square with 2-inch sides. This conclusion is supported by both area calculations and geometric verification, ensuring that the triangles fit perfectly without overlapping [^notfound].

### Goal-oriented prevention: how to fit a square peg into a round hole [^f4847900]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Prevention does not fit well within our problem-oriented medical paradigm in which the focus is on curing or ameliorating existing diseases. It is easier and more satisfying to solve existing problems than it is to advise and motivate patients to implement measures to prevent future problems that may or may not occur. Clinician motivation is further diminished by the time required to help people make lifestyle changes, the low reimbursement rate, and the fact that the benefits, if any, are often not apparent for years. Typical patient panel sizes make it difficult to provide all of the recommended disease-oriented preventive services and to also address the social and lifestyle factors that can impact future health problems. One solution to this square peg-round hole mismatch is to focus on the goals, life extension and prevention of future disabilities.

Trapezoid and 30-60-90 right triangle

This set of experiments was carried out in a right triangle (30°, 60°, 90°) and a trapezoid environment. Corner angles from the trapezoid were 55°, 90°, 90° and 125°. The dimensions of the mazes were 46 (L) × 28 (W) × 30 (H) cm. In total, we conducted 16 sessions each (25 min per session) from eight mice for the right triangle and trapezoid. Data from this set of experiments were aligned and concatenated, and the activity of neurons was tracked across the sessions for each mouse. Other recording protocols were the same as described above.

Insertion of a discrete corner in a square environment

This set of experiments was carried out in a large square environment with dimensions of 40 (L) × 40 (W) × 40 (H) cm. The experiments comprised a baseline session followed by four sessions with the insertion of a discrete corner into the square maze. In these sessions, the walls that formed the discrete corner were gradually separated by 0, 1.5, 3 and 6 cm. Starting from 3 cm, the animals were able to pass through the gap without difficulty. The dimensions of the inserted walls were 15 (W) × 30 (H) cm. For each condition, we recorded eight sessions (30 min per session) from eight mice by conducting a single session from each mouse per day. Data from this set of experiments were aligned and concatenated, and the activity of neurons was tracked throughout the sessions.

### The representation of geometric cues in infancy [^3bf27a75]. Infancy (2008). Low credibility.

There is evidence that, from an early age, humans are sensitive to spatial information such as simple landmarks and the size of objects. This study concerns the ability to represent a particular kind of spatial information, namely, the geometry of an enclosed layout-an ability present in older children, adults, and nonhuman animals (e.g. Cheng, 1986; Hermer & Spelke, 1996). Using a looking-time procedure, 4.5- to 6.5-month-olds were tested on whether they could distinguish among the corners of an isosceles triangle. On each trial, the target corner was marked by a red dot. The stimulus (triangle with dot) appeared from different orientations across trials, ensuring that only cues related to the triangle itself could be used to differentiate the corners. When orientations were highly variable, infants discriminated the unique corner (i.e., the corner with the smaller angle and two equal-length sides) from a nonunique corner; they could not discriminate between the two nonunique corners. With less variable orientations, however, infants did discriminate between the nonunique corners of the isosceles triangle. Implications for how infants represent geometric cues are discussed.

VA/DoD overweight and obesity — BMI screening and calculation: Calculating BMI is a practical screening tool to determine overweight and obesity in adult populations, with BMI defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of the person's height in meters (kg/m^2), or when using pounds and inches as (weight [in pounds]/height [in inches])x 703. The optimal frequency for calculating BMI in the clinical setting has not been evaluated and is a matter of clinical discretion, though screening at least annually provides an opportunity for identification and counseling. There are questions about BMI accuracy; for example, the optimal BMI for those over 65 may be slightly higher than for younger people, and BMI alone may misclassify highly fit individuals with increased lean body mass.

### A general method for the creation of dilational surfaces [^6025b588]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Dilational structures can change in size without changing their shape. Current dilational designs are only suitable for specific shapes or curvatures and often require parts of the structure to move perpendicular to the dilational surface, thereby occupying part of the enclosed volume. Here, we present a general method for creating dilational structures from arbitrary surfaces (2-manifolds with or without boundary), where all motions are tangent to the described surface. The method consists of triangulating the target curved surface and replacing each of the triangular faces by pantograph mechanisms according to a tiling algorithm that avoids collisions between neighboring pantographs. Following this algorithm, any surface can be made to mechanically dilate and could, theoretically, scale from the fully expanded configuration down to a single point. We illustrate the method with three examples of increasing complexity and varying Gaussian curvature.

### Universal non-hermitian skin effect in two and higher dimensions [^9618dcd5]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fig. 3
The corner-skin effect and the geometry-dependent-skin effect.

The universal skin effect can be further classified into two types by the current functional, that is, non-reciprocal skin effect (∃ α, n, J α [n] ≠ 0) and generalized reciprocal skin effect (∀ α, n, J α [n] = 0). CSE (a)–(d) and GDSE (e)-(h) are representatives of these two types of skin effects, respectively. In (a, b, e, f), the light blue regions represent the spectrum under periodic boundary, where 200*200 k -grid is used, and the red points represent the eigenvalues under different open-boundary geometries. The system size under square geometry in (c, g) is L x × L y = 60 × 60, and each triangle geometry in (d, h) has the same right-angled side length L x = L y = 60. The spatial distributions of eigenstates W (x) are plotted in (c, d, g, h) with the color bars. In the system with GDSE, the skin effect disappears under square geometry (geometry 1) in (g), and reappears under triangle geometry (geometry 2) in (h).

### Controlled packing and single-droplet resolution of 3D-printed functional synthetic tissues [^3b7915f7]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Classifying packing types

To estimate the proportion of packing types within each network, we first generated a mesh over the print by performing a Delaunay triangulation using the centres of all regions classified as droplets as the input points. A convenient property of this triangulation method is that the circumcircle of each triangle contains no other points; each triangle therefore represents a triplet of neighbouring droplets and provides localised geometrical information about their arrangements.

The plot of the bivariate distribution of the largest angle of each triangle vs the triangle area normalised by the average droplet area for all prints revealed two distinct clusters of triangles, one corresponding to hexagonally packed droplet regions, and one corresponding to square-packed droplet regions (Supplementary Fig. 3 d). Reasoning that these represented stable configurations of droplets for certain printing parameters, we classified each triangle using these clusters. Four packing categories were used: 'hexagonal' (closely packed triplets of droplets arranged as equilateral triangles), 'square' (closely packed triplets of droplets arranged as right-angled triangles), 'amorphous' (closely packed triplets of droplets of intermediate arrangement) and 'no packing' (triplets of droplets that are not close-packed). For a hexagonal classification. For an amorphous classification. For a square classification. In addition, for all of these classes. Triangles that fell outside of these ranges were classified as no packing (Supplementary Fig. 3 d).

Some elongated 'sliver' triangles were classified as being a member of one of the closely packed classes, despite being composed of widely spaced droplets. Closer analysis of these triangles revealed that they were generally composed of two closely packed droplets and a single more distant droplet, together forming a skinny near-isosceles triangle. We therefore applied an additional constraint based on the perimeter of each triangle normalised by the average droplet radius. Since for perfect hexagonal packing, and for a perfect square packing, we set the constraintfor the closely packed classes based on a linear interpolation between these two points. Our chosen y -intercept for this constraint is slightly greater than the theoretical y -intercept from the interpolation, allowing triangles with small deviations from the perfect packing geometry to be classified as closely packed while still ensuring classification of sliver triangles as no packing.

### Intrinsic cell rheology drives junction maturation [^c7648575]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

One of the consequences of the unequal cell size was that the boundary between the two cells was not always found in the middle of each micropattern. Rather, there was a preference for where junctions were placed (Fig. 3e). On circular shapes, junctions were mostly located at the equator, while a high percentage of junctions were spanning the sides of squared and triangular cell doublets, providing equal or unequal area partition between neighbours. However, the random chance that a junction was found at a given 5° degree interval was 2.78% in circular shapes. In contrast, there was a higher likelihood of a junction spanning a vertex of squares or triangles than their sides. The potential reasons for the orientation preference are currently being investigated in the lab.

Furthermore, the configuration of junctions was distinct, from a wave morphology in circular cell pairs to a straighter junction of neighbours on a triangular shape (linearity index closer to 1; Fig. 3f). Junctions found in triangular cell pairs were also significantly shorter in length (Fig. 3g). Yet, E-cadherin staining occupied similar length of the available contacting interface between cell pairs on different geometries (Fig. 3h). We surmised that the unequal biophysical properties of cells sharing a micropattern (Fig. 3a–d) may affect qualitatively and quantitatively the way they interact with each other (Fig. 3e–h).

Results

Geometric cell confinement alters cortex stiffness

A fundamental question in biology is how tight cohesion between neighbouring cells is maintained to enable signalling and resilience to chemical or mechanical stresses in different epithelial tissues. To investigate the involvement of cell rheology on the ability to attach to each other, we optimized a Junction Unit model, where a cell doublet attaches to different geometric shapes of the same area. Following optimization, we selected the best conditions for subsequent experiments as fibronectin-coated micropatterns with an area of 1300 μm 2 that contained well-spread cell doublets (Fig. 1a; Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). Neighbouring cells on circles had predominantly lamella at the periphery, while a high proportion of square or triangular cell pairs had thick F-actin fibres at their external borders (side fibres) and occasional short lamella (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1c, d). The higher proportion of cells on squares and triangles containing stress fibre bundles suggested increased levels of intracellular mechanical stress compared to circular shapes. Such inference was supported by the longer distance between nuclei of cell doublets spread on triangles or squares (Fig. 1c).

### Nitroglycerin (Nitro-bid) [^72989e6a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:

As noted above (CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY), controlled trials have demonstrated that nitroglycerin ointment can effectively reduce exercise-related angina for up to 7 hours after a single application. Doses used in clinical trials have ranged from 1/2 inch (1.3 cm; 7.5 mg) to 2 inches (5.1 cm; 30 mg), typically applied to 36 square inches (232 square centimeters) of truncal skin.

It is reasonable to believe that the rate and extent of nitroglycerin absorption from ointment may vary with the site and square measure of the skin over which a given dose of ointment is spread, but these relationships have not been adequately studied.

Controlled trials with other formulations of nitroglycerin have demonstrated that if plasma levels are maintained continuously, all anti-anginal efficacy is lost within 24 hours. This tolerance cannot be overcome by increasing the dose of nitroglycerin. As a result, any regimen of NITRO-BID®administration should include a daily nitrate-free interval. The minimum necessary length of such an interval has not been defined, but studies with other nitroglycerin formulations have shown that 10 to 12 hours is sufficient.

Thus, one appropriate dosing schedule for NITRO-BID®would begin with two daily 1/2- inch (7.5 mg) doses, one applied on rising in the morning and one applied six hours later. The dose could be doubled, and even doubled again, in patients tolerating this dose but failing to respond to it. The foilpac is intended as a unit dose package only and is equivalent to approximately 1 inch as squeezed from the tube. Use entire contents of foilpac to obtain full dose and discard immediately after use.

Each tube of ointment and each box of foilpacs is supplied with a pad of ruled, impermeable, paper applicators. These applicators allow ointment to be absorbed through a much smaller area of skin than that used in any of the reported clinical trials, and the significance of this difference is not known. To apply the ointment using one of the applicators, place the applicator on a flat surface, printed side down. Squeeze the necessary amount of ointment from the tube onto the applicator, place the applicator (ointment side down) on the desired area of the skin, and tape the applicator into place.

### Guidelines for handling decedents contaminated with radioactive materials [^98a1a179]. CDC (2007). Medium credibility.

Radiological contamination detection of individuals — parameter values and estimated time to monitor an adult are provided by instrument/detector combination. For CD-V-700 with side window detector, probe speed is 4 inches/second, height of probe 0.25 to 0.5 inches, path width 0.6 inches, and circulated time needed to monitor an adult 19 minutes. For CD V-718 with end window detector, probe speed is 3 inches/second, height of probe 0.5 to 1 inches, path width 1 inches, and time 12 minutes. For all tested instruments with pancake detectors, except the Victoreen 190, probe speed is 6 inches/second, height of probe 1 to 3 inches, path width 2 inches, and time 3.9 minutes. For Victoreen 190 with pancake detector, probe speed is 6 inches/second, height of probe 1 to 4 inches, path width 3 inches, and time 2.6 minutes. These values are based on the ability to detect 0.1 µCi of contamination on a small spot of skin in background gamma radiation levels up to 0.1mR/hr, and a footnote notes that audible detection is not possible in a background gamma radiation level of 0.1 mR/h and that values are for use in background levels of 0.02 mR/h or lower. When using a probe to check a surface for contamination, the user needs to determine 3 parameters from the manufacturer — speed of the probe, height above the surface, and distance between consecutive surveys.

### Shape morphing of plastic films [^a96c261a]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Polygons

The adhesive layer was parallelly aligned with certain intervals. The width of the adhesive layer (w a) was calculated from the interior angles ɵ and the diameter of the peeled-off film, d, where w a = (180− ɵ) π d /360. The intervals are equal to the corresponding side length. Taking right triangle with interior angles of 60° and the shortest side length of 10 mm as an example, the diameter of peeled-off PTFE film (thickness of 80 μm, width of 4 mm) with Kapton tape as the adhesive layer and a peeling angle of 180° is 2 mm; thus, the widths of adhesive layers should be 2.62, 1.57, 2.09 and 2.62 mm, respectively, and the corresponding intervals should be 17.3, 10 and 20 mm, respectively (Fig. 3e). The PTFE film (thickness of 80 μm, width of 4 mm) was adhered vertical to the adhesive layer and peeled off at peeling angle of 180°. For an isosceles right triangle with a short side length of 10 mm, the widths of adhesive layers should be 2.36, 1.57, 2.36, and 2.36 mm, respectively, and the corresponding intervals should be 10, 10, and 14.1 mm, respectively. For an equilateral triangle with a side length of 10 mm, the widths of adhesive layers should be 2.09, 2.09, 2.09, and 2.09 mm, respectively, and the corresponding intervals should be 10, 10 and 10 mm, respectively. For the equilateral polygon with a side length of 10 mm, the widths of adhesive layers are 1.57, 1.26, and 1.05 mm with intervals of 10 mm for quadrangle, pentagon and hexagon, respectively.

### Rapid iceberg calving following removal of tightly packed pro-glacial MéLange [^9ed750dc]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Supplementary Fig. 1b shows the difference between the elevation estimates and the ArcticDEM for points near the radar (small white triangle and square, marked as 1 in Supplementary Fig. 1a). An obvious trend can be seen, indicating possible errors in the ArcticDEM, the baseline, or front-back tilt of the rack structure that supports the antennas. We excluded side-to-side tilt because it would cause a conical surface on the elevation map, which is not seen. Also, the antenna rack was mounted on stable rock, the antennas were bubble-leveled, and the system was protected from wind by a radome. We thus use a simple 1-D model based on the best fitting line of dH vs. slant range (red line in Supplementary Fig. 1b) to correct errors related to reference elevations and instrument geometry. Note that this assumes no systematic spatial bias in the ArcticDEM. Ideally, more evenly distributed points with known a priori elevations should be used as references for this correction. However in our case, only limited stationary areas were in the radar view.

### A non-spatial account of place and grid cells based on clustering models of concept learning [^59af4302]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Gridness in trapezoid environments

To simulate the effect of asymmetric boundaries in a trapezoid enclosure on gridness, we took cluster positions from simulations after learning in square environments, and ran an additional learning phase for 250,000 trials. In this new learning phase, the shape of the environment was now a trapezoid (the agent could only move to those locations), and the annealed learning rate schedule continued (starting at 0.0025, reducing to 0.002 at the end). The trapezoid dimensions were 5 × 24 × 50 pixels, closely matching the proportions in(0.2 × 0.9 × 1.9 meters; multiplied by (50/1.9) equals to 5.26, 23.7, and 50).

In order to test whether the asymmetric boundaries of the trapezoid affected gridness, the trapezoid was split into two halves and we computed the grid score for the spatial autocorrelogram on the left (wide) and right (narrow) side of the shape. Due to discretization, we split it as close to equal as possible. The wide half extended from the leftmost pixels to the 17th pixel (338 pixels), and the narrow side extended from the 18th pixel to the 50th pixel (339 pixels).

Dosage and Administration

REGRANEX is for topical use; it is not for oral, ophthalmic or intravaginal use.

The amount of REGRANEX to be applied depends upon the size of the ulcer area. To calculate the length of gel to apply lo the ulcer, measure the greatest length of the ulcer by the greatest width of the ulcer in either inches or centimeters. To calculate the length of gel in inches, use the formula shown below in Table 1, and to calculate the length of gel in centimeters, use the formula shown below in Table 2.

### "Opposite semilunar" variant of burow triangle in rotation and advancement flaps [^08173ef9]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The Burow triangle is an expedient suitably conceived either to facilitate sliding of the flap and avoid folds due to differences in skin distension or to correct coaptation of 2 cutting edges with a different length. In some cases, the triangle cannot be drawn in the right position either because of a particular anatomic site, for example, in proximity to commissures and openings, or because it is contraindicated to avoid unwelcome scar lines. In these cases, a semilunar ablation opposite to the direction of Burow triangle could be a valuable alternative. We report 3 cases where the opposite semilunar variant of Burow triangle was used in critical areas of the face.

### The 30-degree angle revisited [^eec48357]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The standard surgical ellipse, with 30 degrees apical angles and a length-to-width ratio of 2 or 3 to 1, works optimally on a flat surface. The same pattern, when used for excisions on strongly convex or concave surfaces, leads to distortions which may require significant revisions. The reason for these discrepancies is explainable by the mathematical differences between flat Euclidian geometry and curved non-Euclidian geometry. Understanding these basic mathematical principles as applied to cutaneous surgery should lead to better preoperative planning, fewer intraoperative surprises, and more pleasing results.

### Invariance properties of bacterial random walks in complex structures [^031312fd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The effect of size and shape

We have demonstrated that, for a fixed shape, the density of obstacles has a strong effect on the distribution of path lengths while leaving the mean value unchanged as long as the total internal accessible area remains the same.

We will now investigate the effects of shape and size on the path length distributions and again conclude that, although path distributions are very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the domain, mean path lengths and residence times can be accurately predicted using only the surface to perimeter ratio. We fabricate microstructures of circular, squared and triangular shapes all in four different sizes as shown in Fig. 2a. In all structures the obstacle density is fixed to N / S = 0.016 μm −2. All recorded trajectories are also plotted in Fig. 2a with a color map encoding the scaled path length L /. In Fig. 2b we plot for each structure the histogram of path lengths normalized by the expected valuein Eq. 4. As we move from circles to squares and then to triangles we observe that the corresponding histograms are characterized by larger frequencies for both short and long path lengths. The probability of short paths increases as we introduce convex corners and reduce their angle, as evidenced by the blue-violet color of the corners in squared and triangular structures. The presence of longer paths in triangles can be also understood noting that the normalized maximum straight paths for circles, square and triangles are respectively 4/ π,/ π and/ π (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite these qualitative and quantitative differences between histograms, mean path lengths are always close to 1 when normalized by the predicted valueas shown in Fig. 2b. The observed path length distributions can be very well reproduced by a Lorentz gas model where collisions with obstacles are described as instantaneous reorientation events. These events are assumed to occur with a constant probability per unit path length given by, where/ π is the rotational average cross section of line obstacles with length b (see Methods). For perfectly straight trajectories, circles and squares have path length distributions with a vertical asymptote. A strong peak is found at the location of this divergence and is progressively smeared as the linear size of the domain becomes larger than the mean free path. Upon increasing the size of the region a peak aroundappears due to bacteria that scatter close to the boundary, reorient and exit. The mix of these two types of trajectories gives rise to the observed double-peak structure. Differently for the triangle no asymptote is present in the P (L) for large λ, therefore only a peak atprogressively appears. These results show that P (L) depends strongly on the random walk properties (as the mean free path), and on the domain features (shape and size). Differently the mean valuesanddepend only on the surface to perimeter ratio of the domain as expressed by Eq. 4. Experimental values ofare shown Fig. 3a for all shapes and sizes. We find an excellent agreement with theory using the same value s = 6.3 μm 2 that was used previously to predict the experimental values ofas a function of the number of obstacles (see Fig. 1c). This value of s has also been used to calculateaccording to Eq. 5 which captures quantitatively well the experimental data as shown in Fig. 3b.

### Terahertz rectification in ring-shaped quantum barriers [^8ec2e06a]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

This can be further reduced to C 1 = 2 I 0 τ / τ rep by assuming τ ≪ τ rep (while this assumption is not rigorously valid under the current preamplifier bandwidth of 2 kHz presented here, we confirmed the same signal level for a larger bandwidth of 20 kHz by decreasing the sensitivity of the preamplifier under a large signal condition, thus justifying our assumption). Considering the root-mean-square output of the lock-in amplifier (C 1 / = measured current), we can write the total rectified charges for the single THz pulse by

We finally converted the measured current to the instantaneous tunneling peak current via dividing q THz by the measured tunneling current pulse width and taking the current through one side of the triangle (Fig. 5c) by considering the current distribution (Fig. 2b).

Modeling polarization-dependent response of tunneling currents in ring-shaped barriers

Under the THz field illumination, tunneling current through the triangle barrier sensitively depends on the incident polarization. We modeled the polarization-dependent total instantaneous current I total by the following equation (Supplementary Fig. 2a), where a i is the asymmetry factor for each side of our quantum barrier figure, J t (E) the tunneling current density as a function of the field strength E, E inc the incident field strength, θ i the angle between the THz induced surface current and the figure side, and i runs through the number of sides of the figure. Here, the asymmetry factor reflects the non-uniformity of a realistic barrier in our sample. The black line of Supplementary Fig. 2b shows the raw data presented in Fig. 2c for a triangle (Malus' law). Due to the slight non-uniformity of each side, a i values of 1, 0,75 and 0.67 were used for the fitting process. Using these parameters and taking J t (E) = J t (E inc), we can describe the full 360 degrees polarization responses as shown in Supplementary Fig. 2b. Together with the fittings for the square-shaped-barrier sample, the reconstructed polar plots of Fig. 2d are obtained.

### MetaFlowTrain: a highly parallelized and modular fluidic system for studying exometabolite-mediated inter-organismal interactions [^81acb65b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

3D design of the microchamber trains, connectors, and racks

Microchambers, connectors, Duran® bottle adapters, 15-mL Falcon adapters, and racks were all designed using Fusion 2.0.19440 (Autodesk).
The MetaFlowTrain microchamber is a rectangular microchamber with dimensions of 10 mm (width), 5 mm (length), and 8 mm (height), giving it a volume of 400 µL (Supplementary Fig. 4a). The bottom surface is composed of triangular teeth 1.5 mm high with a rectangular angle on the input side. These teeth demonstrated better retention of microbes and helped prevent clogging of the filters compared to microchambers without teeth (Supplementary Fig. 4b, c). The microchamber has one female Luer fitting as an inlet and one male Luer lock fitting as an outlet, compatible with standard syringe filters. A top hole with a 2-mm luer lock fitting allows for the inoculation and harvesting of microbes. Each microchamber can be easily connected on both sides with 0.22 µm syringe filters (PVDF membrane), allowing complete compartmentalization of the microchambers.
The MetaFlowTrain connector is a 2 cm-long connector with one female fitting (1 mm inner diameter) as an inlet and one male Luer Lock fitting as an outlet.
The Duran® bottle adapter has a 1 mm inner diameter male outlet on both the outside and inside. In the manuscript, we describe a model with 12 male outlets.
The 15-mL Falcon Cap adapter is a 15 mL falcon cap with a 2 mm inner diameter male inlet on top and outlet inside.
MetaFlowTrain racks are racks designed to help handle the microchambers. The racks are composed of five supports for five microchamber trains. They can be stacked and are provided for trains with one unique microchamber (approximately 6 cm long, and for two or more microchambers (approximately 12 cm long).

### Dense packing: surgical indications and technical considerations [^28ddea3a]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Dense packing is the philosophy of fitting more than 30 to 35 follicular unit grafts per square centimeter in one operation. The aim is to produce a more even, consistent, and natural looking flow of hair after just one procedure. Although desirable in principle, not all patients are suitable candidates nor is it possible to achieve in certain patients (eg, coarse or curly hair). Patients who have sufficient donor availability, reasonably stable hair loss, and high hair-to-skin color ratios are the ideal candidates. The authors highlight their philosophies and strategies for dense packing.

### Validity and reliability of the fitbit zip as a measure of preschool children's step count [^c5cbd36f]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Measurement

The Fitbit Zip is a small (width 2.8 cm×height 3.6 cm×depth 1.0 cm), lightweight (8 g), inexpensive (£49.99) and water-resistant commercial activity monitor, which contains a microelectromechanical tri-axial accelerometer and uses proprietary algorithms to calculate step counts recorded on the device. The majority of accelerometers and pedometers are typically secured to the right hip using an elastic belt and require adult (researcher/parent) input to ensure continued compliance and correct placement. Based on the manufacturer's claim that the Fitbit Zip can be 'worn on or very close to the body', including external pieces of clothing, each child wore two devices ('Fitbit 1' and 'Fitbit 2') securely positioned inside a custom-made, close-fitting cotton tabard with elasticated sides, which was designed to cover the children's own everyday clothing (see figure 1). The use of elasticated sides provided a close and comfortable fit, while simultaneously ensuring that the tabard with enclosed Fitbits always moved in exactly the same directions as the child's body. The function of the tabard was to combat issues of wear compliance identified with other accelerometers. The pockets on the inner face of the tabard were positioned one above the other over the child's right hip (Fitbit 1 placed in the upper pocket).

### Child passenger safety [^58a678d2]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Child passenger safety — Table 2 decision points on restraint and booster use state that infants and toddlers are at particularly high risk of head and spine injuries in motor vehicle crashes and that rear-facing CSSs provide optimal support; that the weight thresholds in the algorithm are minimum standards and, in general, children should remain in a child restraint system until they outgrow the weight or height limits; that most children 4–8 years of age are not large enough to fit properly in the vehicle seat belt and will require a CSS or booster seat for optimal restraint; and that most children under 4 ft 9 inches in height will not fit properly in vehicle lap and shoulder seat belts. The page frames a booster-readiness check — "Does child fit properly in the vehicle seat belt, usually around 4 ft 9 inches in height?" — and clarifies that if the answer is "no" to any of three questions about seat-back/knee position, shoulder belt placement, and lap belt position, "the child should use a booster seat". Children with certain temporary or permanent physical or behavioral conditions that preclude use of regular CSSs may require specialized restraint systems.

### Subicular neurons encode concave and convex geometries [^1eca6b36]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

To test the contribution of corner cells to spatial coding, we first trained the decoder using all neurons and then replaced the neural activity of corner cells with vectors of zeroes from the test data before making predictions. It is important to note that this activity removal procedure was only applied to the data used for predicting locations and not for training, as ablating neurons directly from the training data will result in the model learning to compensate for the missing information. We performed this analysis using ten-fold cross-validation for each mouse. To compare the performance of the corner cell removed decoder to the full decoder, we first calculated the 2D decoding error map of a session for each condition, and then obtained a map for error ratio by dividing the error map from the corner cell removed decoder by the error map from the full decoder (Extended Data Fig. 2g). We then compared the error ratio at the corners of the environment to the centre of the environment. For quadrant decoding in the square environment (Fig. 1l), we trained and tested the decoder using only the identified corner cells without the two-step constraint using ten-fold-cross-validation. For the shuffled condition, the decoder was trained and tested for 100 times using circularly shuffled calcium spikes over time. The probability in the correct quadrant was compared between the corner cell trained and shuffled decoders. For decoding the geometry of different environments (Extended Data Fig. 5d–f), we concatenated the data (time bin = 400 ms) with neurons tracked from circle, triangle, square and hexagon environments for each animal. The data was then resampled from an 8 cm diameter circular area either in the centre or near the corner/boundary of the environment. The data length was matched between the two areas and the decoding labels for each environment were identical (numerical, 1 for circle, 2 for square, 3 for triangle, 4 for hexagon). Then the decoder was trained and tested for each mouse using 10-fold-cross-validation.

### A geometrical solution underlies general neural principle for serial ordering [^29e10af8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Serial thinking is a cognitive function underpinning almost any of our daily actions. Our brain continuously encodes temporal sequences that we can remember, process, and replay, such as the subsequent steps to make a sandwich or the path from home to work. Serial reasoning underlies logical deduction, categorical and hierarchical thinking, which are crucial to many higher-level cognitive functions (episodic memory, algebraic computation, language, and many others). A still widely open challenge is to find a unique framework in which all these different abilities could be explained, and several hypotheses about how sequences are mentally encoded have been proposed.

One of these hypotheses is that sequence information in serial learning tasks is represented in the brain as an ordinal knowledge of the items in the list, independently from their timing or their spatial location. The ranking of the elements of a sequence based on the assigned order implies an abstraction of their arrangement, together with the simultaneous encoding of the ordinal and item-specific information. Notably, these are the building blocks of a more general framework named "compositional computation".

### Nanotomy-based production of transferable and dispersible graphene nanostructures of controlled shape and size [^6c570699]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Because of the edge states and quantum confinement, the shape and size of graphene nanostructures dictate their electrical, optical, magnetic and chemical properties. The current synthesis methods for graphene nanostructures do not produce large quantities of graphene nanostructures that are easily transferable to different substrates/solvents, do not produce graphene nanostructures of different and controlled shapes, or do not allow control of GN dimensions over a wide range (up to 100 nm). Here we report the production of graphene nanostructures with predetermined shapes (square, rectangle, triangle and ribbon) and controlled dimensions. This is achieved by diamond-edge-induced nanotomy (nanoscale-cutting) of graphite into graphite nanoblocks, which are then exfoliated. Our results show that the edges of the produced graphene nanostructures are straight and relatively smooth with an I(D)/I(G) of 0.22–0.28 and roughness < 1 nm. Further, thin films of GN-ribbons exhibit a bandgap evolution with width reduction (0, 10 and ~35 meV for 50, 25 and 15 nm, respectively).

### How dimensions can guide surgical planning and training: a systematic review of kambin's triangle [^ac197fc2]. Neurosurgical Focus (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The authors sought to analyze the current literature to determine dimensional trends across the lumbar levels of Kambin's triangle, clarify the role of imaging techniques for preoperative planning, and understand the effect of inclusion of the superior articular process (SAP). This compiled knowledge of the triangle is needed to perform successful procedures, reduce nerve root injuries, and help guide surgeons in training.

Methods

The authors performed a search of multiple databases using combinations of keywords: Kambin's triangle, size, measurement, safe triangle, and bony triangle. Articles were included if their main findings included measurement of Kambin's triangle. The PubMed, Scopus, Ovid, Cochrane, Embase, and Medline databases were systematically searched for English-language articles with no time frame restrictions through July 2022.

Results

Eight studies comprising 132 patients or cadavers were included in the study. The mean ± SD age was 66.69 ± 9.6 years, and 53% of patients were male. Overall, the size of Kambin's triangle increased in area moving down vertebral levels, with L5-S1 being the largest (133.59 ± 4.36 mm2). This trend followed a linear regression model when SAP was kept (p = 0.008) and removed (p = 0.003). There was also a considerable increase in the size of Kambin's triangle if the SAP was removed.

Conclusions

Here, the authors have provided the first reported systematic review of the literature of Kambin's triangle, its measurements at each lumbar level, and key areas of debate related to the definition of the working safe zone. These findings indicate that CT is heavily utilized for imaging of the safe zone, the area of Kambin's triangle tends to increase caudally, and variation exists between patients. Future studies should focus on using advanced imaging techniques for preoperative planning and establishing guidelines for surgeons.

### Electrophysiological evidence of space-number associations in 9-month-old infants [^f83ee808]. Child Development (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Trial structure and exemplar stimuli. Examples of (a) a valid trial, in which a right‐sided target is cued by a large numerical array, and (b) the two‐item and the nine‐item arrays used as numerical cues.

The numerical cue consisted of two‐item or a nine‐item arrays, that were matched for the cumulative area occupied by the items (~8 cm 2) and their total contour length (~34.5 cm), as well as for the size of the virtual square subtended by the items (~52 cm 2). The rectangular‐shaped items composing the two‐item and the nine‐item arrays measured, respectively, 0.5 × 8.1 cm and 0.73 × 1.2 cm; they were arranged randomly within the virtual square, with their shorter side aligned with the horizontal plane. Each numerosity (i.e. 2 or 9) could appear in three different colors (yellow, green, and pink) and four orientations (two leftward, and two rightward), created by rotating the array to the right by 90° three times, which resulted in 12 different arrays per numerosity (Figure 1). On each trial, the displayed numerical cue was selected randomly from the pool of 12 arrays, and the displayed target stimulus was selected randomly from a pool of sixteen different images of a static colorful ball (1.75 cm in radius) varying in color (Figure 1). Trials were administered in blocks, each block composed of eight valid trials (i.e. left‐sided target preceded by a two‐item cue, and right‐sided target preceded by a nine‐item cue) and eight invalid trials (i.e. left‐sided target preceded by a nine‐item cue, and right‐sided target preceded by a two‐item cue). Valid and invalid trials appeared randomly, and cue numerosity and target position were equally distributed within each block. There was no restriction on the number of trial blocks presented to each participant: The experimental session terminated when the infant had looked away from the screen during five consecutive trials.

### Abusive head trauma in infants and children: technical report [^629ea8f2]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Accidental trauma differential — obtaining an optimal history and estimating fall heights notes that there are few quantitative studies regarding the most reliable way to elicit a history, but some methods have been suggested, including facilitating an initial uninterrupted narrative of the history, and gathering specific details has been recommended (positioning/holding, impacted anatomic structures and surfaces, and from what height the child fell); most standard furniture dimensions include couches and other seating heights about 18 to 20 inches, beds 1 to 3 feet, and changing tables and countertops 2.5 to 3 feet; children held by parents at shoulder level typically have head-to-ground falls of approximately 4 to 5 feet; biomechanical scene reconstructions have shown that most caregivers overestimate fall height; and most papers define low-height or short-distance falls as under 3 to 4 feet.

### The circle-fit method helps make reliable cortical thickness measurements regardless of humeral length [^dccd9f59]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Materials and Methods

With institutional review board approval, this study used AP scout view localizers taken from full-length 1.25 mm sliced computed tomography (CT) scans from 19 deidentified fresh-frozen cadaveric specimens. A total of 19 humeri (15 left and 4 right humeri, age 37.5 [20.5] years [range: 16–73], 12 men, 7 females, and mean length of 32.0 [2.6] cm) were used. Soft tissues were manually removed from the humeri prior to being CT scanned. As described in previous studies of humeri, steps were taken to standardize the AP projection.- This was done by placing the humeral head directly on the platform (equivalent to the "cassette" in conventional nondigital imaging) with the long axis of the diaphysis aligned parallel to the platform. Each bone was externally rotated to achieve the true AP plane, which resembles closely the method of Zhang et al. The diaphysis was supported with modeling clay to avoid inadvertent rotation.

Images were imported into an open source medical image viewer (Horos,) and measurements of HHD using the CFM, distance from superior aspect of humeral head to proximal location of Tingart measurements (Tingart distance), distance from superior aspect of humeral head to proximal location of the Mather measurements (Mather distance), and overall HL were made.

Circle-Fit Method

An adjustable digitized circle was visually best fit to the periphery of the humeral head, and the diameter of the humeral head was recorded (Figure 3). In accordance with this method, the distal-most edge of the circle was defined as M1 (metaphysis = surgical neck region). Seven successive levels (locations) were then separated by 1 cm, producing a second metaphyseal level (M2) and 6 diaphyseal levels (D1-D6). The HHD was then determined as a percent of HL.

Tingart Method

Using the Tingart method, a 2-cm tall rectangle was fit to the proximal diaphysis at the most proximal level of the humeral diaphysis where the endosteal surfaces of the lateral and medial cortices become parallel to each other (the proximal most edge of the rectangle is placed where parallelism starts). The distance from the superior aspect of the humeral head to the superior aspect of the rectangle was then recorded as the Tingart distance (Figure 1). This "Tingart distance" was then determined as a percent of HL.

### A short primer on lung stereology [^2276eaf7]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Estimation of the volume of the fixed lung (Step 3) according to the Archimedes principle. Based on buoyancy, the weight of the displaced fluid (e.g. saline) is measured. Since the fixed lung is lighter than the fluid, it tends to emerge and thus has to be submerged by a coiled wire connected to a lab stand. The lung and wire must not touch the wall of the beaker. The wire has a mark to adjust it to the fluid level before and during measurements to make sure it does not contribute to the measured volume. The volume of the lung (in mL or cm 3) is shown as weight gain (in g)

Fig. 3
Estimation of the volume of the fixed lung (Step 3) according to the Cavalieri estimator and subsequent sampling. a The lung is embedded in agar and cut into slices of equal thickness t, with a random start in the agar outside the lung, thus following the principles of systematic uniform random sampling (SURS). Slice thickness t is adjusted to obtain around 8–10 slices. b The slices are placed on a tray with a consistent orientation, e.g. all apical surfaces upwards. The total volume of the lung, V, is calculated as the sum of the cut surface areas, A, of all slices (indicated in red in a) multiplied by the slice thickness t: V = ΣA · t. The cut surface areas, A, are estimated by counting points, P, hitting the cut surface areas using a grid with a known area per point, a(p), as: V = ΣP · a(p) · t. A constant definition for a point "hit", P, is needed, e.g. the upper right corner of the crosses that symbolize the test points (indicated by red arrow). Based on this definition, correct point counts are shown in red. Note that in this example, where the slices are oriented with their apical side upwards, the first slice does not contain an apical cut surface and thus does not contribute any point counts. Accordingly, the uncut pleura at the lateral sides, here visible on the first four slices when viewed from above (grey), is also excluded (black test points) whereas the cut pleura at the apical surfaces (black) is included (red test points). c This collection of fixed lung slices can also be used as the starting point for SURS (Step 4). For example, if 3 different embedding protocols shall be used in the study (e.g. embedding in glycol methacrylate for light microscopic stereology, embedding in paraffin for immunohistochemistry and embedding of smaller subsamples in epon for electron microscopy), the slices are randomly assigned to these 3 protocols with a constant sampling interval (here 3). Thus, slices 1, 4 and 7 will be embedded according to protocol 1, slices 2, 5 and 8 will be embedded according to protocol 2 and slices 3, 6 and 9 will be embedded according to protocol 3. Note that all slices have to be sampled for embedding, even those who had to be excluded from the Cavalieri estimator (here slice 1). Also note that each of these 3 subsamples obtained by SURS constitutes a fraction of 1/3 of the whole lung. They can therefore also be used as starting point for fractionator sampling. d The principle of SURS consists of a random component (the selection of the first sample) and a systematic uniform component (the constant sampling interval for the selection of all other samples). SURS also applies to the subsequent stages of the sampling sequence, such as the selection of smaller subsamples (e.g. for electron microscopy) or the selection of fields of view on histologic sections from an embedded lung slice. The sampling interval is adjusted to achieve the desired number of samples

### Bigger versus smaller: children's understanding of size comparison words becomes more precise with age [^2da129dd]. Child Development (2024). Medium credibility.

Analysis plan

The data from paper coding sheets were input into a spreadsheet by trained coders. This included demographic information, trial information (e.g. trial number, word used, experiment structure), and the structures participants built and their responses to the experimenter's questions. The participant structures were drawn or explained on the sheet, and we quantified them with the total number of blocks, and the maximum number of blocks in the X, Y, and Z‐dimensions. The dimensions were defined with respect to the participant and are depicted in Figure 1c. The X‐dimension was the axis parallel to the tabletop and the participant (e.g. four blocks lined up in a row from left to right is four blocks in the X‐dimension). The Y‐dimension was defined as height (e.g. four blocks stacked on top of each other in a column is four blocks in the Y‐dimension). The Z‐dimension was defined as parallel to the tabletop, but perpendicular to the X‐dimension along the table (e.g. four blocks lined up in a flat row going away from the participant is four blocks in the Z‐dimension). Because we used comparative words, their meaning is defined with respect to a baseline reference (i.e. the structure built by Experimenter 1). Thus, we also described the participant's structure with reference to how each dimension differed from that baseline structure (i.e. whether the participant's structure decreased, did not change, or increased in each dimension). The initial baseline structure was either Long (four blocks lined up in a row; 4 blocks in the X‐dimension, 1 block in the Y‐dimension, and 1 block in the Z‐dimension) or Tall (1 block in the X‐dimension, 4 blocks in the Y‐dimension, and 1 block in the Z‐dimension; see Figure 1). Most trials (89% of the final dataset) consisted of shapes that were easy to define in terms of the number of blocks in each dimension (e.g. a series of blocks lined up in a horizontal row; a series of blocks stacked in a single column). In the remaining cases, children built more creative structures (e.g. a row of blocks horizontal with an extra column of more vertical blocks at the end; pyramids). Each trial was coded independently by at least two research assistants to ensure proper data entry and agreements of interpretation of the number of blocks in each dimension. Trials where there was uncertainty about the structure were excluded.

Osteoporosis clinical evaluation — postmenopausal patients: Clinical evaluation includes medical history, physical examination, and measurement of changes in height, and medical history should assess for significant risk factors and secondary causes; an unexplained fragility fracture is diagnostic of osteoporosis even with normal or absent bone mineral density (BMD) test results. Height loss can indicate an asymptomatic vertebral fracture, with a change of greater than 0.8 inches (2 cm) during 1–3 years appearing to be the optimal threshold for evaluation for vertebral fracture. The National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends vertebral imaging for patients who have lost 1.5 inches (4 cm) or more from peak height at age 20 years or 0.8 inches (2 cm) or more from a previously documented measurement. Vertebral compression fractures can be diagnosed on X-ray or by vertebral fractures assessment at the time of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and assessments can be performed using either lateral thoracic and spine X-ray or lateral vertebral fracture assessment available on most DXA machines. In a cohort of 3,124 postmenopausal women aged 65 years and older, height loss of more than 2 inches (5 cm) was associated with increased hip fracture risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.50; 95% CI 1.06–2.12) and spine fracture risk (HR, 1.48; 95% CI 1.20–1.83) after adjustment for BMD and vertebral fracture incidence.

### Detecting the ultra low dimensionality of real networks [^1811c513]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

We should also mention that some networks present anomalous statistics of higher-order edge cycles that cannot be perfectly matched by the geometric soft configuration model in any dimension. The typical anomalous situation is one in which, for a given value of edge triangles, the value of edge squares or pentagons is higher than the maximum value when dimension D = 1. In such cases, our method would predict an inferred dimension D ✱ = 1, but such networks were not included in the datasets we have explored in this work. Also, themodel will tend to give and upper bound to the dimension of real networks with spurious clustering, like in one-mode projections of bipartite networks, but the underestimation is minimized if the network has a heterogeneous degree distribution. Nervertheless, in general the model provides a very good description of the structure of real networks proving that their latent geometry is hyperbolic.

### Diagnostic sweat testing: the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation guidelines [^9394b93d]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2007). Medium credibility.

Cystic Fibrosis Foundation diagnostic sweat testing — collection materials, stimulation parameters, and minimum sample amounts are defined: sweat must be collected on gauze or filter paper or in a Macroduct coil after iontophoresis; for gauze or filter paper, the stimulated area must be 2 x 2 inches (total area, 4 square inches) using a slightly smaller electrode (eg, 1 1/2 x 1 1/2 inches) or other electrode sizes that cover greater than 50% of the 2 x 2 inch area, iontophoresis should be carried out using USP grade pilocarpine for 5 minutes, collection is from a single site using 2 x 2 inch gauze or filter paper, and the minimum sample weight is 75 mg in 30 minutes; if a Macroduct coil is used, sweat must be stimulated with a disposable Pilogel electrode using the Webster Sweat Inducer for 5 minutes, and after a 30-minute collection the minimum acceptable sample is 15 μL; to ensure a valid result, the average sweat rate should exceed 1 g/m^2 per minute and the area of stimulation and collection must be of similar size.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^175aa821]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Rural water supplies — well construction and protection guidance states that 15% of people in the United States are on individual water supply systems, and a table outlines well types and dimensions; for example, Driven wells have depth 0–50 with diameter 1.25 to 2 inches, and Drilled (rotary type) wells have depth 0–1,000 with diameter 4 to 24 inches. To help assure potability, drainage should be away from a well, the casings of the well should be sealed with grout, and research suggests that a minimum of 10 feet of soil is essential to filter unwanted biologic organisms; wells should be protected from surface water entering directly into the top of the well, groundwater entering below ground level without filtering through at least 10 feet of earth, and surface water entering the space between the well casing and surrounding soil. Additional considerations include that in areas with karst topography, wells of any type are a health risk because of the long distances that both chemical and biologic contaminants can travel, that a well should be located in such a way that it is accessible for maintenance, inspection, and pump or pipe replacement when necessary, and that driven wells are typically installed in sand or soil and do not penetrate base rock.

### Child with suspected short stature [^c5f8ec97]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis of short stature — common causes and idiopathic short stature criteria are specified as follows: Common causes include familial or intrinsic short stature, constitutional delay of growth and puberty, idiopathic short stature, and small for gestational age without catch up growth by 2 years. In constitutional delay, children typically cross percentiles downwards in the first 3 years and then grow at a normal growth velocity on the lower percentiles or just below the 3rd percentile, and bone age is delayed. Idiopathic short stature is defined as height < 2.25 SD below the mean for age and sex (shortest 1.2% of children) – FDA definition, with notes that patients are unlikely to attain adult height in the normal range (less than 63 inches for boys and 59 inches for girls) and that diagnostic evaluation excludes other causes of short stature.

### Collective self-caging of active filaments in virtual confinement [^e5ed295e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Table 1
Simulation parameters corresponding to the data shown in the main text (unless specified otherwise)

For sufficiently large U 0 and d, filaments experience strong repulsive forces that prevent overlaps and thus reproduce a strictly 2D confinement. Decreasing either of these two parameters, we observe crossing between filaments similar to those reported in the experiments (see Fig. 1 d). Lowering U 0 at fixed d = σ /2 for the filament density used in our simulations, this transition quickly leads to a vanishing of the interactions between filaments, leading to structureless aggregates in the illuminated region. On the other hand, decreasing d at fixed U 0 allows for a larger intermediate regime where filaments can cross each other while still effectively aligning nematically when their density reaches large enough values. As discussed in the main text and shown in Fig. 3, this regime where 0.15 ≲ d / σ ≲ 0.35 precisely corresponds to the emergence of nontrivial patterns at the illumination boundary.

The data presented in Fig. 2 d was obtained by varying the radius of the illuminated disk in the range [5 σ; 80 σ] while keeping the system size fixed. In Fig. 4, we illustrate various geometries with the following specifications: ellipse with major and minor radii of 55 σ and 40 σ, respectively (a), ellipse with major and minor radii of 66 σ and 15 σ, respectively (b), square of side length 50 σ (c), trapezoid with height 55 σ, length of the first base 124 σ, and of the second base 62 σ (d), equilateral triangle with height 80 σ (e), and a teardrop made from one equilateral triangle with height 80 σ and a semicircle with radius 23 σ (f).

Estimation of the dimension of real networks.

Mean densities of edge triangles, squares, and pentagons for the Internet at the autonomous system level (A – C), the email network within the Enron company (D – F), and a human connectome (G – I).

The cluttering of the curves for the different dimensions in the cycles phase space affects the accuracy of the estimated dimension of a real network, which is calculated as the proportion of random surrogates of the real network whose dimension is inferred correctly by the corresponding K-NN classifier. Note that accuracy is a measure of the resolution capacity of the dimensionality detection method (error rate associated to the K-NN classifier), which is informative about the error in the best estimate of the embedding dimension because it quantifies how discernible is the dimension of a real network, and the more discernible it is the higher the likelihood that the method selects the best value. Confusion matrices in Fig. 3, defined as the probability of predicting D* in a network generated with dimension D as a function of clustering and heterogeneity in the network, complement the information provided by accuracy. It should be noted that in more than half of the 33 networks analyzed in this work the accuracy reached values of over 90%, and in more than 40% the accuracy is of 99% or absolute.

### A proposal for a primary screening tool:' keep your waist circumference to less than half your height' [^4a3f288d]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Use of BMI

The Body Mass Index (BMI) has served us well as a proxy for obesity for many years, but it has always been recognised that it does not differentiate between the muscular and the overweight, except at very high BMIs. But there is an even more important problem with BMI. Even in the overweight, it is only a proxy for total fat in the body and it does not distinguish between individuals with different types of fat distribution.

The first BMI chart, which displayed BMI as a function of weight (horizontal axis) and height (vertical axis) using contour lines for different values of BMI, first appeared in 1981 in John Garrow's book Treat Obesity Seriously. Since the early 1980s, the classic BMI chart has been used extensively to assess the severity of obesity. Healthy weight for height is usually defined as a BMI between 18.5 and 25 kg/m 2, overweight as equal to or more than 25 and less than 30, and obesity as a BMI of equal to or more than 30.

### Delineation of two intracranial areas and the perpendicular intracranial width is sufficient for intracranial volume estimation [^d043fc49]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Fig. 4
Pearson correlations found during the validation step. The correlations with 95% confidence intervals for method (M) 1 are shown with an x marker, for method 2 with square markers, for method 3 with circle markers and for method 4 with plus sign markers. For each method, except for method 1, the correlations for coronal (Cor), sagittal (Sag) and transversal (Tra) intracranial areas are presented from left to right. The dashed line marks the y-coordinate for correlations of 0.99

Starting side

See Table 1. For method 3 with sagittal ICAs, there was a negligible difference in the correlation to fully delineated ICV between using the position indices consistently from the patients' left and from the right, respectively. When using the indices randomly from either the patients' left or right, the correlation dropped slightly.

Comparison of correlations

Figure 5 visualises the confidence intervals for the differences in correlations among methods 2, 3 and 4. With 95% confidence, method 4 with sagittal ICAs will result in estimates that have a higher correlation to fully delineated ICVs than all other estimates, except those from method 3 with sagittal ICAs.

Fig. 5
Comparison of correlations. With 95% confidence, the actual differences in correlations between methods 2 to 4 (M2–4) are within the height of the plotted boxes. The unit of the y-axes is the Pearson correlation and ranges between −0.1 and 0.1. Above each plot, the confidence intervals are also given in numbers rounded to the nearest thousandth. The titles of the columns tell which correlation was used as minuend and the titles of the rows which correlation was used as subtrahend when calculating the confidence intervals. The planes denote a correlation difference of zero and are red when the confidence intervals pass through zero, indicating that the actual difference between the two compared methods might be zero.

Fig. 4
Left: baseline energy (red hatched triangle ABE), on which the inspiratory energy associated with the tidal volume (area BCDE) is added. Yellow hatched area to the right of line BC represents the inspiratory dissipated energy needed to move the gas, to overcome surface tension forces, to make the extracellular sheets slide across one another (tissue resistances), and possibly to reinflate collapsed pulmonary units. Light green hatched area on the left of line BC defines the elastic energy (trapezoid EBCD) cyclically added to the respiratory system during inspiration. Total area included in the triangle ACD is the total energy level present in the respiratory system at end inspiration. Right: energy changes during expiration. Of the total energy accumulated at end inspiration (triangle ACD), the area of the trapezoid EBCD is the energy released during expiration. The fraction of energy included in the hysteresis area (light blue hatched area) is dissipated into the respiratory system, while the remaining area (dark blue hatched area) is energy dissipated into the atmosphere through the connecting circuit. Note that whatever maneuver (as controlled expiration) reduces the hysteresis area will reduce the energy dissipated into the respiratory system (potentially dangerous?).

### Shaping micro-clusters via inverse jamming and topographic close-packing of microbombs [^7662020f]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Programming the degrees of freedom in topographic clusters

Empirically, the final clusters can be programmed by the number of seeds (N = 1, 2, 3,…) and the number of vertices of the well (V = 0, 3, 4, 5, and 6 for circles, triangles, squares, pentagons, and hexagons, respectively) providing topographic confinement. As shown in Fig. 5a, we analyzed over 2000 clusters. In the confinement of N = 1, single-cell particles could be created by filling the microwell, imitating the shape of the confinement. For N > 1, the differentiated cleavages were symmetric when k = V / N yielded an integer k, i.e. (V, N) = (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 3), (4, 2), (6, 2), and (6, 3). Otherwise, clusters with random microbomb assembly were observed. Regarding the orientation of the constituent cells, the (6, 2) combination, for example, could program two types of symmetric clusters: one with a cleavage wall normal to one of the 6 edges where the interior angle of a unit is 3 π (marked as a black line), and the other containing two isosceles trapezoids (internal angle is 2 π) shares the space diagonally (marked as a blue line). In addition, it is important to note that since there are no predictable cues for the cleavage orientation in the case of the singularity (V = 0), the perfect programming of clusters (100%) for all cases of N is warranted from the non-pinning mobility in confinement. The SEM images in Fig. 5b, c reveal the hollow nature of the clusters from a triangular prism (Fig. 5b) and a cube with a cleavage connecting four cells (Fig. 5c) after focused ion beam (FIB) milling. At room temperature, the shell became glassy again, and thus the microbombs could maintain the packed shape permanently.

### Mononucleosis and athletic participation: an evidence-based subject review [^23973741]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis spleen imaging prioritizes ultrasound for assessing splenomegaly and offers reference methods and thresholds; MRI has not been studied as a means of assessing splenic size and although CT can offer superior organ detail and exact spleen measurements, radiation and cost limit its use, so ultrasound is the preferred modality for evaluation of splenomegaly; splenic size can be determined by breadth, thickness, and longitudinal dimensions, and these 3 measurements can be multiplied and divided by 27 to determine a splenic volumetric index, while literature standards define the upper limits of normal for longitudinal diameter as 12–14 cm (4.72–5.51 inches) in adults, and linear ultrasound measurements have a high correlation with CT volume assessments.

### Structural puzzles in virology solved with an overarching icosahedral design principle [^37e4c114]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Viruses have evolved protein containers with a wide spectrum of icosahedral architectures to protect their genetic material. The geometric constraints defining these container designs, and their implications for viral evolution, are open problems in virology. The principle of quasi-equivalence is currently used to predict virus architecture, but improved imaging techniques have revealed increasing numbers of viral outliers. We show that this theory is a special case of an overarching design principle for icosahedral, as well as octahedral, architectures that can be formulated in terms of the Archimedean lattices and their duals. These surface structures encompass different blueprints for capsids with the same number of structural proteins, as well as for capsid architectures formed from a combination of minor and major capsid proteins, and are recurrent within viral lineages. They also apply to other icosahedral structures in nature, and offer alternative designs for man-made materials and nanocontainers in bionanotechnology.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^5322837b]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Termite prevention for homes — according to Potter, homeowners can reduce the risk for termite attack by adhering to the following suggestions: eliminate wood contact with the ground, do not allow moisture to accumulate near the home's foundation, and reduce humidity in crawl spaces. Most building codes state that crawl space area should be vented at a rate of 1 square foot per 150 square feet of crawl space area; this rate can be reduced for crawl spaces equipped with a polyethylene or equivalent vapor barrier to one square foot per 300 to 500 square feet of crawl space area, and vent placement design includes positioning one vent within 3 feet of each building corner with a minimum of two vents per side.

### Arbitrary lattice symmetries via block copolymer nanomeshes [^8ad6128c]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Self-assembly of block copolymers is a powerful motif for spontaneously forming well-defined nanostructures over macroscopic areas. Yet, the inherent energy minimization criteria of self-assembly give rise to a limited library of structures; diblock copolymers naturally form spheres on a cubic lattice, hexagonally packed cylinders and alternating lamellae. Here, we demonstrate multicomponent nanomeshes with any desired lattice symmetry. We exploit photothermal annealing to rapidly order and align block copolymer phases over macroscopic areas, combined with conversion of the self-assembled organic phase into inorganic replicas. Repeated photothermal processing independently aligns successive layers, providing full control of the size, symmetry and composition of the nanoscale unit cell. We construct a variety of symmetries, most of which are not natively formed by block copolymers, including squares, rhombuses, rectangles and triangles. In fact, we demonstrate all possible two-dimensional Bravais lattices. Finally, we elucidate the influence of nanostructure on the electrical and optical properties of nanomeshes.

### On-site growth of perovskite nanocrystal arrays for integrated nanodevices [^c4125246]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

To investigate the effect of meniscus asymmetry on the nanocrystal positioning, we fabricated wells of different geometries as shown in Fig. 2a. These include a square, an equilateral triangle, and two isosceles triangles with corner angles (44°, 68°, 68°) and (20°, 80°, 80°). The critical contact angles associated with these well designs are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. To allow direct comparison between the different geometries, the wells are made to support an equal volume of the precursor solution. For this, the well dimensions are selected to yield a constant area corresponding to that of a 150 nm × 150 nm square, while maintaining a constant height of 22 nm for all samples. The wells are further made to have a contact angle of 50° to the precursor solution, through a second functionalization step. This contact angle is controlled by varying the duration of the fluorination step, an example of which is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5a. Nanocrystals, 38 ± 3 nm in lateral dimension, are obtained for all the well geometries, which is as expected given the wells' constant volume (Fig. 2c). Depending on the geometry, instances of multiple nanocrystals per well are also observed. Notably, an asymmetric well geometry favors the formation of single crystals with the yield improving to 80% for the (20°, 80°, 80°) template (Fig. 2d).

### Cochlear duct length-one size fits all? [^5e3c9508]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Recent studies demonstrated the utility of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans in measuring basal cochlear length and cochlear insertion depths. These studies showed significant variations in the anatomy of the cochlea amongst humans. The aim of our study was to investigate for gender and racial variations in the basal turn length of the human cochlea in an Asian population.

Method

HRCT temporal bone data from year 1997 till 2012 of patients with normally developed cochleae who reported with otologic disease was obtained. Reconstruction of the full basal turn was performed for both ears. The largest distance from the midpoint of the round window, through the midmodiolar axis, to the lateral wall was measured (distance A). Length of the lateral wall of the cochlea to the first turn (360°) was calculated and statistically analyzed.

Results

HRCT temporal bone data from 161 patients was initially obtained. Four patients were subsequently excluded from the study as they were of various other racial groups. Study group therefore comprised of 157 patients (314 cochleae). Mean distance A was statistically different between the two sides of the ear (right 9.09mm; left 9.06mm; p = 0.0069). Significant gender and racial differences were also found. Mean distance A was 9.17mm in males and 8.97mm in females (p = 0.0016). The racial groups were Chinese (39%), Malay (38%) and Indian (22%). Between racial groups, mean distance A was 9.11mm (Chinese), 9.11mm (Malays) and 8.99mm (Indians). The mean basal turn lengths ranged from 19.71mm to 25.09mm. With gender factored in, significant variation in mean basal turn lengths was found across all three racial groups (p = 0.04).

Conclusion

The view of the basal turn of the cochlea from HRCT is simple to obtain and reproducible. This study found significant differences in basal cochlear length amongst male and female Asian patients, as well as amongst various racial groups. This has implications for cochlear electrode insertion as well as electrode array design.

### Kambin's triangle: definition and new classification schema [^d2589bae]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

Kambin's triangle is an anatomical corridor used to access critical structures in a variety of spinal procedures. It is considered a safe space because it is devoid of vascular and neural structures of importance. Nonetheless, there is currently significant variation in the literature regarding the exact dimensions and anatomical borders of Kambin's triangle. This confusion was originally caused by leaving the superior articular process (SAP) unassigned in the description of the working triangle, despite Kambin identifying that structure in his original report. The SAP is the most relevant structure to consider when accessing the transforaminal corridor. Leaving the SAP unassigned has led to an open-handed application of the term "Kambin's triangle". That single eponym currently has two potential meanings, one meaning for endoscopic surgeons working through a corridor in the intact spine and a second meaning for surgeons accessing the disc space after a complete or partial facetectomy. Nevertheless, an anatomical corridor should have one consistent definition to clearly communicate techniques and use of instrumentation performed through that space. As such, the authors propose a new surgically relevant classification of this corridor. Assigning the SAP a border requires adding another dimension to the triangle, thereby transforming it into a prism. The term "Kambin's prism" indicates the assignment of a border to all relevant anatomical structures, allowing for a uniform definition of the 3D space. From there, the classification scheme considers the expansion of the corridor and the extent of bone removal, with a particular focus on the SAP.

### "Roof" technique-a modified aortotomy closure in Y-incision aortic root enlargement upsizing 3–4 valve sizes [^4c3e8c74]. JTCVS Techniques (2022). Medium credibility.

Details of Aortic Root Enlargement

Details of aortic root enlargement are discussed in Video 1. A complete transverse aortotomy was made 1 cm above the sinotubular junction (STJ). The stenotic aortic valve was excised, and the annulus was debrided. The Y incision was made from the aortotomy, through the left-non commissure post into the aortomitral curtain. The incision was extended in a "Y" fashion undermining the left and noncoronary aortic annulus to their respective nadir, but not reaching the muscular portion on the left or the membranous septum on the right. A rectangular-shaped Hemashield Dacron patch (Maquet, Getinge Group) was trimmed in width slightly longer than the distance between the 2 cusp nadirs. This patch was sewn to the aortomitral curtain/mitral annulus from left to right fibrous trigone with running 4–0 PROLENE suture (Ethicon). The suture line was transitioned to the undermined aortic annulus at the nadir of both the left and noncoronary sinuses, sutured along the longitudinal length of the patch up to the level of the transverse aortotomy incision, and secured. The valve sizer upsized by 3 sizes was placed in the enlarged root touching 3 nadirs of the aortic annulus and the position of the sizer on the patch was marked to guide the placement of valve sutures. The nonpledgeted 2–0 ETHIBOND sutures (Ethicon) were placed along the native aortic annulus in a noneverting fashion and from outside in on the patch. The bioprosthesis was placed with one strut facing the left–right commissural post to ensure the left and right coronary ostia were at the sides of this strut without occlusion. The sutures at the nadirs of the noncoronary and the left coronary sinuses, which were the lowest points of the aortic annulus, were tied first to seat the valve well and to prevent paravalvular leak. The patch above the bioprosthesis was then trimmed in a triangular shape like a roof, and an additional 2 cm longitudinal aortotomy was made at the posterior side of the ascending aorta to match the 2 sides of the triangle-shaped patch (the roof). The aortotomy was then closed with the triangle patch inserted into the proximal ascending aorta with 4–0 PROLENE suture (Figure 2). Postoperative computed tomography angiogram (CTA) at 3 months showed the root, STJ, and proximal ascending were all adequately enlarged compared with the preoperative CTA (Figure 2, E and F).

### A non-spatial account of place and grid cells based on clustering models of concept learning [^7c3febb5]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Due to the asymmetrical shape of the trapezoid environment, the procedure for generating a movement trajectory above leads to a slightly biased sampling of the wide part of the trapezoid, and less exploration of the middle and top parts of the shape. To deal with this, we made a slight change to the possible steps after generating a step that brings the agent out of the environment, described below. For each trial, the step was generated as before. If the generated step was out of the environment, the step was cancelled, and the next step was determined as follows. If the step generated would have brought the agent out of the bottom of the trapezoid, the next step was sampled from [0, 0, 1, 1] (stay or up). If the step brings the agent out to the top, the next step was sampled from [−1, −1, 0, 0] (down or stay). When the step takes the agent out of the left of the trapezoid, then the next step to be sampled on the horizontal axis were [0, 1, 1, 2, 4], towards the inner portion of the environment. If the step took the agent out of the right side of the trapezoid, the next step was generated as before, from [−4, −2, −1, −1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4]. This is because when the agent is out of the trapezoid on the horizontal (left-right) axis, the agent could still be in the middle of the shape on the vertical axis, since the shape becomes more narrow as it reaches the right. Finally, when it lands exactly in the middle of the horizontal axis, but is out of the shape (on the horizontal axis), the next step to be sampled from on the vertical axis is [−1, 0, 1].

### Persistent homology-based functional connectivity and its association with cognitive ability: life-span study [^caee46e8]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

2.6.2 Multi‐scale simplicial complex

Rips filtration is the most natural way to construct a set of multi‐scale simplicial complexes due to its computational efficiency (Boissonnat et al.). Many TDA applications of brain networks have also used Rips filtration to calculate PH. Several studies have directly applied Rips complex filtration using the distance between nodes [e.g. the distance between nodes can be defined as(or), when the weighted network is constructed using Pearson correlations] (Gracia‐Tabuenca et al; Lee et al; Liang et al; Shnier et al; Stolz et al.). However, they considered only dimension 0 topological features (i.e. connected components). This is because the definition of dimension 1 topological features (i.e. loops) under Rips simplicial complex only covers non‐clique cycles (for example, a triangle [3‐clique] is a connected component, not a loop in Rips simplicial complex), which is not easily observable in a complex network. Here, to obtain a more interpretable and observable loop structure of a complex functional brain network, we use the graph simplicial complex, which is similar to the Rips simplicial complex but considers only 0‐ and 1‐ simplices (i.e. nodes and edges), excluding 2‐ and 3‐ simplices (i.e. filled triangles and tetrahedrons) and higher‐order simplices from Rips complexes (Figure 1). Although graph filtration does not consider higher than order two relationships between nodes as connected components, we can use graph filtration to keep information of edges making all kinds of cycles (i.e. triangles, rectangles, pentagons, etc.), which describe the relationship between more than three nodes.

FIGURE 1
Example of Rips and graph simplicial complex. Rips simplicial complex (left) assigns grey faces to three cliques (triangles) and so has one loop. Whereas graph simplicial complex (right) only considers points and edges and so has three loops in this example.

### Universality in long-distance geometry and quantum complexity [^e343ca2d]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

This implies that we can approximate the operatorwith a total cost of about. This operator agrees with our target operatorat leading order in z, and has an inner-product error of about z 2. This can be improved to z 3 by using the next order in the Suzuki–Trotter expansion, but going to even higher orders becomes prohibitively expensive. It is at this point that we make our heuristic step. In the Euclidean group example, we saw that the complexity geometry has so many degrees of freedom that by making minor deformations of the path we can correct small errors at small extra cost, in a way that is not captured by any finite order of the Suzuki–Trotter expansion, and is instead an emergent feature in the IR. Compared with the SU(2) example in the section ' Berger sphere ', the task of compiling in U(2 N) is complicated by the fact that there are many more directions in which to err; on the other hand, there are correspondingly more directions in which we can wiggle the path to eliminate the error, and as a statistical matter, we expect that to dominate. If the small inner-product errors can be corrected by wiggling the path, then we can synthesizefor z < 1 at cost k n 2 (k). To generateat larger values of z, the triangle inequality (for any) guarantees that the complexity grows no faster than linearly with coefficient k n 2 (k). This argument heuristically shows that the binomial metric is in the same universality class as the infinite-cliff metric, and therefore upper-bounds the critical schedule:The upper-bound equation (17) holds at all but the largest k, where the analysis becomes unreliable. Note also that although the binomial metric does not have a curvature as small as the exponential metric, it is still very moderate ∣ κ ∣ ≤ O (N) compared to the cliff metric. The reasoning that leads to equation (17) is heuristic, because to eliminate error it appeals to a statistical argument. In ref. it is shown that there is a weaker result that can be proved. The study also shows that any unitary that can be reached with a path that in the binomial metric has a lengthcan be approximated to within inner-product error ϵ by a path that in the infinite-cliff metric has a lengthOur conjectures imply that this can be improved from polynomial to linear-with-additive-constant and from approximate to exact.

### Abusive head trauma in infants and children: technical report [^232423c4]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis — accidental trauma history and fall-height context — For differentiating accidental trauma from abusive head trauma (AHT), "There are few quantitative studies regarding the most reliable way to elicit a history from caregivers", but "some methods, including those adapted from biomechanical reconstruction questionnaires, have been suggested", such as "facilitating an initial uninterrupted narrative of the history" and obtaining "specific details… including how the child was positioned or held, what anatomic structures sustained impacts against what types of surfaces, and from what height the child fell". Reference dimensions note "couches and other seating heights about 18 to 20 inches, beds 1 to 3 feet, and changing tables and countertops 2.5 to 3 feet", and that children held at a parent's shoulder "typically have head-to-ground falls of approximately 4 to 5 feet". Additional context includes that "most caregivers overestimate fall height when providing a history" and "most papers define low-height or short-distance falls as under 3 to 4 feet".

### Barrier protection use by adolescents during sexual activity [^4a7c9c72]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Barrier methods for adolescents — external condoms, internal condoms, and dental dams — are described with materials, use sites, and access. The external condom "is a latex, synthetic, or natural material shield designed to fit over the male penis and is available over the counter". The internal condom "is a loose-fitting polyurethane (nitrile) sheath with 2 flexible polyurethane rings and is the only US Food and Drug Administration–approved nonpenile barrier method for STI prevention currently available in the United States", may be placed "inside the anus, vagina, or mouth", and "is only available in the United States with a prescription". Another option is "a dental dam, or a latex, synthetic (nitrile or polyurethane) sheet (usually square shaped) that users may place over the penis, vulva, vagina, mouth, anus, or any part of the body". The page also notes, "Although not evidence based or advised, adolescents may also improvise using plastic wrap or plastic bags to act as barriers".

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Pulmonary valve — Preprocedure assessment should describe the pulmonary root components, including the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), the pulmonary valve, the interleaflet triangles, and the pulmonary sinuses of Valsalva; significant pulmonary valve pathology can be present in carcinoid syndrome, endocarditis, and congenital diseases such as repaired tetralogy of Fallot or congenital pulmonary valve stenosis. The assessment should include leaflet morphology and motion, annular size, valve/leaflet symmetry, and leaflet integrity, and the dimensions, size, and function of a normal, native pulmonary valve are particularly important when a Ross procedure or a transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement is planned; the pulmonary valve can be imaged at the upper esophageal (UE), ME, and TG views as recommended in published ASE guidelines.

### Are grid cells used for navigation? On local metrics, subjective spaces, and black holes [^ba0fa718]. Neuron (2023). Medium credibility.

The symmetric, lattice-like spatial pattern of grid-cell activity is thought to provide a neuronal global metric for space. This view is compatible with grid cells recorded in empty boxes but inconsistent with data from more naturalistic settings. We review evidence arguing against the global-metric notion, including the distortion and disintegration of the grid pattern in complex and three-dimensional environments. We argue that deviations from lattice symmetry are key for understanding grid-cell function. We propose three possible functions for grid cells, which treat real-world grid distortions as a feature rather than a bug. First, grid cells may constitute a local metric for proximal space rather than a global metric for all space. Second, grid cells could form a metric for subjective action-relevant space rather than physical space. Third, distortions may represent salient locations. Finally, we discuss mechanisms that can underlie these functions. These ideas may transform our thinking about grid cells.

### Characterizing cell-type spatial relationships across length scales in spatially resolved omics data [^d4079785]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Methods

CRAWDAD overview

CRAWDAD characterizes cell-type spatial relationship trends by comparing observed pairwise cell-type spatial relationships to a set of empirical null distributions in which cell-type labels have been shuffled at different length scales.

Creating null distributions at different length scales

To generate empirical null distributions against which observed cell-type spatial relationships can be compared to evaluate for statistical significance, CRAWDAD employs a grid-based cell-type label shuffling strategy. Given a tissue containing cells represented by x-y spatial coordinates with cell-type annotations, we partition the tissue into non-overlapping side-by-side tiles. By default, tiles are squares of area r 2, where r is the size of the spatial length scale of analysis. Then for all cells that reside within the same square, cell-type labels are shuffled to create a null distribution for the given r. These shuffled null distributions are created for multiple r values to achieve a set of empirical null distribution at different length scales. We further create multiple permutations at each length scale by applying different random seeds and a grid-offsetting approach to mitigate the influence of spatial patterns that would benefit specific grid divisions. Specifically, the offsets are calculated by creating a sequence from 0 to r, in equally spaced intervals of r divided by the number of permutations. In each of the permutations, a different offset of the sequence will be applied. In addition to square tiles, CRAWDAD allows the creation of side-by-side non-overlapping hexagon tiles. In this case, the size of the scale is represented by the distance between opposite edges of the hexagon (Supp. Fig. 9a).

### General principles for the safe performance, training, and adoption of ablation techniques for benign thyroid nodules: an American Thyroid Association statement [^637310a6]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Trans-isthmic approach and moving-shot technique safety considerations — The trans-isthmic approach offers distinct safety advantages for operators treating patients with RFA and MWA, allowing the operator to monitor the association between the applicator, target nodule, and RLN. At the level of the mid-cervical trachea and below the concept of the "danger triangle" becomes less reliable, particularly on the right where the nerve can run 1–2 cm lateral to the tracheoesophageal groove, and the entire posterior capsule should be considered a "danger zone". The moving-shot technique divides the nodule into multiple small ablation units; the applicator tip should be initially positioned in the deepest and most remote portion of the nodule with subsequent retraction to more superficial areas, and the applicator position remains stable even when a patient talks or coughs.

### Quantum simulation of 2D antiferromagnets with hundreds of rydberg atoms [^7da3d0f1]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Quantum simulation using synthetic systems is a promising route to solve outstanding quantum many-body problems in regimes where other approaches, including numerical ones, fail 1. Many platforms are being developed towards this goal, in particular based on trapped ions 2–4, superconducting circuits 5–7, neutral atoms 8–11 or molecules 12,13. All of these platforms face two key challenges: scaling up the ensemble size while retaining high-quality control over the parameters, and validating the outputs for these large systems. Here we use programmable arrays of individual atoms trapped in optical tweezers, with interactions controlled by laser excitation to Rydberg states 11, to implement an iconic many-body problem-the antiferromagnetic two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model. We push this platform to a regime with up to 196 atoms manipulated with high fidelity and probe the antiferromagnetic order by dynamically tuning the parameters of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate the versatility of our platform by exploring various system sizes on two qualitatively different geometries-square and triangular arrays. We obtain good agreement with numerical calculations up to a computationally feasible size (approximately 100 particles). This work demonstrates that our platform can be readily used to address open questions in many-body physics.

### Spatial distribution of B cells and lymphocyte clusters as a predictor of triple-negative breast cancer outcome [^9f46f256]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Spatial distribution analysis of TILs

Using the data spreadsheets with every cell phenotyped and given a set of Cartesian coordinates, we tiled each image with a grid of identical squares. We omitted squares that had no cells, since they lay outside the tissue. However, we included squares that were within the tissue but contained no cells of interest. The length L of one side of a square varies from 10 to 600 μm. A square was assigned 1 or 0 according to the answer to a binary question. For comparison we calculated the occupancy FD of a uniform random (Poisson) distribution of points. We processed the data using in-house custom-developed software (RStudio) and the R packages "spatstat" for point patterns, "dbscan" for cluster analysis, and "EBImage" for raster images.

Statistical methods

Occupancy,

An image is overlaid with a grid of squares (Fig. 2a); each square has an area of L 2. A '0' or '1' is assigned to each square according to the answer to a binary (yes-no) question, e.g. "Is there at least one B cell in the square?" (Fig. 2a inset). The occupancy is the fraction of squares with 1's, i.e. it is an estimate of the probability that a square will have a 1. To characterize the spatial distribution at different length scales, the size of the squares in the grid is varied to produce the occupancy as a function of L, the length of one side of a square. The occupancy depends to some extent on the average cell density for binary questions such as "Is there at least one CD20 + B cell in the square?" because a higher average cell density corresponds to a higher probability that a square is assigned a '1'.

### The triangle of the vertebral artery [^c3601a70]. Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Neurosurgical procedures such as proximal brachial plexus repair, scalenotomy, and direct isolation of the proximal vertebral artery require a good working knowledge of the triangle of the vertebral artery. This deep triangle of the neck is bound by the subclavian artery and the anterior scalene and longus cervicis muscles. In addition to the vertebral artery, many important structures are found in this area, such as the ganglionated sympathetic chain and certain cervical spinal nerves.

Methods

Twenty formalin-fixed cadavers were used for this study. Dissection of this triangle was performed, and measurements were made not only of parts of its borders, but also distances from these borders to neurologically important structures within its confines, such as the C8 spinal nerve.

Results

In all specimens, the middle scalene muscle was noted to form part of the posterior wall of the triangle. The mean height of the triangle was found to be 3.2 cm, and the mean width of its base was 1.3 cm. We observed that the C8 spinal nerve had a mean distance of 1.2 cm inferior to the apex of the triangle and that the C7 spinal nerve was found inside the triangle in 5% of sides. If the phrenic nerve entered the triangle, it was never found more than 6 mm medial to the anterior scalene muscle. The vertebral artery always traveled intimately along the lateral border of the longus cervicis muscle, and its lateral edge ranged 5 to 8 mm medial to the medial edge of the anterior scalene muscle.

Conclusion

The C7 spinal nerve was observed in the triangle of the vertebral artery. In addition, the posterior border of the triangle of the vertebral artery was clearly defined in this study, and the middle scalene muscle could be used as a landmark. These data, coupled with our quantitation of parts and structures within the triangle, may assist neurosurgeons who operate on this area of the neck.

### Terahertz rectification in ring-shaped quantum barriers [^a4e5ef19]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Figure 2b describes the polarization-dependent behaviors of the instantaneous total tunneling current of a triangular loop under a THz field illumination. Electric potential along the contour shows an asymmetric distribution as a consequence of the lack of inversion symmetry inherent in the triangle geometry. It is interesting to note that the contour integration of the barrier potential affected by the external surface current sources always vanishes independent of the loop shape and loop orientation, automatically eliminating the Ohmic component (see Supplementary Note 1). However, the non-vanishing total current through the barrier naturally emerges for the triangle shape because of the nonlinearity in tunneling current vs. applied potential relation (see Eq. 3 in Methods) together with the triangle's lack of inversion symmetry. Figure 2c shows the measured current responses from triangular and square loops as a function of the THz polarizer angle. The results show strikingly different behaviors depending on the loop geometry. A much higher current flows across the triangular barrier than the square one since the asymmetric potential distribution along the equilateral triangle results in a net tunneling current through the contour while the potential distribution at any point of a square is mostly counterbalanced by its corresponding point across the center, independent of the polarization of the incident pulse. Figure 2d displays polar plots of the tunneling currents for the triangular and square geometries, where the current amplitudes are reconstructed by assuming that the incident field maintains its amplitude for different polarization angles (see Methods for details). The total current vs. polarization angle shows the three-fold rotational symmetry of an equilateral triangle.

### A non-spatial account of place and grid cells based on clustering models of concept learning [^d6d70d00]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Cluster learning applied to conceptual and spatial examples.

a The most similar cluster moves (i.e. adjusts its tuning) toward its newest member and becomes associated with a response (blue for bird, red for mammal). b Out of a pool of many randomly tuned clusters, a subset comes to represent the two concepts over learning. c, d The same learning system applied to an agent locomoting in a circular or a square environment gives rise to a hexagonal cluster organization. How the stimulus space is sampled affects how clusters are distributed in the representational space.

We evaluate whether a domain general account is plausible by applying successful models of human concept learning to spatial contexts. In concept learning studies, these models learn to represent experience in terms of conceptual clusters, which are not uniformly distributed. For example, in a simple case with two clearly separable and internally coherent sets of objects, a clustering model would use one cluster to represent each concept, each of which would be centered amidst its members in representational space (e.g. Fig. 1a).

### Computed tomography imaging in the context of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) / transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR): an expert consensus document of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^ad720610]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2019). High credibility.

Aortic root and annulus definitions — TAVI/TAVR anatomical sizing defines the aortic annulus as the luminal contour within a virtual plane aligned with the most basal attachment points of the three aortic valve cusps, and quantitative assessments require accurate identification of each of these points to create a plane that transects all three. The aortic root is described as an extension of the left ventricular outflow tract from the basal attachment of the aortic valve cusps within the LVOT to their peripheral attachment at the sinotubular junction, comprising the sinuses of Valsalva, the fibrous interleaflet triangles and the valvular cusps.

### Grid cell symmetry is shaped by environmental geometry [^b4e91865]. Nature (2015). Excellent credibility.

Grid cells represent an animal's location by firing in multiple fields arranged in a striking hexagonal array. Such an impressive and constant regularity prompted suggestions that grid cells represent a universal and environmental-invariant metric for navigation. Originally the properties of grid patterns were believed to be independent of the shape of the environment and this notion has dominated almost all theoretical grid cell models. However, several studies indicate that environmental boundaries influence grid firing, though the strength, nature and longevity of this effect is unclear. Here we show that grid orientation, scale, symmetry and homogeneity are strongly and permanently affected by environmental geometry. We found that grid patterns orient to the walls of polarized enclosures such as squares, but not circles. Furthermore, the hexagonal grid symmetry is permanently broken in highly polarized environments such as trapezoids, the pattern being more elliptical and less homogeneous. Our results provide compelling evidence for the idea that environmental boundaries compete with the internal organization of the grid cell system to drive grid firing. Notably, grid cell activity is more local than previously thought and as a consequence cannot provide a universal spatial metric in all environments.

### Early sagittal shape of the spine predicts scoliosis development in a syndromic (22q11.2DS) population: a prospective longitudinal study [^2aa8a40d]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

The PIT

All of the radiographic measurements were performed with Surgimap imaging software (version 2.3.2.1; Nemaris), which has been validated for measuring spinopelvic parameters. A single trained observer blinded to the outcome analyzed the freestanding lateral full-spine radiographs, which had been made in a standardized manner, of every patient at inclusion. At that time, all of the patients were skeletally immature, and those with scoliosis on the coronal radiograph were excluded. First, the observer utilized Surgimap's Spinal Wizard software to segment both femoral heads and all vertebral body end plates; manual adjustments were made where necessary (Fig. 1). Second, the software automatically calculated the inclination of each vertebral body based on the upper end plate in the sagittal plane, and the centroids of the most cranial and most caudal posteriorly inclined vertebrae were annotated. Third, the right-angled triangle between these 2 points and the vertical was drawn, and 3 parameters were determined: (1) the PIT area was calculated with the basic formula formula for the area of a triangle, 0.5 × width × height, (2) the PIT length was calculated as the length of the hypotenuse, and (3) the PIT inclination was calculated as the angle between the hypotenuse and the vertical (Fig. 1). Finally, the pelvic incidenceand the length of the spine from T1 to S1 were measured, also in the sagittal plane, using the same Surgimap software. The T1-S1 spinal length was used to normalize the PIT area to account for absolute body size. This was done by calculating the ratio between the T1-S1 length of each patient and the study's population mean, with no distinction between sexes since the T1-S1 length was not significantly different between boys and girls. Using this ratio allowed the PIT area and the PIT length to be normalized for the patient's size but still retain their physical units (cm and cm 2).

### Multiple tipping points and optimal repairing in interacting networks [^bf70cdce]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Geometry of the Manhattan distance minimization problem

The optimal strategies shown in different colours in Fig. 5 are derived from the geometrical reasoning shown in Fig. 9. Figure 9a shows a plot of a series of curves consisting of points at identical Manhattan distances from point S 1 (equidistant curves). They produce a 'diamond' shape, and the minimal Manhattan distance between point S 1 and the green region translates into the task of 'fitting' the diamond so that it just touches the green region and its centre is at S 1. The diamond in Fig. 9a touches the green region at two points — triple points, which are the solution to the minimization problem. Figure 9b shows the solution for point S 6 in the light blue region. Here the solution suggests a different strategy — decreasing only.

### Surgical anatomy of the aortic annulus: landmarks for external annuloplasty in aortic valve repair [^681af087]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although reduction of a dilated aortic annulus is becoming an essential parameter for durable valve repair, anatomical descriptions of the annulus and surgical landmarks of the subvalvular plane for an external aortic annuloplasty remain to be defined.

Methods

Twenty hearts with normal anatomy with tricuspid aortic valves were studied. Annulus diameter, cusp geometric height, and interleaflet triangles heights were measured. The aortic root was dissected externally down to the subvalvular plane as to perform an external aortic annuloplasty or reimplantation procedure proximal anastomosis. Tissue thickness and dissection heights relative to the annulus were measured at each cusp nadir and at the middle of each interleaflet triangle.

Results

The mean annulus diameter, cusp geometric height, and interleaflet triangle heights were, respectively, 24.9 ± 0.2 mm, 19.7 ± 0.3 mm, and 20.1 ± 0.5 mm. External dissection of the aortic root reached the subvalvular plane below the nadir of left coronary cusp (-2.7 ± 0.4 mm), noncoronary (NC) cusp (-3.1 ± 0.3 mm), and the base of left-NC interleaflet triangle (-2.1 ± 0.4 mm). External dissection remained above the nadir of the right coronary cusp (+1.4 ± 0.4 mm), base of left-right interleaflet triangle (+2.4 ± 0.6 mm), and right-NC interleaflet triangle (+3.4 ± 0.3 mm). Mean tissue thickness between the inner and external side of the subvalvular plane was 2.5 ± 0.1 mm.

Conclusions

External dissection of the aortic annulus allows subvalvular placement of an external aortic ring below the left and NC cusps and below or within 3 mm of the right cusp nadir in 80% of cases. An external aortic annuloplasty would induce at least a 5-mm reduction of annulus diameter, corresponding to tissue thickness. Precise anatomical landmarks are important to standardize aortic valve annuloplasty.

Fleischner Society CT pulmonary nodule measurement units and rounding — reporting precision: All measurements and their derivatives should be expressed to the nearest millimeter, and although picture archiving and communication system consoles display measurements to the nearest 0.1 mm, this apparent precision is considered deceptive; consequently, a nodule with a long-axis diameter of 4.5 mm should be rounded to 5 mm, a short-axis diameter of 3.4 mm should be rounded to 3 mm, and the average diameter would be (5 + 3)/2 = 4 mm.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^10031d72]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Portable fire extinguishers — ratings, placement, and operation are outlined for home use. Fire extinguishers have a number rating for Type A fires in gallons of water: 1 means 1¼ gallons of water; 2 means 2½ gallons of water; 3 means 3¾ gallons of water, and for Type B and Type C fires the number represents square feet, for example 2 equals 2 square feet and 5 equals 5 square feet. For multi-class units, an extinguisher labeled 2A5B is good for Type A fires with a 2½-gallon equivalence and for Type B fires with a 5-square-foot equivalency. A good extinguisher to have in each residential kitchen is a 2A10BC fire extinguisher. An extinguisher should be placed in the kitchen and in the garage or workshop, and each extinguisher should be installed in plain view near an escape route and away from potential fire hazards such as heating appliances. PASS is a simple acronym to remind you how to operate most fire extinguishers — pull, aim, squeeze, and sweep. Pull the pin at the top of the cylinder. Aim the nozzle at the base of the fire. Squeeze or press the handle. Sweep the contents from side to side at the base of the fire until it goes out. Shut off the extinguisher and then watch carefully for any rekindling of the fire.

### Reference values for the right and left fetal choroid plexus at 11 to 13 weeks: an early sign of "developmental" laterality? [^4ee6adc5]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to establish reference values for the length, area, and circumference of the right and left fetal choroid plexus at 11 to 13 weeks with respect to the fetal biparietal diameter and to compare the right to the left side.

Methods

We conducted a prospective study on 114 fetuses at 11 to 13 weeks undergoing first-trimester screening for aneuploidy and structural fetal abnormalities. After the establishment of the fetal situs, the plane of the "butterfly" was obtained on all fetuses, from which the length, area, and circumference of both the right and left choroid plexus were obtained and the right and left sides compared. Using a paired t test, analysis of variance, scatterplots, and linear and logarithmic fittings, reference ranges and charts for the length, area, and circumference of the choroid plexus were then formulated according to their relationship to the fetal biparietal diameter. P < .05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

Reference values for the length, area, and circumference of the fetal choroid plexus, with respect to the fetal biparietal diameter, were established. There was a statistically significant difference between the right and left sides for all parameters, with all measurements statistically greater on the left side (P < .0001).

Conclusions

Reference values for the length, area, and circumference of the fetal choroid plexus at 11 to 13 weeks are presented. These may prove to be of clinical importance in the early screening for central nervous system abnormalities. In addition, the statistically significant difference between the right and left sides may be an early sign of "developmental" laterality.

### Solving olympiad geometry without human demonstrations [^ec72812b]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Main

Proving theorems showcases the mastery of logical reasoning and the ability to search through an infinitely large space of actions towards a target, signifying a remarkable problem-solving skill. Since the 1950s (refs.), the pursuit of better theorem-proving capabilities has been a constant focus of artificial intelligence (AI) research. Mathematical olympiads are the most reputed theorem-proving competitions in the world, with a similarly long history dating back to 1959, playing an instrumental role in identifying exceptional talents in problem solving. Matching top human performances at the olympiad level has become a notable milestone of AI research –.

Theorem proving is difficult for learning-based methods because training data of human proofs translated into machine-verifiable languages are scarce in most mathematical domains. Geometry stands out among other olympiad domains because it has very few proof examples in general-purpose mathematical languages such as Leanowing to translation difficulties unique to geometry. Geometry-specific languages, on the other hand, are narrowly defined and thus unable to express many human proofs that use tools beyond the scope of geometry, such as complex numbers (Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4). Overall, this creates a data bottleneck, causing geometry to lag behind in recent progress that uses human demonstrations –. Current approaches to geometry, therefore, still primarily rely on symbolic methods and human-designed, hard-coded search heuristics –.

### Increased shape and size offerings of femoral components improve fit during total knee arthroplasty [^d30aca2d]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Numerous morphologic studies have shown that the dimensions of the distal femur are highly variable and suggested that contemporary femoral component designs may not accommodate morphological differences across ethnicities. These investigations focused on analysis of ethnic or gender variability in femoral anthropometrics only, or comparison of either intact or resected distal femur with component dimensions without consideration of surgical technique and component sizing philosophy. Furthermore, previous assessment on contemporary femoral component designs only focused on either a single ethnicity, or did not differentiate ethnicities in the dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first study that automatically evaluated component fit on the resected distal femur across multiple ethnicities spanning Asian and Caucasian subjects, in which sizing and placement following design-specific algorithms. The current analysis provides further insight into the contemporary component fit in global populations.

There are several limitations to this study. First, though resections were specific to each implant system, ideal distal femoral resections were employed for each design; however, clinical variability in resection parameters has been reported in previous studies. Second, each resection utilized an assumed uniform 2-mm cartilage thickness; however, inter-subject, anatomical site-dependent variations in distal femoral cartilage thickness have been documented and shown to be correlated with multiple factors such as age, BMI, loading in the knee, and state of osteoarthritis. Third, all the results here are based on healthy subjects, not TKA candidates. The impact of these limitations on the results may require further investigation.

Although all the measurements performed in this study were based on fully automated computer simulation, the expected resolution of the results is impacted by several aspects of the data pre-processing: (1) accuracy of the automatic annotations of the landmarks depends on the resolution of the CT data, which had sub-millimetre accuracy (up to 2 decimal places); (2) approval of automatically defined landmarks by experienced users introduces some level of inter- and intra-user variability, though this has been shown to be at sub-millimetre level (errors reported in 1 decimal place); and (3) the surgical reference axes for the distal femoral resection were constructed based on anatomical landmarks and naturally inherited the errors in landmark identification. Based on these considerations, results here were reported at a comparable level of resolution (1 decimal place). Additionally, the accumulated impact of variability from CT data on morphometric analysis of TKA resections has been shown to be within typical clinical bounds of TKA for the workflow utilized here, which supports the clinical relevancy of the virtual distal femoral resection in this study.

### Etonogestrel (Nexplanon) [^04350ac3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Insertion Procedure

To help make sure the implant is inserted just under the skin, the healthcare professionals should be positioned to see the advancement of the needle by viewing the applicator from the side and not from above the arm. From the side view, the insertion site and the movement of the needle just under the skin can be clearly visualized.

For illustrative purposes, Figures depict the left inner arm.

Step 1.	Have the woman lie on her back on the examination table with her non-dominant arm flexed at the elbow and externally rotated so that her hand is underneath her head (or as close as possible) (Figure 1).

Step 2.	Identify the insertion site, which is at the inner side of the non-dominant upper arm. The insertion site is overlying the triceps muscle about 8–10 cm (3–4 inches) from the medial epicondyle of the humerus and 3–5 cm (1.25–2 inches) posterior to (below) the sulcus (groove) between the biceps and triceps muscles (Figures 2a, 2b and 2c). This location is intended to avoid the large blood vessels and nerves lying within and surrounding the sulcus. If it is not possible to insert the implant in this location (e.g., in women with thin arms), it should be inserted as far posterior from the sulcus as possible. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) .]

### Polygonal non-wetting droplets on microtextured surfaces [^db22327a]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Design of silicon micropillar arrays and operations

A schematic representation of the experimental setup is given in Fig. 1a. It consisted of a z -axis translation stage on the bottom and a superhydrophobic glass plate (treated with a commercial coating agent, Glaco Mirror Coat "Zero", Soft 99, Co.), on the top (Supplementary Method 1, Supplementary Fig. 1). As shown in the first row of each panel (Fig. 1b–d), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) illustrated well-defined shapes of silicon micropillar arrays fabricated by standard contact photolithography and deep-reactive ion etching. These microtextured surfaces can be categorized into three groups. First, cross-sectional areas of the pillars based on triangular, circular, and square were arranged in square arrays, respectively (Fig. 1b). Second, the triangular cross-sections of the pillars were arranged in triangular arrays (Fig. 1c). Third, cross-sections of the pillars based on triangular, square, hexagonal, and circular were arranged in hexagonal arrays, respectively (Fig. 1d). Note that a refers to the typical length scale of the cross-sectional area of a pillar, i.e. the side length of the triangular and square pillars, the diameter of the cylindrical pillars, and the diagonal length of the hexagonal pillars (Supplementary Fig. 2). Also, the side length of the triangular and square pillars was set to a = 20 μm, side length of the hexagonal pillars was a = 10 μm, and diameter of the cylindrical pillars was a = 20 μm. The minimum spacing of the pillars was denoted as b = 10 μm and the pillar height was h = 90 μm (Supplementary Method 2, Supplementary Table 1). All samples were first coated by a silane film CF 3 (CF 2) 9 CH 2 CH 2 SiCl 3 (FDDTS) deposited by RPX-540 of Integrated Surface Technologies, Inc. Afterward, the surface of each pillar became hydrophobic with the Young contact angle θ 0 = 110 ± 5°. Each sample was cleaned before the experiments. By placing water (Fig. 1b–d) and liquid metal (Galinstan, Fig. 1e) droplets in a confinement consisting of a microtextured surface on the bottom and a superhydrophobic glass surface on the top, polygonal-shaped droplets were formed by narrowing the separation of the two surfaces. The top-view visualization of the droplet by a CCD camera (Canon 550D, Hi-Scope advanced KH3000) and separation H of the two surfaces by length sensor (Heidenhain-Metro 2581) were recorded simultaneously. The details of the microfabrication, silanization, sample-cleaning procedure, contact angle measurements, and experimental process are all provided in the Methods section.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the care of kidney transplant recipients [^4878f877]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Medium credibility.

Adult obesity definitions and disease risk — Obesity in adults is defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2; because some individuals may have BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 that is not due to excess body fat, it is recommended that the definition of obesity in adults include waist circumference ≥ 102 cm (≥ 40 in.) in men and ≥ 88 cm (≥ 35 in.) in women. Table 26 classifies BMI (kg/m2) as Underweight < 18.5 and Normal 18.5–24.9, with Overweight 25.0–29.9 associated with Increased disease risk, Obesity, class 1 30.0–34.9 with High risk, Obesity, class 2 35.0–39.9 with Very high risk, and Extreme obesity, class 3 ≥ 40 with Extremely high risk; disease risk is higher for people with large waist circumferences (men > 102 cm (> 40 in); women > 88 cm (> 35 in)). Body mass index can be calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, or as weight in pounds divided by height in inches squared multiplied by 703.

### Reading angles in maps [^03895f86]. Child Development (2013). Low credibility.

Preschool children can navigate by simple geometric maps of the environment, but the nature of the geometric relations they use in map reading remains unclear. Here, children were tested specifically on their sensitivity to angle. Forty-eight children (age 47:15–53:30 months) were presented with fragments of geometric maps, in which angle sections appeared without any relevant length or distance information. Children were able to read these map fragments and compare two-dimensional to three-dimensional angles. However, this ability appeared both variable and fragile among the youngest children of the sample. These findings suggest that 4-year-old children begin to form an abstract concept of angle that applies both to two-dimensional and three-dimensional displays and that serves to interpret novel spatial symbols.

### Mosaic two-lengthscale quasicrystals [^2542b8e4]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

Over the past decade, quasicrystalline order has been observed in many soft-matter systems: in dendritic micelles, in star and tetrablock terpolymer melts and in diblock copolymer and surfactant micelles. The formation of quasicrystals from such a broad range of 'soft' macromolecular micelles suggests that they assemble by a generic mechanism rather than being dependent on the specific chemistry of each system. Indeed, micellar softness has been postulated and shown to lead to quasicrystalline order. Here we theoretically explore this link by studying two-dimensional hard disks decorated with step-like square-shoulder repulsion that mimics, for example, the soft alkyl shell around the aromatic core in dendritic micelles. We find a family of quasicrystals with 10-, 12-, 18- and 24-fold bond orientational order which originate from mosaics of equilateral and isosceles triangles formed by particles arranged core-to-core and shoulder-to-shoulder. The pair interaction responsible for these phases highlights the role of local packing geometry in generating quasicrystallinity in soft matter, complementing the principles that lead to quasicrystal formation in hard tetrahedra. Based on simple interparticle potentials, quasicrystalline mosaics may well find use in diverse applications ranging from improved image reproduction to advanced photonic materials.

### "Triangle method" for evaluating the morphological characteristics of the aortic arch in healthy mid-to-late pregnancy fetuses [^073afdca]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to apply the 2-dimensional grayscale ultrasound "triangle method" to evaluate the morphology of the aortic arch in healthy mid-to-late pregnancy fetuses.

Methods

A total of 317 healthy singleton fetuses at 20–38 +6 weeks of gestation were assessed. Using the long-axis view of the aortic arch, the "triangle method" was employed to measure the aortic arch length (sum of the 2 sides of a triangle), width, height, and angle. The aortic arch tortuosity (length/width) and height-to-width ratio were calculated. Healthy reference values for these morphological parameters were established, and their relationship to gestational age (GA) and cardiac valve annuli was explored.

Results

The length, width, and height of the aortic arch in healthy mid-to-late pregnancy fetuses increased significantly with GA (P < .05). Instead, no significant correlation was observed between GA or cardiac valve annuli and the aortic arch angle, tortuosity, or height-to-width ratio (P > .05), whose corresponding reference values were 69.2 ± 6.1°, 1.7 ± 0.1, and 0.7 ± 0.1, respectively.

Conclusions

The aortic arch angle, tortuosity, and height-to-width ratio in healthy mid-to-late pregnancy fetuses remain relatively stable during development.

### Exploring community-dwelling older adults' considerations about values and preferences for future end-of-life care: a study from Sweden [^61d41efe]. The Gerontologist (2020). Medium credibility.

DöBra Card Statements

As each of the exemplars' reasoning about their seemingly similar wild cards differed, we continued our analysis by exploring the reasoning underlying their other prioritized card items. This is illustrated in Figure 1, using two triangles for each card statement. The triangle on the upper-right represents the card dimension according tocategorization, while the lower-left triangle represents our categorization of the participant's reasoning about the statement. A gray triangle represents either no categorization of card statement by(i.e. for wild cards and card statements added in the Swedish version), or no recorded reasoning about this item. When the entire rectangle is of the same color, categorization of the statement dimension matches our interpretation of the participant's reasoning.

As becomes evident in Figure 1, Thomas' and Peter's card rankings are most similar at first glance, with their top three prioritizations ranked identically. Among his 10 most prioritized cards, Thomas chose a majority of statements whichcategorized as socially related (six cards), whereas Peter had a more varied mix, with a predominance of cards categorized byas focused on physical aspects.

When also exploring how each individual reasoned about their prioritized card items, Thomas' focus on social issues became even more evident as we found he reasoned with a relational focus about all of his prioritized cards, regardless of how they were categorized by. When he considered the card item "To be mentally aware", categorized byas representing the physical dimension, he expressed concern for those close to him, as he said: "Yeah, it's simply because… if I'm completely senile… then I'm not a functioning person who can have meaningful contact with either [names partner] or my son or my daughter, so to speak". Peter, in turn, reasoned about two cards thatcategorized as existential (Figure 1), by focusing on their physical implications. For example, when he discussed the card statement "To maintain my dignity", Peter explained: "Yeah, that [dignity], is hard to maintain if I'm in pain. But now when I am pain-free and all, I want to be treated with dignity". Marie's less common focus — a more practical orientation — was evident in her discussion of the same card item about dignity, as she said:

### Detecting the ultra low dimensionality of real networks [^a2604d73]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Inferring hidden dimensions

These results suggest a method by which we can infer the hidden dimension D * of a real network. First, we created an ensemble of synthetic surrogates using themodel with different values of the inverse temperature β and dimension D. To preserve the consistency of the hidden degrees in the synthetic networks and of the observed degrees in the original graph, we computed hidden degrees using an iterative processthat forces a match between expected degrees in the model and observed degrees, see subsection "Estimation of the hidden degrees" in the Methods section. This step also ensures that the model reproduces the degree distribution of the real network with high fidelity. After obtaining the hidden degrees, we assigned homogeneous random positions to the N nodes in the D -dimensional similarity space. To keep the process computationally efficient, we restricted the ensemble of synthetic surrogates to feasible values of D and β. The maximum achievable density of edge triangles happens at β = ∞ and decreases monotonously for increasing values of D, as shown above in Fig. 1. Accordingly, we set the maximum dimension to be explored as the maximum dimension able to reproduce the level of edge clustering of the network under study. For each D less than or equal to the maximum value, we decided the set of inverse temperatures, β, to be explored by sampling homogeneously the phase space of edge clustering in a neighborhood of the observed value, see subsection "Estimation of the range of inverse temperatures in the random ensemble" in Methods. The sample of random surrogates was generated using the connectivity law Eq. (1). The densities of edge triangles, squares, and pentagons were then computed for each surrogate in the ensemble and for the real network. Finally, a data-driven classifier was used to infer D * from the surrogates that best approximate the real network in terms of edge cycles.
