## Question

Bupropion and medrol dose pack

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether bupropion and a Medrol dose pack (methylprednisolone) can be used together safely, and what the clinical risks and management implications are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and labeled risks of bupropion, especially seizure risk. Then, I should verify whether systemic corticosteroids like methylprednisolone lower the seizure threshold and by how much. Next, I will quantify the combined risk and consider patient-specific modifiers. After that, I should outline practical management strategies, including dose limits, monitoring, and alternatives. Finally, I will synthesize a bottom-line recommendation with caveats and documentation needs.

> Let me first confirm the core risk signal. Bupropion carries a dose-related seizure risk, with labeled rates around 0.1% at 300 mg/day (SR) and about 0.4% at 300–450 mg/day (IR), rising sharply at higher doses; importantly, multiple FDA labels list systemic corticosteroids as drugs that lower the seizure threshold when coadministered with bupropion, warranting extreme caution and slow titration [^113G3Q4b] [^115NHBxC] [^113uFNeS].

> Wait, let me verify the steroid-specific evidence. The methylprednisolone label explicitly notes convulsions with concomitant cyclosporine, underscoring neurologic vulnerability, and bupropion labeling repeatedly warns that systemic corticosteroids can lower seizure threshold; although exact synergy quantification is lacking, the mechanistic concern is that corticosteroids may destabilize neuronal excitability, compounding bupropion's pro-convulsant potential, especially at higher bupropion doses or in predisposed patients [^117JtGXh] [^113uFNeS] [^115CtWMV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about absolute risk. I initially thought the combined risk might approach 1–2%, but I should double-check that estimate; there are no robust data quantifying the exact additive risk of bupropion plus a short steroid burst, so any numeric estimate is speculative. The safest, evidence-aligned framing is that the baseline bupropion seizure risk (about 0.1–0.4% depending on dose/formulation) is meaningfully increased when systemic corticosteroids are added, with risk rising further with higher bupropion doses, rapid titration, prior seizures, head trauma, alcohol/benzodiazepine withdrawal, eating disorders, or CNS pathology [^113G3Q4b] [^115NHBxC] [^114qck6Z].

> I need to ensure the management plan reflects label guidance. If coadministration is necessary, keep bupropion at the lowest effective dose and avoid exceeding 300 mg/day (SR/XL) or 450 mg/day (IR), titrate slowly, and use divided doses to avoid peaks; monitor closely for prodromal symptoms (aura, confusion, tremor) during the steroid course and for several days after, and counsel patients to avoid alcohol, sleep deprivation, and other seizure precipitants during this window [^113G3Q4b] [^115NHBxC] [^111JHmwd].

> But wait, what if alternatives exist? For smoking cessation, varenicline is generally more effective than bupropion and does not carry a seizure risk, making it a reasonable substitute when a steroid burst is planned; for depression, consider non-bupropion options temporarily if the steroid course is short and the patient has seizure risk factors, recognizing that this is a risk–benefit judgment individualized to indication and comorbidities [^117XoKqR] [^114QD8H1].

> I should confirm special populations and dose adjustments. In hepatic or renal impairment, bupropion exposure is altered and the maximum recommended dose is lower, which further tightens the safety margin when combined with seizure-threshold–lowering agents; in such cases, I would favor avoiding the combination or using the lowest feasible bupropion dose with enhanced monitoring [^112gY6VC] [^11269vXC] [^111XS2cS].

> Next, I should review documentation and counseling. I need to check that the chart clearly records the rationale for coadministration, informed consent about seizure risk, specific monitoring plans, and patient education on warning signs and when to seek urgent care; this aligns with labeling that emphasizes patient counseling and vigilance for neuropsychiatric and seizure events when bupropion is used with interacting drugs [^113uFNeS] [^1165KKSe].

> Bottom line: I need to ensure the recommendation is precise. Coadministration of bupropion with a Medrol dose pack is not absolutely contraindicated, but it is pharmacologically and clinically risky due to additive seizure potential; if used together, keep bupropion at or below 300 mg/day (SR/XL) or 450 mg/day (IR), titrate slowly, monitor closely during and shortly after the steroid course, and consider switching to varenicline or an alternative antidepressant when feasible, especially in patients with any seizure risk factors or hepatic/renal impairment [^113G3Q4b] [^115NHBxC] [^117XoKqR].

---

Bupropion and Medrol dose packs can be used together, but **caution is warranted** because methylprednisolone lowers the seizure threshold and may increase bupropion-related seizure risk [^113uFNeS]. The risk is dose-related and higher in patients with seizure history, eating disorders, alcohol/benzodiazepine withdrawal, or CNS lesions [^115NHBxC]. Use the lowest effective doses, titrate bupropion slowly, and monitor for seizures, mood changes, and neuropsychiatric symptoms [^113G3Q4b]. If a seizure occurs, stop bupropion and do not restart [^115NHBxC]. Consider alternatives (e.g. varenicline) if seizure risk is high [^116mnEve].

## Pharmacological profiles

### Bupropion

- **Mechanism of action**: Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) with nicotinic antagonism [^114sb6ea].

- **Indications**: Depression, seasonal affective disorder, smoking cessation [^115FfPzz] [^114UzZ1Q].

- **Seizure risk**: Dose-related; ~0.1% at ≤ 300 mg/day, ~0.4% at 400–450 mg/day, ~2.8% at 600 mg/day [^113G3Q4b] [^115NHBxC].

- **Contraindications**: Seizure disorder, anorexia/bulimia, MAOI use, abrupt withdrawal of alcohol/benzodiazepines [^115NHBxC].

---

### Methylprednisolone (Medrol dose pack)

- **Mechanism of action**: Synthetic glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects [^notfound].

- **Indications**: Allergic reactions, inflammatory conditions, autoimmune diseases.

- **Adverse effects**: Mood changes, insomnia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, immunosuppression, and lowered seizure threshold [^112CRL1L].

---

## Potential interaction and clinical concerns

### Seizure risk

Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold, and **systemic corticosteroids further lower it** [^113uFNeS]; combined use increases seizure risk, especially at higher bupropion doses or in predisposed patients [^113G3Q4b] [^115NHBxC].

---

### Neuropsychiatric effects

Both drugs can cause **anxiety, agitation, insomnia, and mood changes**; combined use may worsen these effects [^11282CAa].

---

### Pharmacokinetic considerations

Bupropion is a **CYP2D6 inhibitor** [^113uFNeS]; methylprednisolone is metabolized by CYP3A4, so a direct interaction is unlikely, but bupropion's CYP2D6 inhibition may affect other co-medications [^113uFNeS].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Dose adjustment**: Use the lowest effective doses; titrate bupropion slowly to reduce seizure risk [^113G3Q4b].

- **Monitoring**: Watch for seizures, mood changes, anxiety, insomnia, and other neuropsychiatric symptoms [^115XDtdT].

- **Patient selection**: Avoid or use extreme caution in patients with seizure history, eating disorders, alcohol/benzodiazepine withdrawal, or CNS lesions [^115NHBxC].

- **Discontinuation**: If a seizure occurs, stop bupropion and do not restart [^115NHBxC].

---

## Clinical scenarios and risk mitigation strategies

| **Clinical scenario** | **Risk level** | **Recommended strategy** |
|-|-|-|
| No seizure history, low-dose bupropion, short steroid course | Low | - Monitor closely <br/> - Use lowest effective doses |
| History of seizures, high-dose bupropion, prolonged steroid use | High | - Avoid combination <br/> - Consider alternatives (e.g. varenicline) [^117XoKqR] |
| Patient on multiple CNS-active drugs | Moderate | - Review all medications <br/> - Monitor for additive CNS effects |

---

## Alternative therapies

If seizure risk is high, consider **alternatives** such as varenicline for smoking cessation or SSRIs/SNRIs for depression, while avoiding bupropion during corticosteroid therapy.

---

## Patient counseling points

- **Seizure risk**: Explain signs of seizures and when to seek care [^115XDtdT].

- **Mood symptoms**: Report anxiety, agitation, insomnia, or mood changes promptly [^115Pxq72].

- **Alcohol**: Minimize or avoid alcohol to reduce seizure risk [^114DwB7Q].

- **Adherence**: Take bupropion as prescribed; do not stop abruptly [^1165KKSe].

---

Bupropion and Medrol dose packs can be used together with caution due to increased seizure risk; use the lowest effective doses, titrate slowly, and monitor closely. Consider alternatives in high-risk patients [^113G3Q4b] [^113uFNeS].

5.3 Seizure

Bupropion hydrochloride tablets can cause seizure. The risk of seizure is dose-related. The dose should not exceed 450 mg/day. Increase the dose gradually. Discontinue bupropion hydrochloride tablets and do not restart treatment if the patient experiences a seizure.

The risk of seizures is also related to patient factors, clinical situations, and concomitant medications that lower the seizure threshold. Consider these risks before initiating treatment with bupropion hydrochloride tablets. Bupropion hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder, current or prior diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or bulimia, or undergoing abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and antiepileptic drugs [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.3)]. The following conditions can also increase the risk of seizure: severe head injury; arteriovenous malformation; CNS tumor or CNS infection; severe stroke; concomitant use of other medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., other bupropion products, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, and systemic corticosteroids); metabolic disorders (e.g., hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, severe hepatic impairment, and hypoxia); use of illicit drugs (e.g., cocaine); or abuse or misuse of prescription drugs such as CNS stimulants. Additional predisposing conditions include diabetes mellitus treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin; use of anorectic drugs; and excessive use of alcohol, benzodiazepines, sedative/hypnotics, or opiates.

Incidence of Seizure with Bupropion Use :Bupropion is associated with seizures in approximately 0.4% (4/1,000) of patients treated at doses up to 450 mg/day. The estimated seizure incidence for bupropion hydrochloride tablets increases almost 10-fold between 450 and 600 mg/day.

The risk of seizure can be reduced if the dose of bupropion hydrochloride tablets does not exceed 450 mg/day, given as 150 mg 3 times daily, and the titration rate is gradual.

5.3 Seizure

Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) can cause seizure. The risk of seizure is dose-related. The dose of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) should not exceed 300 mg per day [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Discontinue bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) and do not restart treatment if the patient experiences a seizure.

The risk of seizures is also related to patient factors, clinical situations, and concomitant medications that lower the seizure threshold. Consider these risks before initiating treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR). Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) is contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder, current or prior diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or bulimia, or undergoing abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and antiepileptic drugs [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.3)]. The following conditions can also increase the risk of seizure: severe head injury; arteriovenous malformation; CNS tumor or CNS infection; severe stroke; concomitant use of other medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., other bupropion products, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, and systemic corticosteroids), metabolic disorders (e.g., hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, severe hepatic impairment, and hypoxia), use of illicit drugs (e.g., cocaine), or abuse or misuse of prescription drugs such as CNS stimulants. Additional predisposing conditions include diabetes mellitus treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin; use of anorectic drugs; and excessive use of alcohol, benzodiazepines, sedative/hypnotics, or opiates.

Incidence of Seizure with Bupropion Use

Doses for smoking cessation should not exceed 300 mg per day. The seizure rate associated with doses of sustained-release bupropion in depressed patients up to 300 mg per day is approximately 0.1% (1/1,000) and increases to approximately 0.4% (4/1,000) at doses up to 400 mg per day.

The risk of seizure can be reduced if the dose of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) for smoking cessation does not exceed 300 mg per day, given as 150 mg twice daily, and titration rate is gradual.

7.2 Potential for Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-release (SR) Tablets to Affect Other Drugs

Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6

Bupropion and its metabolites (erythrohydrobupropion, threohydrobupropion, hydroxybupropion) are CYP2D6 inhibitors. Therefore, coadministration of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase the exposures of drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6. Such drugs include certain antidepressants (e.g., venlafaxine, nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide). When used concomitantly with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets, it may be necessary to decrease the dose of these CYP2D6 substrates, particularly for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index.

Drugs that require metabolic activation by CYP2D6 to be effective (e.g., tamoxifen) theoretically could have reduced efficacy when administered concomitantly with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as bupropion. Patients treated concomitantly with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets and such drugs may require increased doses of the drug [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Digoxin

Coadministration of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets with digoxin may decrease plasma digoxin levels. Monitor plasma digoxin levels in patients treated concomitantly with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets and digoxin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold

Use extreme caution when coadministering bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets with other drugs that lower seizure threshold (e.g., other bupropion products, antipsychotics, antidepressants, theophylline, or systemic corticosteroids). Use low initial doses and increase the dose gradually [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage due to bupropion inhalation [^116raDj6]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a form of hemoptysis caused by disruption of the alveolar-capillary basement membrane causing alveolar bleeding. Inhalation of cocaine and other sympathomimetic agents are described as one of many pathologic causes. We describe what is to the author's knowledge the first reported case of DAH caused by inhalation of bupropion, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, which was successfully treated with systemic steroids. This case adds a novel agent to the known pathologic causes of DAH and introduces a novel form of bupropion toxicity, which should be considered as a cause in cases of DAH in the appropriate clinical context. The case also highlights the potential for further research into the pathologic interactions of bupropion at the alveolar basement membrane.

Tobacco cessation — pharmacotherapy dosing and precautions for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion sustained release (SR), and varenicline are outlined as follows: NRT patch is available as 21 mg, 14 mg, or 7 mg, with starting dose 21 mg for ≥ 10 CPD and 14 mg for < 10 CPD; local irritation is possible, avoid with skin disorders, and patch may be removed for sleep if needed. Gum or lozenge are 2 mg or 4 mg; starting dose is 4 mg if first tobacco use is ≤ 30 min after waking and 2 mg if > 30 min, with a maximum of 20 lozenges or 24 pieces of gum/d; hiccups/dyspepsia are possible and patients should avoid food or beverages 15 min before and after use. Nicotine nasal spray is 10 mg/mL with starting dose 1–2 doses/d (1 dose — 1 spray each nostril) and maximum 40 doses/d; local irritation is possible and it should be avoided with nasal or reactive airway disorders. Nicotine oral inhaler uses a 10-mg cartridge with puff for 20 min/cartridge every 1–2 h and maximum 16 cartridges/d; cough is possible and it should be avoided with reactive airway disorders. Bupropion SR is dosed 150 mg once daily (am) for 3 d, then 150 mg twice daily; it may be used in combination with NRT, and should be avoided with history/risk of seizures, eating disorders, MAO inhibitors, or CYP 2D6 inhibitor. Varenicline (0.5 mg or 1 mg) is titrated 0.5 mg once daily (am) for 3 d, then 0.5 mg twice daily for 4 d, then 1 mg twice daily followed by continuation pack for 3–6 mo; nausea is common, it should be taken with food, renal dosing is required, and it has very limited drug interactions with near-exclusive renal clearance. Use caution with all NRT products for patients with recent (< 2 wk) MI, serious arrhythmia, or angina; patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding; and adolescents; CPD is defined as cigarettes smoked per day.

3. How can I watch for and try to prevent suicidal thoughts and actions in myself or a family member?

Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is very important when an antidepressant medicine is started or when the dose is changed.
Call your healthcare provider right away to report new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings.
Keep all follow up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call the healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you have concerns about symptoms.

Call your healthcare provider right away if you or your family member has any of the following symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you:

thoughts about suicide or dying
attempts to commit suicide
new or worse depression
new or worse anxiety
feeling very agitated or restless
panic attacks
trouble sleeping (insomnia)
new or worse irritability
acting aggressive, being angry, or violent
acting on dangerous impulses
an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania)
other unusual changes in behavior or mood

What else do I need to know about antidepressant medicines?

Never stop an antidepressant medicine without first talking to a healthcare provider. Stopping an antidepressant medicine suddenly can cause other symptoms.
Antidepressants are medicines used to treat depression and other illnesses. It is important to discuss all the risks of treating depression and also the risks of not treating it. Patients and their families or other caregivers should discuss all treatment choices with the healthcare provider, not just the use of antidepressants.
Antidepressant medicines have other side effects. Talk to the healthcare provider about the side effects of the medicine prescribed for you or your family member.
Antidepressant medicines can interact with other medicines. Know all of the medicines that you or your family member takes. Keep a list of all medicines to show the healthcare provider. Do not start new medicines without first checking with your healthcare provider.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride and bupropion hydrochloride (contrave) [^115HLLRS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.4 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect CONTRAVE

Bupropion is primarily metabolized to hydroxybupropion by CYP2B6. Therefore, the potential exists for drug interactions between CONTRAVE and drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP2B6.

Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure. During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Inducers of CYP2B6: Ritonavir, Lopinavir, and Efavirenz: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can decrease bupropion and hydroxybupropion exposure and may reduce efficacy. Avoiding concomitant use with ritonavir, lopinavir, or efavirenz is recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.5 Drugs That Lower Seizure Threshold

Use extreme caution when coadministering CONTRAVE with other drugs that lower seizure threshold (e.g., antipsychotics, antidepressants, theophylline, or systemic corticosteroids). Use low initial doses and increase the dose gradually. Concomitant use of other bupropion-containing products is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

7.6 Dopaminergic Drugs (Levodopa and Amantadine)

Bupropion, levodopa, and amantadine have dopamine agonist effects. CNS toxicity has been reported when bupropion was coadministered with levodopa or amantadine. Adverse reactions have included restlessness, agitation, tremor, ataxia, gait disturbance, vertigo, and dizziness. It is presumed that the toxicity results from cumulative dopamine agonist effects. Use caution and monitor for such adverse reactions when administering CONTRAVE concomitantly with these drugs.

7.7 Use with Alcohol

In postmarketing experience, there have been rare reports of adverse neuropsychiatric events or reduced alcohol tolerance in patients who were drinking alcohol during treatment with bupropion. The consumption of alcohol during treatment with CONTRAVE should be minimized or avoided.

Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets can cause seizure. The risk of seizure is dose-related. The dose should not exceed 400 mg/day. Increase the dose gradually. Discontinue bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets and do not restart treatment if the patient experiences a seizure.

The risk of seizures is also related to patient factors, clinical situations, and concomitant medications that lower the seizure threshold. Consider these risks before initiating treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets.

The following conditions can also increase the risk of seizure: severe head injury; arteriovenous malformation; CNS tumor or CNS infection; severe stroke; concomitant use of other medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., other bupropion products, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, and systemic corticosteroids); metabolic disorders (e.g., hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, severe hepatic impairment, and hypoxia); use of illicit drugs (e.g., cocaine); or abuse or misuse of prescription drugs such as CNS stimulants. Additional predisposing conditions include diabetes mellitus treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin; use of anorectic drugs; and excessive use of alcohol, benzodiazepines, sedative/hypnotics, or opiates.

Incidence of Seizure with Bupropion Use

When bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets are dosed up to 300 mg/day, the incidence of seizure is approximately 0.1% (1/1,000) and increases to approximately 0.4% (4/1,000) at the maximum recommended dose of 400 mg/day.

The risk of seizure can be reduced if the dose of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets does not exceed 400 mg/day, given as 200 mg twice daily, and the titration rate is gradual.

### Dextromethorphan hydrobromide, bupropion hydrochloride (Auvelity) [^112Zn3LJ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.2	Seizure

Bupropion, a component of AUVELITY, can cause seizure. The risk of seizure with bupropion is dose-related.

When a bupropion hydrochloride (HCl) sustained-release tablet was dosed up to 300 mg per day (approximately 1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage of AUVELITY), the incidence of seizure was approximately 0.1% (1/1,000) and increased to approximately 0.4% (4/1,000) at the maximum recommended dosage for the sustained-release tablet of 400 mg per day (approximately 2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage of AUVELITY).

The risk of seizures is also related to patient factors, clinical situations, and concomitant medications that lower the seizure threshold. Consider these risks before initiating treatment with AUVELITY. AUVELITY is contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder, current or prior diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or bulimia, or undergoing abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and antiepileptic drugs [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. The following conditions can also increase the risk of seizure: severe head injury; arteriovenous malformation; CNS tumor or CNS infection; severe stroke; concomitant use of other medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., other bupropion products, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, and systemic corticosteroids); metabolic disorders (e.g., hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, severe hepatic impairment, and hypoxia); use of illicit drugs (e.g., cocaine); or abuse or misuse of prescription drugs such as CNS stimulants. Additional predisposing conditions include diabetes mellitus treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin; use of anorectic drugs; and excessive use of alcohol, benzodiazepines, sedative/hypnotics, or opiates.

Because the risk of seizure with bupropion is dose-related, screen patients for use of other bupropion-containing products prior to initiating AUVELITY [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. If concomitant use of AUVELITY with other bupropion-containing products is clinically warranted, inform patients of the risk. Discontinue AUVELITY and do not restart treatment if the patient experiences a seizure.

### Bupropion-induced psychosis: folklore or a fact? A systematic review of the literature [^114sb6ea]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Bupropion is a substituted phenyl-ethylamine that is extensively utilized for the treatment of major depressive disorder and for smoking cessation. It is a reuptake inhibitor of dopamine and norepinephrine, and it also has some nicotinic antagonism. There are concerns that it may increase the risk of psychosis due to its dopaminergic effects. Our objective is to review the literature and analyze the risk of bupropion precipitating a psychotic illness in the general population as well as in the populations with a history of psychotic symptoms.

Methods

A Medline database search limited to human and English-language studies was conducted using the keywords "bupropion" and "psychosis". A total of 23 articles were selected based on the relevance of the articles and their references. The data from these articles were collated.

Results

Collated data show that there is some evidence to suggest that bupropion may cause or worsen psychosis in selected subpopulations. Higher doses of bupropion appear more likely to be associated with the outcome severity. Preexisting psychotic symptoms, substance abuse and drug interactions also seem to increase the risk. Concurrent use of antipsychotics at adequate doses appears to be protective.

Conclusions

The literature is incomplete and in some cases contradictory. In selected cases, bupropion appears to be associated with the induction of psychotic symptoms in addition to the precipitation or worsening of an existing psychotic syndrome. Further research including controlled studies is required to clarify the risk of bupropion precipitating a psychotic illness in vulnerable populations.

7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Bupropion Hydrochloride Tablets

Bupropion is primarily metabolized to hydroxybupropion by CYP2B6. Therefore, the potential exists for drug interactions between bupropion hydrochloride tablets and drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP2B6.

Inhibitors of CYP2B6 Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure. Based on clinical response, dosage adjustment of bupropion hydrochloride tablets may be necessary when coadministered with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Inducers of CYP2B6

Ritonavir, Lopinavir, and Efavirenz: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can decrease bupropion and hydroxybupropion exposure. Dosage increase of bupropion hydrochloride tablets may be necessary when coadministered with ritonavir, lopinavir, or efavirenz [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] but shouldnot exceed the maximum recommended dose.

Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin: While not systematically studied, these drugs may induce the metabolism of bupropion and may decrease bupropion exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If bupropion is used concomitantly with a CYP inducer, it may be necessary to increase the dose of bupropion, but the maximum recommended dose should not be exceeded.

Prolonged, any abstinence and 7‐day PPA

Similar results to those for sustained abstinence were obtained for the other abstinence outcomes (Supporting information, Appendix, pp. 29–35). Relative to placebo, smokers treated with standard doses of varenicline (OR = 3.63, 95% CrI = 2.23–6.36) and bupropion (OR = 2.34, 95% CrI = 1.46–3.86) as monotherapies and in combination (OR = 4.76, 95% CrI = 2.48–10.10) were more likely to achieve prolonged abstinence (Figure 3b). There were no available data for combined varenicline and NRT at standard doses for this outcome.

For the any abstinence outcome (Figure 3c), standard varenicline was more effective than standard doses of NRT (OR = 1.32, 95% CrI = 1.05–1.65) and bupropion (OR = 1.46, 95% CrI = 1.18–1.81).

5.3 Seizure

Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) can cause seizure. The risk of seizure is dose-related. The dose should not exceed 300 mg once daily. Increase the dose gradually. Discontinue bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) and do not restart treatment if the patient experiences a seizure.

The risk of seizures is also related to patient factors, clinical situations, and concomitant medications that lower the seizure threshold. Consider these risks before initiating treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL). Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) are contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder or conditions that increase the risk of seizure (e.g., severe head injury, arteriovenous malformation, CNS tumor or CNS infection, severe stroke, anorexia nervosa or bulimia, or abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and antiepileptic drugs [see Contraindications (4)]. The following conditions can also increase the risk of seizure: concomitant use of other medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., other bupropion products, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, and systemic corticosteroids), metabolic disorders (e.g., hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, severe hepatic impairment, and hypoxia), or use of illicit drugs (e.g., cocaine) or abuse or misuse of prescription drugs such as CNS stimulants. Additional predisposing conditions include diabetes mellitus treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin, use of anorectic drugs, excessive use of alcohol, benzodiazepines, sedative/hypnotics, or opiates.

Incidence of Seizure with Bupropion Use

The incidence of seizure with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) has not been formally evaluated in clinical trials. In studies using bupropion HCl sustained-release up to 300 mg per day the incidence of seizure was approximately 0.1% (1/1000 patients). In a large prospective, follow-up study, the seizure incidence was approximately 0.4% (13/3200) with bupropion HCl immediate-release in the range of 300 mg to 450 mg per day.

Additional data accumulated for bupropion immediate-release suggests that the estimated seizure incidence increases almost tenfold between 450 and 600 mg/day. The risk of seizure can be reduced if the bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) dose does not exceed 450 mg once daily and the titration rate is gradual.

### Randomized trial of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion and NRT plus bupropion for smoking cessation: effectiveness in clinical practice [^114bB6k1]. Addiction (2013). Low credibility.

The study was designed to detect as significant an odds ratio of 1.5 for bupropion versus NRT which, based on an anticipated 25% 6-month cessation rate with NRT (34% bupropion) and with alpha and beta (1-power) set at 0.05, would require sample sizes of 700 (NRT) and 700 (bupropion). Given the weaker prior evidence for the combination compared with bupropion, 0.90 power was considered appropriate for this comparison (i.e. 44 versus 34%), requiring an additional 400 participants in a combination group (1800 participants in total). In the event, recruitment was slower than anticipated over the time clinics allocated and the trial closed with 1071 participants (418 NRT, 409 bupropion, 244 combination). It remained considerably larger than the manufacturer trial, and had 0.90 power to detect an odds ratio of 1.6 for bupropion versus NRT (i.e. 35% versus 25%).

Data were entered initially into local databases before transfer to a database at the lead site. Smoking cessation rates were compared using the OR with 95% CI, and logistic regression models were used to adjust for potentially confounding antecedent characteristics. We examined whether there were subgroups who benefited particularly from either NRT or bupropion by fitting logistic regression models with interaction terms for treatment by each of the characteristics of interest. The trial protocol specified that if there was no difference between single treatments, pooled data would be used for comparison with combination treatment. Unwanted symptom incidence and intensity were compared using χ 2 tests. Data were processed and examined only after all follow-ups had been completed and the data file closed.

### Bupropion hydrochloride (Wellbutrin xl) [^117DxSk8]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Seizures: Bupropion is associated with a dose-related risk of seizures. The risk of seizures is also related to patient factors, clinical situations, and concomitant medications, which must be considered in selection of patients for therapy with WELLBUTRIN XL. WELLBUTRIN XL should be discontinued and not restarted in patients who experience a seizure while on treatment.

As WELLBUTRIN XL is bioequivalent to both the immediate-release formulation of bupropion and to the sustained-release formulation of bupropion, the seizure incidence with WELLBUTRIN XL, while not formally evaluated in clinical trials, may be similar to that presented below for the immediate-release and sustained-release formulations of bupropion.

Dose: At doses up to 300 mg/day of the sustained-release formulation of bupropion (WELLBUTRIN SR), the incidence of seizure is approximately 0.1% (1/1,000).

Data for the immediate-release formulation of bupropion revealed a seizure incidence of approximately 0.4% (i.e., 13 of 3,200 patients followed prospectively) in patients treated at doses in a range of 300 to 450 mg/day. This seizure incidence (0.4%) may exceed that of some other marketed antidepressants.

Additional data accumulated for the immediate-release formulation of bupropion suggested that the estimated seizure incidence increases almost tenfold between 450 and 600 mg/day. The 600 mg dose is twice the usual adult dose and one and one-third the maximum recommended daily dose (450 mg) of WELLBUTRIN XL. This disproportionate increase in seizure incidence with dose incrementation calls for caution in dosing.

Patient factors: Predisposing factors that may increase the risk of seizure with bupropion use include history of head trauma or prior seizure, central nervous system (CNS) tumor, the presence of severe hepatic cirrhosis, and concomitant medications that lower seizure threshold.
Clinical situations: Circumstances associated with an increased seizure risk include, among others, excessive use of alcohol or sedatives (including benzodiazepines); addiction to opiates, cocaine, or stimulants; use of over-the-counter stimulants and anorectics; and diabetes treated with oral hypoglycemics or insulin.
Concomitant medications: Many medications (e.g., antipsychotics, antidepressants, theophylline, systemic steroids) are known to lower seizure threshold.

### Clinical studies on drug-drug interactions involving metabolism and transport: methodology, pitfalls, and interpretation [^114TNRqT]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

What comes to other types of complex DDIs, those caused by inhibitory or inducing major metabolites and mechanism‐based inhibition typically require carefully performed in vitro studies to initially identify the risks. The contribution of metabolites as perpetrators has only been realized during the past decade. It has, for example, been estimated that the clinically observed CYP2C9 inhibition by amiodarone, CYP2D6 inhibition by bupropion, and CYP3A4 inhibition by sertraline could only be explained accurately when considering their inhibitory metabolites. 74 Of note, even glucuronide metabolites can act as mechanism‐based inhibitors of CYP enzymes, capable of causing strong DDIs. 75 Such DDIs can usually be studied using standard clinical DDI study methodology, although in the case of mechanism‐based inhibition and in the case of metabolites that have a very long t 1/2, the time‐dependency of the DDI risk may warrant long‐term administration or other more focused studies. In addition, the growing number of fixed‐dose combination products among newly marketed drugs (especially antiviral agents) represents a unique challenge of understanding the contribution of each drug component to the overall clinical effect when the combination is evaluated as a perpetrator.

### Outcomes of bupropion therapy for smoking cessation during routine clinical use [^111QFHnM]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Knowledge pertaining to the effectiveness of smoking cessation treatments and patient characteristics that may affect success may enable smokers and clinicians to select individualized treatment for each patient and ultimately increase the success rate of smoking cessation in general.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of bupropion as a smoking cessation agent when used in routine clinical practice.

Methods

This was a prospective, observational study with a one year follow-up period. Adult smokers presenting to community pharmacies in British Columbia, Canada, with an index prescription for bupropion for smoking cessation (N = 205) were eligible. The primary outcome was the biochemically validated 12 month point abstinence (PA) rate from smoking. Secondary outcomes included the frequency of adverse events, patterns of bupropion use in routine clinical practice, and possible predictors of bupropion effectiveness.

Results

The validated 12 month PA rate was 21.0%. Of subjects who reported taking at least one dose of bupropion, 70.4% (126/179) experienced at least one adverse event and 29.6% (53/179) reported stopping the drug due to adverse effects. Greater length of time on bupropion (OR 0.98) and a lower cigarette pack-year history (OR 1.05) were associated with an increase in the odds of smoking cessation.

Conclusions

Subjects receiving bupropion in a real-life setting exhibited a similar abstinence rate at 12 months as has been observed in the active drug groups of placebo-controlled clinical trials. However, the patterns of use and discontinuation rate due to adverse events differed substantially from those observed in early efficacy studies.

### Randomized trial of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion and NRT plus bupropion for smoking cessation: effectiveness in clinical practice [^1125RFsU]. Addiction (2013). Low credibility.

With these findings in mind, it is worth considering the position of bupropion for smoking cessation. Bupropion efficacy appears to be lower than for varenicline, and while apparently similarly as effective as NRT, it causes a higher incidence of some unwanted effects (nine effects noted in this study as against two effects with higher NRT incidence). Might unwanted events be reduced without loss of efficacy with 150 rather than 300 mg bupropion? The original dose-ranging trial would suggest so. Longer-term cessation rates for 150- and 300-mg doses were indistinguishable, while there were more withdrawals and serious unwanted events with 300 mg. Without further research into the potential of optimal dosing, current evidence suggests bupropion might be second line for those failing with NRT or varenicline, although its cost-per-week benefit over these treatments is an advantage.

A potentially unique benefit for bupropion over NRT was our observation of a possible improvement in abstinence for those reporting a history of depression. This might be tested in future in a randomized controlled trial among those with a history of depression. Bupropion ameliorated the somewhat detrimental effect of depression observed with NRT, with a suggestion that when given bupropion those with depression, compared with those without, were more successful. Although this seems plausible, given bupropion's previous indication as an antidepressant, in three previous studies that compared bupropion with either placebo or low-dose bupropion no such additional benefit was observed among those with a history of depression–. Taken together, these results would suggest that if bupropion is not additionally beneficial for those with a depression history, then NRT might at best be ineffectual, or even detrimental, for such smokers. Researchers with older data sets where depression history was recorded might investigate this. Perhaps surprisingly, our analysis of depression does not appear to have been undertaken in the three previous trials comparing bupropion with NRT–. Given the high prevalence of depression among smokers seeking help to stop, our tentative finding merits further study.

Consider reducing the dose and/or frequency of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) in patients with renal impairment (Glomerular Filtration Rate less than 90 mL per min) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.8 Use of Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets (SR) with Reversible MAOIs Such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue

Do not start bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) in a patient who is being treated with a reversible MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. Drug interactions can increase the risk of hypertensive reactions [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.6)].

In some cases, a patient already receiving therapy with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of hypertensive reactions in a particular patient, bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for 2 weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue.

The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg per kg with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of a drug interaction with such use [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.6)].

### Pharmacotherapy for obesity: moving towards efficacy improvement [^114pgdfn]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Fixed-dose combination of drugs: naltrexone plus bupropion and phentermine plus topiramate

Considering that obesity is a chronic disease and has a complex pathophysiology, targeting multiple pathways at once could lead to better results than targeting just one component. Combination therapy is widely accepted in other chronic metabolic diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes, but much less in obesity. Among the advantages, we can cite an increased therapeutic efficacy due to the synergistic or additive action of the combined drugs, blockade of compensatory mechanisms that lead to a weight loss plateau, and the possibility of using lower doses to minimize the chances of adverse effects. However, there are also disadvantages, including undesirable drug interactions, more contraindications, higher costs and, specifically in combination treatments, dosage inflexibility. The potential for combination therapies was supported by a study that demonstrated a higher probability for a fixed combination to advance from phase I to approval than a drug studied in monotherapy. To date, two fixed-dose combinations have been studied and approved in some countries.

### Bupropion hydrochloride (Xl) [^1179MtR7]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Seizure

Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) can cause seizure. The risk of seizure is dose-related. The dose should not exceed 300 mg once daily. Increase the dose gradually. Discontinue bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) and do not restart treatment if the patient experiences a seizure.

The risk of seizures is also related to patient factors, clinical situations, and concomitant medications that lower the seizure threshold. Consider these risks before initiating treatment with bupropion hydrochloride. Bupropion hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder or conditions that increase the risk of seizure (e.g., severe head injury, arteriovenous malformation, CNS tumor or CNS infection, severe stroke, anorexia nervosa or bulimia, or abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and antiepileptic drugs [see Contraindications (4)]. The following conditions can also increase the risk of seizure: concomitant use of other medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., other bupropion products, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, and systemic corticosteroids), metabolic disorders (e.g., hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, severe hepatic impairment, and hypoxia), or use of illicit drugs (e.g., cocaine) or abuse or misuse of prescription drugs such as CNS stimulants. Additional predisposing conditions include diabetes mellitus treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin, use of anorectic drugs, excessive use of alcohol, benzodiazepines, sedative/hypnotics, or opiates.

Incidence of Seizure with Bupropion Hydrochloride Use

The incidence of seizure with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) has not been formally evaluated in clinical trials. In studies using bupropion HCl sustained-release up to 300 mg per day the incidence of seizure was approximately 0.1% (1/1,000 patients). In a large prospective, follow-up study, the seizure incidence was approximately 0.4% (13/3,200) with bupropion HCl immediate-release in the range of 300 mg to 450 mg per day.

Additional data accumulated for bupropion immediate-release suggests that the estimated seizure incidence increases almost tenfold between 450 and 600 mg/day. The risk of seizure can be reduced if the bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) dose does not exceed 450 mg once daily and the titration rate is gradual.

5.3 Seizure

Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) can cause seizure. The risk of seizure is dose-related. The dose should not exceed 300 mg once daily. Increase the dose gradually. Discontinue bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) and do not restart treatment if the patient experiences a seizure.

The risk of seizures is also related to patient factors, clinical situations, and concomitant medications that lower the seizure threshold. Consider these risks before initiating treatment with bupropion hydrochloride (XL). Bupropion hydrochloride (XL) is contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder or conditions that increase the risk of seizure (e.g., severe head injury, arteriovenous malformation, CNS tumor or CNS infection, severe stroke, anorexia nervosa or bulimia, or abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and antiepileptic drugs [see Contraindications (4)]. The following conditions can also increase the risk of seizure: concomitant use of other medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., other bupropion products, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, and systemic corticosteroids), metabolic disorders (e.g., hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, severe hepatic impairment, and hypoxia), or use of illicit drugs (e.g., cocaine) or abuse or misuse of prescription drugs such as CNS stimulants. Additional predisposing conditions include diabetes mellitus treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin, use of anorectic drugs, excessive use of alcohol, benzodiazepines, sedative/hypnotics, or opiates.

Incidence of Seizure with Bupropion Use

The incidence of seizure with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) has not been formally evaluated in clinical trials. In studies using bupropion HCl sustained-release up to 300 mg per day the incidence of seizure was approximately 0.1% (1/1,000 patients). In a large prospective, follow-up study, the seizure incidence was approximately 0.4% (13/3,200) with bupropion HCl immediate-release in the range of 300 mg to 450 mg per day.

### Intravenous bupropion: a previously undocumented method of abuse of a commonly prescribed antidepressant agent [^1176DtYR]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Bupropion is an antidepressant commonly prescribed as a smoking cessation aid. It has effects on dopamine and norepinephrine, and can lower seizure threshold, particularly in overdose. Several cases of recreational use of bupropion via nasal insufflation have been reported in the literature. Here we describe a first case of intravenous bupropion dependence, with no evidence of resulting seizure activity. This addiction was sustained in part under the the premise of seeking smoking cessation aid. Pharmacokinetic interactions are explored, and the literature with respect to buproprion abuse is reviewed. We propose that bupropion may have stimulant effects amenable to abuse that vary with route of administration. Health care providers may wish to exercise additional caution when prescribing bupropion to unfamiliar patients.

2.1 General Instructions for Use

To minimize the risk of seizure, increase the dose gradually [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets should be swallowed whole and not crushed, divided, or chewed. Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets may be taken with or without food.

The usual adult target dose for bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets is 300 mg/day, given as 150 mg twice daily. Initiate dosing with 150 mg/day given as a single daily dose in the morning. After 3 days of dosing, the dose may be increased to the 300-mg/day target dose, given as 150 mg twice daily. There should be an interval of at least 8 hours between successive doses. A maximum of 400 mg/day, given as 200 mg twice daily, may be considered for patients in whom no clinical improvement is noted after several weeks of treatment at 300 mg/day. To avoid high peak concentrations of bupropion and/or its metabolites, do not exceed 200 mg in any single dose.

It is generally agreed that acute episodes of depression require several months or longer of antidepressant drug treatment beyond the response in the acute episode. It is unknown whether the dose of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets needed for maintenance treatment is identical to the dose that provided an initial response. Periodically reassess the need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dose for such treatment.

2.2 Dose Adjustment in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

In patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 7 to 15), the maximum dose of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets is 100 mg/day or 150 mg every other day. In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 5 to 6), consider reducing the dose and/or frequency of dosing [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.3 Dose Adjustment in Patients with Renal Impairment

Consider reducing the dose and/or frequency of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets in patients with renal impairment (Glomerular Filtration Rate [GFR] less than 90 mL/min) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Acute generalized pustular psoriasis exacerbated by the COVID-19 vaccine [^1173rzKi]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A man in his 40s with morbid obesity, hypertension, depression/anxiety, and psoriasis presented with an acute, rapidly progressive skin eruption. His preexisting psoriasis had been present for years, with minimally symptomatic transient plaques managed with emollients. His medications included lisinopril and bupropion, which were started 1 month earlier. He received Pfizer vaccine (first dose) 5 days before the development of the rash, with no recent illnesses or new medication exposures. The rash began with tender, erythematous patches and plaques on his abdomen and arms, with progression to his legs and buttocks. Two days after onset, an immediate care clinic diagnosed a yeast infection and prescribed fluconazole 100 mg orally (1 dose taken) and nystatin cream. The following day, he had significantly more surface area involvement of rash with worsening malaise, and upon presentation to the emergency department, he was prescribed prednisone 50 mg/d (0.3 mg/kg/d; patient's weight, 172.36 kg) and doxycycline 100 mg twice a day and given 1 dose of intravenous methylprednisolone 125 mg. The tick-borne illness panel was negative, and he was instructed to discontinue lisinopril and bupropion.

### Antidepressants for smoking cessation [^113DcUzQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

This is the fifth update of a review first published in 2003. It is a linked to a wider project updating all evidence on licenced pharmacotherapies and e‐cigarettes for smoking cessation (Lindson 2022). It was deemed appropriate to update this review as a useful output of this wider project for the following reasons. The ongoing impact of smoking on global morbidity and mortality necessitates effective and safe treatments to aid smoking cessation. Emerging evidence assessing antidepressants as smoking cessation treatments has the potential to change or strengthen many of our conclusions regarding the efficacy, harms, and tolerability of the antidepressants currently being used to help people quit smoking (bupropion and nortriptyline). Further evidence on harms may help to clarify the potential interaction between bupropion and seizures, as well as psychiatric adverse events. Multiple trials and observational studies have previously associated bupropion with increasing the risk of medically important adverse events, including seizures, anxiety, depression, and insomnia (Aubin 2012). New evidence may also help us to directly compare the harms and efficacy of antidepressants with other first‐line smoking cessation pharmacotherapies, providing a further aid to decision making when helping people to quit tobacco smoking.

### Comparative clinical effectiveness and safety of tobacco cessation pharmacotherapies and electronic cigarettes: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114QD8H1]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aim

To determine how varenicline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and electronic cigarettes compare with respect to their clinical effectiveness and safety.

Method

Systematic reviews and Bayesian network meta‐analyses of randomized controlled trials, in any setting, of varenicline, bupropion, NRT and e‐cigarettes (in high, standard and low doses, alone or in combination) in adult smokers and smokeless tobacco users with follow‐up duration of 24 weeks or greater (effectiveness) or any duration (safety). Nine databases were searched until 19 February 2019. Primary outcomes were sustained tobacco abstinence and serious adverse events (SAEs). We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and treatment rankings and conducted meta‐regression to explore covariates.

Results

We identified 363 trials for effectiveness and 355 for safety. Most monotherapies and combination therapies were more effective than placebo at helping participants to achieve sustained abstinence; the most effective of these, estimated with some imprecision, were varenicline standard [OR = 2.83, 95% credible interval (CrI) = 2.34–3.39] and varenicline standard + NRT standard (OR = 5.75, 95% CrI = 2.27–14.88). Estimates were higher in smokers receiving counselling than in those without and in studies with higher baseline nicotine dependence scores than in those with lower scores. Varenicline standard + NRT standard showed a high probability of being ranked best or second‐best. For safety, only bupropion at standard dose increased the odds of experiencing SAEs compared with placebo (OR = 1.27, 95% CrI = 1.04–1.58), and we found no evidence of effect modification.

Conclusions

Most tobacco cessation monotherapies and combination therapies are more effective than placebo at helping participants to achieve sustained abstinence, with varenicline appearing to be most effective based on current evidence. There does not appear to be strong evidence of associations between most tobacco cessation pharmacotherapies and adverse events; however, the data are limited and there is a need for improved reporting of safety data.

2.4 Switching a Patient to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Antidepressant

At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat depression and initiation of therapy with bupropion hydrochloride tablets. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping bupropion hydrochloride tablets before starting an MAOI antidepressant [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.6)].

2.5 Use of Bupropion Hydrochloride Tablets with Reversible MAOIs Such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue

Do not start bupropion hydrochloride tablets in a patient who is being treated with a reversible MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. Drug interactions can increase the risk of hypertensive reactions. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, non-pharmacological interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.6)].

In some cases, a patient already receiving therapy with bupropion hydrochloride tablets may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of hypertensive reactions in a particular patient, bupropion hydrochloride tablets should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for 2 weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with bupropion hydrochloride tablets may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue.

The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with bupropion hydrochloride tablets is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of a drug interaction with such use [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.6)].

### Bupropion hydrochloride (Wellbutrin) [^116XKLZ4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Seizure

Wellbutrin XL can cause seizure. The risk of seizure is dose-related. The dose should not exceed 300 mg once daily. Increase the dose gradually. Discontinue Wellbutrin XL and do not restart treatment if the patient experiences a seizure.

The risk of seizures is also related to patient factors, clinical situations, and concomitant medications that lower the seizure threshold. Consider these risks before initiating treatment with Wellbutrin XL. Wellbutrin XL is contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder or conditions that increase the risk of seizure (e.g., severe head injury, arteriovenous malformation, CNS tumor or CNS infection, severe stroke, anorexia nervosa or bulimia, or abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and antiepileptic drugs [see Contraindications (4)]. The following conditions can also increase the risk of seizure: concomitant use of other medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., other bupropion products, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, and systemic corticosteroids), metabolic disorders (e.g., hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, severe hepatic impairment, and hypoxia), or use of illicit drugs (e.g., cocaine) or abuse or misuse of prescription drugs such as CNS stimulants. Additional predisposing conditions include diabetes mellitus treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin, use of anorectic drugs, excessive use of alcohol, benzodiazepines, sedative/hypnotics, or opiates.

Incidence of Seizure with Bupropion Use

The incidence of seizure with Wellbutrin XL has not been formally evaluated in clinical trials. In studies using bupropion HCl sustained-release up to 300 mg per day the incidence of seizure was approximately 0.1% (1/1000 patients). In a large prospective, follow-up study, the seizure incidence was approximately 0.4% (13/3200) with bupropion HCl immediate-release in the range of 300 mg to 450 mg per day.

Additional data accumulated for bupropion immediate-release suggests that the estimated seizure incidence increases almost tenfold between 450 and 600 mg/day. The risk of seizure can be reduced if the Wellbutrin XL dose does not exceed 450 mg once daily and the titration rate is gradual.

### Does the time between doses in an unintentional double dose bupropion exposure affect the incidence of adverse effects? A retrospective cohort study [^112QhxTq]. Clinical Toxicology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Unintentional therapeutic errors with bupropion are common. The impact of the timing of the second dose in a double dose exposure on adverse effects is not well studied. This study aims to compare adverse effects between double doses separated by < 720min and ≥ 720min.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of unintentional double dose bupropion ingestions in patients reported to a regional poison center between January 2018 and December 2022. Patients were included if the double dose was their own medication, unintentional, and a single substance exposure. Data collected included age, gender, bupropion formulation, prescribed home dose, dosing error details, time between doses, caller site, referral to the emergency department, patient observation at healthcare facilities, clinical effects, and outcome.

Results

Among 663 cases screened, 294 met inclusion criteria. The majority involved extended-release preparations (69.0%). Seventy-four were observed in a healthcare facility and monitored for 24h from initial dose. The incidence of seizures was 5.3%, including one case not observed for a full 24h. There was no significant difference in the incidence of seizures (2.7% versus 7.7%), tachycardia (27.0% versus 30.8%), hypertension (18.9% versus 38.5%) other signs/symptoms (27.0% versus 23.1%), or any signs/symptoms (48.6% versus 61.5%) between double doses of extended release bupropion separated by < 720min and those separated by ≥ 720min, respectively.

Discussion

In patients with double dose exposures to extended-release bupropion, it does not appear that the timing of the second dose can be used to risk-stratify patients. Our data are limited by sample size.

Conclusion

In this study, the time between double doses of bupropion did not affect the incidence of seizure, tachycardia, hypertension, other signs/symptoms, or any signs/symptoms. Larger, prospective studies investigating this difference would strengthen our understanding and management of these patients.

### Drug-induced rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome with bupropion administration [^111EZfVs]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Sustained-release bupropion is commonly used for the symptomatic relief of depressive illness and as an adjuvant in smoking cessation therapy.

Objective

To report a case of bupropion-induced drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome, including acute hepatitis, obstructive lung disease, and myositis.

Methods

After the patient discontinued use of bupropion, serologic tests, muscle biopsies, pulmonary function tests, a chest x-ray examination, venous Doppler ultrasounds, and an electrocardiogram were performed.

Results

On discontinuation of bupropion and prolonged systemic corticosteroid therapy, there was complete resolution of symptoms.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome induced by bupropion therapy. We report this case to notify clinicians of the potential serious multisystem complications that can occur with sustained-release bupropion therapy.

2.1 General Instructions for Use

To minimize the risk of seizure, increase the dose gradually [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Increases in dose should not exceed 100 mg/day in a 3-day period. Bupropion hydrochloride tablets should be swallowed whole and not crushed, divided, or chewed. Bupropion hydrochloride tablets may be taken with or without food.

The recommended starting dose is 200 mg/day, given as 100 mg twice daily. After 3 days of dosing, the dose may be increased to 300 mg/day, given as 100 mg 3 times daily, with at least 6 hours between successive doses. Dosing above 300 mg/day may be accomplished using the 75- or 100-mg tablets.

A maximum of 450 mg/day, given in divided doses of not more than 150 mg each, may be considered for patients who show no clinical improvement after several weeks of treatment at 300 mg/day. Administer the 100-mg tablet 4 times daily to not exceed the limit of 150 mg in a single dose.

It is generally agreed that acute episodes of depression require several months or longer of antidepressant drug treatment beyond the response in the acute episode. It is unknown whether the dose of bupropion hydrochloride tablets needed for maintenance treatment is identical to the dose that provided an initial response. Periodically reassess the need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dose for such treatment.

2.2 Dose Adjustment in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

In patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 7 to 15), the maximum dose of bupropion hydrochloride tablets are 75 mg/day. In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 5 to 6), consider reducing the dose and/or frequency of dosing [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.3 Dose Adjustment in Patients with Renal Impairment

Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Many medicines increase your chances of having seizures or other serious side effects if you take them while you are taking bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets.

How should I take bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets?

Take bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider. Do not change your dose or stop taking bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets without talking to your healthcare provider first.
Swallow bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets whole. Do not chew, cut, or crush bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets. If you do, the medicine will be released into your body too quickly. If this happens you may be more likely to get side effects including seizures. Tell your healthcare provider if you cannot swallow tablets.
Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets may have an odor. This is normal.
Take bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets at the same time each day.
Take your doses of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets at least 8 hours apart.
You may take bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets with or without food.
If you miss a dose, do not take an extra dose to make up for the dose you missed. Wait and take your next dose at the regular time. This is very important. Too much bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets can increase your chance of having a seizure.
If you take too much bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets, or overdose, call your local emergency room or poison control center right away.
Do not take any other medicines while taking bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets unless your healthcare provider has told you it is okay.
If you are taking bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets for the treatment of major depressive disorder, it may take several weeks for you to feel that bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets are working. Once you feel better, it is important to keep taking bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets exactly as directed by your healthcare provider. Call your healthcare provider if you do not feel bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets are working for you.

### Comparative clinical effectiveness and safety of tobacco cessation pharmacotherapies and electronic cigarettes: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115xBDBy]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Comparison to other studies

Our findings are largely comparable to those of previous NMAs. We found evidence that nearly all identified doses of tobacco cessation medicines increased the probability of sustained abstinence compared to placebo. For combined bupropion + NRT, although the HIQA report found evidence that this treatment improved the likelihood of cessation (from the quit date or PPA) compared to placebo (control), this was only observed in our analyses for 'any abstinence' and 7‐day PPA outcomes, and not for sustained or prolonged outcomes. Similar to our findings, previous NMAs also found evidence that monotherapy with varenicline increased the chance of cessation compared to bupropion and to NRT, while finding inconclusive evidence of a difference in likelihood of quitting between bupropion and NRT. Findings were also consistent for combined varenicline + NRT, which showed improved probability of quitting compared to bupropion and NRT monotherapies. Although the HIQA report showed that combined varenicline and bupropion was more effective than bupropion or NRT delivered as monotherapies, we did not. However, we stratified our analyses by dose, while theirs did not. The results of ranking of tobacco cessation treatments were similar throughout NMAs. Our results were also comparable to those of the latest relevant Cochrane Systematic Reviews: we similarly found very imprecise evidence that e‐cigarettes led to higher quit rates than placebo and NRT, that varenicline was more effective for achieving sustained abstinence than placebo (at low and standard doses), bupropion and NRT, that bupropion standard increased sustained abstinence compared to placebo and that various forms of NRT were more effective than placebo at standard and high doses.

### Methylprednisolone (Medrol) [^117JtGXh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DRUG INTERACTIONS

The pharmacokinetic interactions listed below are potentially clinically important. Mutual inhibition of metabolism occurs with concurrent use of cyclosporin and methylprednisolone; therefore, it is possible that adverse events associated with the individual use of either drug may be more apt to occur. Convulsions have been reported with concurrent use of methylprednisolone and cyclosporin. Drugs that induce hepatic enzymes such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and rifampin may increase the clearance of methylprednisolone and may require increases in methylprednisolone dose to achieve the desired response. Drugs such as troleandomycin and ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of methylprednisolone and thus decrease its clearance. Therefore, the dose of methylprednisolone should be titrated to avoid steroid toxicity.

Methylprednisolone may increase the clearance of chronic high dose aspirin. This could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of salicylate toxicity when methylprednisolone is withdrawn. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in patients suffering from hypoprothrombinemia.

The effect of methylprednisolone on oral anticoagulants is variable. There are reports of enhanced as well as diminished effects of anticoagulant when given concurrently with corticosteroids. Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect.

Information for the Patient

Persons who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles. Patients should also be advised that if they are exposed, medical advice should be sought without delay.

Depression

Four studies comparing bupropion to placebo/no pharmacological treatment analysed whether there was any interaction between depression and smoking quit rates (Anthenelli 2016 (analysis reported in West 2018); Aubin 2004; Cinciripini 2018; Kalman 2011). We did not find any evidence of this (Table 5).

Depression as a moderator of the relationship between antidepressants and smoking cessation

Harms

A meta‐analysis of 21 studies, including 10,931 participants, found evidence that bupropion resulted in more non‐serious adverse events (AEs) than placebo or a non‐pharmacological treatment (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.18; I² = 62%; Analysis 1.4). There was some evidence of heterogeneity; however, all but one effect estimate showed the same direction of effect (higher AEs in the bupropion arms). There was also evidence of higher rates of psychiatric AEs in the bupropion arms, with much lower levels of heterogeneity (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.36; I² = 13%; 8 studies, 4494 participants; Analysis 1.5). Looking specifically at anxiety and insomnia, the effects also demonstrated higher rates in the bupropion groups (Analysis 1.6; Analysis 1.7). The Perkins 2013 study did not provide sufficient data to be included in meta‐analyses; however, trialists found that AEs experienced by those in the bupropion and placebo groups were mild, with most participants reporting no AEs at all. Relative to placebo, people using bupropion were less likely to report agitation and more likely to report decreased appetite. The authors deemed these effects to reflect a relief of withdrawal symptoms, and not actual 'adverse effects'.

### Bupropion in dermatology: a brief update [^111J7dmJ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

There is currently an interest in evaluating the role that antidepressants may play in the treatment of primary cutaneous disorders. It has been proposed that antidepressants could have anti-inflammatory effects, but the clinical relevance of this effect has not been adequately established. In the case of bupropion, evidence for its specific use in dermatologic conditions currently come only from a pilot study and a case report. While this level of evidence is unlikely to be sufficient to guide clinical practice, the authors of this brief update hope to sort the available information to serve as a guide and provide a structure for future research.

7.5 Use with Alcohol

In postmarketing experience, there have been rare reports of adverse neuropsychiatric events or reduced alcohol tolerance in patients who were drinking alcohol during treatment with bupropion hydrochloride tablets. The consumption of alcohol during treatment with bupropion hydrochloride tablets should be minimized or avoided.

7.6 MAO Inhibitors

Bupropion inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. Concomitant use of MAOIs and bupropion is contraindicated because there is an increased risk of hypertensive reactions if bupropion is used concomitantly with MAOIs. Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAO inhibitor phenelzine. At least 14 daysshould elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat depression and initiation of treatment with bupropion hydrochloride tablets. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping bupropion hydrochloride tablets before starting an MAOI antidepressant [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5), Contraindications (4)].

7.7 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions

False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for amphetamines have been reported in patients taking bupropion. This is due to lack of specificity of some screening tests. False-positive test results may result even following discontinuation of bupropion therapy. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish bupropion from amphetamines.

### Bupropion for major depressive disorder: pharmacokinetic and formulation considerations [^117M9C5N]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatric condition, with 6.6% of the adult population in the United States experiencing a major depressive episode during any given year. Depressed patients must receive adequate treatment to maximize the likelihood of clinical success. Bupropion hydrochloride, a noradrenergic/dopaminergic antidepressant, is available in 3 oral formulations: immediate release (IR) (given TID), sustained release (SR) (given BID), and extended release (XL) (given QD). Understanding the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and formulations of bupropion can help optimize clinical use.

Objectives

The aims of this article were to provide a review of the PK properties of bupropion and identify its various formulations and clinical applications to help optimize treatment of MDD.

Methods

In this review, data concerning PK trials/reports were collected from articles identified using a PubMed search. The search was conducted without date limitations and using the search terms bupropion, bupropion SR, bupropion XL, bupropion pharmacokinetics, bupropion metabolism, and bupropion drug interactions. Additional reports were selected from references that appeared in articles identified in the original search. In addition, data from studies summarized in product information and labeling were obtained. All available information, concentrating on studies in humans, pertinent to bupropion PK properties and/or formulations was included.

Results

Bupropion is extensively metabolized by the liver (t(1/2), approximately 21 hours). Hydroxybupropion, the primary active metabolite (t(1/2), approximately 20 hours), is formed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6. At steady state, C(max) of hydroxybupropion is 4- to 7-fold higher, and the AUC is approximately 10-fold greater, compared with those of the parent drug. Threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion (mean [SD] t(1/2) values, approximately 37 [13] and approximately 33 [10] hours, respectively), the other active metabolites of bupropion, are formed via nonmicrosomal pathways. Relative to bupropion, the C(max) values are approximately 5-fold greater for threohydrobupropion and similar for erythrohydrobupropion. Based on a mouse antitetrabenazine model, hydroxybupropion is approximately 50% as active as bupropion, and threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion are approximately 20% as active as bupropion. Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold and, therefore, concurrent administration with other agents that lower the seizure threshold should be undertaken cautiously. Potential interactions with other agents that are metabolized by CYP2B6 should be considered. In addition, bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and may reduce clearance of agents metabolized by this enzyme. Absorption of the XL formulation is prolonged compared with the IR and SR formulations (T(max), approximately 5 hours vs approximately 1.5 and approximately 3 hours, respectively). Bupropion is dosed without regard to food.

Conclusions

Understanding the PK profile and formulations of bupropion can help optimize clinical use. Bupropion is metabolized extensively, resulting in 3 active metabolites. This metabolic profile, various patient factors (eg, age, medical illnesses), and potential drug interactions should be considered when prescribing bupropion. The 3 formulations-bupropion, bupropion SR, and bupropion XL-are bioequivalent and offer options to optimize treatment for patients with MDD.

### Randomized trial of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion and NRT plus bupropion for smoking cessation: effectiveness in clinical practice [^113qDKrZ]. Addiction (2013). Low credibility.

Study medication

Study medication was provided free of charge to the trial in standard packaging by all the manufacturers (Pfizer UK, GSK UK, Novartis UK). NRT was dispensed by trial clinicians/pharmacists under whichever scheme operated locally. At two sites with prescribing doctors, bupropion was dispensed under arrangement with the local pharmacy. At the two sites without doctors, bupropion was prescribed in the usual way by the participant's primary care doctor [general practitioner (GP)], following screening at the clinic. GPs were asked to adhere to the randomized treatment assignment.

Following usual practice in NHS clinics, participants assigned to NRT could choose a single product, after consultation with clinic staff regarding such considerations as previous experience with products and appropriate dosage. Dosage over the 12-week course could be adjusted or the product type changed as considered necessary. Participants assigned to bupropion took 150 mg bupropion for the first 6 days and 300 mg for the remainder of the 8-week course, in line with the SpC. The dose could be reduced if considered necessary and those experiencing unacceptable symptoms could stop taking bupropion and switch to NRT. Following NHS practice, medication was dispensed to participants in batches over time. It was usually given every 2 weeks throughout the support phase until the final session (session 7) when the remainder of the course was dispensed to those continuing.

### Lopinavir / ritonavir reduces bupropion plasma concentrations in healthy subjects [^113mmsUj]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Limited data are available about the effect of steady-state lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r) on bupropion pharmacokinetics. As patients may benefit by using these two agents in combination, this study determined the extent and direction of this drug-drug interaction. Twelve healthy volunteers received a single 100 mg dose of sustained-release bupropion before and after 2 weeks of treatment with LPV/r 400 mg/100 mg twice daily. Pharmacokinetics profiles were determined on days 1 and 30 for bupropion and hydroxybupropion and days 29 and 30 for LPV/r. LPV/r administration significantly decreased bupropion maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) by 57% (90% confidence interval (CI), 38–76%; P < 0.01) and area under the curve (AUC) infinity by 57% (90% CI, 32–83%; P < 0.01). Hydroxybupropion C(max) and AUC infinity decreased by 31% (90% CI, 7–55%; P < 0.01) and by 50% (90% CI, 34–65%; P < 0.01), respectively. No significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of LPV/r were found following administration of a single dose of bupropion. Concurrent use of LPV/r and bupropion resulted in decreased exposure to bupropion and its active metabolite hydroxybupropion that may necessitate as much as a 100% dose increase of bupropion. A probable mechanism for this interaction is the concurrent induction of cytochrome P450 2B6 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes. LPV/r exposure is unaffected by a single dose of bupropion.

### Strategies for improving the management of immune-related adverse events [^112CRL1L]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Optimizing the choice of immunosuppressive agents

Current guidelinesrely heavily on the use of steroids for management of irAEs. The duration of steroid use and cumulative dose are usually much greater for management of irAEs compared with other clinical indications for corticosteroid use. However, long-term use of steroids gives rise to several concerns.

Though the recommendation is to continue steroids until resolution of an irAE to grade 1 or better and subsequently taper the dose over a period of 4–6 weeks, efficacy of long-term steroid use in management of irAEs has not been validated. In contrast, when oral methylprednisolone was used as a 5-day tapered dose pack (steroid burst) for mild irAEs, all patients had recurrent grade 2 irAEs. Thus, the optimal dose and duration of steroid use with minimal risk of side effects in the management of irAEs are unknown.
Long-term steroid use may be associated with other complications, such as gastritis, hypertension, new-onset hyperglycemia, and opportunistic infections (eg, pneumocystis pneumonia).

Naltrexone HCl/bupropion HCl extended release — indications, dosing, and interactions are as follows. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist and bupropion is an aminoketone antidepressant with relatively weak inhibition of neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, and the Drug Enforcement Agency Schedule is not a scheduled drug. Tablets = 8 mg/90 mg (naltrexone HCl/bupropion HCl extended release), and the tablets should not be cut, chewed, or crushed. Dosing is: Week 1 = 1 tablet in AM, no tablets in PM; Week 2 = 1 tablet in AM, 1 tablet in PM; Week 3 = 2 tablets in AM, 1 tablet in PM; Week 4 and beyond = 2 tablets in AM, 2 tablets in PM (~12 hours after AM dose). Potential drug interactions state it should not be administered with opioids due to the naltrexone component, with all opioids discontinued at least 7 days prior to start of naltrexone HCl/bupropion HCl, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors may increase the risk of hypertensive reactions when used concomitantly.

### Bupropion toxicokinetic: a case report [^1126UbYt]. Clinical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Context

The toxicokinetics of sustained-release bupropion are not well described.

Case

A 23-year-old Caucasian male took an overdose of 5,700 mg of sustained release bupropion with no co-ingestant. Venous serum samples were assayed for bupropion concentrations over the next 5 days. The peak concentration was 1.114 mg/L. The observed T(max) was found to be 8.25 h, the calculated alpha half-life 10.9 h (± SE of 4.47%), and the calculated beta half-life 19.8 h (± SE 12.62%). The alpha half-life and T(max) differ significantly from those seen in therapeutic doses.

Discussion

Bezoar formation may underlie these differences. Interventions which reduce the absorption of sustained release bupropion may be effective in overdose.

7.5 Use with Alcohol

In postmarketing experience, there have been rare reports of adverse neuropsychiatric events or reduced alcohol tolerance in patients who were drinking alcohol during treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL). The consumption of alcohol during treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) should be minimized or avoided.

7.6 MAO Inhibitors

Bupropion inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. Concomitant use of MAOIs and bupropion is contraindicated because there is an increased risk of hypertensive reactions if bupropion is used concomitantly with MAOIs. Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAO inhibitor phenelzine. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat depression and initiation of treatment with bupropion hydrochloride. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping bupropion hydrochloride before starting an MAOI antidepressant [see Dosage and Administration (2.8, 2.9), Contraindications (4)].

7.7 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions

False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for amphetamines have been reported in patients taking bupropion. This is due to lack of specificity of some screening tests. False-positive test results may result even following discontinuation of bupropion therapy. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish bupropion from amphetamines.

### Oliceridine: a novel drug for the management of moderate to severe acute pain – A review of current evidence [^1144d145]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

There are no clinically significant drug interactions specific to Oliceridine. Like other opioids, care must be taken with concomitant administration of Oliceridine with other central nervous system depressants such as sedatives, alcohol, and hypnotics as this may result in exaggerated respiratory depression and sedation.

Inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 significantly impairs the metabolism of Oliceridine. Concomitant administration of CYP2D6 inhibitors such as paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine, and bupropion may increase or prolong opioid effects, similar to poor CYP2D6 metabolisers. Likewise, concurrent use of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as macrolide antibiotics (eg, erythromycin), triazole antifungals (eg, ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (eg, ritonavir) may increase or prolong therapeutic and adverse effects. Less frequent dosing may be required in these individuals. Conversely, drugs that induce CYP3A4 like carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, and glucocorticoids may reduce the plasma concentration and therapeutic efficacy of Oliceridine.

Serotonin syndrome may ensue if Oliceridine is used concurrently with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO-I), 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, and tramadol. Like other opioids, Oliceridine may reduce the efficacy of diuretics through the release of antidiuretic hormone, or increase the risk of urinary retention and constipation if used together with anticholinergic drugs.

### Bupropion for treatment of interferon-induced depression [^115TUdtw]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the effect of bupropion in a patient with interferon (IFN)-induced depression and review the use of antidepressants for treatment of depressive symptoms associated with IFN therapy.

Case Summary

A 43-year-old white woman with chronic hepatitis C and severe IFN-induced depression was treated with sustained-release bupropion initiated at 150 mg/day for 7 days and 100 mg twice daily thereafter. The dosage was increased again, to 350 mg/day when depressive symptoms recurred. While receiving that dose and continuing IFN treatment, she reported significant improvement in her depressive symptoms without experiencing any adverse effects.

Discussion

There is limited evidence suggesting that IFNs decrease central serotonergic transmission. There are several published reports on the use of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of IFN-induced depression. However, controlled studies are needed to assess the efficacy of serotonergic and noradrenergic antidepressants in IFN-treated patients with depressive symptoms.

Conclusions

Sustained-release bupropion might be of potential benefit in patients with interferon-induced depression.

### Bupropion hydrochloride — Bupropion hydrochloride — sr [^111mzSFc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Usual Dosage

Treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) should be initiated before the patient's planned quit day, while the patient is still smoking, because it takes approximately 1 week of treatment to achieve steady-state blood levels of bupropion. The patient should set a "target quit date" within the first 2 weeks of treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR).

Dosing

To minimize the risk of seizure:

Begin dosing with one 150-mg tablet per day for 3 days.
Increase dose to 300 mg per day given as one 150-mg tablet twice each day with an interval of at least 8 hours between each dose.
Do not exceed 300 mg per day.

Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) should be swallowed whole and not crushed, divided, or chewed, as this may lead to an increased risk of adverse effects including seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) may be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2 Duration of Treatment

Treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) should be continued for 7 to 12 weeks. If the patient has not quit smoking after 7 to 12 weeks, it is unlikely that he or she will quit during that attempt so treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) should probably be discontinued and the treatment plan reassessed. The goal of therapy with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) is complete abstinence.

Discuss discontinuing treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) after 12 weeks if the patient feels ready but consider whether the patient may benefit from ongoing treatment. Patients who successfully quit after 12 weeks of treatment but do not feel ready to discontinue treatment should be considered for ongoing therapy with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR); longer treatment should be guided by the relative benefits and risks for individual patients.

It is important that patients continue to receive counseling and support throughout treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) and for a period of time thereafter.

2.1 General Instructions for Use

To minimize the risk of seizure, increase the dose gradually [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) should be swallowed whole and not crushed, divided, or chewed.

Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) should be administered in the morning and may be taken with or without food.

2.2 Dosage for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)

The recommended starting dose for MDD is 150 mg once daily in the morning. After 4 days of dosing, the dose may be increased to the target dose of 300 mg once daily in the morning.

It is generally agreed that acute episodes of depression require several months or longer of antidepressant treatment beyond the response in the acute episode. It is unknown whether the bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) dose needed for maintenance treatment is identical to the dose that provided an initial response. Periodically reassess the need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dose for such treatment.

2.3 Dosage for Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)

The recommended starting dose for SAD is 150 mg once daily. After 7 days of dosing, the dose may be increased to the target dose of 300 mg once daily in the morning. Doses above 300 mg of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release were not assessed in the SAD trials.

For the prevention of seasonal MDD episodes associated with SAD, initiate bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) in the autumn, prior to the onset of depressive symptoms. Continue treatment through the winter season. Taper and discontinue bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) in early spring. For patients treated with 300 mg per day, decrease the dose to 150 mg once daily before discontinuing bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL). Individualize the timing of initiation, and duration of treatment should be individualized, based on the patient's historical pattern of seasonal MDD episodes.

2.4 Switching Patients from WELLBUTRIN® Tablets (bupropion hydrochloride tablets) or from WELLBUTRIN® SR (bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR))

When switching patients from WELLBUTRIN®Tablets (bupropion hydrochloride tablets) to bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) or from WELLBUTRIN®SR (bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR)) to bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL), give the same total daily dose when possible.

Drug Interactions: Few systemic data have been collected on the metabolism of bupropion following concomitant administration with other drugs or, alternatively, the effect of concomitant administration of bupropion on the metabolism of other drugs.

Because bupropion is extensively metabolized, the coadministration of other drugs may affect its clinical activity. In vitro studies indicate that bupropion is primarily metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 isoenzyme. Therefore, the potential exists for a drug interaction between WELLBUTRIN XL and drugs that are substrates of or inhibitors /inducers of the CYP2B6 isoenzyme (e.g., orphenadrine, thiotepa, cyclophosphamide, ticlopidine, and clopidogrel). In addition, in vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, and fluvoxamine as well as nelfinavir and efavirenz inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion. No clinical studies have been performed to evaluate this finding. The threohydrobupropion metabolite of bupropion does not appear to be produced by the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The effects of concomitant administration of cimetidine on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its active metabolites were studied in 24 healthy young male volunteers. Following oral administration of two 150-mg tablets of the sustained-release formulation of bupropion with and without 800 mg of cimetidine, the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and hydroxybupropion were unaffected. However, there were 16% and 32% increases in the AUC and Cmax, respectively, of the combined moieties of threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion.

### A comprehensive CYP2D6 drug-drug-gene interaction network for application in precision dosing and drug development [^117QsCPt]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Most models within the network were utilized without modifications to their original configurations. However, PBPK models for atomoxetine, bupropion, cimetidine, and fluvoxamine were extended to include additional interaction parameters that mechanistically describe DDIs mediated by these drugs. All interaction parameters implemented in the respective models were sourced from the published literature. For instance, the bupropion model was modified to reflect its unique interaction mechanism, a mix of competitive inhibition and down‐regulation of CYP2D6 caused by bupropion and its metabolites hydroxybupropion, erythrohydrobupropion, and threohydrobupropion as described by Sager et al. These model extensions were necessary to accurately capture the interactions between bupropion and the CYP2D6 victim drugs atomoxetine and desipramine. In the case of metoprolol, the model was refined to include a CYP3A4‐mediated clearance pathway, replacing a previously implemented non‐specific pathway. This adjustment aligns with in vitro evidence suggesting that metoprolol's metabolism is partially mediated by CYP3A4. Although CYP2D6 is generally considered non‐inducible by prototypical CYP inducers, such as carbamazepine and rifampicin, Bennett et al. have reported an increase of metoprolol AUC after rifampicin co‐administration by ~30% indicating additional non‐CYP2D6‐mediated metabolism.

2.1 General Instructions for Use

To minimize the risk of seizure, increase the dose gradually [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) should be swallowed whole and not crushed, divided, or chewed.

Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) should be administered in the morning and may be taken with or without food.

2.2 Dosage for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)

The recommended starting dose for MDD is 150 mg once daily in the morning. After 4 days of dosing, the dose may be increased to the target dose of 300 mg once daily in the morning.

It is generally agreed that acute episodes of depression require several months or longer of antidepressant treatment beyond the response in the acute episode. It is unknown whether the bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) dose needed for maintenance treatment is identical to the dose that provided an initial response. Periodically reassess the need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dose for such treatment.

2.3 Dosage for Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)

The recommended starting dose for SAD is 150 mg once daily. After 7 days of dosing, the dose may be increased to the target dose of 300 mg once daily in the morning. Doses above 300 mg of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) were not assessed in the SAD trials.

For the prevention of seasonal MDD episodes associated with SAD, initiate bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) in the autumn, prior to the onset of depressive symptoms. Continue treatment through the winter season. Taper and discontinue bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) in early spring. For patients treated with 300 mg per day, decrease the dose to 150 mg once daily before discontinuing bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL). Individualize the timing of initiation, and duration of treatment should be individualized, based on the patient's historical pattern of seasonal MDD episodes.

2.4 Switching Patients from Bupropion Hydrochloride Tablets or from Bupropion Hydrochloride Sustained-Release Tablets

When switching patients from bupropion hydrochloride tablets to bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) or from bupropion hydrochloride sustained-release tablets to bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL), give the same total daily dose when possible.

### Effect of bupropion on nocturnal urinary free cortisol and its association with antidepressant response [^115TdLJ9]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2005). Low credibility.

The study examined the relationship between pre-treatment nocturnal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity, as reflected by nocturnal urinary free cortisol (NUFC) response to a single-dose of sustained-release bupropion, and the antidepressant effect of the drug. NUFC changes in response to treatment with bupropion also were assessed. NUFC was measured in 20 patients with unipolar major depressive disorder before and after initiating treatment with sustained-release bupropion. Prior to treatment, subjects were studied on two separate sessions, one week apart. On the morning of each session, the participants received bupropion (150 mg, PO) or placebo using a randomized, double-blind procedure. Following the second session, subjects then received open-label treatment with bupropion for 8 weeks. NUFC sampling was repeated at the end of treatment. There was a significant interaction between NUFC concentration in response to single-dose bupropion and its antidepressant effect. Treatment non-responders showed a significant increase in NUFC in response to a single-dose of bupropion, whereas responders showed no such change. In addition, the NUFC response to bupropion challenge correlated significantly with the change in depression ratings as a result of treatment. In contrast to many other antidepressants, treatment with bupropion for 8 weeks did not reduce HPA activity in either responders or non-responders. These findings suggest that the NUFC response to a test-dose of bupropion might be helpful in predicting its antidepressant effect. One possible mechanism for the association between the NUFC response to acute bupropion challenge and antidepressant efficacy might be linked through dopaminergic and/or noradrenergic mechanisms.
