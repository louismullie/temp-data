## Question

In which patients would you consider applying PROPHY-VAP's findings, and what magnitude of benefit should the ICU team expect?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which patients should receive prophylactic ceftriaxone per PROPHY-VAP and what magnitude of benefit to expect. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact inclusion and exclusion criteria from the trial to define the target population. Then, I should verify the primary and key secondary outcomes and their effect sizes. Next, I will consider external validity and whether results generalize to similar patients. After that, I need to weigh benefits against potential harms, including resistance and misclassification of VAP. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation and note any uncertainties that warrant caution or further study [^e312e7cb] [^80a9f398].

> Let me first confirm the trial population and intervention details so I don't overgeneralize. PROPHY-VAP enrolled comatose adults with acute brain injury who required mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours, with GCS 12 or less, and gave a single 2 g IV ceftriaxone dose within 12 hours of intubation versus placebo; patients with ongoing antibiotics, recent hospitalization, nasal intubation, subglottic secretion drainage, or high early mortality risk were excluded, and the trial did not include selective digestive decontamination, which is important for external validity [^e312e7cb] [^80a9f398].

> I should double-check the primary outcome and its magnitude. Early VAP, defined as VAP occurring between days 2 and 7 of mechanical ventilation, occurred in 14% with ceftriaxone versus 32% with placebo, yielding a hazard ratio of 0.60 with 95% CI 0.38–0.95 and p = 0.030; this corresponds to an absolute risk reduction of 18% and a number needed to treat of about 5.6, which is clinically meaningful if replicated [^e312e7cb] [^80a9f398].

> Next, I should review secondary outcomes to ensure the benefit extends beyond a diagnostic label. Wait, let me verify the mortality signal. The trial reported 28-day mortality of 15% with ceftriaxone versus 25% with placebo, HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39–0.97, which is a 10% absolute mortality reduction; ventilator-free days were also higher by a median of 4 days, and there was no excess of adverse events attributable to ceftriaxone, which strengthens the case for patient-centered benefit if confirmed [^e312e7cb] [^80a9f398].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about generalizability. I need to check whether the results apply to patients outside the strict inclusion criteria. The trial was conducted in French university ICUs with low background resistance and excluded those with ongoing antibiotics, recent hospitalization, nasal intubation, and subglottic secretion drainage; thus, benefits may not translate to settings with high ESBL prevalence, patients already on antibiotics, or those with early tracheostomy or subglottic drainage, and the single-dose strategy differs from SDD regimens that include parenteral components and have shown mortality benefits in low-resistance settings [^e312e7cb] [^c030a102] [^fdcfb844].

> I will now examine potential harms and stewardship concerns. The trial reported no significant difference in adverse or serious adverse events and no signal for increased resistance on surveillance cultures, but the study was not powered for resistance endpoints and used culture-based VAP definitions that could be influenced by early antibiotics; moreover, a single dose is a minimal exposure, yet indiscriminate use could still select for resistance, so I should confirm that use remains restricted to the exact target population and setting [^e312e7cb] [^64e7edb8].

> Let me think about how this fits with existing prevention frameworks. Current VAP prevention guidance prioritizes essential practices like head-of-bed elevation, oral care, minimizing sedation, and early liberation; additional approaches such as subglottic secretion drainage and early tracheostomy can be considered in selected patients, but routine systemic antibiotic prophylaxis is not broadly endorsed, so PROPHY-VAP's single-dose ceftriaxone should be viewed as a niche, evidence-based exception for a specific high-risk subgroup rather than a universal bundle component [^e3dd4e0d] [^5079f716] [^83032c09].

> But wait, what if the observed mortality benefit is a chance finding given the sample size and multiple outcomes. I should acknowledge that the mortality result, while intriguing, is a secondary outcome and the trial was powered for early VAP; replication and meta-analytic confirmation would strengthen confidence, and until then, teams should balance the strong VAP reduction against the uncertainty in mortality and resistance impact in their local context [^e312e7cb] [^80a9f398].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the practical recommendation. Apply PROPHY-VAP's findings to comatose adults with acute brain injury who are expected to be mechanically ventilated for at least 48 hours, have GCS 12 or less, and do not have ongoing antibiotics, recent hospitalization, nasal intubation, or subglottic secretion drainage; give a single 2 g IV ceftriaxone dose within 12 hours of intubation, and expect an approximately 18% absolute reduction in early VAP and a 10% absolute reduction in 28-day mortality, with about 4 more ventilator-free days, recognizing that resistance data are reassuring but limited and that stewardship oversight is essential [^e312e7cb] [^80a9f398].

> Finally, I should double-check exclusions and local considerations before implementing. Avoid use in patients with ongoing systemic antibiotics, those with high early mortality risk, or settings with high ESBL prevalence where a single-dose cephalosporin may be ineffective or risky; monitor local VAP rates and resistance patterns if adopted, and consider this strategy as an adjunct to, not a replacement for, core VAP prevention bundles and early liberation practices [^e312e7cb] [^e3dd4e0d] [^c030a102].

Apply PROPHY-VAP's findings to **comatose adults with acute brain injury** [^e312e7cb] who are expected to need **mechanical ventilation for ≥ 48 hours** [^80a9f398], giving a **single 2 g IV ceftriaxone dose within 12 hours of intubation** [^e312e7cb]. This reduces early VAP by 18% (14% vs 32%; HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38–0.95) [^e312e7cb] and 28-day mortality by 10% (15% vs 25%; HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39–0.97) [^80a9f398], with more ventilator-free days (median 9 vs 5) and no excess adverse events or resistance [^e312e7cb]. Do not use in patients with ongoing antibiotics, recent hospitalization, or high resistance settings, and monitor for resistance if adopted [^c030a102].

---

## Patient population for application

The PROPHY-VAP trial enrolled **comatose adults (GCS ≤ 12)** [^e312e7cb] with acute brain injury (trauma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or stroke) who required mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours [^80a9f398]. Key exclusions included coma from tumor, infection, or cardiac arrest; high early mortality risk; ongoing antibiotics; recent hospitalization; nasal intubation; or subglottic secretion drainage [^e312e7cb]. Thus, the intervention is best suited to **comatose adults with acute brain injury** who are expected to be ventilated for ≥ 48 hours, without recent antibiotic exposure or high resistance risk [^e312e7cb].

---

## Magnitude of benefit

The PROPHY-VAP trial demonstrated **significant clinical benefits**:

| **Outcome** | **Ceftriaxone group** | **Placebo group** | **Effect size** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Early VAP (days 2–7) | 14% | 32% | HR 0.60 (95% CI 0.38–0.95) [^e312e7cb] |
| 28-day mortality | 15% | 25% | HR 0.62 (95% CI 0.39–0.97) [^80a9f398] |
| Ventilator-free days (median) | 9 days | 5 days | Absolute difference 4 days (95% CI 0.55–7.45) [^e312e7cb] |
| Antibiotic-free days (median) | 20 days | 16 days | Absolute difference 4 days (95% CI 0.55–7.45) [^e312e7cb] |

---

These benefits were achieved with **no significant increase in adverse events or resistance** in surveillance cultures [^e312e7cb] [^0435fac0].

---

## Clinical implications and considerations

- **Timing**: Administer ceftriaxone within 12 hours of intubation to maximize benefit [^e312e7cb].
- **Resistance**: No significant resistance signal was observed, but ongoing surveillance is prudent, especially in high-resistance settings [^e312e7cb] [^0435fac0].
- **Guideline alignment**: Current guidelines do not universally recommend routine antibiotic prophylaxis for VAP; this strategy is specific to acute brain injury patients and should be contextualized within local epidemiology and stewardship practices [^c030a102].

---

## Limitations and cautions

- **Generalizability**: Benefits are specific to comatose adults with acute brain injury; extrapolation to other ICU populations is not supported [^e312e7cb].
- **Resistance risk**: Although not observed, theoretical resistance risk remains; use should be restricted to the defined population and setting [^e312e7cb] [^64e7edb8].
- **Not a substitute**: This does not replace standard VAP prevention bundles (e.g. head-of-bed elevation, oral care, subglottic drainage) [^e3dd4e0d] [^5079f716].

---

## Practical application in the ICU

- **Identify eligible patients**: Comatose adults with acute brain injury expected to need ≥ 48 hours of ventilation, without recent antibiotics or high resistance risk [^e312e7cb].
- **Administer intervention**: Single 2 g IV ceftriaxone within 12 hours of intubation [^e312e7cb].
- **Monitor outcomes**: Track VAP rates, mortality, ventilator days, and resistance patterns to ensure continued benefit and safety [^eae4fa90].

---

PROPHY-VAP supports a **single early dose of ceftriaxone** for comatose adults with acute brain injury who are expected to be ventilated for ≥ 48 hours, reducing early VAP and mortality without excess adverse events. Use should be **restricted to this population**, with stewardship oversight and ongoing resistance monitoring [^e312e7cb] [^0435fac0].

The study PROPHY-VAP was published by Claire Dahyot-Fizelier and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Lancet Respir Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Traumatic brain injury and Ventilator-associated pneumonia. In the PROPHY-VAP study, the trial question was: what is the role of prophylactic ceftriaxone in comatose patients with acute brain injury? In the PROPHY-VAP study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PROPHY-VAP study, the population was: 319 patients (153 female, 166 male). The inclusion criteria were comatose adult patients who required mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours after acute brain injury. The key exclusion criteria were coma due to a tumor, an infectious disease, or cardiac arrest; high risk of death within the first 48 hours after admission; ongoing antibiotic treatment; previous hospitalization within the past month; antibiotic prophylaxis expected within the first 24 hours after randomization; tracheal intubation by nasal route; subglottic secretion drainage; mechanical ventilation on tracheostomy. In the PROPHY-VAP study, the interventions were: n = 162 ceftriaxone (an intravenous dose of 2 g once within 12 hours following tracheal intubation) n = 157 placebo (matching placebo IV once within 12 hours following tracheal intubation). In the PROPHY-VAP study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in early ventilator-associated pneumonia (14% vs. 32%; HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.95). In the PROPHY-VAP study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant decrease in all ventilator-associated pneumonia at day 28 (20% vs. 36%; HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.98) Significant increase in ventilator-free days (9 days vs. 5 days; AD 4 days, 95% CI 0.55 to 7.45) Significant decrease in death (15% vs. 25%; HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.97). In the PROPHY-VAP study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. In the PROPHY-VAP study, the conclusion was: in comatose adult patients who required mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours after acute brain injury, ceftriaxone was superior to placebo with respect to early ventilator-associated pneumonia.

NEW APPROACHES FOR ANTIMICROBIAL PROPHYLAXIS

Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was the subject of 2 important prophylaxis studies published in recent years. The AMIKINHAL RCT randomized 850 patients in French intensive care units (ICUs) after ≥ 72 hours of ventilation to receive either daily inhaled amikacin or normal saline for 3 days. The primary outcome was the development of VAP, as determined by a blinded committee using composite criteria including a requirement of microbiology data, in the first 28 days after randomization. Although the study showed a significant reduction in the rates of VAP, there was no reduction in antibiotic rates, length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, or mortality. This raises the possibility that inhaled amikacin might have been reducing the rates of VAP diagnosis in the study by sterilizing respiratory bacterial cultures without improving other important clinical outcomes.

Another RCT looking at the prevention of VAP, PROPHY-VAP, was published in 2024 and involved randomizing patients with acute brain injury within 48 hours of admission and within 12 hours of intubation to receive either a single dose of intravenous ceftriaxone or saline. This study included 345 patients and was also conducted in French ICUs. It found not only a significant reduction in the primary outcome of the development of VAP between days 2 and 7 of intubation but also a significant improvement in other key clinical outcomes, including numbers of ventilator-free, antibiotic-free, and ICU- and hospital-free days and 28-day survival. Importantly, neither AMIKINHAL nor PROPHY-VAP showed a significant increase in the development of resistant organisms in either respiratory or rectal swab surveillance cultures.

Prosthetic Joint Infections

Prosthetic joint infections are another infection associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Current guidelines recommend a cephalosporin for surgical prophylaxis at the time of arthroplasty; however, this would not prevent infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, among the most common causes of infections associated with implanted devices. Thus, there has been interest in the potential benefit of adding empiric vancomycin for surgical prophylaxis. In an RCT conducted among patients without a history of MRSA, whose results were published in late 2023, the addition of vancomycin to cefazolin for surgical prophylaxis in arthroplasty did not reduce the risk of surgical site infections at 90 days. Vancomycin may still have some utility in patients at higher risk for MRSA, as the rate of MRSA carriage in this study was < 1%. However, the results from this study suggest that it is not beneficial to broadly administer vancomycin for prophylaxis.

### Ceftriaxone to prevent early ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients with acute brain injury: a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, assessor-masked superiority trial [^e312e7cb]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Background

Patients with acute brain injury are at high risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The benefit of short-term antibiotic prophylaxis remains debated. We aimed to establish the effect of an early, single dose of the antibiotic ceftriaxone on the incidence of early VAP in patients with severe brain injury who required mechanical ventilation.

Methods

PROPHY-VAP was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, assessor-masked, superiority trial conducted in nine intensive care units in eight French university hospitals. We randomly assigned comatose (Glasgow Coma Scale score [GCS] ≤ 12) adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) who required mechanical ventilation for at least 48 h after acute brain injury to receive intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g or placebo once within the 12 h following tracheal intubation. Participants did not receive selective oropharyngeal and digestive tract decontamination. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients developing early VAP from the 2nd to the 7th day of mechanical ventilation, confirmed by masked assessors. The analysis was reported in the modified intention-to-treat population, which comprised all randomly assigned patients except those who withdrew or did not give consent to continue and those who did not receive the allocated treatment because they met a criterion for non-eligibility. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02265406.

Findings

From Oct 14, 2015, to May 27, 2020, 345 patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ceftriaxone (n = 171) or placebo (n = 174); 330 received the allocated intervention and 319 were included in the analysis (162 in the ceftriaxone group and 157 in the placebo group). 166 (52%) participants in the analysis were men and 153 (48%) were women. 15 patients did not receive the allocated intervention after randomisation and 11 withdrew their consent. Adjudication confirmed 93 cases of VAP, including 74 early infections. The incidence of early VAP was lower in the ceftriaxone group than in the placebo group (23 [14%] vs 51 [32%]; hazard ratio 0.60 [95% CI 0.38–0.95], p = 0.030), with no microbiological impact and no adverse effects attributable to ceftriaxone.

Interpretation

In patients with acute brain injury, a single ceftriaxone dose decreased the risk of early VAP. On the basis of our findings, we recommend that an early, single dose of ceftriaxone be included in all bundles for the prevention of VAP in patients with brain injury who require mechanical ventilation.

Procalcitonin (PCT) plus clinical criteria for HAP/VAP antibiotic discontinuation — we suggest using PCT levels plus clinical criteria rather than clinical criteria alone to guide discontinuation (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), noting it is not known if benefits apply where standard VAP therapy is already 7 days or less. Evidence from a systematic review found 14 trials with 4221 patients showing decreased antibiotic exposure (adjusted mean difference, −3.47 days; 95% CI, −3.78 to −3.17 days) without increased mortality or treatment failure. Trials specifically in VAP (2 published and 1 abstract) pooled 308 patients and showed shorter antibiotic duration with PCT plus clinical criteria (9.1 days vs 12.1 days; P < .00001) with no difference in mortality and no effects on mechanical ventilation duration, ICU or hospital length of stay, recurrent pneumonia, or resistance. The panel had low confidence due to risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision (I2 = 21%), and noted usual short-course therapy is about 7–8 days; the evidence is predominantly from VAP, so recommendations for HAP are mostly based on VAP studies.

IDSA/ATS HAP/VAP empiric threshold setting — example based on Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) prevalence is as follows: To minimize inappropriate broad-spectrum coverage, the panel considered the number needed to treat; if the average prevalence of S. aureus in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is approximately 25%, then a methicillin resistance rate of 10%–20% implies that only 2.5%–5% of VAPs will be due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), so most patients will not benefit from MRSA coverage, although higher MRSA prevalence increases benefit; the panel notes that individual units can adjust thresholds and calls for further research on optimal cutoffs.

Hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP) monotherapy versus combination therapy — systematic and trial evidence: Most randomized evidence found "no differences between monotherapy and combination therapy for mortality, treatment failure, ICU and hospital length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and acquisition of resistance", although "Two trials, however, demonstrated superior outcomes among those who received carbapenem monotherapy compared with those who received combination therapy". The panel had low confidence in applicability due to bias and indirectness ("The panel's confidence that these estimates apply to the clinical question was low because there was the risk of bias… and because the trials enrolled patients with HAP/VAP due to any pathogen"), noting that "only 6%–23% of the population in the trials had HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa".

### Optimal antibiotic use in the intensive care unit [^64e7edb8]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The use of antibiotics to prevent infection has been investigated in patients with acute brain injury. The PROPHY-VAP trial investigated the use of a single dose of intravenous ceftriaxone in adult patients undergoing mechanical ventilation with a GCS of ≤ 12. The etiologies for brain injury in this trial were brain trauma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and hemorrhagic or ischemic strokes. Incidence of VAP was 14% in the ceftriaxone group compared to 32% in the control group, which was associated with a statistically significant hazard Ratio of 0.60. Like the inhaled antibiotic trials, the definition of VAP in this study necessitated a positive culture, and thus the use of ceftriaxone may have influenced the ability to grow bacteria on culture and may underestimate true rates of VAP. This study did show improvements in ICU-free days, hospital free days, and there was a trend towards improvement in mortality. Clinicians should balance the potential benefits of prophylactic antibiotic use in the ICU versus potential adverse effects including resistance emergence.

Recent studies also suggest that prophylactic antibiotics used in the ICU were inappropriate up to 50% of the time and this was more likely to occur in surgical ICUs, mixed surgical ICUs, mixed medical ICUs, and mixed cardiac ICUs. Moreover, inappropriate prophylactic antibiotics were often used more than two-fold longer in duration than nonprophylactic regimens. The use of such inappropriate prophylactic antibiotic regimens may represent an important area for stewardship interventions in the ICU.

Discussion

Main findings

In this systematic review comprising 27 published RCTs addressing the efficacy of antimicrobials for treatment of HAP/VAP in critically ill patients, we found that the enrolled populations, clinical trial design, and endpoints assessed vary greatly between studies. This variability is intuitive but its quantification is of importance because, as shown by the variable mortality and clinical cure rates that were reported, it impacted the results of RCTs. This heterogeneity may therefore influence the ability of studies to demonstrate differences between investigational drugs and comparators. These results are not surprising as far as there are even differences in the guidance from regulatory agencies on how to evaluate treatments for HAP/VAP, especially with regards to the study design, population and endpoint.

### Review of recent clinical trials of hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia: a perspective from academia [^912249f0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical trials evaluating antimicrobial therapy for nosocomial pneumonia face many hurdles in terms of producing data that are widely applicable, supportive of safe medical practices, and able to demonstrate distinct advantages of one form of therapy over the other. Adherence to strict performance measures in conducting such trials should improve their overall quality. Such measures include enrollment of clearly defined patient populations who have a high likelihood of nosocomial pneumonia, use of diagnostic measures to confirm the presence of lower respiratory tract infection, and inclusion of broad-based pathogen distributions to ensure that the trial is applicable to the majority of patients developing nosocomial pneumonia.

### Strategies to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-associated events, and nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^83032c09]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Early tracheostomy — potential benefits and limits: Consider early tracheostomy (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE). A meta-analysis of 17 randomized trials suggests that early tracheostomy (within 7 days of intubation) may be associated with a 40% decrease in VAP rates, less time on mechanical ventilation, and fewer ICU days but no difference in mortality. Decision makers should integrate these potential benefits with each patient's values and preferences when determining whether and when to proceed with tracheostomy.

---

### Other therapeutic modalities and practices: implications for clinical trials of hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia [^114ed515]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Direct delivery of antimicrobial agents to the site of infection via aerosolization may represent a valid option in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Although promising and supported by the results of several recent investigations, antibiotic aerosolization to treat VAP has not yet entered the armamentarium for daily practice. Its potential efficacy should be first evaluated as an adjunctive therapy in a superiority trial in which all participants receive a standard-of-care intravenous regimen and then are randomized to receive additional antibiotics by aerosol or a placebo (eg, combination therapy trials). Inclusion criteria should specifically target patients with microbiologically proven VAP caused by potentially multidrug-resistant strains, because a clear benefit of aerosolized antibiotics is awaited in only this subpopulation. Until results of these trials are known, antibiotic aerosolization can be recommended only for treating patients with multidrug-resistant VAP, for which no effective intravenous regimen is available.

Combination versus monotherapy for empiric gram-negative VAP coverage — across randomized studies of one vs 2 antipseudomonal agents, 7 eligible trials were identified and there were no differences in mortality, clinical response, adverse effects, or acquired resistance between monotherapy and combination arms; many studies allowed adjunctive empiric Pseudomonas coverage until pathogens were identified, limiting applicability to unselected suspected VAP.

HAP/VAP antibiotic discontinuation using procalcitonin (PCT) — For patients with HAP/VAP, we suggest using PCT levels plus clinical criteria to guide the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy, rather than clinical criteria alone (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Remarks add that it is not known if the benefits of using PCT exist where standard antimicrobial therapy for VAP is already 7 days or less.

### Do we need new trials of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy? [^4b6eae3f]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Are control groups receiving the best care?

A major concern in PCT-guided trials is antibiotic use in the control group. According to the World Medical Association's Helsinki declaration, "the benefits, risks, burdens, and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the best current proven intervention", but defining "best current proven intervention" is difficult. Heterogeneity of current practices has been a major argument against using routine care without any constraints as the comparator. When we consider duration of antibiotic treatment and/or antibiotic exposure, the duration of therapy in control groups is systematically above those recommended by guidelines and the best available evidence base (e.g. standard of care for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) patients in the control group should be 6–8 days, not 13 days). Should any intervention compared to a "suboptimal" standard of care (even when it is usual care) be recommended/adopted in clinical practice?

For instance, usual care is sometimes far from the best available care or what should be standard of care. Trials using a protocolized rather than an unrestricted standard care control group will likely have enhanced validity as long as the protocolized care control group is representative of standard care practices. In PCT studies, a protocolized group with clear stop rules for antibiotic duration, making it more compatible with best available evidence and recommendations, would be important and could lead to better evaluation of biomarker-based antimicrobial treatment.

Conclusion

Altogether, this review provides a description of populations and endpoints of RCTs evaluating antimicrobials for treatment of HAP/VAP in the ICU. Our results show significant heterogeneity in the enrollment criteria, endpoints and statistical design that may influence the ability of studies to demonstrate differences between the drugs studied. Although the methodological quality of studies seems to improve over time, some pitfalls remain. In particular, as demonstrated by the variability observed in currently unpublished RCTs testing new molecules, the regulatory agencies should agree on the best primary endpoint and the timing of its assessment. In this context, composite and/or hierarchical endpoints including both mortality and clinical cure may be of particular interest, and new methodologies helping assess the risks and benefits of new antimicrobial treatment strategies such as desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR) and response adjusted for duration of antibiotic risk (RADAR) may be used. Some other promising new tools such as hierarchical nested design (combining non-inferiority and nested superiority trials) or competing event analyses (considering the influence of timing of events on effect measures) have also been recently proposed to improve the design and the analysis of future trials. However, some basic concepts such as clinical cure remain to be better defined.

### Mortality, attributable mortality, and clinical events as end points for clinical trials of ventilator-associated pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia [^3ac5ae2f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Appropriate end points are crucial for the successful interpretation of clinical trials. Choosing end points for therapeutic trials of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) requires careful consideration, because they are complications of critical illness. It may be difficult to distinguish the consequences of VAP and HAP from manifestations of the underlying illnesses, and it is important to determine their incremental magnitude, to plan for possible treatment effects and, thus, sample size calculations. In this article, we discuss mortality, attributable mortality, and time to clinical events as possible end points for HAP and/or VAP trials. Because of the paucity of evidence on HAP, we focus predominantly on VAP. In a systematic review of applicable trials, VAP appears to have slight intensive care unit and low hospital-attributable mortality. VAP is associated with prolonged durations of intensive care unit stay, hospital stay, and mechanical ventilation. Because of these findings, superiority trials of VAP treatment that use mortality as a primary end point are not possible. Equivalency studies are possible, but there are sample size implications. The use of time to clinical event end points, especially when combined with mortality, may be the best option for trial in the future.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with invasive quantitative cultures below diagnostic thresholds — The evidence indicates that patients whose antibiotics are withheld on the basis of an invasive quantitative culture below the diagnostic threshold for VAP have similar clinical outcomes, less antibiotic use, and better microbiologic outcomes compared to those whose antibiotics are continued, but the panel's confidence in these effects was very low due to observational study design, imprecision, and high risk of bias. Antibiotic discontinuation in patients with suspected VAP whose invasive quantitative culture results are below the diagnostic threshold for VAP may be beneficial because it decreases unnecessary antibiotic use and improves microbiological outcomes; while there is no evidence that this approach worsens clinical outcomes, in theory it could result in withdrawal of antibiotics from some patients if quantitative culture results are misleadingly low due to sampling error or prior antibiotic exposure.

Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) scope decision — panel rationale and conclusion: The panel notes that patients with HCAP were thought to be at high risk for multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms due to healthcare contact, but reports that the rationales for including HCAP with the hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) recommendations have come into question, with increasing evidence that many HCAP patients are not at high risk for MDR pathogens and that underlying patient characteristics are also important independent determinants of risk. Consequently, the panel unanimously decided that HCAP should not be included in the HAP/VAP guidelines, anticipating that recommendations for community-dwelling patients would likely be based on validated risk factors for MDR pathogens and not solely on previous healthcare contact.

Endpoints

The question of the best primary efficacy endpoint to use in HAP/VAP trials remains highly debatable. Proof of this is provided by the conflicting guidelines provided by the regulatory agencies, with the EMA recommending the clinical outcome at the TOC visit (ranging from 14 to 21 days after the end of therapy) and the FDA recommending all-cause mortality at day 28.

Our results show that the assessment of clinical response (clinical cure) by investigators was used in the vast majority of HAP/VAP RCTs. The main advantage of this criterion is its routine use by clinicians to assess patient response to an antimicrobial treatment. However, as demonstrated by the wide range of clinical cure rates showed in this review, the variable definitions of clinical cure that are used are problematic and may impact the reliability of this endpoint. These results suggest that a consensual definition of clinical cure is urgently needed. Such consensus should also homogenize the timing used to assess the primary endpoint, in order to limit its variability that may also account for variable clinical cure rates. In our review, whatever the endpoint used (i.e. clinical cure or mortality), there was wide variability in the time point used to assess it. Finally, the documentation of the magnitude of treatment effect on clinical cure should also be established. Indeed, a previous demonstration of the superiority of the comparator drug to a placebo or no therapy is necessary before conducting non-inferiority trials, and in HAP/VAP such benefit of effective antibacterial therapy has only been established for all-cause mortality and not for clinical cure.

### Risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia: from epidemiology to patient management [^d68147d5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Risk factors for the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as identified in epidemiological studies, have provided a basis for testable interventions in randomized trials. We describe how these results have influenced patient treatment. Single interventions in patients undergoing intubation have focused on either reducing aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions, modulation of colonization (in either the oropharynx, the stomach, or the whole digestive tract), use of systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis, or ventilator circuit changes. More recently, multiple simultaneously implemented interventions have been used. In general, routine measures to decrease oropharyngeal aspiration and antibiotic-containing prevention strategies appear to be the most effective, and the latter were associated with improved rates of patient survival in recent trials. These benefits must be balanced against the widespread fear of emergence of antibiotic resistance. In hospital settings with low baseline levels of antibiotic resistance, however, the benefits to patient outcome may outweigh this fear of resistance. In settings with high levels of antibiotic resistance, combined approaches of non-antibiotic using strategies and education programs might be most beneficial.

### Healthcare epidemiology: ventilator-associated pneumonia: preventing the inevitable [^f7cf0543]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Ventilator-associate pneumonia (VAP) is the most common nosocomial infection in patients in intensive care units (ICU). Because of its association with unwanted clinical outcomes, preventive measures have been studied intensively in the past 25 years. Unfortunately, a large amount of clinical trials yielded disappointingly few clear-cut answers. Furthermore, because of the difficulties in reliably diagnosing VAP, we should be very reluctant in embracing measures that have been associated with VAP reductions in small-sized studies, but with no benefits on patient outcome documented in sufficiently powered well-designed trials. Only topical antimicrobial prophylaxis (either alone in the oropharynx or in combination with intestinal decontamination) has been demonstrated to improve patient outcome resulting from prevention of VAP. However, this was demonstrated in not-so-average circumstances-in ICUs with extremely low levels of antibiotic resistance. Despite the obvious challenges with using antibiotics as preventive measures, careful evaluation of these strategies in settings with higher drug-resistance levels is now justified, and future studies should be designed to demonstrate outcome benefits rather than reductions in VAP rates.

Improvement in methodological quality over time

The methodological quality of studies improved over time. We specifically analyzed the six studies published after the EMA workshop on antimicrobials held in 2011, i.e. between 2012 and 2016. Among the six studies, four had a non-inferiority design (with anticipated statistical approach and non-inferiority margin), were double-blinded, and assessed clinical cure in one population as the single primary endpoint. Clinical criteria for diagnosis of HAP/VAP were more homogenous and at least two clinical signs were consistently required. Furthermore, all cases of pneumonia that were analyzed were microbiologically proven in four of the six trials. Finally, the only items that did not improve were the definition of clinical cure and the time points used to assess it. Calculation of the mean quality score confirmed this global improvement: the mean score of studies published after 2011 was higher than that of older studies (5.3 vs 3.9) (Table 2).

Features of currently unpublished RCTs reported on ClinicalTrials.gov. comparing antimicrobial treatment strategies in HAP/VAP

Thirteen currently unpublished RCTs that tested new antimicrobial treatment strategies in patients with HAP/VAP or with severe infections due to carbapenem-resistant bacteria including HAP/VAP are registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (Table 3). Interestingly, the primary endpoint remained highly variable: 28-day all-cause mortality in four studies (all comparing systemic molecules) and clinical cure (with a variable definition, and using variable timing of assessment) in nine studies (four of them comparing systemic molecules and five testing the efficacy of nebulized antimicrobials) and a favorable clinical response. Only five studies described which population was analyzed.

### Preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia: does the evidence support the practice? [^919da514]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is among the most common infections in patients requiring endotracheal tubes with mechanical ventilation. Ventilator-associated pneumonia is associated with increased hospital costs, a greater number of days in the intensive care unit, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, and higher mortality. Despite widely accepted recommendations for interventions designed to reduce rates of VAP, few studies have assessed the ability of these interventions to improve patient outcomes. As the understanding of VAP advances and new technologies to reduce VAP become available, studies should directly assess patient outcomes before the health care community implements specific prevention approaches in clinical practice.

### Individualised, short-course antibiotic treatment versus usual long-course treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (REGARD-VAP): a multicentre, individually randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^56291871]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The study REGARD-VAP was published by Yin Mo and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Lancet Respir Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Ventilator-associated pneumonia. In the REGARD-VAP study, the trial question was: is short-course antibiotic therapy noninferior to long-course antibiotic therapy in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia? In the REGARD-VAP study, the study design was: multi-center, single blinded, RCT. In the REGARD-VAP study, the population was: 460 patients (181 female, 279 male). The inclusion criteria were adults with ventilator-associated pneumonia who had been mechanically ventilated for ≥ 48 hours and were administered culture-directed antibiotics. The key exclusion criteria were poor likelihood of survival; immunocompromised state; other concurrent infections that required antibiotic treatment for > 7 days. In the REGARD-VAP study, the interventions were: n = 231 short-course antibiotics (antibiotic treatment duration ≤ 7 days) n = 229 long-course antibiotics (antibiotic treatment duration ≥ 8 days). In the REGARD-VAP study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in the rate of death or pneumonia recurrence within 60 days (41% vs. 44%; ARD 3, 95% CI -5 to Infinity). In the REGARD-VAP study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in duration of antibiotics during admission (20.5 days vs. 25.7 days; AD -5.2 days, 95% CI -8.1 to -2.4) No significant difference in mean duration of stay in hospital (35.1 days vs. 35 days; AD 0.22 days, 95% CI -4.2 to 4.6) No significant difference in mean duration of mechanical ventilation during admission (29.8 days vs. 30 days; AD -0.06 days, 95% CI -5.2 to 5.1). In the REGARD-VAP study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in allergy, diarrhea. significant differences in antibiotic side effects (8% vs. 38%), AKI (5% vs. 35%). In the REGARD-VAP study, the conclusion was: in adults with ventilator-associated pneumonia who had been mechanically ventilated for ≥ 48 hours and were administered culture-directed antibiotics, short-course antibiotics were noninferior to long-course antibiotics with respect to the rate of death or pneumonia recurrence within 60 days.

### The paradox of ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention measures [^35114918]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

There is a striking paradox in the literature supporting high-profile measures to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): many studies show significant reductions in VAP rates but almost none show any impact on patients' duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital, or mortality. The paradox is largely attributable to lack of specificity in the VAP definition. The clinical and microbiological criteria for VAP capture a population of patients with an array of conditions that range from serious to benign. Many of the benign events are manifestations of bacterial colonization superimposed upon pulmonary edema, atelectasis, or other non-infectious processes. VAP prevention measures that work by decreasing bacterial colonization preferentially lower the frequency of these mislabelled, more benign events. In addition, misclassification obscures detection of an impact of prevention measures on bona fide pneumonias. Together, these effects create the possibility of the paradox where a prevention measure may have a large impact on VAP rates but minimal impact on patients' outcomes. The paradox makes changes in VAP rates alone an unreliable measure of whether VAP prevention measures are truly beneficial to patients and behooves us to measure their impact on patient outcomes before advocating their adoption.

### Strategies to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-associated events, and nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^af971cd9]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Additional approaches for preventing VAP and/or ventilator-associated events (VAE) note that these are interventions associated with lower VAP rates that may also decrease VAE rates, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and/or mortality but carry some risk of harm; they also include interventions associated with lower VAE rates with insufficient data to determine impact on objective outcomes, and hospitals can consider adopting these approaches if VAP or VAE rates do not improve despite high performance with essential practices; some interventions may decrease duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and/or mortality in some populations but not in others and may confer some risk of harm in some populations.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^7e9d52bc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to gram-negative bacilli — adjunctive inhaled antibiotic therapy is selectively recommended and supported by limited outcomes data: When only the trials that evaluated clinical cure were pooled, the clinical cure rate similarly improved (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.11–1.47); one trial found that inhaled antibiotics reduced the frequency of requiring additional intravenous antibiotics, and two studies reported that inhaled colistin reduces the duration of mechanical ventilation. The panel elected to recommend adjunctive inhaled antibiotic therapy for patients who are most likely to benefit: specifically, those who have VAP caused by bacteria that are only susceptible to the classes of antibiotics of which evidence of efficacy by the intravenous route is the most limited (ie, aminoglycosides or colistin), and it is reasonable to consider adjunctive inhaled antibiotic therapy as a treatment of last resort for patients who are not responding to intravenous antibiotics alone, whether the infecting organism is or is not MDR. The rationale notes that antibiotic efficacy against bacteria within purulent secretions may require antibiotic concentrations > 10–25 times the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), that with high-dose intravenous colistin the concentration in the serum is approximately the MIC of Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas while concentrations in the lung and airway are lower and, therefore, subtherapeutic, and that the ongoing use of antibiotics at subtherapeutic levels may lead to the selection of antibiotic-resistant organisms.

The panel noted that studies "did not require specific criteria to define the patients as having septic shock" and that inclusion of less severely ill patients may dilute benefits, and stated "very low confidence" in applying these estimates to HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa because evidence was observational, inconsistent, and indirect.

### Cost-effectiveness of a short-course antibiotic treatment strategy for the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia: an economic analysis of the REGARD-VAP trial [^1ecb2028]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

When updating decisions on adoption of a new health intervention, systematic assessment of trade-offs between benefits, harms, and costs is important to maximise population-level health outcomes. Presently, there is no economic evidence on whether short-course antibiotic treatment of VAP is cost-effective when compared to usual care. Shortening antibiotic therapy can reduce antibiotic costs and risk of antibiotic-related adverse events, but any increased incidence in treatment failure or infection recurrence can compromise patient outcomes or increase hospital costs, or both. Even in trials that show small, non-significant differences in adverse events or treatment failures, paradoxical conclusions regarding cost-effectiveness can occasionally be observed if disproportionally high costs were incurred during the episode of treatment failure or adverse event.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched Embase, MEDLINE (OVID), Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, andfor economic analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed antibiotic treatment duration for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), published in English, from database inception to Dec 1, 2023. We used the following search terms: (randomized OR randomised) AND trial AND ventilator AND pneumonia AND (antibiotic OR treatment). Five RCTs were identified and none of these trials assessed the costs or cost-effectiveness of adopting a short-course antibiotic treatment duration for VAP. Previous economic analyses performed for the antibiotic treatment of VAP were based mostly from trials that compared existing versus new antibiotic options.

### Individualised, short-course antibiotic treatment versus usual long-course treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (REGARD-VAP): a multicentre, individually randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^1d67a8e3]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Background

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is associated with increased mortality, prolonged hospitalisation, excessive antibiotic use and, consequently, increased antimicrobial resistance. In this phase 4, randomised trial, we aimed to establish whether a pragmatic, individualised, short-course antibiotic treatment strategy for VAP was non-inferior to usual care.

Methods

We did an individually randomised, open-label, hierarchical non-inferiority-superiority trial in 39 intensive care units in six hospitals in Nepal, Singapore, and Thailand. We enrolled adults (age ≥ 18 years) who met the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network criteria for VAP, had been mechanically ventilated for 48 h or longer, and were administered culture-directed antibiotics. In culture-negative cases, empirical antibiotic choices were made depending on local hospital antibiograms reported by the respective microbiology laboratories or prevailing local guidelines. Participants were assessed until fever resolution for 48 h and haemodynamic stability, then randomly assigned (1:1) to individualised short-course treatment (≤ 7 days and as short as 3–5 days) or usual care (≥ 8 days, with precise durations determined by the primary clinicians) via permuted blocks of variable sizes (8, 10, and 12), stratified by study site. Independent assessors for recurrent pneumonia and participants were masked to treatment allocation, but clinicians were not. The primary outcome was a 60-day composite endpoint of death or pneumonia recurrence. The non-inferiority margin was prespecified at 12% and had to be met by analyses based on both intention-to-treat (all study participants who were randomised) and per-protocol populations (all randomised study participants who fulfilled the eligibility criteria, met fitness criteria for antibiotic discontinuation, and who received antibiotics for the duration specified by their allocation group). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03382548.

Findings

Between May 25, 2018, and Dec 16, 2022, 461 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the short-course treatment group (n = 232) or the usual care group (n = 229). Median age was 64 years (IQR 51–74) and 181 (39%) participants were female. 460 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis after excluding one withdrawal (231 in the short-course group and 229 in the usual care group); 435 participants received the allocated treatment and fulfilled eligibility criteria, and were included in the per-protocol population. Median antibiotic treatment duration for the index episodes of VAP was 6 days (IQR 5–7) in the short-course group and 14 days (10–21) in the usual care group. 95 (41%) of 231 participants in the short-course group met the primary outcome, compared with 100 (44%) of 229 in the usual care group (risk difference -3% [one-sided 95% CI -∞ to 5%]). Results were similar in the per-protocol population. Non-inferiority of short-course antibiotic treatment was met in the analyses, although superiority compared with usual care was not established. In the per-protocol population, antibiotic side-effects occurred in 86 (38%) of 224 in the usual care group and 17 (8%) of 211 in the short-course group (risk difference -31% [95% CI -37 to -25%; p < 0.0001]).

Interpretation

In this study of adults with VAP, individualised shortened antibiotic duration guided by clinical response was non-inferior to longer treatment durations in terms of 60-day mortality and pneumonia recurrence, and associated with substantially reduced antibiotic use and side-effects. Individualised, short-course antibiotic treatment for VAP could help to reduce the burden of side-effects and the risk of antibiotic resistance in high-resource and resource-limited settings.

### Use of non-invasive ventilation to wean critically ill adults off invasive ventilation: meta-analysis and systematic review [^62d26334]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

This review was strengthened by an extensive search for relevant trials. We conducted duplicate independent citation screening and data abstraction and corresponded with lead investigators to clarify study methods where needed. In addition to appraising the quality of randomised trials, we also assessed methodological features specific to weaning trials that might influence estimates of treatment effect. We used random effects models in pooling data, which take into consideration variation both between and within studies. Pooling results in a meta-analysis implicitly assumes that the studies are sufficiently similar with respect to their populations, study interventions, outcomes, and methodological quality that one could reasonably expect a comparable underlying treatment effect. A priori, we planned sensitivity and subgroup analyses to explain the differences among study results and anticipating heterogeneity in pooling across studies for selected outcomes.

Conclusion

Current trials of non-invasive weaning, while limited by inclusion of small numbers of patients mostly with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, consistently show positive effects on mortality and ventilator associated pneumonia. The evidence of benefit is promising, but additional trials are required to fully evaluate the net clinical benefits on clinical outcomes associated with non-invasive weaning, especially the risks associated with extubation and the impact of reintubation after a failed attempt at extubation on clinical outcomes. If consideration is being given to weaning patients with non-invasive ventilation, we suggest that it be preferentially used in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and applied in a highly monitored environment. A well designed, adequately powered randomised controlled with explicitly defined end points comparing the alternative approaches to weaning is justified.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) empiric antibiotic coverage — scope and thresholds: When local resistance resembles surveillance benchmarks, "empiric coverage should include an agent active against MRSA and at least 2 agents active against gram-negative organisms, including P. aeruginosa", whereas if local data indicate "a low prevalence of MRSA and low antibiotic resistance rates among gram-negatives", "a single agent active against MSSA combined with one agent active against Pseudomonas and other gram-negatives is likely adequate". Empiric choices "should be informed by patient-specific risk factors" and "Not all patients require maximal empiric coverage", and "Narrower-spectrum coverage may be appropriate" when risk factors and local prevalence are low. For threshold guidance, "The panel suggests that ICU-level S. aureus methicillin resistance rates of > 10%–20% merit selecting a gram-positive agent active against MRSA, and that ICU-level gram-negative resistance rates of > 10% to an agent being considered for empiric gram-negative monotherapy merit using 2 gram-negative agents for empiric therapy of suspected VAP". If calculating local rates is difficult, "the resistance rate for Pseudomonas is a reasonable, albeit conservative, proxy because Pseudomonas is the most common gram-negative organism associated with VAP".

Hospital-acquired pneumonia/ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP) due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa — definitive monotherapy versus combination therapy: Evidence syntheses found no differences between monotherapy and combination therapy for definitive treatment, and the panel felt strongly that, in the absence of any demonstrable benefit, the costs and potential side effects of an additional antibiotic were not warranted; therefore, the recommendation is strong despite the low quality of evidence. An exception is that combination therapy is warranted as definitive therapy for patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa who have septic shock or a high risk for death, based upon evidence that combination therapy was associated with decreased mortality among patients with pneumonia complicated by septic shock. Background data cited include an initial meta-analysis of Pseudomonas bacteremia showing benefit with combination therapy (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.32–.79) and a large observational analysis showing no reduction in 30-day mortality with combination therapy versus monotherapy (adjusted HR, 1.34; 95% CI, .73–2.47).

Ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) in adults — antibiotic therapy is not suggested based on low-quality evidence and uncertain clinical benefit. "In patients with VAT, we suggest not providing antibiotic therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence)". VAT definitions included "positive ETA culture (> 10⁶ CFU/mL)… and no radiographic evidence of nosocomial pneumonia". Evidence review "identified 3 randomized trials", but "the panel decided to exclude 2 of the trials" for indirectness; "the remaining randomized trial randomly assigned 58 patients to receive either intravenous antibiotics or no antibiotics for 8 days". In that trial, the antibiotic group had lower "ICU mortality (18% vs 47%; OR, 0.24, 95% CI, 0.07–.88)", less "subsequent VAP (13% vs 47%; OR, 0.17, 95% CI, .04–.70)", and more "mechanical ventilation–free days (median 12 vs 2 days; P < .001), but no difference in the duration of mechanical ventilation or length of ICU stay". Observational data showed antibiotics were associated with shorter ventilation duration "(−3.5 days; 95% CI −6.88 to −0.19 days)" without significant differences in mortality or ICU stay; isolates commonly included "Acinetobacter (27%), Klebsiella (5%), and MRSA (32%)", with "MDR organisms" in "61%" and polymicrobial infections in "31%". Overall, "the evidence suggests that antibiotic therapy for VAT may shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation; however, it is uncertain whether it improves other clinical outcomes", and "the… quality of evidence… was low".

Interventions to be implemented by the physician's decision include; includes daily extubation assessment, peptic ulcer prophylaxis unless contraindicated, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis unless contraindicated. The study was planned to examine the effects of two different solutions on the incidence of VAP in patients who receive the VAP Care Bundle, which was created with evidence-based practices recommended in the literature, after the training to be given to nurses who provide care to patients on mechanical ventilation in the General Intensive Care Unit. The research will be conducted in two stages. The first stage, in which nurses working in the Intensive Care Unit will be included in the sample group, was planned in a pretest-posttest design, in a single group, in order to determine the effectiveness of the training to be given to nurses.

The second stage was planned in a single-group, prospective experimental design, in order to determine the effect of the VİP Care Bundle application on the VİP incidence and the duration of stay on the ventilator. The second stage; 0. 12% chlorhexidine glucanate solution or
0. 2% chlorhexidine glucanate solution will be used in oral care with the standard VAP Care Bundle application. The group to which the patients will be included will be determined by the nurse in charge of the service through simple randomization. This study was planned in a two-group, prospective, experimental design to determine the effect of oral care intervention applied with two different solutions on the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

### Cost-effectiveness of a short-course antibiotic treatment strategy for the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia: an economic analysis of the REGARD-VAP trial [^5c498c03]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Compared with usual care, the decision to adopt an individualised short-course antibiotic strategy using a set of reproducible clinical criteria in patients with VAP is likely to be cost-effective from the health system perspective in Nepal, Singapore, and Thailand, albeit with substantial uncertainty. In a high-income setting such as Singapore, adoption of short-course strategy is also likely to be cost-saving to the health system. Our findings are robust to the scenario analyses. The value of information analysis revealed the greatest value for decision making would arise from reducing uncertainties for mortality risk, costs of bed days, and variable costs.

From a population-level health policy standpoint, results from clinical studies are usually insufficient to guide the adoption of a new health intervention, because multiple factors beyond efficacy go into such decisions. Our cost-effectiveness analysis combined relevant short-term and long-term aspects of patients' costs and outcomes to strengthen the evidence for rational decision making on short-course individualised therapy in VAP. Because the composite endpoint used in the REGARD-VAP trial was unsuitable for economic analyses, we used a decision tree to present endpoints of pneumonia recurrence and patient mortality in a disaggregated form to compare costs and outcomes across the strategies. Our estimates are conservative because our model did not consider the potential spill-over benefits of reduced antibiotic use for reducing resistance carriage and onward transmission of multidrug resistant organisms within the hospital, which would probably result in additional gains in health outcomes and monetary savings. In a previous meta-analysis, Mo and colleaguesfound that 1 day of additional antibiotic treatment was associated with a 7% absolute increase in risk of resistance carriage, when antibiotics administered were not effective against the resistance phenotype in the colonising bacteria carriage. Additionally, we adopted a lower bound of the 1–3 times GDP per capita suggested by WHO for use in low-income and middle-income countries for Nepal because a threshold has not yet been formally established.

Preterm neonates — essential practices to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and/or PedVAE include use of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in selected populations, minimizing the duration of mechanical ventilation, and use of caffeine therapy to facilitate extubation (HIGH); additional essential practices with LOW quality of evidence are to assess readiness to extubate daily, manage patients without sedation whenever possible, avoid unplanned extubations and reintubations, avoid reintubation by using nasal CPAP, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), or high flow nasal cannula in the post-extubation period (HIGH), provide regular oral care with sterile water, and change the ventilator circuit only if visibly soiled or malfunctioning (or per manufacturer's instructions); the rationale states these practices may lower VAP and/or PedVAE rates and have minimal risks of harm, and benefits likely outweigh potential risks.

### A standardised, generic, validated approach to stratify the magnitude of clinical benefit that can be anticipated from anti-cancer therapies: the European society for medical oncology magnitude of clinical benefit scale (ESMO-MCBS) [^8d351729]. Annals of Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

The value of any new therapeutic strategy or treatment is determined by the magnitude of its clinical benefit balanced against its cost. Evidence for clinical benefit from new treatment options is derived from clinical research, in particular phase III randomised trials, which generate unbiased data regarding the efficacy, benefit and safety of new therapeutic approaches. To date, there is no standard tool for grading the magnitude of clinical benefit of cancer therapies, which may range from trivial (median progression-free survival advantage of only a few weeks) to substantial (improved long-term survival). Indeed, in the absence of a standardised approach for grading the magnitude of clinical benefit, conclusions and recommendations derived from studies are often hotly disputed and very modest incremental advances have often been presented, discussed and promoted as major advances or 'breakthroughs'. Recognising the importance of presenting clear and unbiased statements regarding the magnitude of the clinical benefit from new therapeutic approaches derived from high-quality clinical trials, the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) has developed a validated and reproducible tool to assess the magnitude of clinical benefit for cancer medicines, the ESMO Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS). This tool uses a rational, structured and consistent approach to derive a relative ranking of the magnitude of clinically meaningful benefit that can be expected from a new anti-cancer treatment. The ESMO-MCBS is an important first step to the critical public policy issue of value in cancer care, helping to frame the appropriate use of limited public and personal resources to deliver cost-effective and affordable cancer care. The ESMO-MCBS will be a dynamic tool and its criteria will be revised on a regular basis.

Statistical advancements in analyzing endpoints

In addition to the complexities related to study design and selection of the most appropriate endpoints, there are also some issues that need to be considered in the analytical phase. The high underlying mortality rate of critically ill patients makes an analytical evaluation of non-mortality endpoints challenging. Harhay et al. have already emphasized that special statistical methods are needed when evaluating a non-mortal clinical endpoint. All non-mortal clinical endpoints are measured over time, i.e. days from randomization, such as clinical outcome at the test of cure visit. Thus, time plays a crucial role in the interpretation and analysis of the data. The main statistical challenge, when observing non-mortal clinical endpoints, is the way patients who die are handled. For instance, when cure is the endpoint of interest, patients who die before being cured, from, e.g. their underlying disease, will have zero chance of cure (Fig. 2, patients 2 and 9) as compared to patients who are simply lost to follow-up and still have a chance of cure (Fig. 2, patient 5). Death prevents observing cure as the primary endpoint and is therefore a competing event for cure. Competing risk methods take these effects into account and provide an appropriate estimation of how the cure probability develops over time. These methods have recently been applied for RCTs in similar settings: for instance, Ayzac et al. studied the impact of prone positioning on the incidence of VAP using a cumulative incidence function that accounts for death as a competing event.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia/ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP) due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) — trial comparisons and vancomycin monitoring: In a combined population of 1503 patients with gram-positive nosocomial pneumonia, telavancin showed no overall differences in clinical cure, mortality, or adverse effects, but one component study had higher all-cause mortality vs vancomycin (21.5% vs 16.6%; mean difference, 4.9%; 95% CI, −7% to 10.6%), primarily among patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/minute, and increases in serum creatinine were more common with telavancin (16% vs 10%). Nonblinded trials reported similar response for quinupristin plus dalfopristin vs vancomycin in 298 patients (including 51 with MRSA), and vancomycin plus rifampin vs vancomycin alone in 83 MRSA cases increased 14-day clinical cure and decreased 60-day mortality without affecting 28-day mortality, with significant adverse effects in 34.1% receiving the combination. Taken together, the panel states there are no important differences among antibiotics for HAP/VAP due to MRSA with 2 exceptions — vancomycin plus rifampin may improve short-term cure at the expense of more rifampin resistance and possibly other side effects, and telavancin may be harmful when creatinine clearance is < 30 mL/minute — and the panel's overall confidence in the evidence was moderate due to serious risk of bias. The panel agrees with a prior consensus recommendation to achieve a vancomycin trough level of 15–20 mg/L in patients being treated for pneumonia.

Pediatric VAP/VAE prevention — approaches generally not recommended: The following interventions have unknown impact on VAP and VAE rates and/or have inadequate data on risks. Prolonged systemic antibiotics for ventilator-associated tracheitis (Quality of Evidence: LOW) did not protect against VAP but did increase the prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms, and whether, when, and how long to treat ventilator-associated tracheitis to prevent VAP in children remains unresolved. Selective oropharyngeal or digestive decontamination (Quality of Evidence: LOW) may be associated with a decrease in pneumonia rates but no change in mortality, with small trials and unassessed long-term impact on antibiotic resistance. Prophylactic probiotics (Quality of Evidence: LOW) should be considered with caution due to sparse data on impact in children, lack of clear benefit in adults, and case reports of Lactobacillus bacteremia in pediatric patients, including those not known to be immunocompromised.

Initial treatment of VAP and HAP — empiric antibiotic selection for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is directed by local resistance data as follows: We recommend that all hospitals regularly generate and disseminate a local antibiogram, ideally one that is specific to their intensive care population(s) if possible, and we recommend that empiric treatment regimens be informed by the local distribution of pathogens associated with VAP and their antimicrobial susceptibilities. The frequency with which pathogen distribution and susceptibility data are updated should be determined by the institution, with considerations including their rate of change, resources, and the amount of data available for analysis. This approach is supported by the observation that antimicrobial flora and resistance patterns can vary considerably between and within countries, regions, hospitals, ICUs in a hospital, and specimen sources; because of this variability, the only way to know the local prevalence and resistance patterns of pathogens associated with VAP is to develop a local antibiogram, ideally specific for VAP patients or, failing that, ICU patients. In the absence of local microbial epidemiology, clinicians can refer to large national and international surveys of organisms and resistance patterns, and the survey closest to the local level should be utilized; an approved guideline for susceptibility testing is available.

Procalcitonin (PCT) plus clinical criteria — diagnostic accuracy and panel stance for suspected HAP/VAP indicate high misclassification and no survival benefit from a PCT-guided escalation protocol. The false-negative and false-positive rates of serum PCT testing plus clinical criteria are 33% and 17%, respectively; assuming a prevalence of HAP/VAP of 50%, then for every 1000 patients with suspected HAP/VAP who are evaluated with serum PCT plus clinical criteria, 165 patients (16.5%) would be incorrectly diagnosed as not having HAP/VAP and 85 patients (8.5%) will be incorrectly diagnosed as having HAP/VAP. A recent trial randomized ICU patients to a PCT-guided antibiotic escalation protocol vs standard of care showed that the PCT-guided protocol did not result in survival improvement, but resulted in a higher number of ventilator-days and prolonged ICU stay. The panel agreed that the frequency of such undesirable consequences due to misleading PCT results was unacceptable and, therefore, recommended not using PCT to guide antibiotic initiation.

Early vs late tracheotomy

Context

Among critically ill patients expected to require prolonged mechanical ventilation, determining the optimal timing for tracheotomy remains a significant clinical question. Early tracheotomy (around days 6–8 of intubation) may reduce sedation needs, facilitate weaning, and potentially lower the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but it also involves procedural risks. Terragni et al. conducted a multicenter, randomized trial across 12 Italian ICUs (600 adult patients) to compare early (days 6–8) vs. late (days 13–15) tracheotomy in reducing pneumonia and resource utilization (e.g. ventilator and ICU days).

Key finding

VAP were diagnosed in 14% of patients in the early tracheotomy group vs 21% in the late group (p = 0.07). Hazard ratio for developing VAP with early vs late tracheotomy was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.42–1.04). Although the difference narrowly missed conventional significance (p < 0.05), the direction suggests a possible reduction in pneumonia with early tracheostomy. The study also showed a reduction in time on mechanical ventilation (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56–0.87), time in the ICU (HR 0.73, 95% CI, 0.55–0.97, and death (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56–1.15).

Bayesian reanalysis

Neutral prior: Assume a 0% difference in VAP incidence, with a moderate standard deviation to encompass plausible clinical effects (e.g. ± 10%).
Posterior probability: Given the observed 7% absolute difference (14% vs. 21%) but a p- value of 0.07, a Bayesian approach might still yield a meaningful probability (> 75%) that early tracheotomy reduces pneumonia by ≥ 5%.

Interpretation

Despite not achieving frequentist significance, the trend toward reduced VAP in the early tracheotomy group may be clinically relevant. The hazard ratios also suggest fewer ventilator and ICU days with earlier intervention. Because even modest reductions in nosocomial infections and ICU stay can translate into substantial benefits and cost savings, these borderline findings warrant careful consideration and further study. The decision on timing should balance the procedural risks against the potential for decreased ventilator exposure and pneumonia.

### Ventilator associated pneumonia in the ICU: where has it gone? [^c5b5aa52]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To highlight the clinical importance of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in an era of escalating antimicrobial resistance.

Recent Findings

VAP continues to be an important infection in the critically ill. The development of rapid microbiologic diagnostics and new antimicrobial agents offer opportunities for improved treatment strategies for VAP balancing the need to treat effectively in a timely manner and antimicrobial stewardship. Additionally, the new surveillance definitions for assessing the quality of care in critically ill patients (ventilator-associated events, ventilator-associated conditions, and infection-related ventilator-associated conditions) do not appear to be adequate surrogates for the identification of VAP.

Summary

Clinicians caring for critically ill patients should be aware of the importance of correctly treating VAP. As new diagnostic technologies and antimicrobials become available for VAP, their incorporation into routine patient management should occur in a way that optimizes patient outcomes wherein minimizing further emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

### Conference summary: ventilator-associated pneumonia [^d79b3d8f]. Respiratory Care (2005). Low credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is usually defined as an infection occurring greater than 48 hours after hospital admission in a patient requiring mechanical ventilation, is an entity that should be viewed as a subcategory of health-care-associated pneumonia, which includes any patient who was hospitalized in an acute care hospital for 2 or more days within 90 days of the infection; resided in a nursing home or long-term care facility; received recent antibiotic therapy, chemotherapy, or wound care within the past 30 days of the current infection; or attended a hospital or hemodialysis clinic. VAP is the most frequent intensive-care-unit (ICU)-acquired infection among patients receiving mechanical ventilation. In contrast to infections of other frequently involved organs (eg, urinary tract and skin), for which mortality is low, the mortality rate for VAP ranges from 20% to 50% and can reach 70% in some specific settings or when lung infection is caused by high-risk pathogens and/or when initial antibiotic therapy is inappropriate. Although the attributable mortality rate for VAP is still debated, it has been shown that these infections prolong both the duration of ventilation and the duration of ICU stay. These prolonged hospitalizations underscore the considerable financial burden imposed by the development of VAP. The causes of VAP are many and may vary by hospital, patient population, and type of ICU, emphasizing the need for timely, local surveillance data. In many cases infection is caused by multiple-drug-resistant pathogens. Risk factors for such resistant microorganisms are the duration of mechanical ventilation, prior antibiotic treatment, and contact with the health care system. Preventive measures should be guided with regard to a full understanding of pathogenesis and epidemiology. Because respiratory-tract colonization of ICU patients is generally very complex, corresponding to a mix of self-colonization and cross-transmission, only a multifaceted and multidisciplinary program can be effective. Antimicrobial therapy of patients with VAP should follow a 2-stage process. The first stage involves administering broad-spectrum antibiotics to avoid inappropriate treatment in patients with true bacterial pneumonia. The second stage focuses on trying to achieve this objective without over-using and abusing antibiotics, combining a number of different steps, such as stopping therapy in patients with a low probability of the disease, streamlining treatment once the etiologic agent is known, switching to monotherapy after days 3–5, and shortening duration of therapy to 7–8 days, as dictated by the patient's clinical response to therapy and information about the bacteriology of the infection.

For this reason, mortality is the only endpoint that should be used in non-inferiority trials. However, while mortality is the endpoint that reflects the strongest outcome criteria, its choice may also offer some disadvantages. First, the mortality attributable is difficult to determine; all-cause mortality may be related to underlying comorbidity, affecting the relationship between the efficiency of the antimicrobial treatment and death. Second, low mortality rates reported in HAP/VAP trials (except for those enrolling patients with difficult-to-treat pathogens) and the large non-inferiority margins that are recommended may prevent rejection of the non-inferiority of the tested drug and biased the results.

Nevertheless, the latest FDA recommendations may promote the use of mortality as a primary endpoint. Indeed, among the five currently unpublished RCTs of new systemic molecules that are reported on the ClinicalTrials.gov website, two use 28-day all-cause mortality as the primary endpoint, and one includes death in the definition of clinical cure. Clinical cure was used in seven studies, including one addressing the effect of inhaled antimicrobials as adjunctive therapy. As expected, as a clear consensus is still lacking, the variability in the definition of clinical cure and in the time point used to assess it remain significant.

Results

Systematic review

Selection

Two hundred and eight potentially relevant studies were initially identified by our search. Three studies fulfilled the selection criteria and were included in the review. The flow diagram showing the steps we followed to identify the RCTs fulfilling the inclusion criteria of our systematic review can be found in Additional file 1.

Quality assessment of trials

All three trials clearly concealed patient allocation, adequately described dropouts and did not report events in a selective way. A single trial blinded the investigators responsible for VAP diagnosis and used intention-to-treat analysis. In one trial, 46% of the randomized patients did not complete the trial. One trial stopped before the intended sample size was reached because of benefit.

Data extraction, analysis and body of evidence

Data on study populations, interventions and outcome definitions are shown in Table 1. Three RCTs compared 45° bed head elevation (treatment group) with respectively 25°, 10°, or 0° elevations (control groups) in adult ventilated ICU patients with a mean ventilation time varying from 4 days to 7 days. Patients with hemodynamic instability, pelvis trauma, (recent) abdominal surgery or neurosurgery, and severe obesity were excluded.

### Considerations unique to pediatrics for clinical trial design in hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia [^b7b644b5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background. A need exists for new antimicrobial agents to treat neonates, infants, and children for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by nosocomial antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Current and clear guidance on approval of new agents for all pediatric age groups is lacking. Methods. Studies on HAP and VAP in the neonatal and pediatric age groups were collected using PubMed (National Library of Medicine). Published articles were reviewed for pediatric-specific definitions of HAP and VAP, diagnostic techniques, rates of disease, risk factors, characteristics, and outcomes. Results. Definitions of HAP and VAP in neonatal and pediatric age groups vary considerably. No well-studied, sensitive, and specific microbiologic testing techniques exist. Morbidity and mortality associated with VAP in neonates, infants, and children have been documented. Conclusions. Investigation and approval of new agents for HAP and VAP in all pediatric age groups is needed. A uniform definition of HAP and VAP is required that is relevant for clinical trials and balances the risks of experimental therapy and sampling procedures for study patients with potential benefits for both the patient under investigation and the hospitalized children who may develop nosocomial pneumonia.

### Ventilator-associated pneumonia: insights from recent clinical trials [^3e59dc06]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common nosocomial infection in the ICU and contributes disproportionately to both poor outcomes and the high cost of care in critically ill patients. While VAP has been the focus of extensive research, little consensus exists about methods for diagnosis, treatment, or prevention. Delays in initiating appropriate therapy, antibiotic resistance due to indiscriminate and prolonged use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and treatment of patients with a low risk of VAP (based on clinical pulmonary infection scores) represent a sample of VAP-related issues that have been addressed in recent clinical trials. Educational programs for VAP prevention and other nonpharmacologic strategies aimed at eliminating VAP have also been explored in clinical investigations. This review highlights selected areas of new clinical research on VAP treatment and prevention in order to place their significance in context.

The following interventions may lower VAP rates, but current data are insufficient to determine their impact on duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and mortality.

Consider using endotracheal tubes with subglottic secretion drainage ports to minimize pooling of secretions above the endotracheal cuff in patients likely to require > 48–72 hours of intubation (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE). Intermittent and continuous drainage of subglottic secretions has been studied in at least 20 randomized controlled trials. On meta-analysis, the use of endotracheal tubes with subglottic drainage reduced VAP rates by 44%. There was no association, however, between subglottic secretion drainage and duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, or hospital length of stay. One meta-analysis reported a significant impact on mortality but abstracted one large study twice. The effect on mortality was no longer significant after removing the duplicate study (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.83–1.02). One large trial included VAE as an outcome and found no association between subglottic secretion drainage and VAE rates. Some studies have reported that subglottic secretion drainage is associated with less antibiotic utilization, but others have not. – Reductions in duration of mechanical ventilation with subglottic secretion drainage appear to be limited to patients expected to require > 48–72 hours of mechanical ventilation. Endotracheal tubes with subglottic secretion drainage ports should therefore be reserved for patients likely to require > 48–72 hours of intubation. Patients requiring emergency intubation in the hospital and preoperative patients at risk for prolonged mechanical ventilation are reasonable candidates. Extubation followed by immediate reintubation to exchange a conventional endotracheal tube for a subglottic secretion drainage endotracheal tube is not recommended.
Consider early tracheostomy (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE). Meta-analysis of 17 randomized trials suggests that early tracheostomy (within 7 days of intubation) may be associated with a 40% decrease in VAP rates, less time on mechanical ventilation, and fewer ICU days but no difference in mortality. Decision makers should integrate these potential benefits with each patient's values and preferences when determining whether and when to proceed with tracheostomy.
Consider postpyloric feeding tube placement in patients with gastric feeding intolerance at high risk for aspiration (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE). Postpyloric feeding is associated with less aspiration and less pneumonia compared to gastric-tube feeding. Meta-analyses vary in their assessment of whether postpyloric feeding is associated with decreases in ventilator, ICU, and/or hospital length of stay. Postpyloric tube placement requires special expertise that is not available in all centers and may incur delay in placement. Postpyloric feeding is considered less physiologic than gastric feeding. Postpyloric feeding should therefore be reserved for patients with gastric feeding intolerance and for patients at high risk for aspiration as detailed in nutrition society guidelines.

ESBL-producing gram-negative bacilli in HAP/VAP — definitive therapy selection: For patients with HAP/VAP due to ESBL-producing gram-negative bacilli, we recommend that the choice of an antibiotic for definitive (not empiric) therapy be based upon the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing and patient-specific factors (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Remarks state that patient-specific factors to consider include allergies and comorbidities that may confer an increased risk of side effects. Supporting evidence notes that comparative antibiotic data are extremely limited, with no randomized or observational studies specifically enrolling HAP/VAP due to ESBL-producing organisms, and only a few case series describing failure of third-generation cephalosporins in treating ESBL-producing pathogens.

Determining etiology of HAP and VAP — Because of MDR risk and consequences of ineffective initial therapy, experts believe that cultures of respiratory secretions should be obtained from virtually all patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), a practice with which the panel agreed; subsequent sections presume cultures are obtained for all suspected VAP. Evidence supporting blood cultures in VAP is limited, but approximately 15% of VAP patients are bacteremic and bacteremic VAP has been associated with higher morbidity and mortality than nonbacteremic VAP.

The Effect of Two Different Oral Care Solutions on Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia and Oral Health of Mechanically Ventilated Patients in the Intensive Care UnitClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview The aim of this observational study is to evaluate the effects of two different oral care solutions on ventilator-associated pneumonia and oral health in mechanically ventilated participants in the intensive care unit. Did oral health improve in participants who used cetylpyridinium chloride. Did pneumonia develop. Did oral health improve in participants who used chlorhexidine chloride. Did pneumonia develop. The results will be evaluated by giving oral care to the participants with these solutions for 5 days with the same protocol. Ventilator-associated pneumonia is defined as pulmonary parenchymal infection in patients exposed to invasive mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours and is a part of intensive care unit -acquired pneumonia.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia is the most common intensive care unit -acquired infection among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. When the VAP data of surgical and medical ICUs of thirty-six developing countries, including our country, for the years 2013–2018 were evaluated; the average VAP rate was determined as 11. 47 per 1000 ventilator days. It contributes to the increase in hospital mortality, MV and ICU hospital stay. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of two different oral care solutions on ventilator-associated pneumonia and oral health of patients on mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. H0: There is no difference between the development of VAP and oral health of patients on mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit where 0. 25% chlorhexidine gluconate is used in oral care and the development of VAP and oral health of patients on mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit where

### Evaluating patient-centered outcomes in the randomized controlled trial and beyond: informing the future with lessons from the past [^dc8fe742]. Clinical Cancer Research (2010). Low credibility.

In the era of molecular oncology, patients still define a useful therapy as one that allows them to live longer and helps them to live better. Although patient outcomes have clearly improved as a result of randomized controlled trials (RCT), it is critical that contemporary trials retain the perspective of these fundamental patient-centered outcomes. Trends in study design, results, and interpretation of oncology RCTs from the past provide a useful framework in which to consider how the research community may approach trial design in the future. Although the RCT remains the standard for establishing efficacy, this article also considers how population-based outcome studies can provide insight into effectiveness of new therapies and explores how the results of RCTs translate into benefit in the general population.

### Preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults: sowing seeds of change [^662f8f79]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), a major cause of ICU infection, results in high morbidity, mortality, and health-care costs. Multiple risk factors for VAP involve complex host factors and ubiquitous pathogens that require several different types of prevention strategies. Prevention efforts should focus on reducing bacterial colonization, and limiting aspiration, antibiotic exposure, and use of invasive devices. Although evidence-based prevention guidelines are available, they are lengthy, often ignored, and not implemented. New insights into the barriers to implementation of effective prevention programs are emerging. This article provides highlights from recent guidelines and publications discussing VAP prevention strategies and examines barriers to their implementation. Prevention and implementation of cost-effective strategies to reduce risk and improve patient outcomes should be prioritized. Clearly, prevention programs should be population specific and may vary among hospitals, but a multidisciplinary prevention team led by a "champion" is recommended to help set priorities, benchmarking goals, analyze data, and sow the seeds of change for risk reduction.

Section 1: Rationale and statements of concern

Hospitalized patients are at high risk for pneumonia and other pulmonary complications, particularly patients on mechanical ventilation. Hospital-acquired pneumonia is the most common nosocomial infection. It affects ~1 in 100 patients overall and up to 1 in 10 patients on invasive mechanical ventilation. The true incidence of nosocomial pneumonia is difficult to discern, however, because diagnostic criteria vary widely, correlate poorly with histology, are often subjective, and are applied differently by different surveyors. – Many hospitals have reported dramatic decreases in VAP rates over the past 20 years, but the extent to which these declines reflect better care versus stricter application of subjective surveillance criteria remains unclear. Clinical surveys suggest that 5%–10% of ventilated patients continue to be treated for VAP, – and an independent audit conducted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that VAP rates were stable between 2005 and 2013. Patients on mechanical ventilation are at risk for a variety of serious complications in addition to pneumonia. Examples include acute respiratory distress syndrome, fluid overload, atelectasis, pneumothorax, barotrauma, and pulmonary embolism. The CDC created VAE definitions to better capture the breadth of serious complications associated with mechanical ventilation. Approximately 5%–10% of mechanically ventilated patients develop VAEs. – The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated with an increase in the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia due to hospital-acquired severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and hospital-acquired bacterial superinfections in patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia. – Differentiating superinfection from underlying COVID-19 pneumonia and COVID-19–related ARDS is challenging due to considerable overlap in clinical signs.
VAP, VAE, and NV-HAP are detrimental to patients and increase costs. The attributable mortality of VAP is estimated to be ~10% but varies considerably by type and severity of underlying illness. – VAP and VAE extend duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, prolong intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay, and increase mortality risk. They are also associated with greater use of antimicrobials and higher costs. Patients with VAEs are ~50% more likely to die compared to similar patients with VAP.NV-HAP is associated with a doubling of the length of time until discharge and substantially higher mortality rates compared to similar patients without NV-HAP.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) timing and MDR risk — The presence of risk factors for multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens should take precedence over classifying pneumonia as early vs late onset, and timing should be interpreted alongside other risk factors and recent antibiotic exposure; overall, patients who develop VAP after > 5 days of hospitalization are at higher risk of MDR infection than those with earlier VAP.

For MRSA screening, "Observational data suggest that concurrent or recent positive MRSA screens increase the likelihood that clinical infection is due to MRSA", yet "Only about 30% of respiratory infections are due to MRSA in patients with positive MRSA surveillance studies", and in higher-prevalence settings a negative screen "decreases the probability that infection is due to MRSA but does not rule out the possibility", with "up to 75% of critically ill respiratory tract infections" having "negative nasal culture surveillance screens for MRSA"; similarly, "We did not identify any RCTs evaluating the use of MRSA screening to inform empiric treatment choices for VAP".

Pediatric VAP prevention — interventions with insufficient evidence and suctioning: No recommendation is made because these interventions have limited data from pediatric studies, no impact on VAP rates or outcomes in adults, and unclear impact. Closed/in-line suctioning (Quality of Evidence: LOW) may be associated with fewer transient decreases in oxygenation and increases in heart rate and blood pressure compared to open suctioning, but the clinical significance of these findings is unclear, and an observational study in children did not find any difference in VAP rates, length of stay, or mortality given the lack of blinding and randomization.

### The epidemiology and clinical outcomes of ventilator-associated events among 20, 769 mechanically ventilated patients at intensive care units: an observational study [^265f900b]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Due to the poor correlation between VAE and the traditional definition of VAP, the new approach has not been widely implemented outside the USA and is mainly used for surveillance. However, VAE is not designed to be a proxy for VAP, rather it was intentionally to broaden the surveillance from targeting pneumonia only to include the complications associated with ventilation in healthcare settings. Therefore, many VAEs may be conditions other than pneumonia. Nevertheless, surveillance aims to identify patients with severe complications and to track the impact of prevention strategies. With shifting the focus on all major causes of respiratory deterioration in ventilated patients, VAE surveillance imposes a severity threshold to identify a subset of patients with severe disease. Indeed, previous studies have found that patients without impaired gas exchange are associated with a relatively benign clinical course. Compared to those with traditionally defined VAP, patients with VAE had a higher mortality rate as demonstrated by our study group and that others. This confirms the clinical importance of VAE surveillance. In addition, traditional ventilator bundles were primarily based on subjectively and nonspecifically traditional VAP definition, but some components proved to be harmful. VAE surveillance, which is defined based on objective ventilator data, is less vulnerable to misattributing benefit to neutral or negative interventions. Several potential strategies for preventing VAEs have been proposed including minimizing sedation, paired daily spontaneous awakening and breathing trials, and conservative fluid management. Studies have suggested that the VAE prevention bundles were associated not only with lower risks of VAE, but also with less time to extubation and shorter LOS in hospital. In general, VAE is a relatively new algorithm to address complications associated with ventilation including, but not restricted to, VAP. This is quite different from the traditional approach to address VAP alone and therefore brings challenges for the long-standing thinking pattern and practice routines in patient care. It may take time for such a relatively new algorithm to be adopted widely in clinical practice. More studies are warranted to further demonstrate the preventability of VAE and its clinical significance on patient outcomes in different countries and among different patient populations. These studies will be likely to generate more high-quality, convincing, and patient care-focused (in addition to the surveillance purpose) evidence to further demonstrate the clinical relevance of VAE. Meanwhile, as VAE is simple and can be easily applied, we recommend clinicians to raise awareness towards VAE and to consider performing observations of the incidence and impact of VAE for their patients.

### PRophylaxis against early VENTilator-associated infections in acute… [^fdcfb844]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

- In a multicentre placebo-controlled randomised clinical trial prophylactic antibiotics significantly reduced early ventilator-associated pneumonia compared to placebo in patients who were mechanically ventilated and treated with targeted temperature management after an out of hospital cardiac arrest.
- In another recent RCT, trial participants allocated to receive a single dose of 2g of ceftriaxone within 12 hours of endotracheal intubation, who were comatose and expected to require at least 48 h of invasive mechanical ventilation in the ICU, had a significantly lower rate of VAP than trial participants allocated to placebo.
- These RCTs were not adequately powered to determine the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on patient-important outcomes. However, in the PROPHY-VAP trial a total of 32 of 161 participants allocated to prophylactic ceftriaxone had died and a total of 46 of 157 allocated to placebo had died; P = 0. 074). Finally, in the Prophylactic Antibiotics for VAP trial, 2g of prophylactic intravenous ceftriaxone in patients with acute brain injuries requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICU significantly reduced early VAP compared to placebo. A total of 23 of 162 allocated to ceftriaxone and 51 or 157 allocated to placebo developed early ventilated pneumonia. However, when SuDDICU trial data were combined with other data in a systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis of 32 randomized trials that included 24, 389 participants, there was a 99. 3% posterior probability that SDD was associated with reduced hospital mortality compared with standard care. The mortality reduction associated with SDD was only evident in regimens that included an intravenous antibiotic component.

In a secondary analysis of the SuDDICU trial data, in patients with an ICU admission diagnosis of acute brain injury, SDD was associated with significantly improved survival compared to standard care without SDD as well as increased ventilator free day, ICU and hospital free days. These benefits were not evident in patients without acute brain injury.

Cuff pressure targets and monitoring — trial data and measurement accuracy: Appropriate cuff pressure to reduce microaspiration and tracheal injury has been identified as 20–30 cm H2O; across 6 RCTs, tapered versus standard cuff shape showed no significant difference in hospital-acquired pneumonia (odds ratio 0.97 [95% CI 0.73–1.28], P = 0.81). Infrequent versus frequent (every 8 h) cuff pressure measurement produced similar ventilator-associated event (VAE) occurrence (5.8% vs 3.6%, P = 0.37) despite 336 versus 1,531 measurements, and palpation/minimal leak techniques are inaccurate when compared to analog or digital pressure manometers. In RCTs of continuous cuff pressure regulation versus measurements every 8 h, sample sizes included 142 (n = 73 vs n = 69), 597, and 434 (n = 216 vs n = 218), with no reduction in VAP rates (22% vs 29%, P = 0.44; 25% vs 23%, P = 0.53; 33.8% vs 29.4%, P = 0.71) and no benefit for microbiologically confirmed VAP, distribution of early or late onset VAP, causative microorganisms, proportion of intubated days without antimicrobials, rate of ICU discharge, cost of ICU LOS, cost of ICU antimicrobials, cost of hospital LOS, ICU mortality, or hospital mortality.

Preterm neonates — additional approaches have unknown impact on VAP and VAE rates but risk of harm likely minimal, and are reasonable to consider if rates remain elevated despite essential practices; listed options are lateral recumbent positioning, reverse Trendelenberg positioning, and closed/in-line suctioning systems (all LOW). Generally not recommended options due to unknown impact on VAP rates and inadequate data on risks are regular oral care with an antiseptic or Biotene (LOW) and oral care with maternal colostrum (MODERATE). Interventions that may be harmful, where the risk-benefit balance does not favor intervention unless specifically indicated for reasons other than VAP prevention, include histamine-2 receptor antagonists (MODERATE), prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics (MODERATE), daily spontaneous breathing trials (LOW), daily sedative interruptions (LOW), and prophylactic probiotics or synbiotics (LOW). Not recommended because appropriate products are not available or approved for use in this population are endotracheal tubes with subglottic secretion drainage ports and silver-coated endotracheal tubes (quality of evidence NA).

### Treatment failures in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia [^1b1e95de]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Treatment failures in patients with VAP are a complex issue and form a major challenge for clinicians. The following key elements inherent to a rational approach to treatment failures have been elucidated: (1) the presence of treatment failure must be thoroughly defined and assessed; (2) the many causes behind treatment failures must be realized, particularly the possibility of pneumonia-related and extrapulmonary reasons; (3) the recognition of different patterns of treatment failures as a useful framework for decisions about modalities and intensity of diagnostic reassessment; and (4) the establishment of a protocol for the search of pulmonary and extrapulmonary sites of infection and noninfectious causes of nonresponse. Only such a rational approach precludes the adverse effects of blind empiricism, which always implies a dangerous and costly overtreatment. Many issues related to treatment failures remain unsettled, and efforts will have to be made in the future to improve current clinical attitudes to treatment failures in VAP.

Additional approaches for preventing VAP and/or VAEs in adult patients

Additional approaches are interventions associated with lower VAP rates that that may also decrease VAE rates, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and/or mortality but carry some risk of harm. Additional approaches also include interventions that are associated with lower VAP rates, but insufficient data exist to determine their impact on objective outcomes. Hospitals can consider adopting additional approaches if their VAP or VAE rates do not improve despite high performance rates with essential practices.

The following interventions may decrease duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and/or mortality in some populations but not in others, and they may confer some risk of harm in some populations.

Consider using selective decontamination of the oropharynx and digestive tract to decrease microbial burden in ICUs with low prevalence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Antimicrobial decontamination is not recommended in countries, regions, or ICUs with high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant organisms (Quality of Evidence: HIGH). A meta-analysis of 6 cluster randomized trials performed in countries with low levels of antibiotic resistance reported that selective decontamination of the oropharynx with topical antibiotics was associated with a 16% reduction in hospital mortality, and decontamination of the oropharynx and digestive tract with a combination of topical, oral, and parenteral antibiotics was associated with an 18% reduction in hospital mortality. Selective digestive decontamination was more effective than selective oral decontamination alone (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82–0.97 for hospital death). A broader meta-analysis that included a larger but more heterogenous set of studies had similar findings. Oral agents that have been used for digestive decontamination include colistin, tobramycin, and amphotericin B. Parenteral agents include cefotaxime. ICUs that implement this practice should actively monitor its impact on antibiotic utilization, antimicrobial resistance, and Clostridioides difficile infections. There is no consensus on what constitutes "low levels of antibiotic resistance", but an arbitrary threshold that has been used by other guidelines and randomized trials is < 5% of bloodstream infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales. A cluster randomized trial of selective digestive decontamination (without parenteral antibiotics) versus selective oral decontamination versus oral care with 2% chlorhexidine versus routine care conducted in ICUs with high levels of antibiotic resistance (≥ 5% of bloodstream infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales) found no difference between study arms in ICU-acquired bloodstream infections or 28-day mortality rates. Selective oral and digestive decontamination with antibiotics is therefore not recommended in settings with high baseline levels of antibiotic resistance.

HAP/VAP aminoglycoside monotherapy — committee stance and rationale: The panel chose to recommend against aminoglycoside monotherapy as definitive therapy for 2 reasons; aminoglycosides penetrate the lung poorly and require high serum concentrations to achieve microbiologically active alveolar levels, which increases the risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, and studies have found no detectable antipseudomonal activity within bronchial secretions despite therapeutic serum levels in patients with Pseudomonas pulmonary infection. Given the lack of studies evaluating aminoglycoside monotherapy in HAP/VAP, the recommendation is based upon the committee's collective clinical experience.

### Pre-emptive antibiotic therapy to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia: "thinking outside the box" [^9721fae8]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Mechanically ventilated, intubated patients are at increased risk for tracheal colonization with bacterial pathogens that may progress to heavy bacterial colonization, ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT), and/or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Previous studies report that 10 to 30% of patients with VAT progress to VAP, resulting in increased morbidity and significant acute and chronic healthcare costs. Several natural history studies, randomized, controlled trials, and a meta-analysis have reported antibiotic treatment for VAT can reduce VAP, ventilator days, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and patient morbidity and mortality. We discuss early diagnostic criteria, etiologic agents, and benefits of initiating, early, appropriate intravenous or aerosolized antibiotic(s) to treat VAT and reduce VAP, to improve patient outcomes by reducing lung damage, length of ICU stay, and healthcare costs.

Results

The results of the REGARD-VAP trial have been published. Briefly, 460 patients were randomly assigned to the individualised short-course strategy (n = 231) or usual care (n = 229). 215 (47%) of the 460 patients received combination antibiotics. The median time to culture-directed antibiotic receipt for both the short-course and usual care groups was 0 days (IQR 0 to 2). Within the per-protocol population (n = 435), 60-day mortality was observed in 76 (36%) of 211 patients in the short-course strategy group and 87 (39%) of 224 patients in the usual care group (appendix 1 p 5). Pneumonia recurred in 29 (14%) of 211 patients in the short-course strategy group and 30 (13%) of 224 patients in the usual care group. There was no significant difference in the primary composite endpoint of 60-day death or pneumonia recurrence in the intention-to-treat (absolute risk difference –3% [one-sided 95% CI –∞ to 5]) and per-protocol population (absolute risk difference –3% [one-sided 95% CI –∞ to 5]) between the groups. Short-course strategy reduced overall mean antibiotic treatment days during hospitalisation (mean difference 5 · 2 days [95% CI –7.5 to –2.8]), but the lengths of hospital (mean difference –0.45 days [–4.5 to 3.6]) and ICU (mean difference –1.8 days [–6.0 to 2.4]) stays were similar between the groups.

Description of levels of evidence — Evidence based on endpoints of well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provides consistent findings without important limitations. Evidence with limitations includes RCTs with limited numbers of patients, post hoc or subgroup analyses or meta-analyses, and also applies when few RCTs exist or important limitations are evident (e.g., methodological flaws, small numbers, short duration, populations differing from the target, or inconsistent results). Evidence from non-randomized designs derives from outcomes of uncontrolled or non-randomized trials or observational studies. When clinical literature is insufficient, guidance relies on panel consensus based on clinical experience or knowledge that does not meet the above stated criteria.

The study GRACE-VAP was published by Jumpei Yoshimura and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Ventilator-associated pneumonia. In the GRACE-VAP study, the trial question was: is Gram stain-guided antibiotic therapy noninferior to guideline-based antibiotic therapy in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia? In the GRACE-VAP study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the GRACE-VAP study, the population was: 206 patients (65 female, 141 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia in the ICU. The key exclusion criteria were known allergy to study medications; discharge from ICU; HF; atelectasis; receipt of antibiotics for > 24 hours; withdrawal or withholding of life support; COVID-19 infection. In the GRACE-VAP study, the interventions were: n = 103 Gram stain-guided antibiotic therapy (selection of antibiotics guided by Gram staining of the endotracheal aspirate) n = 103 guideline-based antibiotic therapy (combination of an anti-pseudomonal agent and anti-MRSA agent). In the GRACE-VAP study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in clinical response (76.7% vs. 71.8%; AD 5%, 95% CI -7 to 17). In the GRACE-VAP study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death at day 28 (13.6% vs. 17.5%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.48) Significant decrease in the use of antipseudomonal agents (69.9% vs. 100%; ARD -30.1, 95% CI -21.5 to -39.9) Significant decrease in the use of anti-MRSA agents (61.2% vs. 100%; AD -38.8%, 95% CI -29.4 to -48.9). In the GRACE-VAP study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in adverse events, ICU-free days, ventilator-free days. In the GRACE-VAP study, the conclusion was: in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia in the ICU, Gram stain-guided antibiotic therapy was noninferior to guideline-based antibiotic therapy with respect to clinical response.

### Ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults: a narrative review [^f12e72d3]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is one of the most frequent ICU-acquired infections. Reported incidences vary widely from 5 to 40% depending on the setting and diagnostic criteria. VAP is associated with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. The estimated attributable mortality of VAP is around 10%, with higher mortality rates in surgical ICU patients and in patients with mid-range severity scores at admission. Microbiological confirmation of infection is strongly encouraged. Which sampling method to use is still a matter of controversy. Emerging microbiological tools will likely modify our routine approach to diagnosing and treating VAP in the next future. Prevention of VAP is based on minimizing the exposure to mechanical ventilation and encouraging early liberation. Bundles that combine multiple prevention strategies may improve outcomes, but large randomized trials are needed to confirm this. Treatment should be limited to 7 days in the vast majority of the cases. Patients should be reassessed daily to confirm ongoing suspicion of disease, antibiotics should be narrowed as soon as antibiotic susceptibility results are available, and clinicians should consider stopping antibiotics if cultures are negative.

### Treatment of severe hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: a systematic review of inclusion and judgment criteria used in randomized controlled trials [^a4ac8d37]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

New antimicrobials are required to face the dramatically increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens. This unmet need has become a worldwide source of concern, and government action plans aiming at increasing the antimicrobials pipeline are in development. The evaluation of these new treatments will require properly designed studies with appropriate inclusion criteria and endpoints. However, in hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), the way to conduct such studies remains unclear. During the past ten years, the regulatory agencies (European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)) have repeatedly updated their guidelines for the design of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but their recommendations remain conflicting, especially regarding the design, endpoints, or inclusion criteria that should be used.

This is an important issue because HAP and VAP are ideal syndromes for clinical trials in the context of new drug approval: they are a major cause of infection, often involving multidrug-resistant pathogens (25% of ICU infections), they account for up to 50% of antibiotic prescriptions, identification of the causative pathogen using microbiological samples is easy, and they are particularly sensitive to antimicrobial treatment effect.

Our hypothesis is that to date, HAP/VAP RCTs greatly differ in the population enrolled, the criteria used for definition of HAP/VAP, and the endpoints assessed. Such differences among studies may be of importance as they may impact the results of the studies. For example, some studies showed that the reported incidence of VAP greatly depends on the diagnostic methodology used. This systematic review describes the enrolled populations, design, and conduct of RCTs addressing the efficacy of antimicrobials for HAP/VAP treatment in intensive care unit (ICU) patients from 1994 to 2016.

### Current place of probiotics for VAP [^8d775873]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

With the advent of new technological advancements, our understanding of the gut microbes, their functionality and their roles in critical illness has advanced greatly. The microbiome of ICU patients is characterised by a loss of diversity, site specificity, microbial richness and overgrowth of pathogens, inclining towards a single taxon. Despite a lag in understanding behind application, an emerging number of studies now focus on the use of probiotics as offering promise to ICU patients for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, Clostridium difficile infections, multi-organ dysfunction, sepsis in neonates and — most notably — ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

VAP is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in mechanically ventilated patients and responsible for between 24 and 47% of ICU acquired infections. Despite a plethora of existing VAP prevention strategies, results have been disappointing. An emerging number of studies now focus on the use of probiotics for the prevention of VAP. However, despite optimistic results, some believe the growing interest in the microbiota has spawned an explanatory hype as the essence for understanding otherwise unexplainable phenomenon. Hence key questions require answers: Does it work? And if so, what is the mechanism? And most importantly, is it safe?

Does it work? A number of clinical trials and meta-analysis focusing on probiotics and critical illness, not least VAP, have been published over recent years. A Cochrane review of probiotic therapy for VAP found a reduction in incidence, although evidence was of low quality. The analysis of eight RCTs with a total 1083 participants showed that the use of probiotics decreased the incidence of VAP (odds ratio 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.52 to 0.95, low-quality evidence). However, the aggregated results were uncertain for ICU mortality. Another more recent meta-analysis by Weng et al, from 13 RCTs (n = 1969) had similar findings. Again, they found no difference in length of ICU/hospital stay or duration of mechanical ventilation. These meta-analyses suffer from inclusion of trials of low quality, significant between-study heterogeneity and — with the limited number of inclusions — failed to detect any publication bias which affects precision of findings. Furthermore, the baseline incidence of VAP as well as the VAP definitions used can vary markedly between studies. Not least, there are large variations in probiotic strains used, dosing schema as well as route of administration.

Section 3: Background on prevention of VAP, VAE, and NV-HAP

Framework for evaluating and prioritizing interventions

The subjectivity and lack of specificity of diagnosing pneumonia complicate the interpretation of VAP and NV-HAP prevention studies. Subjectivity makes it possible that decreases in observed pneumonia rates are due to stricter interpretation of subjective diagnostic criteria rather than true decreases in disease. Lack of specificity makes it possible that lower pneumonia rates are due to less colonization or decreases in conditions that mimic the presentation of pneumonia without corresponding decreases in true pneumonia cases.
VAE criteria are more objective and hence less susceptible to these sources of bias, but the literature on VAE prevention is still relatively sparse.
Given the limitations of the pneumonia prevention literature and the relative paucity of VAE prevention literature, we prioritize pneumonia prevention strategies associated with improvements in objective outcomes such as duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU or hospital length of stay, mortality, VAEs, antibiotic utilization, and/or costs in randomized controlled trials. In addition, the potential benefits of different interventions are balanced against their feasibility, costs, and potential harms.
