## Question

MRI with contrast or without to look for brain tumor

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether brain MRI to look for a tumor should be done with gadolinium contrast, without contrast, or both, and under what circumstances contrast can be omitted. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the major neuro-oncology guidelines mandate for initial diagnosis, characterization, and follow-up. Then, I should verify diagnostic performance differences between contrast-enhanced and non-contrast MRI for primary tumors and metastases. Next, I need to review safety considerations for gadolinium-based contrast agents and mitigation strategies. After that, I should consider specific scenarios where non-contrast imaging might be acceptable and what sequences are critical. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and protocol details that align with evidence and guidance.

> Let me first confirm the guideline backbone so I don't jump to conclusions. The EANO 2021 diffuse glioma guidelines explicitly recommend brain MRI without and with gadolinium as the first-choice diagnostic modality for adult-type diffuse gliomas, and this applies at baseline for astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and glioblastoma, so contrast is not optional for standard care in that context [^1168Si9b] [^116wmHE8]. The AANS/CNS 2014 glioblastoma practice guideline similarly recommends MRI with and without gadolinium for surveillance after treatment to assess progression, again anchoring contrast use in routine follow-up [^1152kFNX]. For brain metastases, the NCCN states that contrast-enhanced brain MRI is preferred and more sensitive than CT for detecting intracranial disease in SCLC, specifying contrast-enhanced studies unless clinically contraindicated, reinforcing that contrast is the default standard [^111N89ic]. For leptomeningeal metastasis, EANO-ESMO 2023 goes further in prescribing post-gadolinium 3D T1 and 3D FLAIR sequences, underscoring the centrality of contrast to detect subtle meningeal disease [^113ZJtTH].

> Wait, let me verify that this isn't just guideline dogma without regulatory or evidentiary support. The FDA label for gadobutrol (Gadavist) indicates its use to detect and visualize areas with disrupted blood–brain barrier or abnormal CNS vascularity, which is precisely the imaging target in most enhancing brain tumors and metastases [^1168Si9b]. Moreover, the label includes clinical trials demonstrating that paired pre- plus post-contrast imaging was statistically superior to pre-contrast alone for lesion visualization, border delineation, and internal morphology in CNS imaging, directly supporting the additive value of contrast over non-contrast MRI for lesion conspicuity and assessment [^116hGVbR].

> I should now examine diagnostic performance, especially for metastases where small lesion detection changes management. I initially recall an incremental detection on the order of 30% for contrast-enhanced protocols, but hold on, I should double-check the specifics rather than rely on memory. High-quality modern protocols using contrast-enhanced 3D T1-weighted imaging with black-blood preparation and magnetization transfer substantially improve detection of enhancing metastases and are considered standard of reference, aligning with guideline recommendations and contemporary 3 T practice [^111BHcyb]. Earlier comparative work also demonstrated that increasing relaxivity or optimizing dose and field strength improves metastasis conspicuity and lesion count, although some of those studies used higher-than-standard doses that we do not routinely employ today, so I need to be cautious in extrapolating absolute numbers while accepting the qualitative conclusion that contrast increases sensitivity for small metastases [^1174o2FK] [^111eF6oi]. Techniques like contrast-enhanced black-blood TSE and vessel-suppressed sequences reduce vascular mimicry and further raise detection, again predicated on contrast use, which is clinically relevant for stereotactic radiosurgery planning where precise lesion count and borders are critical [^111tgQB5] [^111eF6oi].

> Hold on, let's not assume enhancement equals malignancy or that non-contrast adds nothing. Enhancement patterns assist with differential diagnosis and surgical or biopsy targeting, but enhancement is an imperfect surrogate of grade; importantly, a meaningful minority of high-grade gliomas do not enhance, with estimates up to about 18%, so I need to ensure non-contrast sequences like T2/FLAIR and diffusion are always included and interpreted in tandem with post-contrast images [^112sRdCp]. Response assessment frameworks in neuro-oncology operationalize measurable disease using contrast-enhancing lesions but also track non-enhancing T2/FLAIR changes, reflecting that both components matter for management and that contrast is necessary yet insufficient on its own for full tumor burden assessment [^115bq9N6].

> Next, I should review the role and limits of non-contrast techniques so I don't overstate contrast dependence. Non-contrast MRI, including T2/FLAIR, DWI/ADC, SWI, and advanced methods like ASL, MRS, and APTw, can detect and characterize tumors and treatment effects in many scenarios, and in selected questions their diagnostic performance approaches or exceeds static post-contrast T1 for specificity, but the consensus remains that these techniques complement rather than replace gadolinium in routine neuro-oncologic practice [^111Kvjx5] [^114cbm88]. Indeed, even proponents of GBCA minimization for stable or benign lesions acknowledge that contrast remains essential in many malignant and complex tumor cases, supporting a tailored but contrast-forward approach for suspected or active disease [^111fVBGm].

> But wait, what about safety — do gadolinium risks ever tip the balance against contrast in suspected tumor imaging? Macrocyclic agents such as gadobutrol have a strong safety record, and while nephrogenic systemic fibrosis risk is linked primarily to severe renal impairment and older linear agents, I still need to screen renal function and use the lowest effective dose within labeling, balancing benefit and risk in those with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or on dialysis [^1168Si9b] [^111Kvjx5]. Gadolinium retention in the brain has been observed, but contemporary reviews and regulatory language emphasize that the clinical significance remains uncertain, so standard practice continues to support indicated GBCA use with macrocyclics and appropriate patient selection and counseling [^115ZygfE] [^1168Si9b].

> I will now examine when non-contrast MRI may be acceptable or necessary so I do not overgeneralize. If there is a documented prior severe GBCA hypersensitivity or an absolute contraindication due to renal failure risk where the clinical team elects to avoid GBCA, non-contrast MRI with a comprehensive protocol may be used as a compromise, recognizing reduced sensitivity for small enhancing lesions such as micrometastases; even NCCN language allows substitution only when contrast is clinically contraindicated, which underscores that this is an exception, not the rule [^111N89ic]. In longitudinal follow-up of known, stable, non-enhancing lesions where management would not change based on enhancement, some authors advocate GBCA minimization, but this is an individualized decision that should be reassessed if clinical status changes or if imaging raises new concern for progression or malignant transformation [^111fVBGm].

> Let me think about protocol optimization because sequence choice can mitigate limitations and maximize yield. For suspected leptomeningeal spread, post-gadolinium 3D T1 and especially 3D FLAIR are critical due to improved sensitivity for subtle meningeal enhancement, so I should ensure these are included if LM is in the differential [^113ZJtTH]. For parenchymal metastases and enhancing tumors, high-resolution 3D T1 post-contrast at 3 T with vessel suppression or black-blood preparation and magnetization transfer can improve lesion conspicuity and reduce vascular confounds, and careful attention to timing after injection can increase enhancing volume and lesion detectability, although I should balance this with overall scan efficiency and patient tolerance [^111BHcyb] [^116PphnP]. Choice among macrocyclic GBCAs shows broadly similar qualitative lesion visualization in head-to-head trials at standard dosing, allowing selection based on availability and patient factors while maintaining diagnostic quality [^114mt3w6].

> I should confirm whether higher field strength or advanced platforms change the contrast calculus. Ultra-high-field 7 T MRI can improve delineation of tumor margins and microvasculature compared to 3 T, but it does not obviate the need for gadolinium when enhancement is clinically important; rather, it refines anatomical and susceptibility-based assessment within comprehensive protocols that still include contrast-enhanced sequences when appropriate [^112sXFq5]. Similarly, susceptibility-weighted imaging at 3 T can add microvascular and hemorrhagic detail correlating with tumor grade, yet it functions as an adjunct to, not a replacement for, contrast-enhanced imaging in standard workflows [^11496z7E].

> Synthesizing all of this, I should be explicit. For initial evaluation of a suspected brain tumor, for characterization to guide biopsy or surgery, for radiation or radiosurgery planning, and for most treatment response assessments, MRI with and without gadolinium is the standard of care and should be obtained unless a specific contraindication exists, because it improves lesion detection, delineation, and clinically actionable decision-making compared with non-contrast imaging alone [^115ddpWc] [^111N89ic] [^1152kFNX] [^113ZJtTH]. When contrast must be avoided, a robust non-contrast protocol including T2/FLAIR, DWI/ADC, SWI, and, when available, ASL and MRS can partially compensate, but I need to counsel that sensitivity for small enhancing lesions, leptomeningeal disease, and subtle progression will be lower, potentially altering management timelines and confidence [^111Kvjx5] [^113yALKB].

> Final recommendation and practical takeaways, making sure I have not missed any caveats: perform brain MRI with and without gadolinium contrast for suspected or known brain tumors, using macrocyclic GBCA at labeled dosing with renal function screening, and include optimized post-contrast 3D T1 and, when indicated, post-contrast 3D FLAIR; reserve non-contrast–only protocols for clear contraindications or narrowly defined stable, non-enhancing scenarios with explicit acknowledgment of diagnostic trade-offs and a low threshold to add contrast if the clinical picture evolves [^1168Si9b] [^115ddpWc] [^111N89ic] [^113ZJtTH]. If I encounter a case where I initially think non-contrast might suffice, I should pause and verify whether detection of additional small enhancing foci, refinement of margins, or assessment of leptomeninges would alter management; if yes — and it usually is — contrast should be administered to meet the standard of care [^111BHcyb] [^1152kFNX].

---

MRI with contrast is the standard for brain tumor imaging [^116wmHE8] because it detects and delineates tumors [^116hGVbR] by highlighting blood–brain barrier disruption [^115ddpWc], improving diagnostic confidence and treatment planning [^111N89ic]. Non-contrast MRI is reserved for patients with severe renal impairment [^111Kvjx5], allergy, or pregnancy [^111fVBGm]. For initial diagnosis, follow-up, or suspected recurrence [^1152kFNX], use MRI with and without contrast [^111fVBGm]; for low-grade gliomas or when contrast is contraindicated, use non-contrast MRI with advanced sequences (DWI, ASL, MRS).

---

## Clinical indications for MRI with contrast

- **MRI with contrast** is indicated for:

- **Initial diagnosis and characterization**: Detects and delineates tumors [^116wmHE8] by highlighting blood–brain barrier disruption [^115ddpWc].

- **Differentiation of tumor types**: Helps distinguish primary tumors, metastases [^111N89ic], and lymphoma [^115Hj8ML].

- **Treatment planning**: Guides surgery, radiotherapy [^111eF6oi], and chemotherapy by defining tumor extent and margins [^112sXFq5].

- **Monitoring treatment response and recurrence**: Detects residual or recurrent tumor [^1152kFNX] and differentiates from treatment effects [^1131Jndq].

---

## Clinical indications for MRI without contrast

- **MRI without contrast** is indicated when:

- **Contraindications to contrast**: Severe renal impairment [^111Kvjx5], allergy, or pregnancy [^111fVBGm].

- **Low-grade gliomas**: Often non-enhancing [^116TXYf4]; advanced non-contrast sequences (DWI, ASL, MRS) can provide diagnostic information [^112X9fsw].

- **Screening and follow-up**: Useful for benign or stable lesions, especially with advanced non-contrast techniques [^111Kvjx5] [^111fVBGm].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity

MRI with contrast has higher sensitivity and specificity [^116hGVbR] than non-contrast MRI for detecting and characterizing brain tumors, particularly small lesions [^111BHcyb], metastases [^111N89ic], and leptomeningeal disease [^113ZJtTH]. Non-contrast MRI may miss small or subtle lesions, especially metastases, and is less accurate for tumor grading and differentiation [^111Kvjx5].

---

## Risks and limitations

MRI with contrast carries risks, including nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in renal impairment [^111Kvjx5] and gadolinium deposition in the brain, although the clinical significance is unclear [^115ZygfE]. Non-contrast MRI avoids these risks [^111Kvjx5] but may have lower diagnostic accuracy and may miss small or subtle lesions [^111BHcyb].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend MRI with and without contrast [^116wmHE8] as the first-choice imaging modality for brain tumors [^115ddpWc], including gliomas and metastases [^111N89ic]. Non-contrast MRI is reserved for specific scenarios, such as when contrast is contraindicated [^111fVBGm] or for low-grade gliomas.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended MRI protocol** |
|-|-|
| Initial diagnosis and characterization | MRI with and without contrast |
| Treatment planning | MRI with and without contrast |
| Monitoring treatment response and recurrence | MRI with and without contrast |
| Contraindications to contrast | MRI without contrast (advanced sequences) |
| Low-grade gliomas | MRI without contrast (advanced sequences) |

---

MRI with contrast is the standard for brain tumor imaging, providing superior detection, characterization, and treatment planning [^116wmHE8]. Non-contrast MRI is used when contrast is contraindicated or for low-grade gliomas, often with advanced sequences [^111Kvjx5].

### Recommendations on the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents in the diagnosis and monitoring of common adult intracranial tumours [^111fVBGm]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) have been indispensable in intracranial tumour imaging, particularly for detecting and characterising malignant lesions, as well as assessing treatment response and disease progression. However, growing concerns about gadolinium deposition in the central nervous system and its environmental impact have prompted a re-evaluation of its use, particularly in the management of benign or stable lesions. This review examines the role of GBCAs in imaging the most common types of intracranial tumours, including gliomas, meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, cranial nerve tumours, and metastases.

Recent advancements in high-field MRI scanners and the increasing adoption of 3D T2-weighted sequences, which provide excellent soft-tissue contrast, offer significant opportunities to minimise or eliminate GBCA use. Moreover, advanced MRI methods, such as arterial spin labelling for perfusion imaging and the obtention of synthetic images, have emerged as non-invasive alternatives that further enable contrast-free imaging. Finally, the development of ultra-high-relaxivity contrast agents offers the potential to reduce doses when GBCAs are required. While GBCAs remain essential for imaging certain high-grade gliomas and complex tumour cases, alternative imaging techniques can often replace them in many benign or stable lesions, ensuring diagnostic accuracy and prioritising patient safety.

This review highlights strategies to optimise GBCA use, focusing on reducing reliance on GBCAs across different intracranial tumour types.

### Diagnostic value of alternative techniques to gadolinium-based contrast agents in MR neuroimaging-a comprehensive overview [^111Kvjx5]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) increase lesion detection and improve disease characterization for many cerebral pathologies investigated with MRI. These agents, introduced in the late 1980s, are in wide use today. However, some non-ionic linear GBCAs have been associated with the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with kidney failure. Gadolinium deposition has also been found in deep brain structures, although it is of unclear clinical relevance. Hence, new guidelines from the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine advocate cautious use of GBCA in clinical and research practice. Some linear GBCAs were restricted from use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2017. This review focuses on non-contrast-enhanced MRI techniques that can serve as alternatives for the use of GBCAs.

Clinical studies on the diagnostic performance of non-contrast-enhanced as well as contrast-enhanced MRI methods, both well established and newly proposed, were included. Advantages and disadvantages together with the diagnostic performance of each method are detailed. Non-contrast-enhanced MRIs discussed in this review are arterial spin labeling (ASL), time of flight (TOF), phase contrast (PC), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), and amide proton transfer (APT) imaging. Ten common diseases were identified for which studies reported comparisons of non-contrast-enhanced and contrast-enhanced MRI. These specific diseases include primary brain tumors, metastases, abscess, multiple lesions.

- **Question**: What is the optimal imaging technique to be used in the diagnosis of a suspected low grade glioma? Specifically, which anatomic imaging sequences are critical for most accurately identifying or diagnosing a low grade glioma (LGG), and do non-anatomic imaging methods and/or sequences add to the diagnostic specificity of suspected low grade gliomas?

- **Target population**: These recommendations apply to adults with a newly diagnosed lesion with a suspected or histopathologically proven LGG.

- **Level II**: In patients with a suspected brain tumor, the minimum magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam should be an anatomic exam with both T2 weighted and pre- and post-gadolinium contrast enhanced T1 weighted imaging. Critical imaging for the identification and diagnosis of low grade glioma includes:
	- **Level II**: In patients with a suspected brain tumor, anatomic imaging sequences should include T1 and T2 weighted and Fluid Attenuation Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) MR sequences, and will include T1 weighted imaging after the administration of gadolinium based contrast. Computed tomography (CT) can provide additional information regarding calcification or hemorrhage, which may narrow the differential diagnosis. At a minimum, these anatomic sequences can help identify a lesion, its location, and potential for surgical intervention.

### From dose reduction to contrast maximization: Can deep learning amplify the impact of contrast media on brain magnetic resonance image quality? A reader study [^111TfG8b]. Investigative Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate a deep learning method designed to increase the contrast-to-noise ratio in contrast-enhanced gradient echo T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions. The processed images are quantitatively evaluated in terms of lesion detection performance.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 250 multiparametric brain MRIs, acquired between November 2019 and March 2021 at Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus (Villejuif, France), were considered for inclusion in this retrospective monocentric study. Independent training (107 cases; age, 55 ± 14 years; 58 women) and test (79 cases; age, 59 ± 14 years; 41 women) samples were defined. Patients had glioma, brain metastasis, meningioma, or no enhancing lesion. Gradient echo and turbo spin echo with variable flip angles postcontrast T1 sequences were acquired in all cases. For the cases that formed the training sample, "low-dose" postcontrast gradient echo T1 images using 0.025 mmol/kg injections of contrast agent were also acquired. A deep neural network was trained to synthetically enhance the low-dose T1 acquisitions, taking standard-dose T1 MRI as reference. Once trained, the contrast enhancement network was used to process the test gradient echo T1 images. A read was then performed by two experienced neuroradiologists to evaluate the original and processed T1 MRI sequences in terms of contrast enhancement and lesion detection performance, taking the turbo spin echo sequences as reference.

- **Results**: The processed images were superior to the original gradient echo and reference turbo.

### Clinical 7 tesla magnetic resonance imaging: Impact and patient value in neurological disorders [^112sXFq5]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The increased magnetic field strength of 7 T MRI enables more detailed visualization of fine structures, such as tumor margins, microvasculature, small lesions, microbleeds, and subtle anatomical changes that might be missed at conventional field strengths. This is particularly useful for identifying early signs of tumor growth or recurrence and for detailed mapping of tumor-associated vasculature.

Compared to 3 T, 7 T can provide greater contrast between healthy white matter and glioblastoma tissue, with enhanced visualization of tumor infiltration into adjacent white matter tracts and improved demarcation of tumor boundaries. The improved delineation of tumor borders can help spare more healthy brain tissue. Incorporating 7 T MRI into neurosurgical navigation and radiotherapy treatment planning is technically feasible and safe.

- **Swi and dwi techniques**: These are instrumental in analyzing brain structures such as microbleeds and tumor vasculature, aiding in preoperative tumor grading, tumor microstructure characterization, and visualizing radiation therapy injuries.

Glioma diagnosis traditionally requires histopathological analysis, with MRI providing grade estimation based on contrast enhancement, which has limitations. Imaging techniques such as SWI are particularly useful in visualizing neovascularization in malignant gliomas and venous structures and have the potential to improve accuracy. Longitudinal studies using 7 T SWI have tracked tumor vasculature changes during anti-angiogenic therapy, highlighting changes in brain edema, microhemorrhages, and intratumoral changes.

### Vcam-1-targeted MRI improves detection of the tumor-brain interface [^115tNnLv]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Low credibility.

We have previously shown that VCAM-1–targeted MRI enables early detection of micrometastases in the brain and that preliminary data in human samples of brain metastases indicated VCAM-1 upregulation at the invasive margin. From these observations, we proposed that this technique might also enhance detection of the tumor-brain interface of more advanced brain tumors.

To test this hypothesis, we used xenograft models induced through direct intracerebral injection of human-derived MDA231Br-GFP or U87MG tumor cells. The U87MG cell line has been well-characterized as a model for human glioblastoma. It has been shown to display a distinct invasive pattern with in vitro systems, with prominent cellular protrusions. However, the limitations of the U87MG model in vivo have also been widely reported, as it lacks a diffusely infiltrative cellular pattern at the tumor margin and, therefore, does not fully replicate the tumor-brain interface typically seen in human glioblastoma.

In the study, however, we observed that the U87MG intracranial model produced highly proliferative tumors with a disrupted tumor border, characterized by finger-like projections and isolated tumor clusters separated from the tumor bulk. Importantly, even with a less infiltrative pattern of invasion, we demonstrated that the VCAM-MPIO imaging was able to detect the tumor-brain interface more sensitively than gadolinium contrast-enhanced MRI. Moreover, the presence of upregulated endothelial VCAM-1 in close association with the tumor front in human glioblastoma tissue provides confidence that VCAM-MPIO MRI has a significant role in detecting the tumor-brain interface.

### Preoperative prediction of diffuse glioma type and grade in adults: A gadolinium-free MRI-based decision tree [^112ALQEN]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA)-enhanced MRI is the standard imaging modality for managing brain tumors, including adult-type diffuse gliomas, aiding diagnosis and treatment decisions. Nonetheless, enhancement is an imperfect measure for both tumor malignancy and resectability of tumor borders. Tumors displaying enhancement may not always be high-grade gliomas; conversely, high-grade gliomas may lack enhancement. This conflict is acknowledged in the latest Response Assessment in Neuro-oncology criteria (RANO 2.0), which also stresses the diagnostic relevance of GBCA-free sequences.

While being a standard imaging practice, GBCA increasingly raises concerns about associated side effects, with safety recommendations relying solely on expert opinion rather than prospective experimental evidence. Although certain linear GBCAs were restricted due to their link with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, renal impairment remains the primary catalyst for this condition, with uncertainty about whether normal renal function excludes the risk. With uncertain clinical implications, GBCA, mainly in linear forms, was also identified to accumulate in the body. Furthermore, studies indicate anthropogenic medical gadolinium accumulation in ecosystems, raising concerns about aquatic life and urban water safety. Beyond these challenges, longer examination times, increased financial costs, and limited availability in low-middle-income countries are stimuli to the shift from GBCA-enhanced MRI to GBCA-free MRI. Additionally, vulnerable populations, such as pregnant or breastfeeding individuals, face increased concerns.

### Optimizing contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging characterization of brain metastases: Relevance to stereotactic radiosurgery [^111eF6oi]. Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

Intracranial metastases are the most common form of intra-axial brain tumor. Management approaches to brain metastases include surgical resection, whole-brain radiotherapy, and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The management approach that is typically selected is based on algorithms incorporating the number, size, and location of lesions. SRS is the treatment of choice when metastases detected on imaging are few (maximum, 3–5) and/or of small size (≤ 30 mm), offering advantages of noninvasiveness and the ability to treat inaccessible lesions compared with surgical resection.

Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the standard imaging technique for determining the number, size, and location of metastatic lesions. In SRS, the capability of MRI to delineate lesion borders precisely in three dimensions helps reduce recurrence rates and minimize radiation necrosis in surrounding tissue. Optimization of the MRI protocol, including selecting the appropriate gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA), is paramount for accurate lesion imaging.

GBCAs differ in their safety, tolerability, and efficacy due to their diverse physicochemical properties. Gadobutrol and gadobenate dimeglumine are high-relaxivity GBCAs that demonstrate superior efficacy for imaging metastatic lesions compared with other GBCAs, with gadobutrol additionally providing macrocyclic stability. This article reviews recent comparative trials of GBCAs and discusses their relevance for optimizing MRI protocols in the management of brain metastases, with particular relevance to SRS.

### Review and consensus recommendations on clinical APT-weighted imaging approaches at 3T: Application to brain tumors [^114cbm88]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2022).

Although APTw imaging is useful for brain tumor evaluation, there are pitfalls for APTw image interpretation. In addition to artifacts caused by motion and B0 alterations, areas of large liquefactive necrosis, hemorrhage, or large vessels typically demonstrate high APTw signals and should not be mistaken for viable tumor tissue. Figure 10 provides several representative images of liquefactive necrosis and hemorrhage at different stages.

Careful interpretation is needed with post-operative-stage tumors where the surgical cavity is filled with proteinaceous fluid, unless a fluid suppression method is used (Figure 10C and D). To distinguish between viable tumor and proteinaceous fluid, APTw images should generally be interpreted together with anatomic MRI (such as T2w, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and pre- and post-contrast T1w), SWI, diffusion, and perfusion (including dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced and dynamic contrast-enhanced) MRI sequences that are acquired during routine clinical tumor protocols. This comparison helps, on the one hand, to recognize and assign non-tumorous signals and potential artifacts on APTw images, and, on the other hand, to identify tumor viability characteristics, which are not captured by the structural and perfusion-weighted MRI (Figure 10D).

The information provided by APTw MRI should be regarded as complementary to existing approaches, further extending the repertoire of diagnostic tools in radiology. Finally, and importantly, the selection of the color scheme in the APTw images can affect the interpretability of the information contained.

### How often are nonenhancing supratentorial gliomas malignant? A population study [^114gfoLc]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

The presence of contrast enhancement in a brain tumor is often regarded as a sign of malignancy. The authors identified 314 patients with malignant and low-grade supratentorial glial neoplasms in an unselected population, 58 of which lacked contrast enhancement on preoperative neuroimaging. Nonenhancing gliomas were malignant in approximately one-third of cases, especially in older patients. Histologic confirmation of the diagnosis is therefore important in all patients suspected of harboring a primary glial neoplasm.

### Detection of small metastatic brain tumors: comparison of 3d contrast-enhanced whole-brain black-blood imaging and MP-RAGE imaging [^111tgQB5]. Investigative Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Early and accurate diagnosis of small metastatic brain tumors may affect outcomes and treatment strategies. For this reason, three-dimensional (3D) thin-section imaging is preferred. However, with conventional contrast-enhanced (CE) 3D imaging, such as magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE), many visually enhanced vessels may mimic small metastatic tumors, hindering tumor detection. CE black-blood single-slab 3D turbo-spin echo imaging (BB-ssTSE) was recently developed, which uses variable refocusing flip angles and flow-sensitizing gradient schemes to enhance metastatic brain tumors while selectively suppressing blood vessels. The purpose of this work was to investigate the efficiency of the proposed CE BB-ssTSE in detecting small metastatic brain tumors as compared with conventional MP-RAGE.

Numerical comparisons of MP-RAGE and BB-ssTSE were performed through simulation studies to investigate the signal/contrast behaviors of flowing blood and stationary CE tumors. For in vivo studies, we enrolled 35 patients (18 women; mean age, 58.1 years) with breast or lung cancer who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging. After administering a double dose of contrast medium, whole-brain two-dimensional T1-weighted imaging followed by high-resolution isotropic 3D BB-ssTSE and MP-RAGE was performed at 3.0 T. Two reviewers independently evaluated the presence of metastatic brain tumors using:

1. MP-RAGE
2. BB-ssTSE
3. MP-RAGE + BB-ssTSE sequentially in three review sessions, two weeks apart.

The lesions were classified by size into two groups.

### Dynamic susceptibility-contrast magnetic resonance imaging with contrast agent leakage correction aids in predicting grade in pediatric brain tumours: A multicenter study [^113DuJJC]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) measured using dynamic susceptibility-contrast MRI can differentiate between low- and high-grade pediatric brain tumors. Multicenter studies are required for translation into clinical practice.

- **Objective**: We compared leakage-corrected dynamic susceptibility-contrast MRI perfusion parameters acquired at multiple centers in low- and high-grade pediatric brain tumors.

- **Materials and methods**: Eighty-five pediatric patients underwent pre-treatment dynamic susceptibility-contrast MRI scans at four centers. MRI protocols were variable. We analyzed data using the Boxerman leakage-correction method, producing pixel-by-pixel estimates of leakage-uncorrected (rCBV uncorr) and corrected (rCBV corr) relative cerebral blood volume, and the leakage parameter, K2. Histological diagnoses were obtained. Tumors were classified by high-grade tumor. We compared whole-tumor median perfusion parameters between low- and high-grade tumors and across tumor types.

- **Results**: Forty tumors were classified as low grade, and 45 as high grade. Mean whole-tumor median rCBV uncorr was higher in high-grade tumors than in low-grade tumors (mean ± standard deviation [SD] = 2.37 ± 2.61 vs. -0.14 ± 5.55; P < 0.01). Average median rCBV increased following leakage correction (2.54 ± 1.63 vs. 1.68 ± 1.36; P = 0.010), remaining higher in high-grade tumors than in low-grade tumors. Low-grade tumors, particularly pilocytic astrocytomas, showed T1-dominant leakage effects; high-grade tumors showed T2✱-dominance (mean K2 = 0.017 ± 0.049 vs. 0.002 ± 0.017). Parameters varied with tumor type.

### High-relaxivity contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance neuroimaging: A review [^1156pFUw]. European Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Evaluation of brain lesions using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides information that is critical for accurate diagnosis, prognosis, therapeutic intervention, and monitoring response. Conventional contrast-enhanced MR neuroimaging using gadolinium (Gd) contrast agents primarily depicts disruption of the blood-brain barrier, demonstrating the location and extent of disease, as well as the morphological details at the lesion site. However, conventional imaging results do not always accurately predict tumor aggressiveness.

Advanced functional MRI techniques, such as dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion-weighted imaging, utilize contrast agents to convey physiological information regarding the hemodynamics and neoangiogenic status of the lesion, which is often complementary to anatomical information obtained through conventional imaging. Most Gd contrast agents available have similar T1 and T2 relaxivities, and thus their contrast-enhancing capabilities are comparable. Exceptions are gadobenate-dimeglumine, Gd-EOB-DTPA, gadobutrol, and gadofosveset, which, owing to their transient-protein-binding capability, possess almost twice the T1 and T2 relaxivities as other agents at all magnetic field strengths.

Numerous comparative studies have demonstrated the advantages of the increased relaxivity in terms of enhanced image contrast, image quality, and diagnostic confidence. Here, we summarize the benefits of higher relaxivity for the most common neuroimaging applications, including MRI, perfusion-weighted imaging, and MRA, for the evaluation of brain tumors and cerebrovascular disease.

### Diagnostic value of alternative techniques to gadolinium-based contrast agents in MR neuroimaging: A comprehensive overview [^113yALKB]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Tumor extent and detection

Brain tumor detection and characterization is an area where contrast-enhanced MRI is frequently used. However, since the first report on the application of contrast-enhanced MRI, techniques for non-contrast-enhanced MRI have evolved. As tumor localization and extent are two essential issues in pre-operative brain tumor imaging, non-contrast-enhanced MRI should be able to detect and localize primary brain tumors. This can be achieved by, for example, T2 FLAIR imaging showing high signal intensity in low-grade gliomas. In high-grade gliomas, increased signal on T2 FLAIR can encompass tumor edema with tumor cells. Imaging-histology correlation data show that primary malignant brain tumors rarely have surrounding edema without interspersed tumor cells outside the contrast-enhanced area. Compared to contrast-enhanced MRI, diffusion imaging can better depict the perifocal tumor density and effects on surrounding white matter tracts. Further issues in brain tumor imaging relate to the characterization of tumor type and malignancy grade. It is known that the contrast enhancement is an imperfect marker of malignancy grade. In comparison to primary brain tumors, cerebral metastases can be multiple and small, with a potential increased lesion detection rate by the use of GBCAs.

Although it may be feasible to exclude the use of GBCA without limiting the ability to detect primary brain tumors, imaging of secondary brain tumors cannot be performed without GBCA. One study reported that 20% of cerebral metastases were undetected on pre-contrast echo-planar imaging.

### Effect of contrast leakage on the detection of abnormal brain tumor vasculature in high-grade glioma [^1155GFrE]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Abnormal brain tumor vasculature has recently been highlighted by a dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI processing technique. This technique uses independent component analysis (ICA) to separate arterial and venous perfusion. The overlap of the two, i.e. arterio-venous overlap (AVOL), preferentially occurs in brain tumors and predicts response to anti-angiogenic therapy. However, the effects of contrast agent leakage on the AVOL biomarker have yet to be established.

DSC was acquired during two separate contrast boluses in ten patients undergoing clinical imaging for brain tumor diagnosis. Three components were modeled with ICA, including the arterial and venous components. The percentage of each component, as well as a third component, was determined within the contrast-enhancing tumor and compared. AVOL within enhancing tumors was also compared between doses. The percentage of enhancing tumor classified as neither arterial nor venous, instead falling into a third component with contrast agent leakage apparent in the time-series, was significantly greater for the first contrast dose compared to the second. The amount of AVOL detected within enhancing tumors was also significantly greater with the second dose compared to the first.

Contrast leakage results in large signal variance classified as a separate component by the ICA algorithm. The use of a second dose mitigates this effect and allows measurement of AVOL within enhancement.

### Diagnostic value of alternative techniques to gadolinium-based contrast agents in MR neuroimaging-a comprehensive overview [^111DEECC]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

In this review, we have summarized data on how non-contrast-enhanced MRI can detect and characterize pathology in at least ten specific diseases, with a diagnostic performance comparable to contrast-enhanced MRI for specific clinical questions. Although we acknowledge that GBCA can increase lesion detection (sensitivity), the specificity in lesion characterization by contrast-enhanced MRI is often lower compared to other, more advanced MR sequences. In fact, the high sensitivity and low specificity can mislead clinical decisions. Contrast agent injection, used to achieve a high lesion-to-background contrast, is relatively less important in MRI compared to CT, which inherently has much higher soft tissue contrast.

In general, the data summarized in this review showed the lowest diagnostic performance for static GBCA MRI, such as contrast-enhanced T1, but higher performance for dynamic GBCA MRI, such as DSC perfusion. This highlights the importance of depicting physiological properties of GBCA injection, such as tissue perfusion, to increase diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice.

### State-of-the-art imaging for glioma surgery [^115FNm44]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Low credibility.

Discussion

How can imaging aid glioma surgery? Gliomas are typically widespread in the brain by the time of diagnosis, which precludes a curative resection. Nonetheless, there is accumulating evidence that removing a greater portion of the tumor improves progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). As glioma is an infiltrative disease, macroscopic recognition of the tumor within the normal brain is very difficult. Imaging has the potential to visualize the tumor, thereby overcoming macroscopic challenges. Ideally, an imaging modality should not miss any tumor (100% sensitivity) and should show only the tumor (100% specificity). Unfortunately, available imaging is not yet that accurate.

Still, using standard MRI to guide glioma resection has a positive impact on treatment. Intraoperative MRI, fluorescence, and ultrasound can aid in achieving a complete resection of these standard MRI abnormalities. Since gliomas extend beyond standard imaging abnormalities, the next logical step is to extend resection beyond these abnormalities. Evidence is starting to accumulate that other modalities, such as PET and MRSI, or FLAIR MRI in the case of enhancing tumors, could guide these extended resections.

An alternative approach is the use of functional boundaries instead of imaging to guide resection, whereby intraoperative mapping during awake surgery defines the limits of resection. This strategy postpones malignant transformation in low-grade gliomas (LGG). A pitfall of using functional boundaries is the choice of functions to test; removing more of the brain may lead to more deficits, depending on how thoroughly the functions are assessed.

### Improving lesion detection and visualization: Implications for neurosurgical planning and follow-up [^116ju2xB]. Neuroradiology (2007). Low credibility.

Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is considered the most sensitive method for detecting tumors in the central nervous system (CNS). The primary objective is to improve lesion detection, delineation, and characterization (benign or malignant) to more accurately define the location, extent, and type of disease and the appropriate treatment option (surgical intervention, radiation therapy, or cytotoxic chemotherapy) for improved patient outcomes. This article reviews the various types of tumors occurring in the brain and the specific role of contrast-enhanced MR imaging in their evaluation. Emphasis is placed on the value of contrast-enhanced MR imaging in evaluating primary intra-axial brain lesions and how high relaxivity contrast agents such as MultiHance (Bracco Imaging, Milan, Italy) might improve detection, treatment planning, and follow-up.

### Synthetic generation of DSC-MRI-derived relative CBV maps from DCE MRI of brain tumors [^111aAkXp]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Perfusion MRI with gadolinium-based contrast agents is useful for diagnosis and treatment response evaluation of brain tumors. Dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI are two gadolinium-based contrast agent perfusion imaging techniques that provide complementary information about the tumor vasculature. However, each requires a separate administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the feasibility of synthesizing relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps, as computed from DSC MRI, from DCE MRI of brain tumors.

- **Methods**: One hundred nine brain tumor patients underwent both DCE and DSC MRI. Relative CBV maps were computed from the DSC MRI, and blood plasma volume fraction maps were computed from the DCE MRIs. Conditional generative adversarial networks were developed to synthesize rCBV maps from the DCE MRIs. Tumor-to-white matter ratios were calculated from real rCBV, synthetic rCBV, and plasma volume fraction maps and compared using correlation analysis. Real and synthetic rCBV in white and gray matter regions were also compared.

- **Results**: Pearson correlation analysis showed that both the tumor rCBV and tumor-to-white matter ratios in the synthetic and real rCBV maps were strongly correlated (ρ = 0.87, P < .05 and ρ = 0.86, P < .05, respectively). Tumor plasma volume fraction and real rCBV were not strongly correlated (ρ = 0.47). Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean difference between the synthetic and real rCBV tumor-to-white matter ratios of 0.20 with a 95% co.

### Carbonized paramagnetic complexes of Mn (II) as contrast agents for precise magnetic resonance imaging of sub-millimeter-sized orthotopic tumors [^116NA9mu]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

Glioblastoma (GBM) has a median survival rate of 14 months after diagnosis. One major reason is the lack of effective tools for detecting glioma in its early stages when treatment is more effective. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents 98% of small molecules and all large molecules from entering the brain. Currently available MRI contrast agents for the detection of brain tumors, such as Magnevist (Gd-DTPA), are nonspecific and only detect tumor masses that have significantly damaged the BBB. At the early stages of glioma, these agents cannot enhance detection because the BBB has not been significantly damaged.

To address this issue, we developed carbonized paramagnetic complexes of manganese (II) (Mn@CCs) using food additives and amino acids as precursors. Encapsulating Mn²⁺ in sealed carbonized shells achieved superhigh Mn²⁺ stability and r₁ relaxivity (22.1 mM⁻¹ s⁻¹, 9.4 T). In vivo investigations on healthy mice demonstrated that Mn@CCs efficiently crossed the intact BBB via multiphoton intravital imaging. Compared to Gd-DTPA, three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance images and light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) imaging clearly showed that Mn@CCs preferentially target glioma tissues and distribute homogeneously with high penetration in an intracranial mouse model. This delineates clear brain tumor margins and enables precise MRI of microscopic single-nodule brain tumors (approximately 1 mm). Notably, Mn@CCs also efficiently detect multinodular tumors.

### Optimization of workflow for detection of brain metastases at 3T: Is a black-blood MTC prepared 3D T1 used alone robust enough to replace the combination of conventional 3D T1 and the black-blood 3D T1 MTC [^111BHcyb]? Neuroradiology (2023). High credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly contrast-enhanced (CE) three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted (T1w) imaging, is the standard of reference in brain metastases detection due to its excellent soft-tissue contrast. T1w sampling perfection with application-optimized contrasts using different flip angle evolutions (SPACE, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) is a 3D turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence that is inherently black-blood (i.e. saturation of signal from blood vessels due to intravoxel dephasing among blood spins) and has the advantage of a low specific absorption rate and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

The corresponding sequences for other MRI manufacturers are CUBE for General Electric, VISTA/BRAINVIEW for Philips, isoFSE for Hitachi, and 3D MOVX for Canon. Critically, as some slow flow distribution (e.g. in cortical veins) may be inaccurately suppressed, the SPACE sequence often includes an additional black-blood preparation module (e.g. delay alternating with nutation for tailored excitation or DANTE) to optimize blood-related signal suppression.

A magnetization transfer preparation contrast (MTC) can be added to the SPACE sequence to suppress background tissue signals and render CE areas more conspicuous, enabling high sensitivity in detecting secondary brain lesions. The combination of MTC and paramagnetic contrast agents enhances the contrast between enhancing areas (i.e. intracerebral tumors) and surrounding tissue, further improving detection sensitivity for enhancing tumors.

### MRI combined with PET-CT of different tracers to improve the accuracy of glioma diagnosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113gQ25a]. Neurosurgical Review (2019). Low credibility.

The notion that the application of CT and MRI can be used for distinguishing low-grade glioma tumor tissue from peritumoral normal brain tissue has already been recognized. With continuous clinical practice, including enhancement MRI, conventional MRI scans alone have limitations in identifying glioma and glioma grading. Biopsy or surgical resection decisions based solely on MRI information are unreliable. There may be false positive judgments of tumor grading and tumor invasion range, and this is explicitly presented in each study. For example, in T2-weighted FLAIR sequences exhibiting enhanced signal cases, only about half of the cases proved to be actual tumor tissue after biopsy.

There is also a considerable portion of patients with suspected glioma not presenting MRI contrast enhancement, or lacking contrast-enhanced MRI at an early stage. However, final pathologic diagnoses often show high-grade gliomas. For the follow-up evaluation of glioma patients who have undergone multiple treatments, conventional MRI alone is insufficient. At the same time, conventional MRI has its indispensable role. Various studies have shown that combining conventional MRI with PET-CT is more valuable in judging tumor tissue and peritumoral brain tissue.

### Advanced imaging techniques for neuro-oncologic tumor diagnosis, with an emphasis on PET-MRI imaging of malignant brain tumors [^115bq9N6]. Current oncology reports (2021). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging has long been the standard modality for diagnosing and localizing brain tumors, performing stereotactic biopsies, planning surgical resections, and distinguishing post-treatment changes from residual tumors. Conventional MRI sequences include pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted, T2-weighted, T2-based fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and either susceptibility-weighted or gradient echo imaging.

The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group has defined many metrics for tumor analysis in conventional MRI. **Measurable disease** requires a bi-dimensional measurement of a contrast-enhancing lesion with margins that are clearly discernible. These measurements should be perpendicular and at least 10 mm in length, visible on at least two axial slices. **Non-measurable disease** applies to lesions that are less than 10 mm, have unclear surgical margins, or where only a single-dimensional measurement can be made. In 2010, the RANO group added non-enhancing mass-like T2/FLAIR signals as part of the non-measurable criteria.

The RANO criteria have more limited applications when discerning true tumor extent or tumor progression from treatment-related changes. These changes include pseudoprogression, radiation necrosis, and pseudoresponse. Extensive work is being done to overcome the limitations of conventional imaging. The development of perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) is discussed in the following section.

### Human cerebral blood volume measurements using dynamic contrast enhancement in comparison to dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI [^116Bq1E2]. Neuroradiology (2015). Low credibility.

Cerebral blood volume (CBV) is an important parameter for the assessment of brain tumors, usually obtained using dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI. However, this method often suffers from low spatial resolution, high sensitivity to susceptibility artifacts, and usually does not take into account the effect of tissue permeability. The plasma volume (vp) can also be extracted from dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) MRI. The aim of this study was to investigate whether DCE can be used for the measurement of cerebral blood volume in place of DSC for the assessment of patients with brain tumors.

- **Methods**: Twenty-eight subjects (17 healthy subjects and 11 patients with glioblastoma) were scanned using DCE and DSC. Vp and CBV values were measured and compared in different brain components in healthy subjects and in the tumor area in patients.

- **Results**: Significant high correlations were detected between vp and CBV in healthy subjects in the different brain components — white matter, gray matter, and arteries — correlating with the known increased tissue vascularity, and within the tumor area in patients.

- **Conclusion**: This work proposes the use of DCE as an alternative method to DSC for the assessment of blood volume, given the advantages of its higher spatial resolution, its lower sensitivity to susceptibility artifacts, and its ability to provide additional information regarding tissue permeability.

### Dynamic susceptibility-contrast magnetic resonance imaging with contrast agent leakage correction aids in predicting grade in pediatric brain tumours: a multicenter study [^114qLRhy]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Dynamic susceptibility-contrast MRI is a technique to measure perfusion in the brain. It involves the injection of a contrast agent during rapid MRI scanning, resulting in T2- or T2✱-weighted signal changes as the bolus of contrast agent passes through the intravascular space. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) can be calculated by integrating the contrast agent concentration–time curve and is usually reported in tumors as normalized to normal white matter. Relative cerebral blood volume has been shown to be useful for grading pediatric brain tumors, monitoring treatment response, differentiating recurrent/residual tumor from treatment effects, and providing markers of long-term prognosis. Studies are usually performed at a single center, so there is a need to boost study numbers via multicenter studies and demonstrate that the technique is reproducible across sites and scanners to inform its use in clinical practice.

Conversely, to adult brain tumors, many low-grade pediatric brain tumors display significant contrast enhancement on T1-weighted images. Calculation of rCBV assumes that the blood–brain barrier remains intact, which is often not the case in brain tumors. Contrast agent leakage from the intravascular to the extravascular extracellular space results in an increase in MR signal from T1 shortening and underestimation of rCBV. Conversely, T2 and T2✱ effects arise when there are changes in susceptibility differences between tissue compartments, reducing the MR signal so that it does not recover to baseline. This results in overestimation of rCBV.

### Diagnostic value of alternative techniques to gadolinium-based contrast agents in MR neuroimaging-a comprehensive overview [^112ro3EY]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Cerebral abscess and infectious meningitis: Intracranial and cerebral infections are classical indications for contrast-enhanced MRI. However, abscesses and necrotic tumors can have the same appearance and present as ring-enhancing lesions on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. Hence, the exclusive use of contrast-enhanced T1 sequences or contrast-enhanced CT will not help in determining the etiology of the lesion.

A bacterial cerebral abscess can be differentiated from a necrotic or cystic brain tumor by DWI (AUC = 0.96) with higher diagnostic performance than morphological T1 and T2 images; this has also been reported by other groups (AUC for DWI = 1.00). DWI has replaced MRS as the method of choice for differentiating between abscesses and necrotic tumors such as glioblastomas and metastases.

### Multiparametric MRI: Practical approach and pictorial review of a useful tool in the evaluation of brain tumours and tumour-like lesions [^115DZbGx]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

MRI plays a crucial role in the assessment of intracranial lesions. Conventional MRI has limited specificity, whereas multiparametric MRI, which utilizes diffusion-weighted imaging, perfusion-weighted imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, allows for a more accurate assessment of the tissue microenvironment. This educational pictorial review aims to demonstrate the role of multiparametric MRI in diagnosis, treatment planning, and assessing treatment response. It also provides a practical approach for performing and interpreting multiparametric MRI in a clinical setting. A variety of cases are presented to show how multiparametric MRI can help differentiate neoplastic from non-neoplastic lesions, compared to conventional MRI alone.

### Brain tumor segmentation for multi-modal MRI with missing information [^116VZSuN]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have shown promise in brain tumor segmentation from multi-modal MRI sequences, accommodating heterogeneity in tumor shape and appearance. The fusion of multiple MRI sequences allows networks to explore complementary tumor information for segmentation. However, developing a network that maintains clinical relevance in situations where certain MRI sequences might be unavailable or unusual poses a significant challenge.

One solution is to train multiple models with different MRI sequence combinations, but it is impractical to train every model from all possible sequence combinations. In this paper, we propose a DCNN-based brain tumor segmentation framework incorporating a novel sequence dropout technique. This technique trains networks to be robust to missing MRI sequences while employing all other available sequences.

Experiments were performed on the RSNA-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS 2021 Challenge dataset. When all MRI sequences were available, there were no significant differences in the performance of the model with and without dropout for enhanced tumor (ET), tumor (TC), and whole tumor (WT), with p-values of 1.000, 1.000, and 0.799, respectively. This demonstrates that the addition of dropout improves robustness without hindering overall performance.

When key sequences were unavailable, the network with sequence dropout performed significantly better. For example, when tested on only T1, T2, and FLAIR sequences together, the DSC for ET, TC, and WT increased from 0.143 to 0.486, 0.431 to 0.680, and 0.854 to 0.901, respectively. Sequence dropout represents a robust improvement, ensuring better segmentation performance despite missing data.

### Gadavist [^1168Si9b]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Gadavist is a gadolinium-based contrast agent indicated for use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in several contexts:

- **MRI of the central nervous system (CNS)**: Gadavist is indicated for use in adult and pediatric patients, including term neonates, to detect and visualize areas with disrupted blood-brain barrier and/or abnormal vascularity of the central nervous system.

- **MRI of the breast**: Gadavist is indicated for use in adult patients to assess the presence and extent of malignant breast disease.

- **Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)**: Gadavist is indicated for use in adult and pediatric patients, including term neonates, to evaluate known or suspected supra-aortic or renal artery disease.

- **Cardiac MRI (CMRI)**: Gadavist is indicated for use to assess myocardial perfusion (stress, rest) and late gadolinium enhancement in adult patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).

### Vcam-1-targeted MRI improves detection of the tumor-brain interface [^112Ko2er]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Low credibility.

Advancing the existing management of brain tumors will require enhanced imaging techniques for better delineating the tumor-brain interface. In preclinical studies, we have shown that it is possible to augment the sensitivity of MRI for detecting subclinical micrometastases in the brain using a contrast agent based on microparticles of iron oxide (MPIO) targeted against the cell adhesion molecule, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). These data suggest that an invasive, proliferative tumor profile is associated with endothelial VCAM-1 upregulation.

On this basis, we hypothesized that the application of VCAM-1–targeted MRI may enable more sensitive delineation of the tumor-brain interface. Our initial aim, therefore, was to determine whether the tumor-brain interface in rat models of brain metastasis and glioblastoma shows upregulation of VCAM-1. Next, we wanted to assess the sensitivity of VCAM-1–targeted MPIO (VCAM-MPIO) in conjunction with T2✱-weighted MRI for detection of the tumor-brain interface compared with conventional MRI, and further extend this analysis to a xenograft model of medulloblastoma to assess its broader applicability. Finally, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between VCAM-1 upregulation, the tumor margin, and conventional MRI indices in human brain metastasis and glioblastoma samples.

### Application of deep learning for automatic segmentation of brain tumors on magnetic resonance imaging: A heuristic approach in the clinical scenario [^116SdagL]. Neuroradiology (2021). Low credibility.

Accurate brain tumor segmentation on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has wide-ranging applications, such as radiosurgery planning. Advances in artificial intelligence, especially deep learning (DL), allow the development of automatic segmentation that overcomes the labor-intensive and operator-dependent manual segmentation. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the top-performing DL model from the 2018 Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, the impact of missing MRI sequences, and whether a model trained on gliomas can accurately segment other brain tumor types.

We trained the model using the Medical Decathlon dataset, applied it to the BraTS 2019 glioma dataset, and developed additional models using individual and multimodal MRI sequences. The Dice score was calculated to assess the model's accuracy compared to ground truth labels by neuroradiologists on the BraTS dataset. The model was then applied to a local dataset of 105 brain tumors, with performance qualitatively evaluated.

The DL model using pre- and post-gadolinium contrast T1 and T2 FLAIR sequences performed best, with a Dice score of 0.878 for the whole tumor, 0.732 for the tumor core, and 0.699 for the active tumor. The lack of T1 or T2 sequences did not significantly degrade performance, but FLAIR and T1C were important contributors. All segmentations performed by the model in the local dataset, including non-glioma cases, were considered accurate by a pool of specialists.

The DL model could use available MRI sequences to optimize glioma segmentation and adopt transfer learning to segment non-glioma cases effectively.

### Diagnostic value of alternative techniques to gadolinium-based contrast agents in MR neuroimaging: A comprehensive overview [^113mjirV]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

While contrast enhancement in neuroimaging is clinically used to increase sensitivity for detecting abnormalities, its specificity is often lower. Static contrast enhancement cannot differentiate between low-grade and high-grade tumors in adults and children, pseudoprogression and true intracranial tumor progression following radiation therapy, and pseudoresponse versus true response after anti-angiogenic or immunotherapy interventions. This correct definition of treatment response is crucial for selecting optimal patient treatment and preventing premature cessation of an effective treatment. Additional challenges include distinguishing between ring-enhancing metastasis, glioblastoma, abscesses, or indicating low tumor grade in vascularized oligodendroglial tumors. Moreover, contrast enhancement can fail to detect tumor cells infiltrating beyond the contrast-enhancing lesion into the surrounding white matter, as seen in high-grade gliomas.

The diffusion time of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) is often overlooked in clinical practice, potentially impairing the detection of small lesions. Variable detectability also arises from the different sensitivity levels of T1-weighted sequences to T1-shortening effects induced by GBCA. Since contrast enhancement itself is unspecific for disease categorization related to blood-brain barrier disruption, time-resolved MRI techniques using GBCAs have been developed. For instance, MRI perfusion or perfusion-related techniques, such as dynamic susceptibility contrast, are used to improve specificity in these clinical assessments.

### Gadavist [^116hGVbR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Patients referred for MRI of the central nervous system with contrast were enrolled in two clinical trials that evaluated the visualization characteristics of lesions. In both studies, patients underwent a baseline, pre-contrast MRI prior to administration of Gadavist at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg, followed by a post-contrast MRI. In Study A, patients also underwent an MRI before and after the administration of gadoteridol. The studies were designed to demonstrate the superiority of Gadavist MRI to non-contrast MRI for lesion visualization.

- **Study evaluation**: For both studies, pre-contrast and pre-plus-post contrast images (paired images) were independently evaluated by three readers for contrast enhancement and border delineation using a scale of 1 to 4, and for internal morphology using a scale of 1 to 3. Lesion counting was also performed to demonstrate the non-inferiority of paired Gadavist image sets to pre-contrast MRI. Readers were blinded to clinical information.

Efficacy was determined in 657 subjects. The average age was 49 years (range 18 to 85 years) and 42% were male. The ethnic representations were 39% Caucasian, 4% Black, 16% Hispanic, 38% Asian, and 3% of other ethnic groups.

- **Results**: Table 6 shows a comparison of visualization results between paired images and pre-contrast images. Gadavist provided a statistically significant improvement in each of the three lesion visualization parameters when averaged across three independent readers for each study.

### Tryptophan PET predicts spatial and temporal patterns of post-treatment glioblastoma progression detected by contrast-enhanced MRI [^112CKkcw]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Amino acid PET is increasingly utilized for the detection of gliomas. Increased amino acid uptake is often observed outside the contrast-enhancing brain tumor mass. This study evaluated if non-enhancing PET+ regions could predict spatial and temporal patterns of subsequent MRI progression in previously treated glioblastomas. Twelve patients with a contrast-enhancing area suspicious for glioblastoma recurrence on MRI underwent PET scanning with the amino acid radiotracer alpha-[(11)C]-methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT).

Brain regions showing increased AMT uptake, both in and outside the contrast-enhancing volume, were objectively delineated to include high uptake consistent with glioma, as defined by previous studies. The volume and tracer uptake of such non-enhancing PET+ regions were compared to spatial patterns and timing of subsequent progression of the contrast-enhancing lesion, as defined by serial surveillance MRI. Non-enhancing PET+ volumes varied widely across patients and extended up to 24 mm from the edge of MRI contrast enhancement.

In ten patients with clear progression of the contrast-enhancing lesion, the non-enhancing PET+ volumes predicted the location of new enhancement, which extended beyond the PET+ brain tissue in six patients. In two patients without PET+ areas beyond the initial contrast enhancement, MRI remained stable. A negative correlation was observed between AMT uptake in non-enhancing brain regions and time to subsequent progression (r = -0.77, p = 0.003).

Amino acid PET imaging could complement MRI not only for detecting glioma recurrence but also in predicting location and timing of progression.

### Comparative analysis of synthetic and conventional magnetic resonance imaging features across various brain regions [^114whm5S]. European Journal of Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

This study compared the contrast characteristics of synthetic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with conventional MRI in normal brain tissue and tumor-related areas.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis was performed on 60 patients who underwent noncontrast synthetic and conventional MRIs. Synthetic MRI was reconstructed to match conventional MRI parameters using magnetization-prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echoes and multiple spin echo sequences. The contrast in T1-weighted (T1WI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and T2-weighted images (T2WI) was assessed across various brain regions and tumor-related areas. Relaxation times and dynamic range were analyzed, and a five-point visual assessment was conducted for overall image quality.

- **Results**: Synthetic MRI demonstrated significantly higher contrast in T1WI across all normal brain regions and most tumor-related areas (P < 0.01). For FLAIR, synthetic MRI exhibited superior contrast around the putamen (P < 0.05) but showed variable results in other regions. In T2WI, synthetic MRI showed higher contrast overall (P < 0.01), though conventional MRI performed better in some comparisons. Relaxation times of synthetic MRI were generally consistent with literature values but differed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and lesion areas. The dynamic range of synthetic MRI was narrower. Visual assessments showed that synthetic MRI outperformed conventional MRI in all sequences except FLAIR (P < 0.01).

- **Conclusion**: Synthetic MRI provided superior overall image quality for T1WI and T2WI, particularly achieving higher T1WI contrast.

### Double-echo perfusion-weighted MR imaging: Basic concepts and application in brain tumors for the assessment of tumor blood volume and vascular permeability [^116Wh4iY]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging using contrast agents plays a key role in characterizing tumors of the brain. We have shown that double-echo perfusion-weighted MR imaging (DEPWI) is potentially useful in assessing brain tumors. Quantitative indices, such as tumor blood volume, are obtained using DEPWI, which allows correction of underestimation of tumor blood volume due to leakage of contrast agents from tumor vessels, in addition to simultaneous acquisition of tumor vessel permeability. This article describes basic concepts of DEPWI and demonstrates clinical applications in brain tumors.

### Increased delay between gadolinium chelate administration and T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging acquisition increases contrast-enhancing tumor volumes and T1 intensities in brain tumor patients [^116PphnP]. Investigative Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of delayed T1-weighted (T1-w) MRI acquisition after gadolinium chelate administration on brain tumor volumes and T1-w intensities.

- **Materials and methods**: Fifty-five patients with histologically confirmed, contrast-enhancing intra-axial brain tumors were analyzed in this prospective test-retest study. Patients underwent two consecutive 3 T MRI scans (separated by a 1-minute break) during routine follow-up with contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1-w), T2, and FLAIR acquisition. Macrocyclic gadolinium chelate-based contrast agent was only administered before the first ceT1-w acquisition; median latency to ceT1-w acquisition was 6.72 minutes (IQR, 6.53–6.92) in the first and 16.27 minutes (IQR, 15.49–17.26) in the second scan. Changes in tumor volumes and relative ceT1-w intensities between the two acquisitions were quantitatively assessed following semiautomated tumor segmentation, separately for contrast-enhancement (CE), necrosis (NEC), and nonenhancing (NE) tumor.

- **Results**: Semiautomatically segmented CE tumor volumes were significantly larger in the second acquisition (median +32% [1.2 cm]; IQR, 16%-62%; P < 0.01), which corresponded to a 10% increase in CE tumor diameter (+0.3 cm). Contrarily, NEC and NE tumor volumes were significantly smaller (median -24% [IQR, -36% to -54%], P < 0.01 for NEC and -2% [IQR, -1% to -3%], P = 0.02 for NE tumor). Bland-Altman plots confirmed a proportional bias toward higher CE and lower NEC volumes for the second ceT1-w acquisition. Relative ceT1-w intensities for both early-acquisition and late-acquisition regions were evaluated; however, the text is incomplete here.

### Validation of a semi-automatic co-registration of MRI scans in patients with brain tumors during treatment follow-up [^113tdKNK]. NMR in Biomedicine (2016). Low credibility.

There is an expanding research interest in high-grade gliomas because of their significant population burden and poor survival despite the extensive standard multimodal treatment. One of the obstacles is the lack of individualized monitoring of tumor characteristics and treatment response before, during, and after treatment. We have developed a two-stage semi-automatic method to co-register MRI scans at different time points before and after surgical and adjuvant treatment of high-grade gliomas.

- **Linear co-registration**: This stage involves a linear co-registration of the semi-automatically derived mask of the preoperative contrast-enhancing area or postoperative resection cavity, brain contour, and ventricles between different time points. The resulting transformation matrix was then applied in a non-linear manner to co-register conventional contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images.

- **Targeted registration errors**: Targeted registration errors were calculated and compared with linear and non-linear co-registered images. Targeted registration errors were smaller for the semi-automatic non-linear co-registration compared with both the non-linear and linear co-registered images. This was further visualized using a three-dimensional structural similarity method.

The semi-automatic non-linear co-registration allowed for optimal correction of the variable brain shift at different time points, as evaluated by the minimal targeted registration error. This proposed method allows for the accurate evaluation of the treatment response, which is essential for the growing research area of brain tumor imaging and treatment response evaluation.

### Diagnostic value of alternative techniques to gadolinium-based contrast agents in MR neuroimaging-a comprehensive overview [^1131Jndq]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

In the follow-up of patients treated with surgery and/or radiochemotherapy for brain tumors, the updated Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria consider not only contrast enhancement but also progression of T2 FLAIR changes.

- **Pseudoprogression and pseudoresponse**: These are challenging entities for the neuroradiologist when evaluating post-therapeutic intracranial tumors on contrast-enhanced MRI. Non-contrast-enhanced MRI techniques that have shown promise in depicting and discriminating between treatment-related changes and tumor progression include ASL (AUC = 0.84), APTw, intravoxel incoherent motion imaging (AUC = 0.94–0.95), diffusion tensor imaging (AUC = 0.84), and MRS (AUC = 0.91).

- **Recent studies**: One study showed how quantitative T1 mapping (without GBCA) can monitor GBM during bevacizumab treatment. Another study utilizing non-contrast-enhanced texture analysis showed high diagnostic performance in differentiating between re-tumor and treatment-related changes, with an AUC of 0.79 compared to 0.57 for contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging.

- **MRS and ASL insights**: MRS has shown promise in discriminating between tumor recurrence and treatment-related changes by measuring elevated choline. More surprisingly, in patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, ASL post-radiotherapy shows high CBF in patients with pseudoprogression. Identifying signs of pseudoprogression is crucial, as the misinterpretation of contrast enhancement as progressive disease might lead to the discontinuation of therapy.

### Detection of brain metastases by contrast-enhanced MRI: Comparison of gadopiclenol and gadobenate in a mouse model [^115uGSWs]. Investigative Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Among the 41 animals, 14 mice did not develop detectable tumors, and 9 mice died after the injection of tumor cells or from anesthesia during the imaging procedure. A total of 18 mice met the criteria for inclusion (n = 6 in each group).

A total of 47 enhancing lesions (1 to 7 per animal) were detected in the 18 mice during the blinded analysis of the MR images approximately 4 weeks after cell injection. Brain lesions were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 4 randomly chosen mice to characterize the metastases and confirm the detected contrast enhancement areas.

### Comparison of gadoterate meglumine and gadobutrol in the MRI diagnosis of primary brain tumors: A double-blind randomized controlled intraindividual crossover study (the REMIND study) [^114mt3w6]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Effective management of patients with brain tumors depends on accurate detection and characterization of lesions. This study aimed to demonstrate the noninferiority of gadoterate meglumine versus gadobutrol for overall visualization and characterization of primary brain tumors.

- **Materials and methods**: This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled intraindividual, crossover, noninferiority study included 279 patients. Both contrast agents (dose = 0.1 mmol/kg of body weight) were assessed with two identical MRIs at a time interval of 2–14 days. The primary endpoint was overall lesion visualization and characterization, scored independently by three off-site readers on a 4-point scale, ranging from "poor" to "excellent". Secondary endpoints were qualitative assessments (lesion border delineation, internal morphology, degree of contrast enhancement, diagnostic confidence), quantitative measurements (signal intensity), and safety (adverse events). All qualitative assessments were also performed on-site.

- **Results**: For all three readers, images of most patients (> 90%) were scored good or excellent for overall lesion visualization and characterization with either contrast agent, and the noninferiority of gadoterate meglumine versus gadobutrol was statistically demonstrated. No significant differences were observed between the two contrast agents regarding qualitative endpoints, despite quantitative mean lesion percentage enhancement being higher with gadobutrol.

### Effect of contrast dose and field strength in the magnetic resonance detection of brain metastases [^1174o2FK]. Investigative Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

To compare the diagnostic efficacy of a standard and cumulative triple dose of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contrast agent in the evaluation of brain metastases, a study was conducted using a high-field 3.0 T MR unit versus a standard field 1.5 T MR unit. Twenty-two patients with suspected brain metastases were examined at both field strengths using identical postcontrast coronal 3D gradient echo with magnetization preparation, which was adjusted separately for each field strength. In both groups initially, an intravenous injection of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight gadolinium chelate (gadodiamide) was administered, followed by 0.2 mmol/kg body weight gadodiamide. Subjective assessment of the images was performed independently by three neuroradiologists, and objective measurement of signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios was obtained.

- **Results**: The subjective assessment of cumulative triple-dose 3.0 T images yielded the best results compared with other sequences, detecting 84 metastases, followed by 1.5 T cumulative triple-dose enhanced images with 81 brain metastases. The objective assessment confirmed these results, showing significantly higher signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios with 3.0 T than with 1.5 T.

- **Conclusions**: Cumulative triple-dose images of both field strengths were superior to standard field strengths. However, the administration of gadodiamide contrast agent produced higher contrast between tumor and normal brain on 3.0 T than on 1.5 T, resulting in better detection of brain metastases and leptomeningeal involvement.

### Spinal-QDCNN: Advanced feature extraction for brain tumor detection using MRI images [^115s9r3Y]. European Spine Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Brain tumors occur due to the abnormal development of cells in the brain, adversely affecting human health. Early diagnosis is crucial to improving patient survival rates. Consequently, various brain tumor detection models have been developed. However, existing methods often suffer from limited accuracy and inefficient learning architectures. Traditional approaches cannot effectively detect small and subtle changes in brain cells.

To overcome these limitations, a SpinalNet-Quantum Dilated Convolutional Neural Network (Spinal-QDCNN) model is proposed for detecting brain tumors using MRI images. The Spinal-QDCNN method is developed by combining QDCNN and SpinalNet. Initially, the input brain image undergoes pre-processing using Region of Interest (RoI) extraction, followed by image enhancement using thresholding transformation. This is followed by segmentation using Projective Adversarial Networks (PAN).

During the image augmentation phase, processes such as random erasing, flipping, and resizing are applied. Next, feature extraction takes place, where statistical features such as average contrast, kurtosis, skewness, mean, Gabor wavelet features, and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with Gradient Binary Pattern (GBP) are extracted. Finally, detection is performed using Spinal-QDCNN.

Moreover, the proposed method achieved a maximum accuracy of 86.356%, sensitivity of 87.37%, and specificity of 88.357%.

### Brain tumour post-treatment imaging and treatment-related complications [^116TXYf4]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Brain tumour imaging techniques

Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI imaging is the workhorse of brain tumour imaging. It is easy to perform and accurately depicts the margins of most brain metastases and dural-based lesions. However, it is not as reliable for primary brain neoplasms, particularly gliomas, because these tumours often demonstrate non-enhancing or infiltrative components (Fig. 1). In these cases, T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging is often the sequence of choice as it clearly delineates abnormal signal from normal brain parenchyma. Low-grade gliomas rarely exhibit vasogenic oedema, and therefore T2 FLAIR imaging can be particularly accurate in delineating tumour extent. However, with high-grade gliomas, T2 FLAIR imaging has limitations in that it cannot reliably differentiate infiltrating tumour from vasogenic oedema as both are hyperintense on T2 FLAIR sequences. Therefore, advanced imaging techniques are often relied upon to further differentiate residual tumour from post-treatment changes. The most common advanced imaging techniques include diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), and MR spectroscopy. Individually, none of these techniques have proven very specific; however, a thoughtful synthesis using all of them can usually allow the radiologist to correctly separate tumour from post-treatment changes.

### High-resolution contrast-enhanced, susceptibility-weighted MR imaging at 3T in patients with brain tumors: Correlation with positron-emission tomography and histopathologic findings [^11496z7E]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2007). High credibility.

The purpose of this work was to demonstrate susceptibility effects (SusE) in various types of brain tumors with high-resolution (HR) contrast-enhanced (CE) susceptibility-weighted (SW) MR imaging at 3T, and to correlate these effects with positron-emission tomography (PET) and histopathology.

Eighteen patients with brain tumors, who were scheduled for biopsy or tumor removal, underwent high-field (3T) MR imaging. All patients had an axial T1-spin-echo (SE) sequence and an HR-SW imaging sequence performed before and after intravenous application of a standard dose of the contrast agent MultiHance. Seven of these patients also underwent PET preoperatively. The frequency and formation of intralesional SusE in all images were evaluated and correlated with tumor grade as determined by PET and histopathology. A direct correlation of SusE with histopathologic specimens was performed in six patients. Contrast enhancement of the lesions was assessed in both imaging sequences.

High-grade lesions showed either a high or medium frequency of SusE in 90% of the patients. In contrast, low-grade lesions demonstrated a low frequency of SusE or no SusE at all. The correlation between the frequency of intralesional SusE and tumor grading, both histopathologically and via PET, was statistically significant. Contrast enhancement was equally visible in both SW and SE sequences. A side-to-side comparison of tumor areas with a high frequency of SusE and histopathology revealed that intralesional SusE reflected conglomerates of increased tumor microvascularity.

### The optimal use of contrast agents at high field MRI [^115DrdVG]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The intravenous administration of a standard dose of conventional gadolinium-based contrast agents produces higher contrast between the tumor and normal brain at 3.0 Tesla (T) than at 1.5 T, allowing a reduction in the dose to half of the standard one to produce similar contrast at 3.0 T compared to 1.5 T. The assessment of cumulative triple-dose 3.0 T images obtained the best results in the detection of brain metastases compared to other sequences.

The contrast agent dose for dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging at 3.0 T can be reduced to 0.1 mmol compared to 0.2 mmol at 1.5 T due to the increased susceptibility effects at higher magnetic field strengths. Contrast agent application makes susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) at 3.0 T clinically attractive, with an increase in spatial resolution within the same scan time. Whereas a double dose of conventional gadolinium-based contrast agents was optimal in SWI with respect to sensitivity and image quality, a standard dose of gadobenate dimeglumine, which has a two-fold higher T1-relaxivity in blood, produced the same effect.

For MR-arthrography, optimized concentrations of gadolinium-based contrast agents are similar at 3.0 and 1.5 T. In summary, high field MRI requires the optimization of the contrast agent dose in different clinical applications.

### Dynamic magnetic resonance perfusion imaging of brain tumors [^117FfBZF]. The Oncologist (2004). Low credibility.

In this paper, we review the technique of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion imaging of brain neoplasms, with an emphasis on its clinical applications and utility. We start with a discussion of MR perfusion techniques available today and their relative merits and shortcomings. Next, we examine the ability of MR perfusion to provide a preoperative assessment of tumor histology. We also discuss the role of MR perfusion in helping guide tumor biopsy and its advantages over more conventional methods.

We scrutinize the use of MR perfusion for assessing true lesion extent in contrast to conventional MR imaging and other MR techniques. Further, we discuss the role of MR perfusion in differentiating treatment effects, such as radiation necrosis, from tumor recurrence. Finally, we address the future potential applications of this technology in the context of novel antiangiogenic therapies for brain tumors.

### Improved brain tumor conspicuity at 3 T using dark blood, fat-suppressed, Dixon unbalanced T1 relaxation-enhanced steady-state MRI [^11114ucX]. Investigative Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the cornerstone for brain tumor diagnosis and treatment planning. We have developed a novel dual-echo volumetric dark blood pulse sequence called Dixon unbalanced T1 relaxation-enhanced steady-state (uT1 RESS) that improves the visibility of contrast-enhancing lesions while suppressing the tissue signals from blood vessels and fat. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that Dixon uT1 RESS would significantly improve the conspicuity of brain tumors compared with magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE), as well as to determine potential limitations of the technique.

This retrospective study was approved by the hospital institutional review board. Forty-seven adult patients undergoing an MRI scan for a brain tumor indication were included. Contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain was performed at 3 T using both MPRAGE and Dixon uT1 RESS. To control for any impact of contrast agent washout during the scan procedure, Dixon uT1 RESS was acquired in approximately half the subjects immediately after MPRAGE, and in the other half immediately before MPRAGE. Image quality, artifacts, and lesion detection were scored by three readers, whereas lesion apparent signal-to-noise ratio and lesion-to-background Weber contrast were calculated from region-of-interest measurements.

Image quality was not rated significantly different between MPRAGE and Dixon uT1 RESS, whereas motion artifacts were slightly worse with Dixon uT1 RESS. Comparing Dixon uT1 RESS with MPRAGE, the results indicated that…

### Evaluation of intraaxial enhancing brain tumors on magnetic resonance imaging: Intraindividual crossover comparison of gadobenate dimeglumine and gadopentetate dimeglumine for visualization and assessment, and implications for surgical intervention [^115t3eCL]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this article was to compare 0.1 mmol/kg doses of gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA) and gadopentetate dimeglumine, also known as gadolinium diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA), for enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of intraaxial brain tumors.

- **Methods**: Eighty-four patients with either intraaxial glioma (47 patients) or metastasis (37 patients) underwent two MR imaging examinations at 1.5 tesla, one with Gd-BOPTA as the contrast agent and the other with Gd-DTPA. The interval between fully randomized contrast medium administrations was 2 to 7 days. The T1-weighted spin echo and T2-weighted fast spin echo images were acquired before administration of contrast agents, and T1-weighted spin echo images were obtained after the agents were administered. Acquisition parameters and post-injection acquisition times were identical for the two examinations in each patient. Three experienced readers, working in a fully blinded fashion, independently evaluated all images for the degree and quality of available information (lesion contrast enhancement, lesion border delineation, definition of disease extent, visualization of the lesion's internal structures, global diagnostic preference) and quantitative enhancement (that is, the extent of lesion enhancement after contrast agent administration compared with that seen before its administration [hereafter referred to as percent enhancement], lesion/brain ratio, and contrast/noise ratio). Differences were tested with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and reader agreement was assessed using kappa statistics.

### Diagnostic value of alternative techniques to gadolinium-based contrast agents in MR neuroimaging-a comprehensive overview [^112sRdCp]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Differentiation of brain tumors:

A few recent studies have demonstrated that support vector machine-based classifiers using histogram features of the ADC from diffusion MRI (AUC = 0.97) can better discriminate between different types of posterior fossa tumors in children than contrast-enhanced T1 or T2 images (AUC = 0.84). Texture features from conventional non-contrast-enhanced MRI showed sufficient accuracy to separate childhood tumors into the correct classes (accuracy 71–92%), which is higher than the clinical radiological reading of the cases (47% correct diagnosis).

Non-contrast-enhanced MRI can also differentiate between cerebral lymphoma and GBM using the ADC with an AUC of 0.94. This can also be achieved by ASL with an AUC of 0.91 and an accuracy of 95%. MRS can discriminate between metastases and CNS lymphoma/GBM with equal diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.96) as perfusion MRI with contrast agent injection (AUC = 0.97). Further, ASL, T2 relaxometry, DKI, and APTw imaging can discriminate between cerebral metastasis and GBM with sufficient diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.84, 0.86, 1.00, and 0.91, respectively). To increase the specificity of contrast-enhanced imaging, one can use perfusion weighting such as dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI, which allows discrimination between glioblastoma, metastasis, and primary central nervous system lymphoma with accuracy between 0.94 and 0.99.

Tumor grade discrimination:

High-grade primary brain tumors are not always contrast-enhancing. In fact, up to 18% of high-grade gliomas can be non-enhancing.

### Computer-aided detection of metastatic brain tumors using magnetic resonance black-blood imaging [^115grf68]. Investigative Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to develop a computer-aided detection system for automated brain metastases detection using magnetic resonance black-blood imaging and compare its applicability with conventional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) imaging.

- **Materials and methods**: Twenty-six patients with brain metastases were imaged using a contrast-enhanced, 3-dimensional, whole-brain magnetic resonance black-blood pulse sequence. Approval from the institutional review board and informed consent from the patients were obtained. Preprocessing steps included B1 inhomogeneity correction and brain extraction. The computer-aided detection system used 3-dimensional template matching, which measured the normalized cross-correlation coefficient to generate possible metastases candidates. An artificial neural network was used for classification after various volume features were extracted. The same detection procedure was tested with contrast-enhanced MP-RAGE, which was also acquired from the same patients.

- **Results**: The performance of the proposed detection method was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity values. In the black-blood case, the detection process displayed an AUROC of 0.9355, a sensitivity value of 81.1%, and a specificity value of 98.2%. Magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo data showed an AUROC of 0.6508, a sensitivity value of 30.2%, and a specificity value of 99.97%.

- **Conclusions**: The results demonstrate that accurate automated detection of metastatic brain tumors using magnetic resonance black-blood imaging is feasible and displays superior detection performance compared to conventional MP-RAGE imaging.
