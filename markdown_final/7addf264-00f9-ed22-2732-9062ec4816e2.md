## Question

What antibiotics is good for it

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotic is "good" for an unspecified infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principle that antibiotic selection is infection-specific and must be matched to the likely pathogen, site of infection, and patient factors. Then, I should verify the role of diagnostics and stewardship in narrowing choices. Next, I will consider common scenarios to illustrate how to pick a "good" antibiotic in practice. Finally, I should confirm safety, duration, and resistance considerations that apply across cases.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: there is no single "good" antibiotic for everything; antibiotics are chosen based on the clinical syndrome, the most likely causative organisms, local resistance patterns, and patient-specific factors such as allergies, renal function, and pregnancy status, so I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing here [^116Jb9KK] [^112m6fDT].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic anchor before naming any drug: obtaining appropriate cultures or targeted tests guides both initial empiric therapy and subsequent de-escalation, and in sepsis or severe infection, early effective therapy matters, but I should balance that with stewardship and avoid unnecessary broad-spectrum exposure when infection is unlikely or cultures are negative [^1172JxNK] [^116PSdkr].

> I will now examine a few representative scenarios to illustrate how to pick a "good" antibiotic in context, but hold on, I should confirm each choice against guidelines and resistance data rather than assume. For uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia in an adult without comorbidities, amoxicillin is a reasonable first-line option per WHO stewardship-aligned guidance, whereas macrolides or fluoroquinolones are often overused and should be reserved for specific indications or local resistance patterns, so I need to check the local antibiogram before finalizing [^115ZzQTE].

> For pediatric acute otitis media, let me think about first-line therapy and when to broaden. High-dose amoxicillin remains first-line for most children, but if there has been recent amoxicillin exposure, concurrent purulent conjunctivitis, or treatment failure, I should consider an agent with beta-lactamase coverage such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, and I need to ensure I am not substituting convenience for efficacy here [^1173F3P5] [^115Sosyg].

> For MRSA skin and soft tissue infection, I should confirm oral options with supportive evidence. TMP-SMX, doxycycline, clindamycin, and linezolid are acceptable choices depending on local resistance and patient factors; I initially thought clindamycin resistance was uniformly high, but wait, I should double-check — resistance varies by locale, so local susceptibility data are essential before choosing clindamycin, and I should avoid agents with poor tissue penetration or excessive toxicity when equally effective alternatives exist [^111aNudS] [^115csuj1].

> For complicated urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis, I need to ensure I start with an agent active against local Gram-negative uropathogens and then de-escalate promptly to the narrowest effective agent once culture and susceptibility results return; I should also consider early oral step-down when clinically stable and obstruction is relieved to minimize IV exposure and resistance risk [^112gtP1T] [^115EJrG2].

> Let me consider duration, because "good" also means using the right length of therapy. Shorter effective courses reduce resistance and adverse events without sacrificing outcomes in many syndromes; for example, 4 days of antibiotics after adequate source control is sufficient for complicated appendicitis, and many bacteremias can be treated in about 7 days if the patient is responding, so I should confirm whether a shorter, evidence-based duration is appropriate for the specific infection [^114bdm3b].

> Hold on, I should verify stewardship principles that apply across scenarios: use the narrowest effective spectrum, reassess daily for de-escalation or discontinuation, and avoid treating colonization or nonbacterial conditions; these habits reduce C. difficile, adverse events, and resistance, and they are especially critical in pediatrics and in patients with complex comorbidities [^113wFkMh] [^113Q1YuN] [^1172JxNK].

> But wait, what if the user is thinking about non-antibiotic or adjunctive strategies when antibiotics are not clearly indicated or when resistance risk is high. I need to ensure I mention that for some conditions — such as mild bacterial conjunctivitis, many SSTIs with adequate source control, and certain chronic or biofilm-associated infections — non-antibiotic or antibiotic-sparing approaches may be reasonable, and in select refractory contexts, investigational options like bacteriophage or immune modulation are being explored, though evidence varies and access is limited [^112ZYxCy] [^111hpbMn] [^111Dm3dC].

> In summary, I should confirm that the "good" antibiotic is the one that matches the infection, the patient, and the local resistance landscape, is started promptly when indicated, used at the right dose and duration, and stopped or narrowed as soon as clinically and microbiologically justified; if you tell me the specific infection, site, severity, allergies, and any available culture data, I can name the most appropriate options and dosing with confidence [^116Jb9KK] [^112m6fDT].

The best antibiotic depends on the **infection type, likely pathogens, and patient factors** (allergies, age, comorbidities, pregnancy, renal/hepatic function) [^116Jb9KK]. Use **narrow-spectrum agents** when possible, guided by cultures and local resistance data [^116PSdkr], and follow stewardship principles to minimize resistance and adverse effects [^113wFkMh]. There is no single "best" antibiotic; selection must be individualized and evidence-based [^112m6fDT].

---

## General principles of antibiotic selection

- **Identify the infection**: Determine the site and severity (e.g. pneumonia, UTI, SSTI, sepsis) [^111uSmjV].
- **Likely pathogens**: Consider common organisms for the infection type and local epidemiology [^116Jb9KK].
- **Patient factors**: Account for allergies, age, pregnancy, renal/hepatic function, and comorbidities [^112m6fDT].
- **Spectrum**: Use the narrowest effective spectrum to limit resistance and adverse effects [^113wFkMh].
- **Stewardship**: Apply local guidelines, cultures, and resistance data to guide therapy [^116PSdkr].

## Common infections and recommended antibiotics

| **Infection type** | **Recommended antibiotics** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) | - Amoxicillin or ampicillin <br/> - Doxycycline <br/> - Macrolides (azithromycin) if local resistance is low <br/> - Fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) for severe cases or comorbidities | - Choice depends on severity, comorbidities, and local resistance [^115ZzQTE] <br/> - Macrolides reserved for low resistance areas [^notfound] |
| Urinary tract infection (UTI) | - Nitrofurantoin <br/> - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) <br/> - Fosfomycin <br/> - Beta-lactams (amoxicillin, cephalexin) if others contraindicated | - Choice depends on local resistance and patient factors [^notfound] <br/> - Fluoroquinolones reserved for complicated cases [^notfound] |
| Skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) | - Cephalexin <br/> - Dicloxacillin <br/> - Clindamycin <br/> - TMP-SMX or doxycycline for MRSA coverage | - Choice depends on severity and MRSA risk [^111aNudS] <br/> - Drainage is critical for abscesses [^117L8GRv] |
| Sepsis/septic shock | - Broad-spectrum empiric therapy (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, vancomycin) <br/> - De-escalate based on cultures | - Early, appropriate therapy improves outcomes [^notfound] <br/> - Stewardship essential to avoid overtreatment [^1172JxNK] |
| Acute otitis media (pediatric) | - Amoxicillin <br/> - Amoxicillin-clavulanate if beta-lactamase producers suspected | - First-line due to efficacy and safety [^notfound] <br/> - Consider local resistance patterns [^notfound] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Allergies**: Avoid beta-lactams in severe allergies; use clindamycin, macrolides, or fluoroquinolones as appropriate [^notfound].
- **Pregnancy**: Avoid tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides; prefer beta-lactams [^notfound].
- **Renal/hepatic impairment**: Adjust dosing for agents cleared by these organs (e.g. aminoglycosides, vancomycin) [^notfound].
- **Pediatrics**: Use weight-based dosing; avoid fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines in young children [^notfound].

---

## Role of antibiotic stewardship

Stewardship programs are essential to **optimize outcomes**, reduce resistance, and minimize adverse effects [^117DfnaT]. Key strategies include:

- **Narrow-spectrum therapy**: Use the narrowest effective agent [^113wFkMh].
- **Shortest effective duration**: Avoid prolonged courses [^116WViWa].
- **Culture-guided de-escalation**: Tailor therapy to cultures and susceptibilities [^116Jb9KK].
- **Education**: Train clinicians on appropriate prescribing [^113Ae2di].

---

## Emerging trends and future directions

- **Rapid diagnostics**: Enable targeted therapy sooner [^112dQAr7].
- **Combination therapy**: Used for resistant infections (e.g. MRSA, MDR Gram-negatives) [^1129e5fi].
- **Non-antibiotic therapies**: Bacteriophages, immunotherapies, and microbiome modulation are under study [^111F12At].

---

The best antibiotic is the **narrowest effective agent** matched to the infection, patient factors, and local resistance patterns, applied within stewardship frameworks to balance efficacy with resistance and safety [^112m6fDT].

### The past, present, and future of antibiotics [^113be87z]. Science Translational Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics have transformed modern medicine. They are essential for treating infectious diseases and enable vital therapies and procedures. However, despite this success, their continued use in the 21st century is imperiled by two orthogonal challenges. The first is that the microbes targeted by these drugs evolve resistance to them over time. The second is that antibiotic discovery and development are no longer cost-effective using traditional reimbursement models. Consequently, there are a dwindling number of companies and laboratories dedicated to delivering new antibiotics, resulting in an anemic pipeline that threatens our control of infections. The future of antibiotics requires innovation in a field that has relied on highly traditional methods of discovery and development. This will require substantial changes in policy, quantitative understanding of the societal value of these drugs, and investment in alternatives to traditional antibiotics. These include narrow-spectrum drugs, bacteriophage, monoclonal antibodies, and vaccines, coupled with highly effective diagnostics. Addressing the antibiotic crisis to meet our future needs requires considerable investment in both research and development, along with ensuring a viable marketplace that encourages innovation. This review explores the past, present, and future of antimicrobial therapy.

### Where will new antibiotics come from? [^113AWgqW]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2003). Medium credibility.

There is a constant need for new antibacterial drugs owing to the inevitable development of resistance that follows the introduction of antibiotics to the clinic. When a new class of antibiotic is introduced, it is effective at first, but will eventually select for survival of the small fraction of bacterial populations that have an intrinsic or acquired resistance mechanism. Pathogens that are resistant to multiple drugs emerge around the globe, so how robust are antibiotic discovery processes?

### Antibiotics for the treatment of COVID-19 [^115pqQku]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The effect of antibiotics with potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties are being investigated in clinical trials as treatment for COVID-19. The use of antibiotics follows the intention-to-treat the viral disease and not primarily to treat bacterial co-infections of individuals with COVID-19. A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding effectiveness and safety of antibiotics as anti-viral treatments for COVID-19 based on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is required.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotics compared to each other, no treatment, standard of care alone, placebo, or any other active intervention with proven efficacy for treatment of COVID-19 outpatients and inpatients. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (including MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, medRxiv, CENTRAL), Web of Science and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 14 June 2021.

Selection Criteria

RCTs were included that compared antibiotics with each other, no treatment, standard of care alone, placebo, or another proven intervention, for treatment of people with confirmed COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, treated in the in- or outpatient settings. Co-interventions had to be the same in both study arms. We excluded studies comparing antibiotics to other pharmacological interventions with unproven efficacy.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed risk of bias of primary outcomes using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (ROB 2) for RCTs. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence for the following primary outcomes: 1. to treat inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening defined as new need for intubation or death, clinical improvement defined as being discharged alive, quality of life, adverse and serious adverse events, and cardiac arrhythmias; 2. to treat outpatients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening defined as hospital admission or death, clinical improvement defined as symptom resolution, quality of life, adverse and serious adverse events, and cardiac arrhythmias.

Main Results

We included 11 studies with 11,281 participants with an average age of 54 years investigating antibiotics compared to placebo, standard of care alone or another antibiotic. No study was found comparing antibiotics to an intervention with proven efficacy. All studies investigated azithromycin, two studies investigated other antibiotics compared to azithromycin. Seven studies investigated inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19 and four investigated mild COVID-19 cases in outpatient settings. Eight studies had an open-label design, two were blinded with a placebo control, and one did not report on blinding. We identified 19 ongoing and 15 studies awaiting classification pending publication of results or clarification of inconsistencies. Of the 30 study results contributing to primary outcomes by included studies, 17 were assessed as overall low risk and 13 as some concerns of bias. Only studies investigating azithromycin reported data eligible for the prioritised primary outcomes. Azithromycin doses and treatment duration varied among included studies. Azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 compared to placebo or standard of care alone in inpatients We are very certain that azithromycin has little or no effect on all-cause mortality at day 28 compared to standard of care alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.06; 8600 participants; 4 studies; high-certainty evidence). Azithromycin probably has little or no effect on clinical worsening or death at day 28 (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03; 7311 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence), on clinical improvement at day 28 (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.11; 8172 participants; 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence), on serious adverse events during the study period (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.40; 794 participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence), and cardiac arrhythmias during the study period (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.15; 7865 participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard of care alone. Azithromycin may increase any adverse events slightly during the study period (RR 1.20; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.57; 355 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence) compared to standard of care alone. No study reported quality of life up to 28 days. Azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 compared to placebo or standard of care alone in outpatients Azithromycin may have little or no effect compared to placebo or standard of care alone on all-cause mortality at day 28 (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.06 to 15.69; 876 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence), on admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.56; 876 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence), and on symptom resolution at day 14 (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.12; 138 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether azithromycin increases or reduces serious adverse events compared to placebo or standard of care alone (0 participants experienced serious adverse events; 454 participants; 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported on adverse events, cardiac arrhythmias during the study period or quality of life up to 28 days. Azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 compared to any other antibiotics in inpatients and outpatients One study compared azithromycin to lincomycin in inpatients, but did not report any primary outcome. Another study compared azithromycin to clarithromycin in outpatients, but did not report any relevant outcome for this review.

Authors' Conclusions

We are certain that risk of death in hospitalised COVID-19 patients is not reduced by treatment with azithromycin after 28 days. Further, based on moderate-certainty evidence, patients in the inpatient setting with moderate and severe disease probably do not benefit from azithromycin used as potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment for COVID-19 regarding clinical worsening or improvement. For the outpatient setting, there is currently low-certainty evidence that azithromycin may have no beneficial effect for COVID-19 individuals. There is no evidence from RCTs available for other antibiotics as antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment of COVID-19. With accordance to the living approach of this review, we will continually update our search and include eligible trials to fill this evidence gap. However, in relation to the evidence for azithromycin and in the context of antimicrobial resistance, antibiotics should not be used for treatment of COVID-19 outside well-designed RCTs.

### What can we Do about antimicrobial resistance? [^113qdN2U]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance is of global concern, and preserving the ability of many antimicrobials to kill disease-causing bacteria is likely to become more challenging over time. However, we are speeding up this process dramatically by using antibiotics too much or in the wrong way. Respecting simple key principles of optimal antibiotic prescribing together with commitment to further research in this area from the pediatric community is essential to extend the lifeline of antibiotics for the most vulnerable patients without limiting access to antibiotics for those children who require treatment.

### Antibiotic myths for the infectious diseases clinician [^112WRvLE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobials are commonly prescribed and often misunderstood. With more than 50% of hospitalized patients receiving an antimicrobial agent at any point in time, judicious and optimal use of these drugs is paramount to advancing patient care. This narrative will focus on myths relevant to nuanced consultation from infectious diseases specialists, particularly surrounding specific considerations for a variety of antibiotics.

### Bacterial metabolism and antibiotic efficacy [^1175LfNg]. Cell Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

We are in the infancy of understanding bacterial metabolism in the context of antibiotic efficacy. As such, we suggest that a transdisciplinary approach including biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering is essential to improve bacterial infection therapy beyond the current state of the art. With a focused effort, we posit that a thorough understanding of the relationship between bacterial cell metabolism and antibiotic function can soon be leveraged into highly potent and precise antibacterial therapies that overcome many of the defense mechanisms used by bacteria to deplete the efficacy of our current antibiotics.

### The future of antibiotics [^115dCwnK]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Antibiotic resistance continues to spread even as society is experiencing a market failure of new antibiotic research and development (R&D). Scientific, economic, and regulatory barriers all contribute to the antibiotic market failure. Scientific solutions to rekindle R&D include finding new screening strategies to identify novel antibiotic scaffolds and transforming the way we think about treating infections, such that the goal is to disarm the pathogen without killing it or modulate the host response to the organism without targeting the organism for destruction. Future economic strategies are likely to focus on 'push' incentives offered by public-private partnerships as well as increasing pricing by focusing development on areas of high unmet need. Such strategies can also help protect new antibiotics from overuse after marketing. Regulatory reform is needed to re-establish feasible and meaningful traditional antibiotic pathways, to create novel limited-use pathways that focus on highly resistant infections, and to harmonize regulatory standards across nations. We need new antibiotics with which to treat our patients. But we also need to protect those new antibiotics from misuse when they become available. If we want to break the cycle of resistance and change the current landscape, disruptive approaches that challenge long-standing dogma will be needed.

### How antibiotics work together: molecular mechanisms behind combination therapy [^1129e5fi]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics used in combination are an effective strategy for combatting numerous infectious diseases in clinical and veterinary settings, particularly as a last-line therapy for difficult-to-treat cases. Combination therapy can either increase or slow the rate of killing, broaden the antibiotic spectrum, reduce dosage and unwanted side-effects, and even control the emergence of resistance. The administration of antibiotics in combination has been used effectively against bacterial infections for > 70 years, first used to treat tuberculosis. However, effective antibiotic combinations and their dosage regimes have been largely determined empirically in the clinic, and the molecular mechanisms underpinning how these combinations work remains surprisingly elusive. This review focuses on studies that have outlined the genetics and molecular mechanisms of action underlying antibiotic combinations, as well as those that examine how resistance develops. We highlight the need for further experimentation and genetic validation to fully realise the potential of combination therapy.

Objectives

To quantify the benefit of antimicrobial treatment for patients with cholera.
To determine whether different antimicrobials have different effects.
To determine whether different lengths of treatment or dosing of antimicrobials have different effects.

### Antibiotics in critically ill children-a narrative review on different aspects of a rational approach [^1149f9Nn]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Antibiotics can save lives, but at the same time exert harm to the individual by multiple mechanisms, ranging from direct impairment of cellular function to disturbance of physiological homeostasis and even contributing to the development of new diseases. Awareness of these potential harms must become an essential part of physician's decision-making for or against antibiotic treatment.

Critically ill children may be a patient group that needs wise decision-making on antibiotic therapies even more than others. Important aspects to consider on the path to adequate antibiotic treatment are diagnostic approaches to identify pathogens and guide antibiotic treatment, timing of antibiotics, empiric and targeted therapy, and therapeutic drug monitoring. To guide decision-making, we developed 6 key questions to answer before the initiation of antibiotic therapy in critically ill children.

### Antibiotic regimens | Group A strep… [^112SrWMm]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Multiple antibiotic regimens have been used to eradicate carriage of group A Streptococcus in previous outbreaks.
- Regimen should be chosen on a case-by-case basis.
- Some regimens require antibiotic susceptibility test results prior to their use.
- Follow recommended guidance on preventing and treating GAS infections. Overview Multiple antibiotic regimens have been recommended for GAS carriage eradication in either
- 2002 U. S. guidelines for postpartum and post-surgical outbreaks
- Canada's guidelines for prevention and control of invasive GAS disease Several regimens have been used in previous outbreaks for GAS carriage eradication. First-line regimens GAS is universally susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillin and cephalosporins. LTCFs and public health don't need to consider antibiotic susceptibility when selecting one of these treatment regimens. Universally susceptible antibiotic regimens, with dosages.

Benzathine penicillin G plus rifampin BPG: 600, 000 units for patients < 27 kilograms or 1, 200, 000 units for patients ≥ 27 kg intramuscular in a single dose Rifampin: 20 mg/kg/day oral in 2 divided doses for 4 days. 1st generation cephalosporins Cephalexin: 25–50 mg/kg/day in 2–4 divided doses for 10 days. Alternative regimens LTCFs and public health should only consider clindamycin or macrolides if the outbreak strain is documented as susceptible to these antibiotics. Clindamycin and macrolide resistance have been commonly reported. Among invasive disease isolates in 2023, 27% of GAS isolates were macrolide resistant and 26% of isolates were clindamycin resistant. Antibiotic regimens, with dosages, that need susceptibility testing Azithromycin Clindamycin

### Antibiotic efficacy in the complex infection environment [^115wxpTL]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Accurate prediction of antimicrobial efficacy is essential for successful treatment of bacterial infection. Beyond genetically encoded mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, the determinants of antibiotic susceptibility during infection remain poorly understood, and treatment failure is common. Traditional antibiotic susceptibility testing fails to account for extrinsic determinants of antibiotic susceptibility present in the complex infection environment and is therefore a poor predictor of antibiotic treatment outcome. Here we discuss how host-pathogen interaction, microbial interspecies interaction, and metabolic heterogeneity contribute to the success or failure of antibiotic therapy. Consideration of these factors during the treatment of disease will improve our ability to successfully resolve recalcitrant bacterial infection and improve patient health.

### It's not just the antibiotics, it's the treatment [^112KSqzp]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

At its core, the narrow-focused debate surrounding the timing of antimicrobial therapy is inherently flawed. The appropriate treatment of the septic patient requires a rapid multimodal response including fluid resuscitation, source control, and pressors (if required). Antimicrobials are only one part of this equation. In cases of life threatening septic shock, broad-spectrum empiric therapy should be initiated as soon as possible. However, the harmful effects of inappropriate antimicrobials should be mitigated, whenever possible, by using culture-guided therapy and delayed initiation. In all cases, resuscitation and source control should be the highest priority. Bloos and colleagues' study is a reminder that antimicrobials, while important, are not the only tools in our arsenal against infectious disease.

### Important challenges to finding new leads for new antibiotics [^114rFTLq]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Identification of new antibiotics remains a huge challenge. The last antibiotic of new chemical class and mechanism was discovered more than 30 years ago. Advances since have been largely incremental modifications to a limited number of chemical scaffolds. Discovering and developing truly new antibiotics is challenging: the science is complex, and the development process is time consuming and expensive. Herein, we focus on the discovery phase of modern antibacterial research and development. We argue that antibacterial discovery has been challenged by a poor understanding of bacterial permeability, by generic in vitro conventions that ignore the host, and by the inherent complexity of bacterial systems. Together, these factors have colluded to challenge modern, industrial, and reductionist approaches to antibiotic discovery. Nevertheless, advances in our understanding of many of these obstacles, including a new appreciation for the complexity of both host and pathogen biology, bode well for future efforts.

### Optimising trial designs to identify appropriate antibiotic treatment durations [^116WViWa]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacteria are increasingly able to resist antibiotic treatment, resulting in increased morbidity, deaths and costs worldwide. Antibiotic use is an important driver of the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance. Selective pressure can be reduced by minimising antibiotic prescribing for conditions for which antibiotics are often unnecessary. Moreover, the duration of antibiotic courses can often be reduced without significantly compromising cure rates. Shortening antibiotic duration can have a large impact on reducing exposure of bacteria to antibiotics, including bacteria carried asymptomatically. Antibiotics are by far the most prescribed drugs for children, with more than 60 million systemic antibiotics dispensed annually in the US outpatient setting alone, and are amongst the most frequently prescribed drugs for adults.

An important challenge is that, for many infectious conditions, the optimal antibiotic course length remains unclear. Courses should be long enough to treat infections effectively, yet short enough to reduce the incidence of side effects and the development and spread of antibiotic resistance. The continued need for antibiotics can be assessed with daily reviews for inpatients; however, in practice, such reviews are not always performed or acted upon and antibiotics are often continued in order to complete currently recommended course durations. Further, in the outpatient or primary care setting, continued assessment of patients initiated on antibiotics is not feasible. Therefore, it is especially important to have strong evidence about optimal treatment durations in these settings.

Because observational studies comparing different antibiotic durations are potentially confounded by unmeasured patient factors influencing the need for prolonged treatment, evidence about the optimal treatment duration should, where possible, come from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, antibiotic durations for several infections managed in primary care, such as prostatitis, are not guided by RCT evidence on optimal treatment duration. Where treatment durations have been compared in RCTs, in most cases, two treatment durations were selected for comparison, both of which lacked a clear scientific rationale. Whilst RCTs designed in this way can be useful, there are disadvantages to this approach.

Herein, we discuss the main issue with conventional two-arm trial designs, how to assess the 'optimal' antibiotic treatment duration, four alternative trial designs that can estimate much needed duration–response relationships (subsequently denoted duration–response curves), and which of these designs has the most desirable properties.

### Antibiotics for treating lower urinary tract infection in children [^114oxSmY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in infants and children. Lower UTI is the most commonly presenting and in the majority of cases can be easily treated with a course of antibiotic therapy with no further complications. A number of antimicrobials have been used to treat children with lower UTIs; however is it unclear what are the specific benefits and harms of such treatments.

Objectives

This review aims to summarise the benefits and harms of antibiotics for treating lower UTI in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Renal Group's Specialised Register (April 2012), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 5), MEDLINE OVID SP (from 1966), and EMBASE OVID SP (from 1988) without language restriction. Date of last search: May 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in which antibiotic therapy was used to treat bacteriologically proven, symptomatic, lower UTI in children aged zero to 18 years in primary and community healthcare settings were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Sixteen RCTs, analysing 1,116 children were included. Conventional 10-day antibiotic treatment significantly increased the number of children free of persistent bacteriuria compared to single-dose therapy (6 studies, 228 children: RR 2.01, 95%CI 1.06 to 3.80). No heterogeneity was observed. Persistent bacteriuria at the end of treatment was reported in 24% of children receiving single-dose therapy compared to 10% of children who were randomised to 10-day therapy. There were no significant differences between groups for persistent symptoms, recurrence following treatment, or re-infection following treatment. There was insufficient data to analyse the effect of antibiotics on renal parenchymal damage, compliance, development of resistant organisms or adverse events. Despite the inclusion of 16 RCTs, methodological weakness and small sample sizes made it difficult to conclude if any of the included antibiotics or regimens were superior to another.

Authors' Conclusions

Although antibiotic treatment is effective for children with UTI, there are insufficient data to answer the question of which type of antibiotic or which duration is most effective to treat symptomatic lower UTI. This review found that 10-day antibiotic treatment is more likely to eliminate bacteria from the urine than single-dose treatments. No differences were observed for persistent bacteriuria, recurrence or re-infection between short and long-course antibiotics where the antibiotic differed between groups. This data adds to an existing Cochrane review comparing short and long-course treatment of the same antibiotic who also reported no evidence of difference between short and long-course antibiotics.

### How antibiotics can make us sick: the less obvious adverse effects of antimicrobial chemotherapy [^115EG4mJ]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2004). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial agents are associated with side-effects, which are usually tolerated because the benefits of treatment outweigh the toxic effects. Clinicians know about these side-effects but are less likely to understand additional adverse events, such as the overgrowth of resistant microorganisms. Overgrowth can itself precipitate a secondary infection, which can be more difficult to treat. Resistant organisms then spread to other patients and the environment, and contribute to increasing antimicrobial resistance worldwide. Organisms exposed to antibiotics undergo molecular changes that might enhance virulence. Enhanced pathogenicity would affect patients, particularly if the organism is also multiply resistant. Clinicians have a responsibility to select the correct antibiotic as soon as they have diagnosed infection, but an absence of microbiological understanding and ignorance of the potential environmental effects have contributed to inappropriate prescribing. The less obvious results of antimicrobial consumption probably go unrecognised in routine clinical care.

### Drug combinations: a strategy to extend the life of antibiotics in the 21st century [^113Gn1xx]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2019). High credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance threatens a resurgence of life-threatening bacterial infections and the potential demise of many aspects of modern medicine. Despite intensive drug discovery efforts, no new classes of antibiotics have been developed into new medicines for decades, in large part owing to the stringent chemical, biological and pharmacological requisites for effective antibiotic drugs. Combinations of antibiotics and of antibiotics with non-antibiotic activity-enhancing compounds offer a productive strategy to address the widespread emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. In this Review, we outline a theoretical and practical framework for the development of effective antibiotic combinations.

### Antibiotic strategies in the era of multidrug resistance [^11791pn5]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

There is no doubt that we are now faced with greater antibiotic resistance challenges than ever before, limiting treatment options for patients with severe infections. The rate of development of new antimicrobial agents has failed to keep pace with the "ingenuity" of bacteria to mutate and become resistant to antibiotics. We have to adapt to this threat by reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We need to optimize control measures to minimize the risk of spread of resistant bacteria, and we have to find novel ways to detect pathogens early. These approaches will help prevent the spread of MDR pathogens and could enable us to direct last-line (and in some cases, narrow-spectrum) antibiotics more effectively to those patients who need them most, rather than the current "broad-spectrum is best" approaches.

### Antimicrobial stewardship [^117DfnaT]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of antimicrobial management or stewardship programmes is to ensure proper use of antimicrobial agents in order to provide the best treatment outcomes, to lessen the risk of adverse effects (including antimicrobial resistance), and to promote cost-effectiveness. Increasingly, long-term sustainability is found to be the major focus of antimicrobial stewardship. Implementing structural measures in healthcare institutions is therefore a major, but not the sole, focus of attention in promoting prudent use of antibiotics. The problem of antimicrobial resistance requires common strategies at all levels — for the prescribers and at ward, departmental, hospital, national and international levels.

Purpose of this section — if an antibiotic will be used for treatment of a child with AOM, the clinician must choose an antibiotic with a high likelihood of being effective against the most likely etiologic bacterial pathogens with considerations of cost, taste, convenience, and adverse effects, and this section proposes first- and second-line antibiotics that best meet these criteria while balancing potential benefits and harms.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^111uSmjV]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a common and life-threatening illness in the ICU, requiring timely and effective antimicrobial therapy. The aims of this review are to identify the most common sites of sepsis, the likely pathogens, and the optimal approach to antimicrobial therapy. Effective therapy must be balanced by the need to avoid overuse of broad spectrum agents and thus must be accompanied by a commitment to antimicrobial stewardship. Using experts in this topic, we reviewed the literature relevant to antimicrobial management of sepsis and recommend key principles for management.

Summary

The progressive spread of antibiotic resistance genes is forcing us to reconsider our treatment options against some bacterial pathogens. Treating bacterial infections will likely become more challenging in the future. We need to protect the antibiotics we already have, develop new ones, and redouble our efforts to generate novel therapies against bacterial pathogens.

### The use of long-term antibiotics for suppression of bacterial infections [^112x2xqo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Suppressive antibiotic therapy is prescribed when a patient has an infection that is presumed to be incurable by a defined course of therapy or source control. The cohort receiving suppressive antibiotic therapy is typically highly comorbid and the infections often involve retained prosthetic material. In part due to a lack of clear guidelines regarding the use of suppressive antibiotics, and in part due to the complex nature of the infections in question, patients are often prescribed suppressive antibiotics for extremely long, if not indefinite, courses. The risks of prolonged antibiotic exposure in this context are not fully characterized, but they include adverse drug effects ranging from mild to severe, the development of antibiotic-resistant organisms, and perturbations of the gastrointestinal microbiome. In this narrative review we present the available evidence for the use of suppressive antibiotic therapy in 4 common indications, examine the gaps in the current literature, and explore the known and potential risks of this therapy. We also make suggestions for improving the quality of evidence in future studies, particularly by highlighting the need for a standardized term to describe the use of long courses of antibiotics to suppress hard-to-treat infections.

### Drug combinations targeting antibiotic resistance [^111a2u7M]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2024). Medium credibility.

While the rise of antibiotic resistance poses a global health challenge, the development of new antibiotics has slowed down over the past decades. This turned the attention of researchers towards the rational design of drug combination therapies to combat antibiotic resistance. In this review we discuss how drug combinations can exploit the deleterious pleiotropic effects of antibiotic resistance and conclude that each drug interaction has its prospective therapeutic application.

### Antibiotic therapy versus no antibiotic therapy for children aged 2 to 59 months with WHO-defined non-severe pneumonia and wheeze [^114QGHBL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Worldwide, pneumonia is the leading cause of death amongst children under five years of age, and accounts for approximately two million deaths annually. Pneumonia can be classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Classification includes assessment of certain clinical signs and symptoms, and the severity of the disease. Treatment is then tailored according to the classification. For non-severe pneumonia, the WHO recommends treatment with oral antibiotics. We used the 2014 WHO definition of non-severe pneumonia for this review: an acute episode of cough, or difficulty in breathing, combined with fast breathing and chest indrawing. The WHO recommends treating non-severe pneumonia with oral antibiotics. Pneumonia is more commonly caused by viruses that do not require antibiotic treatment, but pneumonia caused by bacteria needs management with antibiotics to avoid complications. There is no clear way to quickly distinguish between viral and bacterial pneumonia. It is considered safe to give antibiotics, however, this may lead to the development of antibiotic resistance, and thus, limit their use in future infections. Therefore, it is essential to explore the efficacy of antibiotics for children with WHO-defined non-severe pneumonia and wheeze.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of antibiotic therapy versus no antibiotic therapy for children aged 2 to 59 months with WHO-defined non-severe pneumonia and wheeze.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, and two trial registers (December 2020).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of antibiotic therapy versus no antibiotic therapy for children, aged 2 to 59 months, with non-severe pneumonia and wheeze. We defined non-severe pneumonia as 'a cough or difficulty in breathing, with rapid breathing (a respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute or more for children aged 2 to 12 months, or a respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute or more for children aged 12 to 59 months), chest indrawing and wheeze'. We excluded trials involving children with severe or very severe pneumonia, and non-RCTs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Our primary outcomes were clinical cure and treatment failure; secondary outcomes were relapse, mortality, and treatment harms. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. Two review authors independently assessed the search results, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence. We contacted the authors of two included trials and the author of the trial awaiting classification to obtain missing numerical outcome data.

Main Results

We included three trials involving 3256 children aged between 2 to 59 months, who exhibited features of non-severe pneumonia with wheeze. The included trials were multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials carried out in Malawi, Pakistan, and India. The children were treated with a three-day course of amoxicillin or placebo, and were followed up for a total of two weeks. We assessed the included trials at overall low risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, attrition bias, and selective reporting. Only one trial was assessed to be at high risk for blinding of outcome assessors. One trial is awaiting classification Antibiotic therapy may result in a reduction of treatment failure by 20% (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 0.94; three trials; 3222 participants; low-certainty evidence). Antibiotic therapy probably results in little or no difference to clinical cure (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08; one trial; 456 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and in little or no difference to relapse (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.34; three trials; 2795 participants; low-certainty evidence), and treatment harms (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.09; three trials, 3253 participants; low-certainty evidence). Two trials (2112 participants) reported on mortality; no deaths occurred in either group. One trial reported cases of hospitalisation, diarrhoea (with and without dehydration), rash (without itch), tremors, mild nausea and vomiting.

Authors' Conclusions

We do not currently have enough evidence to support or challenge the continued use of antibiotics for the treatment of non-severe pneumonia. There is a clear need for RCTs to address this question in children aged 2 to 59 months with 2014 WHO-defined non-severe pneumonia and wheeze.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^117L8GRv]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Future research

Key research questions to inform decision makers and future guidelines are:

What is the impact of different types of antibiotics in settings where MRSA is rare (prevalence < 10%)?
Do antibiotics have different effects in different populations, such as people who are immunocompromised or in people with recurrent skin abscesses?
What are the long term effects (such as > 6 months) of antibiotics on abscess recurrence, Clostridium difficile infection, and MRSA resistance to TMP-SMX or clindamycin?
Is a shorter course of antibiotics (such as 5 days) as effective as a longer course (10 days)?
Is topical therapy (such as iodine, honey, silver, other antimicrobials) effective for treating uncomplicated skin abscesses compared with systemic therapy? Do other adjunctive measures, such as nasal decontamination or antisepsis for the body, reduce the risk that skin abscesses will recur?

### Advances in antibiotic therapy in the critically ill [^1115tp2p]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

De-escalation?

Decisions regarding empiric antibiotic therapy are based on two approaches: (1) a judgment that the likely agent has "normal antibiotic susceptibility" and can therefore be treated as such with possible need for "escalation" to second-line drugs after microbiological identification; (2) a judgment, based on local microbiology patterns and clinical presentation, that the infecting microorganism may be MDR and should be treated as such, with possible "de-escalation" to a simpler antibiotic regimen after identification and antibiotic susceptibilities of the causative microorganism are known. More frequently the latter approach is used in the ICU to ensure that all possible causative organisms are initially covered. Indeed, only about 30% of all antibiotics are used for definitive therapy in which the susceptibility patterns for the infection-associated pathogen are known. In many ICUs, more than 50% of isolates are resistant to at least one antibiotic, and broad-spectrum combination empiric therapy may be warranted in these units to ensure that these organisms are adequately covered. Once susceptibilities are confirmed, the spectrum can be reduced (de-escalated) accordingly, although one study reported that de-escalation may actually be feasible in < 50% of cases.

Studies have reported conflicting effects on outcomes with de-escalation in various groups of critically ill patients. A systematic review of 493 studies concluded that there was not sufficient evidence to determine whether de-escalation of antibiotic agents was effective and safe for adults with sepsis. Nevertheless, within a context of a dedicated "antibiotic stewardship" program, de-escalation should be encouraged, whenever possible, to optimize antibiotic use.

### Predicting antibiotic resistance [^113e1c1a]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2007). Medium credibility.

The treatment of bacterial infections is increasingly complicated because microorganisms can develop resistance to antimicrobial agents. This article discusses the information that is required to predict when antibiotic resistance is likely to emerge in a bacterial population. Indeed, the development of the conceptual and methodological tools required for this type of prediction represents an important goal for microbiological research. To this end, we propose the establishment of methodological guidelines that will allow researchers to predict the emergence of resistance to a new antibiotic before its clinical introduction.

### Is it time to replace vancomycin in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections? [^111m3NJf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

For more than 4 decades, vancomycin has been the antibiotic of choice for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Recently, infections due to isolates with high but susceptible vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations have been associated with additional treatment failures and patient mortality. These poorer outcomes may in part be explained by the inability of attaining appropriate vancomycin levels in these patients. However, assumptions that these poor outcomes are solely due to failure to achieve optimal serum levels of vancomycin are premature. The availability of effective alternatives further erodes the position of vancomycin as first-line therapy. The emergence of resistance and cost considerations, however, favor a more measured approach when using alternative antimicrobials. Collectively, the current available data suggest that the optimal therapy for MRSA infections remains unclear. In the absence of further data, the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines remain relevant and inform clinicians of best practice for treating patients with MRSA infections.

### Beyond antibiotics: new therapeutic approaches for bacterial infections [^111F12At]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The utility of conventional antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial infections has become increasingly strained due to increased rates of resistance coupled with reduced rates of development of new agents. As a result, multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant, and pandrug-resistant bacterial strains are now frequently encountered. This has led to fears of a "postantibiotic era" in which many bacterial infections will be untreatable. Alternative nonantibiotic treatment strategies need to be explored to ensure that a robust pipeline of effective therapies is available to clinicians. In this review, we highlight some of the recent developments in this area, such as the targeting of bacterial virulence factors, utilization of bacteriophages to kill bacteria, and manipulation of the microbiome to combat infections.

### Pharmacological agents for soft tissue and bone infected with MRSA: which agent and for how long? [^111PbbLA]. Injury (2011). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections cause an important number of soft tissue and bone infections, although exact rates vary across different countries and institutions. The length of antibiotic treatment required depends upon the severity of infection and pre-existing co-morbidities. Monitoring response to treatment is important to ensure cure of infection whilst preventing excessive antibiotic use. Debridement and drainage, in addition to prosthesis removal, may be necessary. Numerous antibiotics are effective at treating soft tissue and bone infected with MRSA. Oral antibiotics, such as clindamycin, doxycycline and linezolid, generally offer good bioavailability and tissue penetration. They are separated largely by side effect profile and drug interactions, which should be considered carefully prior to use. There are also several agents only available in the intravenous (IV) form, for example glycopeptides, daptomycin and tigecycline. These are normally reserved for the treatment of severe infections. Whilst tissue penetration is variable within this group, it is the adverse events linked with each antibiotic that are most effective in determining the preferred agent.

### Exploring the principles behind antibiotics with limited resistance [^115V7fT1]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Our study investigated the effects of diverse antibiotics on bacterial resistance evolution to elucidate factors contributing to antibiotic efficacy. We identified key principles of antibiotic action that minimize resistance and proposed potential directions for future antibiotic development. However, further in vivo experiments are needed to enhance and validate the findings presented here. More generally, these promising results suggest a fruitful direction for future therapeutic applications, advocating for a focus on dual-target mechanisms that disrupt bacterial membranes while targeting additional cellular components. Our study focused on antibiotics effective against Gram-negative bacterial species with critical clinical importance. Therefore, it remains to be shown whether similar conclusions hold for antibiotics specific against infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens. Our work also highlights the complexity of resistance mechanisms and the importance of a strategic, informed approach to antibiotic design and use.

### Antibiotic stewardship in pediatrics [^113wFkMh]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship in pediatrics — scope, rationale, and harms are outlined, with the policy noting it was reaffirmed September 2025 and defining stewardship as prescribing antibiotics only when necessary and optimizing agent, dose, duration, and route to minimize unintended consequences; the statement emphasizes pediatric-specific guidance due to differences from adults, details the rationale and required personnel/infrastructure and activities for inpatient and outpatient programs, addresses approaches to evaluating effectiveness and knowledge gaps, and notes antibiotics are the most commonly prescribed medications to children whose overuse causes harms including antibiotic resistance, Clostridioides difficile infections (CDIs), and adverse events; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates antibiotic-resistant microbes cause nearly 3 million infections and 35 000 deaths each year in the United States, and antibiotics are frequently used in both pediatric inpatient and outpatient settings with a significant proportion considered unnecessary.

### Why antibiotics should not be used to treat Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infections [^116MgTtt]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There has been much debate about treating Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections with antibiotics. No data convincingly demonstrate that antibiotics are better than no antibiotic treatment at all, and many studies suggest antibiotics increase the risk of developing the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This topic is timely, because emerging technology enables rapid identification of STEC-infected patients, and we anticipate questions about management will increase. This review is designed to familiarize readers with the series of observations that underlie our recommendations.

Recent Findings

The long debate over antibiotics in STEC infections appears resolved by gradually accruing information that show that antibiotics do not benefit infected patients. In fact, they are associated with an increased likelihood of developing HUS. A meta-analysis published in 2016 demonstrated that low risk of bias studies find a clear association between antibiotic use and development of HUS. Subsequent publications do not refute these findings.

Summary

In high-income countries, antibiotics should not routinely be given to patients with acute diarrhea unless testing demonstrates a pathogen for which antibiotics are indicated, and STEC infection has been excluded. Future work to prevent HUS should focus on preventing primary infections, and mitigating extraintestinal consequences of STEC gut infections.

### Non-antibiotic strategies for sepsis [^113a4ft4]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2009). Low credibility.

Sepsis and septic shock remain a considerable therapeutic challenge. Despite significant advances in supportive care and the availability of potent, broad-spectrum antibiotics, the overall mortality due to sepsis is still approximately 35%, and this increases to 60% if patients develop septic shock. Antibiotics constitute a necessary part of the treatment of sepsis, and there is probably considerable scope to improve the way in which they are used. Nevertheless, antibiotics alone, even used optimally, are probably not sufficient to substantially reduce the mortality that accompanies the multiorgan failure that occurs in septic patients. For this reason, considerable efforts have been expended in developing non-antibiotic (or so-called adjunctive) forms of treatment, and here the general approaches to these types of treatment are reviewed. There are three main categories: improvements in supportive care, treatments aimed at bacterial virulence factors, and treatments aimed at host mediators. This is not intended to be a comprehensive review, but rather to provide examples in each category to illustrate the general principles-and the hurdles-that have characterized these approaches to therapy.

### Antibiotics re-booted-time to kick back against drug resistance [^111hpbMn]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

After decades of neglect and a decline in antibiotic research and development, we are now finally witnessing the advent of new funding programs dedicated to new therapies. In addition to traditional new chemical entities that directly kill or arrest the growth of bacteria, alternative approaches are being identified and advanced towards proof-of-concept trials in the clinic. We briefly review the current pipeline of conventional new antibiotics and highlight in more depth promising alternatives, including potentiators of antibiotic action, bacteriophage, lysins and microbiome modulation. More innovative approaches, such as adaptive and innate immune modulators, CRISPR-Cas and diagnostic guided 'theranostics' are discussed and contrasted. Such exploratory therapies may require the development of alternative regulatory and clinical development pathways, but represent a potential circuit breaker from the current 'arms race' between bacteria and traditional antibiotics.

### It's not just the antibiotics, it's the treatment [^111iprLV]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The recent study by Bloos and colleagues demonstrates that early initiation of antimicrobial therapy is not associated with improved survival in sepsis. We contend that these findings should not be surprising. This study is yet another part of the growing case against early and aggressive antimicrobial therapy and highlights the important roles resuscitation and source control play in the management of the septic patient. We suggest that, whenever possible, antimicrobial therapy should we withheld until objective evidence of infection has been obtained.

### MRSA: treating people with infection [^113isEmX]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has a gene that makes it resistant to methicillin as well as to other beta-lactam antibiotics including flucloxacillin, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. MRSA can be part of the normal body flora (colonisation), especially in the nose, but it can cause infection, especially in people with prolonged hospital admissions, with underlying disease, or after antibiotic use. About 20% of S aureus in blood cultures in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland is resistant to methicillin.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatment for MRSA infections at any body site? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to November 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 11 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: clindamycin, daptomycin, fusidic acid, glycopeptides (teicoplanin, vancomycin), linezolid, macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin), quinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), quinupristin-dalfopristin, pristinamycin, rifampicin, tetracyclines (doxycycline, minocycline, oxytetracycline), tigecycline, trimethoprim, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole).

### Antibiotic tolerance: targeting bacterial survival [^112HcoRw]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is the cornerstone of antibiotic treatments. Yet, active drugs are frequently unsuccessful in vivo and most clinical trials investigating antibiotics fail. So far, bacterial survival strategies, other than drug resistance, have been largely ignored. As such, drug tolerance and persisters, allowing bacterial populations to survive during antibiotic treatments, could fill a gap in antibiotic susceptibility testing. Therefore, it remains critical to establish robust and scalable bacterial viability measures and to define the clinical relevance of bacterial survivors across various bacterial infections. If successful, these tools could improve drug design and development to prevent tolerance formation or target bacterial survivors, to ultimately reduce treatment failures and curb resistance evolution.

### A game theoretic approach reveals that discretizing clinical information can reduce antibiotic misuse [^111kwQFq]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Actions

Each player chooses one of two possible actions: to administer antibiotic treatment, A, or withhold antibiotic treatment, W.

Effectiveness depletion

As mentioned before, each use of the drug decreases the average antibiotic susceptibility to the drug, or its effectiveness, in the next period by a depletion effect α. Such depletion is in accordance with both biological knowledge of antibiotic resistance acquisition in bacterial populations as well as observations of resistance frequencies in countries with varying antibiotic consumption. The game ends when antibiotic effectiveness is completely depleted, for mathematical convenience. This assumption can be easily attenuated (see "Discussion" section). Given an initial effectiveness level e₀ and the depletion effect α, one can calculate the total number of possible game effectiveness-states, M. Note that since the effect of use has a delay of one period, when the effectiveness is α two patients can be treated simultaneously before the effectiveness is completely depleted. Therefore, the number of patients that will be treated is either M or M + 1. Empirically, M is very large (an antibiotic drug is used by millions of patients before it is considered not effective), and for the purpose of mathematical convenience, we will assume that it is as large as we want. For simplicity, we will also assume that e₀ = Mα, where M is a positive integer. The current level of effectiveness eₜ in any given period t is represented by the current effectiveness-state (E -state). For simplicity, and since the E -state does not depend on the period number, we will omit the index t and denote the E -state by k.

### The antibiotic R&D pipeline: an update [^113fWeuL]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2011). Low credibility.

There is an urgent need for new antibacterials to target emerging multidrug-resistant bacteria. The need for such agents is rising while the efforts in antibacterial research have declined dramatically in the past few decades with the result of only four compounds belonging to new chemical classes being approved for clinical use. The main reasons that led to this critical situation are shortly described. A renewed interest in the research of new effective antimicrobials is nonetheless delivering compounds deriving mainly from modification of existing drugs, yet new chemical classes are appearing. Because many of these activities have started relatively recently, we should expect a long period before new antibiotics are added to the medical armamentarium.

### The future of antibiotics [^115j1KmY]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Highly accomplished clinician-scientists who experienced the before and after of the availability of antibiotics described their effect as being 'almost beyond belief' and 'an awesome acquisition of power'. Unfortunately, the crisis of antibiotic resistance threatens to dissipate that power. The pipeline has dried up and resistance continues to worsen year by year. As a result, a national survey of infectious diseases specialists in 2012 revealed that more than half of them had been confronted with pan-resistant bacterial infection during the previous year. This problem will continue to grow worse unless we fundamentally change the way our society deals with the discovery, development, use, and protection of these life-saving drugs.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^113ZdjTj]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris — systemic antibiotic recommendations — Systemic antibiotics are recommended in the management of moderate and severe acne and forms of inflammatory acne that are resistant to topical treatments. Doxycycline and minocycline are more effective than tetracycline, but neither is superior to each other. Although oral erythromycin and azithromycin can be effective in treating acne, its use should be limited to those who cannot use the tetracyclines (ie, pregnant women or children < 8 years of age), and erythromycin use should be restricted because of its increased risk of bacterial resistance. Use of systemic antibiotics, other than the tetracyclines and macrolides, is discouraged; trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim use should be restricted to patients who are unable to tolerate tetracyclines or in treatment-resistant patients. Systemic antibiotic use should be limited to the shortest possible duration. Re-evaluate at 3–4 months to minimize the development of bacterial resistance, and monotherapy with systemic antibiotics is not recommended. Concomitant topical therapy with benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid should be used with systemic antibiotics and for maintenance after completion of systemic antibiotic therapy.

### SAGES guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis [^114bdm3b]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Complicated appendicitis postoperative antibiotics — The panel suggested that adult and pediatric patients who have undergone appendectomy for complicated appendicitis should be treated with short-term antibiotics postoperatively. This is a conditional recommendation based on very low certainty of evidence. There is still uncertainty surrounding the ideal number of days of antibiotics post-operatively; however, the STOP-IT trial demonstrated that antibiotics for four days after adequate source control is sufficient and this can logically be applied to patients with complicated appendicitis as well. Once adopted, it will be important to monitor readmission and post-operative infection (both superficial and deep) at individual institutions. Future studies should investigate how short a course of antibiotics is still effective, when the transition to oral antibiotics can be made, and the optimal antibiotic from the perspective of stewardship and efficacy.

### International comparison of guidelines for management of impetigo: a systematic review [^111FX78s]. Family Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Impetigo is a common superficial skin infection that affects people worldwide and is usually treated with antibiotics; therefore, its management has implications for global antibiotic stewardship.

Objective

This systematic review and narrative synthesis compares and contrasts international impetigo management guidelines.

Methods

Guidelines for treatment of impetigo that were produced by a national authority; available to primary care physicians; and published since 2008 were included. Following a comprehensive search strategy, data extraction from eligible studies was performed independently in duplicate. Details of antiseptic and antibiotic treatment; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus treatment; and conservative management and preventative measures were tabulated and analysed descriptively.

Results

Fifty-one guidelines were included from 42 different countries. All guidelines recommended systemic antibiotics, 78% of these only for widespread lesions or failure of topical antibiotic treatment. The first-line systemic antibiotic treatment was restricted to narrow-spectrum options in 21 (41%) whilst 7 (14%) recommended only broad-spectrum antibiotics first-line. Thirty-four (67%) guidelines included recommendations for topical antibiotic use. Twenty guidelines (39%) did not mention antiseptic treatment for impetigo. Guidelines did not always provide clear indications for different treatment options.

Conclusions

Despite potentially equal efficacy to systemic antibiotics, only two-thirds of guidelines include topical antibiotic options. Many fail to include recommendations for non-antibiotic treatments such as antiseptics, preventative measures and conservative management, despite potential for antibiotic-sparing. Provision of clear definitions of disease severity and indications for treatment would enhance the ability of clinicians to adhere to recommendations.

Currently, a wide range of terminology is used, including "long-term suppressive therapy", "indefinite chronic suppression", and "indefinite oral antimicrobial suppression". We recommend "suppressive antibiotic therapy" as a standardized term that accurately and succinctly describes the practice of using long courses of antibiotics to indefinitely suppress bacterial infection, so that relevant data are not unintentionally excluded from systematic reviews. As antimicrobial resistance and the levels of comorbidity in the population increase worldwide, the number of patients prescribed SAT will likely increase. Therefore, it is important that both patients and clinicians have accurate information about the treatment strategy to promote safe patient-centered care.

### The negative impact of antibiotic resistance [^111acNtv]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Antibacterial therapy is one of the most important medical developments of the twentieth century; however, the spread of resistance in healthcare settings and in the community threatens the enormous gains made by the availability of antibiotic therapy. Infections caused by resistant bacteria lead to up to two-fold higher rates of adverse outcomes compared with similar infections caused by susceptible strains. These adverse outcomes may be clinical or economic and reflect primarily the failure or delay of antibiotic treatment. The magnitude of these adverse outcomes will be more pronounced as disease severity, strain virulence, or host vulnerability increases. The negative impacts of antibacterial resistance can be measured at the patient level by increased morbidity and mortality, at the healthcare level by increased resource utilization, higher costs and reduced hospital activity and at the society level by antibiotic treatment guidelines favouring increasingly broad-spectrum empiric therapy. In this review we will discuss the negative impact of antibiotic resistance on patients, the healthcare system and society.

### Seven ways to preserve the miracle of antibiotics [^114MCw6n]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Antibiotic resistance is a well-acknowledged crisis with no clearly defined comprehensive, national corrective plan. We propose a number of interventions that, collectively, could make a large difference. These include collection of data to inform decisions, efforts to reduce antibiotic abuse in people and animals, great emphasis on antibiotic stewardship, performance incentives, optimal use of newer diagnostics, better support for clinical and basic resistance-related research, and novel methods to foster new antibiotic development.

### It's not just the antibiotics, it's the treatment [^1167uYXv]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Should these findings have been surprising? We think not. The author's cite a meta-analysis by Barochia and colleagues that suggests that timely administration of antimicrobials is associated with improved survival. However, this finding was only significant after removing the effects from Rivers and colleagues' study on early goal-directed therapy. Another meta-analysis conducted on studies of outpatient respiratory infections found no difference between immediate or delayed antibiotic therapy. Puskarich and colleagues demonstrated that, in the setting of appropriate resuscitation, the timing of antimicrobial therapy appears to have little effect on mortality. Similarly, Hranjec and colleagues found that, assuming resuscitation and source control occur in a timely manner, intentionally withholding antimicrobial therapy until infection can be objectively proven to result in improved patient outcomes compared with early and aggressive initiation. These studies focused on emergency department and ICU management, respectively. Bloos and colleagues' study confirms the findings of Hranjec and colleagues and Puskarich and colleagues, while spanning the entire spectrum of hospitalization.

This trial also suffers from the most common deficit in most studies of timing of antimicrobial therapy in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock: the lack of a proper control group. The question faced by the clinician is not whether a patient with proven infection should have the rapid initiation of antimicrobials, but whether a patient who might be infected should receive therapy. Missing in this study is the group of patients who received antimicrobials for suspected infection but were not infected, and what the consequences of this unnecessary exposure to antibiotics were. However, the data are reassuring to us who believe that it is prudent to wait until there is objective microbiological data to support the diagnosis of infection before initiating therapy. Even among these patients with significant disease, the exact timing of antimicrobial therapy did not appear to be the main driver of outcomes.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^115ZzQTE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided with 'first choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles, and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable from an antibiotic stewardship perspective. Amoxicillin, which is the first-choice treatment for CAP based on the 2019 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, and is also listed as a first-choice option in many guidelines outside the United States, is only recommended in the ATS/IDSA guidelines, together with doxycycline and macrolides as equivalent options, for patients without comorbidities (very broadly stated as "chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; malignancy; or asplenia").

### Tackling antibiotic resistance [^116D74yy]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2011). Medium credibility.

The development and spread of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is a universal threat to both humans and animals that is generally not preventable but can nevertheless be controlled, and it must be tackled in the most effective ways possible. To explore how the problem of antibiotic resistance might best be addressed, a group of 30 scientists from academia and industry gathered at the Banbury Conference Centre in Cold Spring Harbor, New York, USA, from 16 to 18 May 2011. From these discussions there emerged a priority list of steps that need to be taken to resolve this global crisis.

### What is the evidence for Co-trimoxazole, clindamycin, doxycycline, and minocycline in the treatment of methicillin-resistant (MRSA) pneumonia? [^113cLKAX]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective: To review the evidence for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), clindamycin, doxycycline, and minocycline in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. Data Source: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Google, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1946 to May 20, 2019. The search was performed with the keywords methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Staphylococcus aureus, pneumonia, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole drug combination, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, TMP-SMX, co-trimoxazole, clindamycin, doxycycline, and minocycline. Data Extraction: Studies reporting the use of the above antibiotics for MRSA pneumonia treatment with clinical outcomes were included. Search parameters were limited to English language and human studies only. Data Synthesis: The search yielded 16 relevant articles: 6 TMP-SMX, 8 clindamycin, zero doxycycline, and 2 minocycline. For TMP-SMX, prospective randomized trials showed variable results; however, these studies were not specifically designed to assess MRSA pneumonia treatment. Retrospective studies with clindamycin suggested that it could be used as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-MRSA antibiotics. There was no evidence for doxycycline use, but 2 small retrospective reviews appeared to support minocycline as a treatment option. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: These antibiotics are often used in clinical practice as potential treatment options for MRSA pneumonia. This article reviews the evidence for the clinical efficacy and safety of these agents. Conclusions: There are limited data to support use of TMP-SMX, clindamycin, doxycycline, or minocycline in MRSA pneumonia treatment. Randomized controlled trials are required to determine the effectiveness of these antibiotics. Clinicians should base their decision to use these agents on a case-by-case basis depending on clinical status and susceptibility results.

### Principles of antibiotic therapy in severe infections: optimizing the therapeutic approach by use of laboratory and clinical data [^116Jb9KK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The increasingly daunting problem of antimicrobial resistance has led to an intense focus on optimization of antibiotic therapy, with simultaneous goals of improving patient outcomes and minimizing the contribution of that therapy to making the available antibiotics obsolete. Although even appropriate antibiotic therapy drives resistance, inappropriate therapy may also have adverse effects on the individual patient, as well as on the bacterial ecology. Recent research has validated the benefit of intelligent utilization of both microbiological data and clinical assessment in the empirical selection of initial broad-spectrum therapy and in further guidance of therapeutic decisions throughout the course of illness by use of a systems approach. Thus, the optimal approach to the critically ill patient with infection involves the initiation of aggressive broad-spectrum empirical therapy followed by timely responses to microbiological and clinical results as they become available. An appropriate response to this information often involves de-escalation of therapy or even its discontinuation.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^111aNudS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What oral antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs)? What intravenous antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections?

For oral antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: linezolid (recommendation 1A), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (recommendation 1B), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline) (recommendation 1B), or tedizolid (Recommendation 1A).

For intravenous (IV) antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: daptomycin (10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily) (recommendation 1A), IV linezolid (recommendation 1A), IV ceftaroline (recommendation 1A), IV dalbavancin (recommendation 1A), IV vancomycin (recommendation 1A), IV tigecycline (recommendation 1A), or IV tedizolid (recommendation 1A).

Seven to 14 days of therapy is recommended but should be individualized on the basis of the patient's clinical response (recommendation 1A). IV to oral switch should occur when criteria of clinical stability have been reached (recommendation 1C).

For CA-MRSA, recommended oral agents are clindamycin, although clindamycin resistance is now very common, tetracyclines, TMP-SMX, linezolid, tedizolid, and occasionally, fluoroquinolones. Several observational studies and one small randomized trial suggest that TMP-SMX, doxycycline, and minocycline are effective for such infections. If coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired for oral therapy, options include clindamycin alone, or the combination of either TMP-SMX or doxycycline with a beta-lactam (e.g. penicillin, cephalexin, or amoxicillin).

### Topical antibiotics in the dermatological clinical practice: indications, efficacy, and adverse effects [^11187QYz]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Topical antibiotic therapy is a central component of patient management for several skin conditions, including acne, hidradenitis suppurativa, rosacea, impetigo or other superinfected dermatitis, and prevention of wound infections. Moreover, particular situations, such as skin diseases of bacterial origin in pregnancy and infants often warrant topical therapy. However, the occurrence of local delayed hypersensitivity reactions and the rising rate of antibiotic resistance are becoming great challenges faced by many dermatologists today. This narrative review provides an overview of the main topical antibiotics used in dermatology, focusing on their clinical role in the most common dermatological indications. For this purpose, a review of MEDLINE and PubMed for pertinent, scientific, and clinical publications until March 2020 was performed. Only articles published in the English language were included.

### Use of appropriate antimicrobials in wound management [^1166WGJ8]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

The primary goal of wound management is to achieve a functional closure with minimal scarring. Preventing infection is important to facilitate the healing process. Most simple, uncomplicated wounds do not need systemic antibiotics but benefit from the use of topical antibiotics. Judicious use of antibiotics reduces unnecessary adverse events and helps reduce the development of resistance. Although antibiotics can help reduce infection risk and promote healing, they are not a substitute for good local wound care, in particular irrigation and surgical débridement. This article reviews the role of antibiotics in emergency department wound management.

### Advances in the medical management of skin and soft tissue infections [^115csuj1]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections are some of the most common infectious disease diagnoses in both inpatient and outpatient settings. With bacterial resistance to antimicrobials growing, decision making on empiric antibiotics is becoming increasingly difficult. Additionally, the most recent guidance from a professional society on the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections was published in 2014 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and is now two years old. New antimicrobial agents have been developed and approved for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections since then, and more are in the pipeline. This review summarizes the evidence on treatments that are new or in development and the potential repurposing of old antimicrobials. The clinical utility of these treatments is also discussed.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of pouchitis and inflammatory pouch disorders [^112t7VQi]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

AGA guideline — chronic antibiotic therapy for recurrent pouchitis — The AGA suggests using chronic antibiotic therapy to treat recurrent pouchitis (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Implementation considerations state that the panel suggests endoscopic evaluation of the pouch with confirmation of inflammation and ruling out alternative etiologies in patients with recurrent pouchitis, and that the lowest effective dose of antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily or 250 mg twice daily) with intermittent gap periods (such as approximately 1 week per month), or use of cyclical antibiotics (such as rotating between ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin every 1–2 weeks) may be considered to decrease risk of antimicrobial resistance. Historically, chronic antibiotic-dependent pouchitis was defined as more than 3 episodes of pouchitis per year, and in patients with episodes of pouchitis every 2–4 months, they may prefer intermittent antibiotic therapy for 6–12 weeks per year. Chronic antibiotic use has been associated with increased rates of antimicrobial resistance and other adverse effects, including neuropathy with chronic metronidazole use and tendinopathy with chronic ciprofloxacin use.

### When antibiotics can be avoided in skin inflammation and bacterial colonization: a review of topical treatments [^111Dm3dC]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review looks at the recent evidence on the safety, toxicity, microbiology and the prevention and management of acute and chronic wound infections with regard to antiseptics and antiseptic wound dressings. It is timely and relevant because of the global concerns of antimicrobial resistance and the need to address the inappropriate use of antimicrobials in the healthcare setting.

Recent Findings

There have been a number of recent Cochrane reviews that have concluded that there is little evidence to delineate clinical outcomes between antiseptics and antiseptic dressings. Published in-vitro evidence offers some new techniques and evaluates some new dressings and antiseptics. There are no economic evaluations of antiseptics and antiseptic dressings.

Summary

Better clinical trials on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of wound dressings are needed to ensure evidence-based guidance is developed for optimizing the treatment of patients. It is surprising that with the paucity of evidence of clinical effectiveness, healthcare organizations continue to spend considerable resources on poorly evaluated topical wound products.

### Current paradigms of combination therapy in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia: does it work, which combination, and for which patients? [^113pZkPC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The last several years have seen an emergence of literature documenting the utility of combination antimicrobial therapy, particularly in the salvage of refractory methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Recent clinical data are shaping conundrums of which regimens may be more beneficial, which can be potentially harmful, and which subset of patients stand to benefit from more aggressive treatment regimens than called for by current standards. In addition, the incorporation of combination therapy for MRSA bacteremia should be accompanied by the reminder that antimicrobial therapy does not need to be uniform for the entire duration, with an early intensive phase in high inoculum infections (eg, with combination therapy), followed by a consolidation phase (ie, monotherapy). This review and perspective consolidates the recent data on this subject and directs future goals in filling the knowledge gaps to methodically move forward towards improving patient outcomes.

### The future of antibiotics [^112dQAr7]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Solutions to prevent emergence of resistance

While the primary focus of this article is on facilitating new antibacterial development, we must stop making the same mistake over and over again with respect to misuse and overuse of antibiotics. Resistance will occur to all new antibiotics developed. Thus, as we facilitate new antibiotic development, we must re-emphasize our core responsibility as physicians and members of our communities to help preserve and protect the precious, limited, and exhaustible resource of antibiotics. Summaries of novel, disruptive approaches to enhancing infection prevention, disinfection, and decontamination; use of rapid diagnostics to enhance stewardship; and other improvements in antibiotic stewardship have been recently published.

The struggle with microbes will not end with new antibiotic availability. Indeed, it will never end. We bear great responsibility to protect the 'awesome power' of antibiotics that our forebears in medicine bestowed upon us. To prescribe a powerful new antibiotic is easy. To protect it is hard. But if we want to break the cycle and stop repeating the same mistakes of the past over and over, we must learn how to not use and abuse new antibiotics.

### Ten golden rules for optimal antibiotic use in hospital settings: the WARNING call to action [^113EnWMB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

In 2017, the WHO Expert Committee on Selection and Use of Essential Medicines established the AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) classification of antibiotics to aid antibiotic stewardship efforts globally at all levels of care. This classification system groups antibiotics into the aforementioned three categories, based on treatment of common bacterial infections and their impact on AMR, focusing on the need for appropriate use. The AWaRe classification was updated in 2021 to include an additional 78 antibiotics that were not previously classified, bringing the total number of classified antibiotics to 258 (Fig. 13).

Fig. 13
AWaRe classification

The "Access" category refers to the antibiotic of choice for each of the 25 most common infections. These antibiotics should be available at all times and places and should be acceptable and affordable. The "Watch" category includes most of the "highest-priority critically important antibiotics", which are recommended only for specific indications. The "Reserve" category includes antibiotics that should only be used as a last resort (i.e. to treat MDR bacteria) and only when all other antibiotics have failed. WHO recommends reducing the use of antibiotics in the "Watch" and in the "Reserve" groups, and increasing the access and use of antibiotics in the "Access" group, expecting 60% of all antibiotic use in hospitals should come from this group. As a practical matter, this would reduce the global utilization of piperacillin-tazobactam, an antipseudomonal ureidopenicillin that is overused to treat community-acquired infections.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^112ZYxCy]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Mild bacterial conjunctivitis — treatment approach: Mild bacterial conjunctivitis is usually self-limited, and it typically resolves spontaneously without specific treatment in immune-competent adults. Use of topical antibacterial therapy is associated with earlier clinical and microbiological remission compared with placebo in days 2 to 5 of treatment, and these advantages persist over days 6 to 10, but the extent of benefit over placebo lessens over time. Because a 5- to 7-day course of a broad-spectrum topical antibiotic is usually effective, the most convenient or least expensive option can be selected; there is no clinical evidence supporting the superiority of any particular antibiotic. Povidone-iodine 1.25% ophthalmic solution may be as effective as topical antibiotic therapy for treating bacterial conjunctivitis and could be considered when access to antibiotics is limited, such as in low- to middle-income countries, and although there are no data supporting the cost-effectiveness of using antibiotics in mild bacterial conjunctivitis, the shortened morbidity associated with their use makes choice of therapy an individual decision.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^113679yM]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris — systemic antibiotics indications and dosing — Systemic antibiotics have been a mainstay of acne treatment for years; they are indicated for use in moderate to severe inflammatory acne and should be used in combination with a topical retinoid and BP. Evidence supports the efficacy of tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), trimethoprim, erythromycin, azithromycin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin. The tetracycline class of antibiotics should be considered first-line therapy in moderate to severe acne, except when contraindicated because of other circumstances (ie, pregnancy, < 8 years of age, or allergy). Minocycline in an extended release form appears safest (at 1 mg/kg), but no dose response was found for efficacy; doxycycline appears effective in the 1.7 to 2.4 mg/kg dose range, and subantimicrobial dosing of doxycycline (ie, 20 mg twice daily to 40 mg daily) has also shown efficacy in patients with moderate inflammatory acne. Azithromycin has been primarily studied in the treatment of acne in open label studies with different pulse dosing regimens ranging from 3 times a week to 4 days a month, with azithromycin being an effective treatment in the time span evaluated — usually 2 to 3 months. A recent randomized controlled trial comparing 3 days per month of azithromycin to daily doxycycline did show superiority of doxycycline. Outside of case reports, there is 1 small, double-blind study showing that TMP/SMX is as effective as oxytetracycline.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111PZ2N8]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

A recent global point prevalence survey of infections in 1,265 intensive care units (ICUs) documented bloodstream infection (BSI) among 15% of patients, and this rate may be increasing over time because of increased use of immunosuppressive drugs, invasive procedures, and older patients who have concomitant medical conditions and who are admitted to intensive care. These infections are a major contributor to patient morbidity and are associated with a doubling or even tripling of mortality. Mortality rates may be higher if delayed or ineffective initial antimicrobial therapy is prescribed, and so it is difficult to reduce broad-spectrum antibiotic use in the initial empiric phase of treatment in this vulnerable patient population. In contrast, it may be more feasible to reduce antibiotic use at the back end of treatment courses. Up to half of the antibiotic use in hospital wards and critical care units is unnecessary or inappropriate, and excessive durations of treatment are the greatest contributor to inappropriate use. A reduction in the length of antibiotic courses is, therefore, a potentially viable strategy to minimize the consequences of antibiotic overuse in critical care, including antibiotic resistance, adverse effects, Clostridium difficile colitis, and costs.

The optimal duration of therapy for primary BSI and BSI secondary to major organ system infections has been poorly defined. A review of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the treatment of infections most commonly encountered in the critical care setting - including guidelines for community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia, intra-abdominal infection, catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), pyelonephritis, and skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) - provides no guidance about the optimal duration of therapy for the subset of patients with bacteremia. In the absence of high-grade evidence, there is wide variability in antibiotic treatment duration recommendations from infectious disease and critical care specialists, and the presence of bacteremia is often used as a justification for extended courses of antibiotic therapy regardless of the observed clinical response to treatment. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining duration of therapy in several organ system infections have demonstrated that treatment can be shortened to 1 week or less without worsening patient outcomes, so it is plausible that treatment duration could potentially be shortened for BSIs as well.

### Update on topical antibiotics in dermatology [^114PAJUq]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Topical antibiotics are used for various purposes in dermatology. Some of the most common uses include treatment of acne, treatment and prevention of wound infection(s), impetigo or impetiginized dermatitis, and staphylococcal nasal carrier state. It is important for the dermatologist to be familiar with the spectrum of activity, the mechanism of action, and the variables that may interfere with the antibiotic of choice. The following discussion will review an update on topical antibiotic use in acne, wound care, impetigo, and in staphylococcal nasal carriers.

### How I manage a patient with MRSA bacteraemia [^116McRrj]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections are common and associated with a high mortality of 15–25%. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infection accounts for 10–40% of cases, and has an even higher mortality. Despite being the 'bread and butter' of clinical infectious diseases practice, robust evidence to guide optimal management is often lacking and there is wide variation in practice.

Objectives

To provide a real-world example of a case of MRSA bacteraemia and the thought processes of the authors as key management decision points are reached.

Sources

The discussion is based on recent literature searches of relevant topics. In making recommendations, randomized clinical trial data have been prioritized and highlighted, and where these are not available recommendations are based on the experience and opinions of the authors.

Content

For a patient with MRSA bacteraemia and a primary bone and joint infection the following points are discussed: empirical antibiotic choice for suspected S. aureus bacteraemia; directed antibiotic choice for MRSA; monitoring and dosing of vancomycin; the role of combination therapy when bacteraemia is persistent; and the duration of therapy and role of switching to oral antibiotics.

Implications

While broad principles of aggressive source control and appropriate choice and duration of antibiotics are important, the heterogeneity of S. aureus bacteraemia means that a tailored rather than algorithmic approach to management is often required. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to strengthen the evidence base for the management of MRSA bacteraemia.

### Nebulized antibiotics for the treatment of refractory bacterial chronic rhinosinusitis [^117Bczsf]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the safety and efficacy of nebulized antibiotics for refractory bacterial chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in adults.

Data Sources

PubMed (up to February 2011) and The Cochrane Library (up to February 2011) were searched using the terms nebulizer, nebulized, antibiotics, and chronic sinusitis.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles reporting clinical trials in adults were evaluated; 4 relevant studies were identified.

Data Synthesis

Conventional therapy for CRS, including pharmacologic treatments (eg, oral antibiotics, corticosteroids, antihistamines) and surgery, are not effective for all patients, which has led to experimentation with nebulized antibiotics. The 4 trials analyzing the effectiveness of nebulized antibiotics for refractory CRS in adults identified in our literature search were diverse in their methods, and different antibiotics were used in each trial. Furthermore, all of the trials had small sample sizes, with the largest comprising 42 patients. Two of the studies compared nebulized antibiotics to nebulized saline, and even though rhinosinusitis symptoms improved, nebulized antibiotics were found to offer no additional benefit over saline. The 2 other trials had no control groups and found that nebulized antibiotics led to an improvement in symptoms. In 1 trial, antibiotics were selected based on the results of sinus cultures, which led to infection resolution in 38 of 50 (76%) treatment courses. Nebulized antibiotics were well tolerated, with only minor adverse effects noted.

Conclusions

Based on current studies, use of nebulized antibiotics for refractory CRS cannot be recommended at this time. Although supportive evidence is limited, nebulized antibiotics appear to improve rhinosinusitis symptoms in some patients with minimal adverse effects. With further studies, culture-directed nebulized antibiotic therapy may be a treatment option in patients with CRS refractory to conventional treatments.

### MRSA new treatments on the horizon: current status [^114TKvLc]. Injury (2011). Low credibility.

There is a choice of anti-MRSA antibiotic available with proven efficacy in the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infection (cSSSI). Additional anti-MRSA antibiotics are in development, which have the potential to influence how such infections are managed. The emergence of resistance to current anti-MRSA agents, toxicity, and general lack of oral agents with proven efficacy for deep seated infection justify the development of new agents. However, there is a relative dearth of information specific to patients with orthopaedic-related infection. Combination therapy is often used in these patients, although there is a paucity of controlled trial data to support particular antibiotic combinations. As the choice of anti-MRSA agents increases, so does the need to identify which are best for the large variety of infections included in the group of cSSSIs. This is particular true for infections occurring in orthopaedic patients where poorly vascularised tissue, trauma or implanted prosthetic material, pose specific challenges.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^115EJrG2]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and associated Gram-negative bacteremia treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly included patients who were afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and had achieved source control (relief of any urinary obstruction) before transitioning to oral antibiotics. An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

### Changes in antibiotic prescription following an education strategy for acute respiratory infections [^113Ae2di]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Infections are one of the most common reasons for consultations in primary care, accounting for approximately one-third of visits to the general practitioner, with half of these visits due to acute respiratory tract infections. There is a large variability in the prescription of antibiotics between health care professionals and countries for the management of patients with acute respiratory tract infections. Inappropriate and excessive antibiotic consumption is the most important factor for the development of antibiotic resistance. In countries with the highest antibiotic use, it is where more multiresistant pathogens are isolated. Also, consumption of one antibiotic agent is associated with a greater propensity to resistance. In addition, there has been an alarming decrease in the research of new antibiotic drugs, with a clinical shortage of new molecules being approved in the past decades. A few antibiotic classes in the pipeline are innovative treatments that will add value to the current antibiotic treatment arsenal.

Unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics is a major contributor to the problem of antimicrobial resistance, and quality improvement efforts appear generally effective at reducing both inappropriate use of antibiotics and choice of antibiotic drugs. A high percentage of antibiotics are prescribed in the primary care setting, with acute lower respiratory tract illness as one of the most common condition. The debate continues about the effect of antibiotics on the course of the disease, concerns regarding complications if antibiotics are not prescribed, or the definition of the clinical characteristics that identify patients at risk for which antibiotics are necessary. Single quality improvement antibiotic prescribing strategies (e.g. no offer or a delayed offer of antibiotics for acute uncomplicated lower respiratory tract infections, rapid antigen testing to detect group A Streptococcal [GAS] infection) have shown to be effective for the rational use of antibiotics. Also, active clinician education may be more effective than passive education, particularly for addressing the antibiotic treatment decision.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess changes in antibiotic prescription following an education intervention for primary health care physicians, based on the knowledge of clinical practice guidelines and availability of rapid antigen detection test for GAS, and on the improvement of antibiotic use for patients with acute respiratory tract infection.

### Advances in antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia [^1135HPLU]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major public health problem all over the world. The increasing number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a matter of concern for physicians when choosing antibiotic treatment in patients with CAP. This review focuses on the current recommendations of antibiotic treatment, recent information concerning antibiotic resistance of pathogens, and the advances in antibiotic therapy in the field of CAP.

Recent Findings

A significant increase in the frequency of resistance to the antibiotics commonly used against causative pathogens of CAP, such as β-lactams or macrolides, has been reported in recent years. At present, the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae remains low. Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 have been reported as causes of severe CAP. Several newly-developed antibiotics, including cepholosporins, ketolides and quinolones, present marked activity in vitro against the main causative pathogens of CAP. Many randomized controlled trials have demonstrated equivalent efficacy of the newer antibiotics compared with conventional antimicrobial therapy in mild-to-moderate CAP.

Summary

An increase of resistance to the antibiotics used in CAP has been documented over the years. Several new antibiotics have been developed for treating CAP, with promising results. However, data regarding their efficacy and safety in patients with severe CAP are lacking.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^115Sosyg]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Key action statement 4B — When additional β-lactamase coverage is needed in acute otitis media (AOM), clinicians should prescribe an antibiotic with additional β-lactamase coverage for AOM when a decision to treat with antibiotics has been made and the child has received amoxicillin in the past 30 days or has concurrent purulent conjunctivitis or has a history of recurrent AOM unresponsive to amoxicillin (Evidence Quality: Grade C, Rec. Strength: Recommendation); benefits include successful treatment of β-lactamase–producing organisms, with risks of cost and increased adverse effects, a preponderance of benefit, the value judgment that efficacy is more important than taste, exclusions of patients with known penicillin allergy, and consideration of patient concerns regarding side effects and taste.

### Antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance facts… [^117PcCKP]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- Antibiotics are drugs that kill certain kinds of germs called bacteria and stop their growth.
- Anytime antibiotics are used, they can cause side effects and contribute to antimicrobial resistance.
- Antibiotics aren't always the answer when you're sick. Use antibiotics only when you need them to protect yourself from harms caused by unnecessary antibiotic use and fight antimicrobial resistance. What is an antibiotic. Antibiotics are drugs that kill certain kinds of germs called bacteria and stop their growth. Antibiotics are critical tools for preventing and treating infections caused by specific bacteria in people, animals and crops. In health care, antibiotics are one of our most powerful drugs for fighting life-threatening bacterial infections. We need antibiotics to treat life-threatening conditions caused by bacteria. What is a virus.

Viruses are germs different from bacteria. They cause infections, such as colds and flu. However, antibiotics do not treat infections caused by viruses. Keep Reading: Take antibiotics ONLY when you need them. Appropriate antibiotic use It's important we use antibiotics only when it is necessary. What is unnecessary antibiotic use. Unnecessary antibiotic use happens when a person takes antibiotics they don't need, like for colds and flu. Unnecessary use also happens when a person takes antibiotics for infections that are sometimes caused by bacteria that do not always need antibiotics, like many sinus infections and some ear infections. Antimicrobial resistance What is antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial resistance happens when germs like bacteria and fungi develop the ability to defeat the drugs designed to kill them. That means the germs continue to grow. Resistant infections can be difficult, and sometimes impossible, to treat.

Bacteria and fungi do not have to be resistant to every antibiotic or antifungal to be dangerous. Resistance to even one antibiotic can mean serious problems. Antimicrobial resistance can affect any person, at any stage of life. Antimicrobial resistance does not mean our body is resistant to antibiotics or antifungals. Many medical advances are dependent on the ability to fight infections using antibiotics, including joint replacements, organ transplants, cancer therapy, and the treatment of chronic diseases like diabetes, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. If antibiotics and antifungals lose their effectiveness, then we lose the ability to treat infections and control these public health threats. Aside from health care, antimicrobial resistance also impacts the veterinary and agriculture industries.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113kBEib]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF research needs and gaps for asymptomatic bacteriuria — priority evidence deficits — highlight the absence of harm studies in nonpregnant adults, limited data on serious outcomes in modern pregnancy, and the need to understand microbiome and antibiotic effects. No studies were identified that addressed the harms of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults. There were few studies that examined asymptomatic bacteriuria and risk of serious outcomes (eg, pyelonephritis or urosepsis) in modern pregnant populations, epidemiologic evidence suggests that the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria has been lower in recent decades and many antibiotics used in older studies are no longer recommended for use in pregnancy, and clinical trials, observational studies, and natural experiments where screening and treatment are not the standard of care or guidelines are changing would be useful. Newer understandings of the human microbiome suggest that bacterial colonization may play a protective role in both mothers and babies, and for pregnant and nonpregnant populations research is needed to better understand the microbiology of a healthy urinary tract and the natural history of asymptomatic bacteriuria. The role of current patterns of antibiotic use is unclear; antibiotic use increases the risk of antimicrobial resistance and can change the microbiome, and more research is needed to understand potential harms and effects on newborn, child, and longer-term health.

### Advances in antibiotic therapy in the critically ill [^115Uw4tT]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Intensive care unit (ICU) patients are particularly likely to have or develop infection, in part because infection is a reason for admission and in part because of immunosuppression associated with critical illness and the large number of invasive devices used in these patients. Correct and adequate antibiotic coverage is essential but can be complex as a result of delayed identification of microorganisms, the impact of critical illness and therapy on pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of antibiotics, and the high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant strains.

In this review, we briefly highlight the importance of early infection diagnosis before discussing some of the key issues related to antibiotic management, including problems associated with timing, duration, and dosing. We also briefly consider ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), the use of inhaled antibiotics, and new antibiotic and adjunct strategies for the future. We focus on bacterial infections and issues associated with multi-drug resistance will not be covered.

### Choosing wisely in healthcare epidemiology and antimicrobial stewardship [^116PSdkr]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship — culture-negative suspected infection: Stop antibiotics in patients whose diagnostic culture(s) are negative unless there is clear evidence of bacterial infection. Patients often receive antibiotic treatment when bacterial infection is suspected but not yet confirmed, and usually, laboratory and radiology information are available after 3 days. Based on test and culture results, antibiotics should be deescalated to a narrow-spectrum antibiotic or discontinued if there is no further evidence of infection. Reducing antibiotic exposure decreases the risk of infections with C. difficile and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and medical professionals should use their local antibiogram to develop guidance for narrow empiric choices to limit patient exposures to unnecessary antibiotics.
