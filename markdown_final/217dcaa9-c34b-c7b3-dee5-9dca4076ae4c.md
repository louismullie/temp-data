## Question

How would you counsel a patient with mild calcific aortic stenosis who asks whether starting atorvastatin will slow the valve's deterioration, and how does SALTIRE guide follow-up planning?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether starting atorvastatin will slow the progression of mild calcific aortic stenosis, and how the SALTIRE trial informs follow-up planning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality randomized evidence on statins for aortic stenosis progression. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines say about statins in calcific aortic stenosis. Next, I will consider mechanistic explanations for why statins might fail despite lowering LDL. After that, I should outline practical follow-up and risk-factor management, including what SALTIRE did and did not show. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and address any lingering uncertainties or exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the pivotal randomized evidence. The SALTIRE trial randomized 155 patients with calcific aortic stenosis to atorvastatin 80 mg daily versus placebo and found no difference in the annual increase in aortic-jet velocity (0.199 m/s/year with atorvastatin vs 0.203 m/s/year with placebo; adjusted mean difference −0.002 m/s/year, 95% CI −0.07 to 0.07; P = 0.95), and no difference in progression of valvular calcification (22.3%/year vs 21.7%/year; ratio 0.998, 99% CI 0.95–1.05; P = 0.93), despite a 53% reduction in LDL cholesterol in the statin arm [^5cc8a8a2] [^9eac6a13].

> Wait, let me verify whether larger, longer trials align with SALTIRE. The ASTRONOMER trial in 269 patients with mild-to-moderate AS showed no reduction in hemodynamic progression with rosuvastatin 40 mg over a median 3.5 years, and the SEAS trial in 1,873 patients likewise found no reduction in AS progression or valve events with simvastatin plus ezetimibe, despite substantial LDL lowering, although ischemic events were reduced, which is a separate issue [^aea5a10d] [^9d2cf98a]. Hold on, I should also check meta-analyses; a Cochrane review of four RCTs including SALTIRE and ASTRONOMER concluded there was no significant effect of statins on valve hemodynamics or clinical outcomes, reinforcing that statins do not slow AS progression [^3b5fd7be].

> Next, I should review guidelines to ensure my interpretation matches current standards. The 2020 ACC/AHA guideline states that statins are indicated for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients with calcific AS, but they are not indicated to prevent hemodynamic progression of AS, which is a Class 3 "no benefit" recommendation with Level A evidence, reflecting the negative RCTs [^ab8da454] [^56bf808e]. I need to ensure I communicate that clearly: statins are appropriate for ASCVD risk reduction, but not for slowing the valve disease itself [^c8d2df03].

> I will now examine why statins might fail mechanistically despite lowering LDL. Let me think about the disease biology: calcific AS progresses from an initiation phase with lipid deposition and inflammation to a propagation phase dominated by fibrosis and calcification; once the latter is established, LDL lowering may be too late to reverse the osteogenic programming of valve interstitial cells, explaining the neutral RCT results despite marked LDL reductions [^9cfa7e65] [^f037aa08]. But wait, what if Lp(a) is the real culprit? Observational and genetic data implicate Lp(a) and oxidized phospholipids in faster progression, and statins do not lower Lp(a), which may blunt any potential benefit and even raise Lp(a) in some studies, though the cardiovascular net benefit of statins remains favorable for ASCVD risk reduction [^7be800e7] [^6d60ebfa] [^c85e9dd0].

> Let me consider the clinical implications for follow-up. SALTIRE did not establish a disease-modifying role for statins, but it did illustrate that patients with calcific AS can be safely monitored with periodic echocardiography and that aggressive LDL lowering is feasible without altering valve outcomes, which supports standard surveillance rather than statin therapy to modify valve progression [^5cc8a8a2]. I should confirm progression benchmarks: in moderate AS, average annual progression is about +0.3 m/s in jet velocity, +7 mm Hg in mean gradient, and −0.1 cm² in valve area, which helps frame expectations during follow-up [^fcc50776].

> Next, I should review practical management and surveillance. For mild calcific AS, I would reassess clinically and with echocardiography about every 1–2 years, escalating frequency if there are signs of progression or new symptoms, and I would treat hypertension, diabetes, and other ASCVD risk factors per guideline-directed medical therapy, while emphasizing smoking cessation and physical activity, because these steps reduce overall cardiovascular risk even if they do not slow valve progression [^e5cba831] [^ab8da454]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overstating surveillance intervals; patient-level progression varies, so individualized follow-up based on severity and trajectory is prudent [^fcc50776].

> I should double-check whether any subgroup or exception changes the calculus. Post hoc analyses from SEAS suggested a signal of slower progression only in patients with mild AS and high baseline LDL, but this was hypothesis-generating and not a prespecified endpoint, so it should not override the overall negative RCTs and guideline stance; similarly, observational studies suggesting benefit are confounded and should not guide practice [^38776d43] [^9d2cf98a]. Let me reconsider: if the patient has very high Lp(a), I would discuss emerging evidence and consider measuring Lp(a), but I would not start a statin for the valve; instead, I would optimize global risk and consider referral if Lp(a) is markedly elevated, recognizing that Lp(a)-lowering trials are ongoing and not yet practice-changing for AS [^c85e9dd0] [^7be800e7].

> Putting this together, I would counsel the patient as follows: Starting atorvastatin will not slow the progression of your mild calcific aortic stenosis, based on high-quality randomized trials including SALTIRE, ASTRONOMER, and SEAS, and this is reflected in current ACC/AHA guidelines that recommend statins only for ASCVD risk reduction, not to modify valve disease progression [^5cc8a8a2] [^aea5a10d] [^9d2cf98a] [^ab8da454]. I should confirm that we will continue standard surveillance with periodic echocardiography and aggressive management of blood pressure and other risk factors, and I will reassess symptoms at each visit because progression to severe AS is unpredictable and intervention is driven by symptoms and ventricular response rather than lipid levels [^fcc50776] [^e5cba831].

Starting atorvastatin **does not slow progression** of mild calcific aortic stenosis [^5cc8a8a2]. The SALTIRE randomized trial showed no reduction in aortic-jet velocity or valve calcification with high-dose atorvastatin over 25 months [^9eac6a13], and this finding is supported by larger trials (SEAS, ASTRONOMER) and meta-analyses [^3b5fd7be] [^8e8c32b8]. Statins remain important for ASCVD risk reduction, but **should not be used to modify valve progression** in mild AS [^ab8da454]. Follow-up should focus on symptom surveillance and periodic echocardiography every 1–2 years, with earlier reassessment if symptoms or new findings arise [^e5cba831].

---

## Evidence from SALTIRE and other randomized trials

- **SALTIRE trial**: 155 patients with calcific AS randomized to atorvastatin 80 mg vs placebo for 25 months; no difference in aortic-jet velocity progression (0.199 vs 0.203 m/s/year; P = 0.95) or calcification (22.3% vs 21.7%/year; P = 0.93) [^5cc8a8a2] [^9eac6a13].

- **SEAS trial**: 1,873 patients with mild-to-moderate AS; simvastatin/ezetimibe reduced LDL by 54% but did not slow hemodynamic progression or reduce valve events, though ischemic events fell [^9d2cf98a].

- **ASTRONOMER trial**: 269 patients with mild-to-moderate AS; rosuvastatin 40 mg did not reduce progression over 3.5 years [^aea5a10d].

- **Meta-analyses**: Consistently show no benefit of statins on AS progression or clinical outcomes [^3b5fd7be] [^8e8c32b8].

---

## Mechanistic considerations

Statins lower LDL and have anti-inflammatory effects, but calcific AS progresses via **fibrocalcific remodeling** driven by osteogenic differentiation of valve interstitial cells; once established, this process is largely irreversible and not responsive to LDL lowering [^9cfa7e65] [^f037aa08]. Lipoprotein(a) and oxidized phospholipids may drive progression, and statins do not meaningfully lower Lp(a), limiting their impact on valve disease [^7be800e7] [^6d60ebfa].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Guidelines advise statins for **ASCVD risk reduction** in calcific AS, but explicitly recommend against statins to prevent hemodynamic progression of AS (Class III, No Benefit) [^ab8da454] [^56bf808e]. This aligns with the negative RCTs and meta-analyses.

---

## Clinical implications for follow-up planning

Given the lack of disease-modifying benefit, follow-up should prioritize:

- **Symptom surveillance**: Educate patients to report dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, or reduced exercise tolerance promptly [^e5cba831].

- **Periodic echocardiography**: Reassess every 1–2 years in mild AS, or sooner if symptoms or new findings emerge [^e5cba831].

- **Risk factor management**: Treat hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia per guidelines to reduce overall cardiovascular risk, recognizing statins are for ASCVD prevention, not AS modification [^ab8da454].

## Summary of evidence

| **Study** | **Intervention** | **Outcome** | **Result** |
|-|-|-|-|
| SALTIRE | Atorvastatin 80 mg | Aortic-jet velocity progression | No difference vs placebo [^5cc8a8a2] |

### A randomized trial of intensive lipid-lowering therapy in calcific aortic stenosis [^9eac6a13]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

The study SALTIRE was published by Cowell SJ and colleagues in 2005 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Aortic stenosis. In the SALTIRE study, the trial question was: what is the role of intensive lipid-lowering therapy in patients with calcific aortic stenosis? In the SALTIRE study, the study design was: single center, double blinded, RCT. In the SALTIRE study, the population was: 155 patients (47 female, 108 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with calcific aortic stenosis. The key exclusion criteria were active or chronic liver disease, a history of alcohol or drug abuse, severe mitral-valve stenosis, severe mitral or aortic regurgitation, LV dysfunction, a planned aortic-valve replacement, or intolerance of statins. In the SALTIRE study, the interventions were: n = 77 atorvastatin (80 mg daily) n = 78 placebo (matching placebo once daily). In the SALTIRE study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in change in aortic-jet velocity (0.199 m/s/y vs. 0.203 m/s/y; MD -0.002, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.07). In the SALTIRE study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in progression in valvular calcification (22.3%/y vs. 21.7%/y; RR 0.998, 99% CI 0.95 to 1.05). In the SALTIRE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the SALTIRE study, the conclusion was: in patients with calcific aortic stenosis, atorvastatin was not superior to placebo with respect to change in aortic-jet velocity.

Aortic stenosis (AS)

Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease and the third most common heart disease, after hypertension and coronary artery disease, in Europe and North America. In the elderly the prevalence of aortic stenosis has been reported to be up to 4%. Aortic sclerosis, the precursor of aortic stenosis, has been found in approximately a third of patients over the age of 65 years. In most patients the underlying cause is calcific AS. This is a chronic progressive disease that begins with thickening and calcification of the valve cusps without haemodynamic significance and ends in heavily calcified, stiff cusps that cause severe valve stenosis. Recent studies have shown that this is not only a degenerative process due to mechanical stress, but also an active process, involving inflammation and lipid infiltration, similar to that seen in atherosclerosis. Epidemiological studies have confirmed that AS and atherosclerosis share several common risk factors: male sex, older age, hypertension, diabetes, smoking and elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and lipoprotein(a). These observations have led to the proposal of pharmacological strategies, already used in atherosclerosis, e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), which may slow the progression of AS. However, the SALTIRE study has shown results contrary to this. This was a double-blind, placebo-control trial (n = 155) in which patients were treated with 80 mg of atorvastatin or matched placebo. They were assessed at follow up (median 25 months) for AS and AV calcification by echocardiography and serum LDL cholesterol. They concluded that intensive lipid-lowering therapy did not halt the progression of calcific aortic stenosis or induce its regression but that large, long-term, randomised trials were needed.

### Plasma lipids and risk of aortic valve stenosis: a mendelian randomization study [^2ee4bad4]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, no RCT has yet assessed the effect of lipid modification for primary prevention of aortic stenosis. However, three randomized trials have investigated the effects of statins in patients with mild to moderate aortic stenosis. Although these trials failed to show a clear benefit for LDL-lowering therapy in delaying the progression of aortic stenosis to eventually require aortic valve replacement, they were mostly limited by a short follow-up duration and insufficient statistical power. Indeed, detecting a relatively small treatment effect on a slowly progressive disease will likely require a substantially large sample size. In addition, our MR analysis reflects the impact of lifelong exposure to higher levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, capturing long-term risks that may not be modifiable by short-term lipid-lowering treatment. Indeed, it is possible that cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis plays a more important role in initiation than in progression of aortic stenosis, which, for practical reasons, has been the main outcome of earlier RCTs. It is possible that an initial damage to the aortic cups disturbs valve function and flow, setting in motion an irreversible cycle of disturbed flow, abnormal pressure, endothelial damage, and calcification that eventually leads to severe stenosis requiring valve replacement. Once a certain threshold of valve damage has been crossed, cholesterol-lowering treatment might not be able to halt progression of aortic valve disease. As aortic stenosis has a long, silent clinically asymptomatic phase, it is plausible that treatment initiation after clinical manifestation might be too late to revert the pathologic process that has been triggered by prolonged exposure to raised lipid levels. A large randomized prospective, placebo vs. high-dose statin clinical trial in patients with subclinical aortic sclerosis or mild aortic stenosis would need to be conducted to test whether statin treatment can slow progression to overt aortic stenosis.

### Emerging medical treatments for aortic stenosis: statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or both? [^26c6b46c]. Heart (2006). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is the most common adult heart valve condition seen in the Western world and its incidence continues to rise. No established disease modifying treatments retard progression of the stenotic process. Recent insights into the pathogenesis of calcific aortic stenosis suggest that the disease mimics atherosclerosis. The natural history and progression of calcific aortic stenosis are described with particular emphasis on new and emerging medical treatments that may modify the disease process. In particular, statins and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors appear to hold promise but definitive evidence from large clinical trials is awaited.

### Is it time to prescribe statins to patients with calcified aortic stenosis? [^9ed37b74]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a common disease especially in the older population. It is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Recent data suggest that coronary artery disease and AS share common risk factors. Retrospective studies suggest that statins might slow the progression of AS but there are no randomized clinical trial data available. It would seem that statins can be considered for medical treatment of AS; however, this needs to be investigated in future randomized clinical trials.

### A randomized trial of intensive lipid-lowering therapy in calcific aortic stenosis [^5cc8a8a2]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

Calcific aortic stenosis has many characteristics in common with atherosclerosis, including hypercholesterolemia. We hypothesized that intensive lipid-lowering therapy would halt the progression of calcific aortic stenosis or induce its regression.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients with calcific aortic stenosis were randomly assigned to receive either 80 mg of atorvastatin daily or a matched placebo. Aortic-valve stenosis and calcification were assessed with the use of Doppler echocardiography and helical computed tomography, respectively. The primary end points were change in aortic-jet velocity and aortic-valve calcium score.

Results

Seventy-seven patients were assigned to atorvastatin and 78 to placebo, with a median follow-up of 25 months (range, 7 to 36). Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations remained at 130 ± 30 mg per deciliter in the placebo group and fell to 63 ± 23 mg per deciliter in the atorvastatin group (P < 0.001). Increases in aortic-jet velocity were 0.199 ± 0.210 m per second per year in the atorvastatin group and 0.203 ± 0.208 m per second per year in the placebo group (P = 0.95; adjusted mean difference, 0.002; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.066 to 0.070 m per second per year). Progression in valvular calcification was 22.3 ± 21.0 percent per year in the atorvastatin group, and 21.7 ± 19.8 percent per year in the placebo group (P = 0.93; ratio of post-treatment aortic-valve calcium score, 0.998; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.947 to 1.050).

Conclusions

Intensive lipid-lowering therapy does not halt the progression of calcific aortic stenosis or induce its regression. This study cannot exclude a small reduction in the rate of disease progression or a significant reduction in major clinical end points. Long-term, large-scale, randomized, controlled trials are needed to establish the role of statin therapy in patients with calcific aortic stenosis.

### Do statins improve outcomes and delay the progression of non-rheumatic calcific aortic stenosis? [^8e8c32b8]. Heart (2011). Low credibility.

Context

It is not known whether statin treatment improves clinical outcomes and reduces aortic stenosis progression in non-rheumatic calcific aortic stenosis.

Objective

A meta-analysis of studies was performed comparing statin therapy with placebo or no treatment on outcomes and on aortic stenosis progression echocardiographic parameters.

Data Sources

The authors searched Medline and Pubmed up to January 2010.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers independently abstracted information on study design (prospective vs retrospective or randomised vs non-randomised), study and participant characteristics. Fixed and random effects models were used. A-priori subanalyses assessed the effect of statins on low-quality (retrospective or non-randomised) and on high-quality (prospective or randomised) studies separately.

Results

Meta-analysis identified 10 studies with a total of 3822 participants (2214 non-statin-treated and 1608 statin-treated); five studies were classified as prospective and five as retrospective; concerning randomisation, three trials were randomised whereas seven were not. No significant differences were found in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality or in the need for aortic valve surgery. Lower-quality (retrospective or non-randomised) studies showed that, in statin-treated patients, the annual increase in peak aortic jet velocity and the annual decrease in aortic valve area were lower, but this was not confirmed by the analysis in high-quality (prospective or randomised) studies. Statins did not significantly affect the progression over time of peak and mean aortic gradient.

Conclusions

Currently available data do not support the use of statins to improve outcomes and to reduce disease progression in non-rheumatic calcific aortic valve stenosis.

### Intensive lipid-lowering therapy for patients with aortic stenosis [^70112593]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

It has been suggested by several retrospective studies that lipid-lowering therapy (compared with treatment with medications other than statins) retards the progression of aortic stenosis. Additional evidence for this has emerged from the prospective (nonrandomized) Rosuvastatin Affecting Aortic Valve Endothelium (RAAVE) study, although not from findings of the randomized, double-blind Scottish Aortic Stenosis and Lipid Lowering Trial, Impact on Regression (SALTIRE). Currently, 2 larger randomized studies of aortic stenosis are in progress. These studies have longer durations than SALTIRE. The Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) study, with 1,873 patients, is the largest study with the longest planned length of treatment (4 to 7 years) that will assess whether lipid-lowering therapy slows the progression of aortic stenosis and the degradation of the aortic valve, thereby potentially reducing the urgency for surgery or at least delaying the need for surgery, relieving adverse hemodynamic consequences of aortic stenosis, and possibly decreasing mortality and morbidity in these patients. The Aortic Stenosis Progression Observation: Measuring Effects of Rosuvastatin (ASTRONOMER) trial, a study of disease progression, involves 272 patients with aortic stenosis, with treatment arms of rosuvastatin 40 mg/d and placebo for 3 to 5 years. In conclusion, the SEAS and ASTRONOMER studies will help resolve the contradictory findings of SALTIRE and RAAVE on the benefit of intensive lipid-lowering treatment in aortic stenosis.

### Disease drivers in aortic stenosis vs atherosclerosis… [^1c94a029]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Aortic stenosis due to fibrosis and calcification of the aortic valve is a hazardous component of cardiovascular disease burden — after developing symptomatic AS, patients survive for an average of less than 2 years without treatment. Alongside the shared presence of many traditional cardiometabolic risk factors, the earliest comparisons of AS and atherosclerotic lesions suggested gross morphological and histological similarities 1 and led to the belief that AS might be an atherosclerosislike disease of the aortic valve. However, the preponderance of basic, clinical, and translational research over the 30 years that followed has shown that this is not entirely true. Fewer than half of patients with valvular calcification also develop vascular calcification, suggesting differential modes of pathogenesis.

Furthermore, prospective clinical trials of statin-mediated lipid lowering have repeatedly failed to provide any benefit in AS outcomes. Indeed, there remain no approved pharmaceutical therapies for AS; aortic valve replacement by surgical or transcatheter approaches is the only option for patients with AS. This unmet clinical need for pharmacotherapeutic strategies tailored specifically to AS has spurred contemporary efforts to unravel the development of this disease from atherosclerosis. Trenkwalder and colleagues2 take an important step in this direction with the first genome-wide association study of AS that is fully adjusted for comorbid coronary artery disease.

### Rationale and design of the EPISODE trial: a randomized controlled trial on the effect of PCSK9 inhibitors in calcific aortic valve stenosis [^2604e487]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) can lead to cardiac adverse outcomes; however, currently, no effective pharmacological interventions are available to prevent or delay disease progression. Emerging evidence has identified significant associations between CAVS and key biomarkers, including Lp(a) (lipoprotein [a]), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9). However, robust evidence from randomized controlled trials is still lacking to substantiate these associations.

Methods

The EPISODE (Effect of PCSK9 Inhibitors on Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis) trial is a prospective, evaluator-blinded, randomized controlled trial designed to assess the therapeutic efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors in patients with CAVS. A total of 160 patients with mild-to-moderate or asymptomatic severe CAVS will be randomly assigned to receive either statin monotherapy or a combination of statins and PCSK9 inhibitors. Participants will undergo follow-up assessments at 3-month intervals for 24months, including transthoracic ultrasonic cardiogram, computed tomography, and quality-of-life evaluations using the EuroQol-5 Dimension-3 Level questionnaire. The primary end point is the annualized change in peak aortic jet velocity, whereas secondary end points encompass changes in aortic valve area, calcification score, incidence of heart valve surgery, and quality of life. Safety end points include all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events.

Conclusions

The trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors in modulating disease progression, reducing adverse cardiovascular events, and improving clinical outcomes in patients with CAVS. The anticipated findings are expected to provide critical insights for developing novel therapeutic strategies for early intervention in CAVS.

### Quest for pharmacotherapy in aortic valve stenosis: the lipid hypothesis [^f037aa08]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis was first described by the French surgeon and anatomist Lazare Riviere in 1663. While the last decade has seen impressive advances in our ability to treat aortic valve stenosis invasively and percutaneously, significant issues remain with regards to the optimal timing of valve replacement, periprocedural risks and long-term durability. There therefore remains major interest in developing medical treatments to halt or slow progression of aortic stenosis, which could obviate the need for surgical intervention altogether. A stitch in time saves nine; however, no pharmacotherapies are currently proven to be effective for the treatment of calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS).

Atherogenic apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), have clearly been implicated in the pathogenesis of aortic stenosis, particularly in the early initiation phase. However, LDL cholesterol lowering with statins or ezetimibe failed to modify progression of aortic valve stenosis in multiple randomised clinical trials (SEAS, SALTIRE and ASTRONOMER). Attention has instead switched to Lp(a), with a growing body of epidemiology, genetics and prospective imaging studies having built a convincing case for elevated Lp(a) levels being associated with an increased incidence of aortic stenosis, increased disease activity, faster disease progression and the more rapid need for aortic valve replacement. Although the pathophysiological mechanisms are still incompletely understood, the procalcific effect of Lp(a) has so far been attributed to its content of oxidised phospholipids (OxPL). One potential mechanism is that the enzyme lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), which binds to plasma lipoproteins including LDL and Lp(a), transforms OxPLs into lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC). In turn, lysoPC is converted by the enzyme autotaxin to lysophosphatidic acid, which has been demonstrated to induce calcification in experimental models through an inflammation-mediated pathway.

### Progressive coronary calcification despite intensive lipid-lowering treatment: a randomised controlled trial [^6aac1c81]. Heart (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of intensive lipid-lowering treatment on coronary artery calcification in a substudy of a trial recruiting patients with calcific aortic stenosis.

Methods

In a double blind randomised controlled trial, 102 patients with calcific aortic stenosis and coronary artery calcification were randomly assigned by the minimisation technique to atorvastatin 80 mg daily or matched placebo. Coronary artery calcification was assessed annually by helical computed tomography.

Results

48 patients were randomly assigned to atorvastatin and 54 to placebo with a median follow up of 24 months (interquartile range 24–30). Baseline characteristics and coronary artery calcium scores were similar in both groups. Atorvastatin reduced serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol (-53%, p < 0.001) and C reactive protein (-49%, p < 0.001) concentrations whereas there was no change with placebo (-7% and 17%, p > 0.95 for both). The rate of change in coronary artery calcification was 26%/year (0.234 (SE 0.037) log arbitrary units (AU)/year; n = 39) in the atorvastatin group and 18%/year (0.167 (SE 0.034) log AU/year; n = 49) in the placebo group, with a geometric mean difference of 7%/year (95% confidence interval -3% to 18%, p = 0.18). Serum low density lipoprotein concentrations were not correlated with the rate of progression of coronary calcification (r = 0.05, p = 0.62).

Conclusion

In contrast to previous observational studies, this randomised controlled trial has shown that, despite reducing systemic inflammation and halving serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, statin treatment does not have a major effect on the rate of progression of coronary artery calcification.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^9d2cf98a]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Aortic stenosis — medical therapy and comorbidities: In asymptomatic aortic stenosis (AS), hypertension (n = 1340) was associated with a 56% higher rate of ischemic cardiovascular events and a 2-fold higher mortality rate (both P < 0.01), while medical therapy for hypertension follows standard guidelines with low-dose initiation and titration; there are no studies addressing specific antihypertensive medications in AS, diuretics may reduce stroke volume, ACE inhibitors may be advantageous, and consideration should be given to a higher target blood pressure for AS. Concurrent coronary artery disease (CAD) is common and all patients should be screened and treated for hypercholesterolemia with guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT); in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of statin therapy for mild to moderate AS, ischemic events were reduced by about 20% despite no reduction in aortic valve event rates. After transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), renin–angiotensin system blocker therapy was associated with a lower 1-year mortality with a relative risk reduction of about 20% to 50% and an absolute risk reduction between 2.4% and 5.0%, with benefit among patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) but not among those with reduced LVEF. Despite experimental and retrospective signals, 3 large well-designed RCTs failed to show benefit of statins for calcific AS progression, and there are no data to support the use of statins for prevention of progression of AS.

### Lipoprotein (a) has no major impact on calcification activity in patients with mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis [^ca6ba915]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Lp(a) and progression of established AS

In previous studies, Lp(a) has also been associated with faster AS progression. This was first demonstrated in a post-hoc analysis of the Aortic Stenosis Progression Observation: Measuring Effects of Rosuvastatin (ASTRONOMER) trial, which evaluated the effect of statin treatment in relatively young patients (mean age 58 years) with mild to moderate AS. Elevated Lp(a) levels were associated with more rapid haemodynamic AS progression on echocardiography over a median follow-up of 3.5 years, especially in younger patients (< 57 years, median). These data suggested that as patients get older, other risk factors or disease mechanisms may come into play as drivers of disease progression. A subsequent post-hoc analysis of two longitudinal imaging studies (Scottish Aortic Stenosis and Lipid Lowering Trial, Impact on Regression (SALTIRE)/Ring of Fire) also supported a role of Lp(a) in older patients (mean age 70 years) with more advanced AS. Patients in the top Lp(a) tertile (> 35 mg/dL) showed higher valvular 18 F-NaF uptake at baseline, which associated with faster CT AVC score progression and a higher HR for valve replacement and cardiovascular disease during follow-up, as compared with patients in the lower tertiles of Lp(a). Although we selected patients with mild to moderate AS and much higher Lp(a) levels in this study, we could not establish a difference in 18 F-NaF uptake between high and low Lp(a) patients.

### Statin therapy of calcific aortic stenosis: hype or hope? [^5318ca03]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Calcific aortic stenosis, with a prevalence of 3–9%, is the most frequent heart valve disease and the main cause for valve replacement in patients over 60 years of age. Once thought to be caused by a passive calcium precipitate within the aortic valve leaflets, there is now increasing evidence that development and progression of calcific aortic valve disease may be triggered by underlying genetic and cardiovascular risk factors, and is regulated by an active cellular process involving inflammatory pathways. Targeted drug therapy to prevent the progression of calcific aortic valve disease should ideally be based on the knowledge of risk factors and the molecular pathogenesis of the disease. Conflicting data exists on the potency of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (i.e. statins) to influence both risk factors and inflammatory pathways by lowering lipid levels and exerting anti-inflammatory properties, respectively. In this review, various aspects of the molecular pathogenesis of calcific aortic stenosis will be summarized and connected with recent experimental and clinical studies that address the potential benefit of the targeted drug therapy by statins in order to prevent the progression of the disease.

### Effect of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase inhibitors on the progression of calcific aortic stenosis [^49573840]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies have supported the hypothesis that calcific aortic stenosis is the product of an active inflammatory process, with similarities to atherosclerosis. We sought to determine whether therapy with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) might slow the progression of aortic stenosis.

Methods and Results

A retrospective study of 174 patients (mean age 68 ± 12 years) with mild to moderate calcific aortic stenosis was conducted. Patients required normal left ventricular function, ≤ 2+ aortic regurgitation, and ≥ 2 echocardiograms performed at least 12 months apart. Fifty-seven patients (33%) received treatment with a statin; the remaining 117 (67%) did not. The statin group was older and had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary disease. During a mean follow-up of 21 months, patients treated with statin had a smaller increase in peak and mean gradient and a smaller decrease in aortic valve area. When annualized, the decrease in aortic valve area for the nonstatin group was 0.11 ± 0.18 cm(2) compared with 0.06 ± 0.16 cm(2) for those treated with a statin (P = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, statin usage was a significant independent predictor of a smaller decrease in valve area (P = 0.01) and a lesser increase in peak gradient (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Statin-treated patients, despite a higher risk profile for progression, had reduced aortic stenosis progression compared with those not treated with a statin. These data provide justification for a prospective randomized trial to substantiate whether statin therapy slows the progression of aortic stenosis.

### PCSK9 and calcific aortic valve stenosis: moving beyond lipids [^60926e10]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

Although not posited by the study directly, it is difficult to believe that lower LDL-C levels correlated with the PCSK9 loss-of-function variant were the sole explanation for protection from CAVS for several reasons. First, interventional studies of the effect statins on CAVS, such as the double-blind, placebo-controlled SALTIRE (Scottish Aortic Stenosis and Lipid Lowering Trial, Impact on Regression) study, demonstrated a > 50% reduction in LDL-C yet found no difference in the progression of valvular calcification in the statin-treated arm. Second, although it is critically important to lower and maintain guideline-directed LDL-C levels, at the cellular and molecular level, it is the oxidized form of LDL (ox-LDL) that increases the calcification potential of human VICs. Cells exposed to ox-LDL increase expression of the phosphate transporter Pit1 and the pro-calcific mediator bone morphogenetic protein-2, both of which were shown to promote transition of VICs to osteoblast-like calcifying cells. The idea that an oxidant-rich milieu promotes calcification may also explain, in part, the link between Lp(a) and CAVS because Lp(a) is the major lipoprotein carrier of oxidized phospholipids. Clinical studies showed that the top tertile of Lp(a) was associated with the highest aortic valve calcification activity by 15 F-NaF positron emission tomography imaging. Thus, to understand the role of PCSK9 in mediating CAVS, it is necessary to look at the biological activity of PCSK9 beyond its effects on regulating lipid levels.

### Statins and progression of calcified aortic stenosis [^c603352b]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence evaluating the efficacy of statins in reducing the progression of calcified aortic stenosis (AS).

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed were searched (all up to November 2006) for studies evaluating the use of statins to reduce the progression of calcified AS. Search terms included statin, HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, calcified AS, valve stenosis, and calcified stenosis. Additional primary trials were located by searching references noted in review articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials published in the English language were selected for review. Primary efficacy outcomes evaluated were changes in aortic valve measurements, hemodynamic measures of AS, and change in measures of AS severity.

Data Synthesis

Two prospective clinical trials and 5 retrospective studies were included in this review. All of the retrospective studies demonstrated that statin use was associated with a statistically significant delay in the progression of AS. One prospective observation trial showed benefit of statin use; however, a large, randomized, double-blind, prospective trial showed no benefit of statin use in decreasing the progression of AS.

Conclusions

An association between statin use and a delay in AS progression has been observed in retrospective studies; however, prospective trials showed conflicting results. Currently, statins cannot be recommended for medical treatment of AS until larger trials are conducted.

### Effect of lipid lowering with rosuvastatin on progression of aortic stenosis: results of the aortic stenosis progression observation: measuring effects of rosuvastatin (ASTRONOMER) trial [^aea5a10d]. Circulation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Aortic stenosis (AS) is an active process with similarities to atherosclerosis. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of cholesterol lowering with rosuvastatin on the progression of AS.

Methods and Results

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in asymptomatic patients with mild to moderate AS and no clinical indications for cholesterol lowering. The patients were randomized to receive either placebo or rosuvastatin 40 mg daily. A total of 269 patients were randomized: 134 patients to rosuvastatin 40 mg daily and 135 patients to placebo. Annual echocardiograms were performed to assess AS progression, which was the primary outcome; the median follow-up was 3.5 years. The peak AS gradient increased in patients receiving rosuvastatin from a baseline of 40.8 ± 11.1 to 57.8 ± 22.7 mm Hg at the end of follow-up and in patients with placebo from 41.6 ± 10.9 mm Hg at baseline to 54.8 ± 19.8 mm Hg at the end of follow-up. The annualized increase in the peak AS gradient was 6.3 ± 6.9 mm Hg in the rosuvastatin group and 6.1 ± 8.2 mm Hg in the placebo group (P = 0.83). Treatment with rosuvastatin was not associated with a reduction in AS progression in any of the predefined subgroups.

Conclusions

Cholesterol lowering with rosuvastatin 40 mg did not reduce the progression of AS in patients with mild to moderate AS; thus, statins should not be used for the sole purpose of reducing the progression of AS. Clinical Trial Registration Information- URL: http://www.controlled-trials.com/.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^c8d2df03]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Aortic stenosis — medical therapy recommendations are: In patients at risk of developing AS (Stage A) and in patients with asymptomatic AS (Stages B and C), hypertension should be treated according to standard GDMT, started at a low dose, and gradually titrated upward as needed, with appropriate clinical monitoring. In all patients with calcific AS, statin therapy is indicated for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerosis on the basis of standard risk scores. In patients who have undergone TAVI, renin-angiotensin system blocker therapy (ACE inhibitor or ARB) may be considered to reduce the long-term risk of all-cause mortality. In patients with calcific AS (Stages B and C), statin therapy is not indicated for prevention of hemodynamic progression of AS.

### Prognosis and risk factors in patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis and their modulation by atorvastatin (20 mg) [^c2b85bb2]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of the prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled Tyrolean Aortic Stenosis Study (TASS) was to characterize the natural history and risk factors and their possible modulation by new-onset atorvastatin treatment (20 mg/day vs placebo) in patients with asymptomatic calcified aortic stenosis. Forty-seven patients without previous lipid-lowering therapy or indications for it according to guidelines at study entry were randomized to atorvastatin treatment or placebo and prospectively followed for a mean study period of 2.3 ± 1.2 years. Patients' prognoses were worse than expected, with 24 (51%) experiencing major adverse clinical events, in most cases the new onset of symptoms followed by aortic valve replacement. In multivariate regression analysis, independent risk factors for worse clinical outcomes were aortic valve calcification, as assessed by multidetector computed tomography, and plasma levels of C-reactive protein. In univariate analysis, mean systolic pressure gradient or an increased N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide plasma level allowed the prediction of major adverse clinical events as well, whereas concomitant coronary calcification, age, and the initiation of atorvastatin treatment had no significant prognostic implication. As shown in a subgroup of 35 patients (19 randomly assigned to atorvastatin and 16 to placebo), annular progression in aortic valve calcification and hemodynamic deterioration were similar in both treatment groups. In conclusion, TASS could demonstrate a poor clinical outcome in patients with asymptomatic calcified aortic stenosis which can be predicted by new risk factors such as strong AVC or increased plasma levels of CRP or NT-proBNP. The study does not support the concept that treatment with a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (20 mg atorvastatin once daily) halts the progression of calcified aortic stenosis.

### Association of mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis progression with higher lipoprotein (a) and oxidized phospholipid levels: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^43b425b7]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Several studies have reported an association of levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) and the content of oxidized phospholipids on apolipoprotein B (OxPL-apoB) and apolipoprotein(a) (OxPL-apo[a]) with faster calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) progression. However, whether this association is threshold or linear remains unclear.

Objective

To determine whether the plasma levels of Lp(a), OxPL-apoB, and OxPL-apo(a) have a linear association with a faster rate of CAVS progression.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial tested the association of baseline plasma levels of Lp(a), OxPL-apoB, and OxPL-apo(a) with the rate of CAVS progression. Participants were included from the ASTRONOMER (Effects of Rosuvastatin on Aortic Stenosis Progression) trial, a multicenter study conducted in 23 Canadian sites designed to test the effect of statin therapy (median follow-up, 3.5 years [interquartile range, 2.9–4.5 years]). Patients with mild to moderate CAVS defined by peak aortic jet velocity ranging from 2.5 to 4.0 m/s were recruited; those with peak aortic jet velocity of less than 2.5 m/s or with an indication for statin therapy were excluded. Data were collected from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2005, and underwent ad hoc analysis from April 1 through September 1, 2018.

Interventions

After the randomization process, patients were followed up by means of echocardiography for 3 to 5 years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Progression rate of CAVS as assessed by annualized progression of peak aortic jet velocity.

Results

In this cohort of 220 patients (60.0% male; mean [SD] age, 58[13] years), a linear association was found between plasma levels of Lp(a) (odds ratio [OR] per 10-mg/dL increase, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03–1.19; P = 0.006), OxPL-apoB (OR per 1-nM increase,1.06; 95% CI, 1.01–1.12; P = 0.02), and OxPL-apo(a) (OR per 10-nM increase,1.16; 95% CI, 1.05–1.27; P = 0.002) and faster CAVS progression, which is marked in younger patients (OR for Lp[a] level per 10-mg/dL increase, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.07–1.33; P = 0.002]; OR for OxPL-apoB level per 1-nM increase, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.02–1.17; P = 0.01]; and OR for OxPL-apo[a] level per 10-nM increase, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.10–1.45; P = 0.001]) and remained statistically significant after comprehensive multivariable adjustment (β coefficient, ≥ 0.25; SE, ≤ 0.004 [P ≤ .005]; OR, ≥ 1.10 [P ≤ .007]).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study demonstrates that the association of Lp(a) levels and its content in OxPL with faster CAVS progression is linear, reinforcing the concept that Lp(a) levels should be measured in patients with mild to moderate CAVS to enhance management and risk stratification.

### Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibition to prevent progression of calcific aortic stenosis [^3fd0639e]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our study, we categorised five DPP-4 inhibitors into favourable and unfavourable according to anticalcification abilities and cardiac tissue distribution profiles. Importantly, we found that among patients with diabetes and mild-to-moderate AS, those who received favourable DPP-4 inhibitors (ie, inhibitors with high anticalcification ability and high H:P ratios) had significantly lower degree of increase in Vmax as well as lower frequency of AS progression and aortic valve intervention than those who received unfavourable DPP-4 inhibitors or did not receive DPP-4 inhibitors. These results warrant the need for clinical trials on the repositioning of DPP-4 inhibitors for the management of AS.

AS is a progressive condition characterised by long asymptomatic phase; accordingly, AS has been traditionally regarded as a typical disease entity of prolonged 'wear and tear'. Nevertheless, recent molecular studies showed that aortic valve has VICs with unique homeostatic mechanisms, and that valvular degeneration starts with active inflammation involving biochemical, humoral and genetic factors. As lipid-lowering agents failed to show efficacy in preventing AS progression, researchers have investigated potential therapeutic molecular targets including lipoprotein (a), apolipoprotein B oxidised phospholipidand interleukin 11. Similarly, the target of medical interventions has greatly expanded and ranges from the classic calcification (SALTIRE 2 trial using denosumab or bisphosphonate; NCT02132026) to the matrix before calcification (BASIK 2 trial targeting matrix γ-carboxyglutamic acid protein; NCT02917525).

### Traditional cardiovascular risk factors and their relation to future surgery for valvular heart disease or ascending aortic disease: a Case-referent study [^140bbb3b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Aortic Stenosis

Surgery for aortic stenosis is the most common valvular intervention in the population and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. 17 There are no known methods to halt the process, and surgery is the ultimate treatment. 18 Several studies have focused on an association between aortic stenosis and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In a cross‐sectional study of 5201 subjects older than 65 years, age, sex, lipoprotein(a), low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, and history of hypertension were more common in subjects with aortic sclerosis and aortic stenosis. 7 Three randomized trials (SALTIRE [Stenosis and Lipid Lowering Trial, Impact on Regression], SEAS [Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis], and ASTRONOMER [Aortic Stenosis Progression Observation Measuring Effects of Rosuvastatin]) have tested the hypothesis that statins slow the progression rate and reduce the risk for aortic valvular replacement. 9, 10, 11 The process leading to aortic stenosis resembles vascular wall atherosclerosis, and animal and retrospective human studies have indicated that statin use can slow the progress of aortic stenosis. However, none of the 3 studies showed any effect on progression rate, and plausible explanations might be late initiation of treatment of an advanced valvular disease, the existence of several phenotypes of the disease, or the existence of as‐yet unknown risk factors. Aortic stenosis also exhibit unexplained sex‐related differences in occurrence, pathophysiology, and prognosis. 19, 20, 21 Other pathways may be important; recently, high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein was reported to be an independent risk marker for aortic valvular replacement in the SEAS study, suggesting that inflammatory processes may be important. 22 We have previously shown a cross‐sectional association between high levels of leptin, lipoprotein(a), and tissue plasminogen activator mass and aortic stenosis requiring surgery. 23

In this study, with a focus on traditional risk factors, we found that hypertension, high cholesterol levels, a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and active smoking predicted independently the development of aortic stenosis, also after exclusion of patients with surgery within 5 years from the baseline survey. However, after exclusion of cases with visible coronary artery disease, none of the risk factors remained significant, although possibly indicating an effect of hypertension, which was also observed in the SEAS trial. 24 Of note, valvular defects, such as bicuspid valves, were not studied as predictors because echocardiography was not performed at baseline. Clearly, more research is needed to identify risk factors amenable for intervention. 25 Our study, with well‐characterized phenotypes, shows the importance of separating isolated aortic valvular disease from concomitant coronary artery disease.

### Calcific aortic valve stenosis: hard disease in the heart: a biomolecular approach towards diagnosis and treatment [^9cfa7e65]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Statins

Statins are widely used for lipid lowering in atherosclerosis and inflammation, being a specific inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutarylco-enzyme A-reductase (HMG-CoA-reductase). Although retrospective studies suggested that statins might also be of benefit in CAVS, subsequent RCTs demonstrated that statins in fact have no effect on CAVS progression or clinical outcomes. This conclusion was confirmed by a subsequent meta-analysis. The most plausible explanation for this failure is that whilst statins might intervene with inflammation and lipid deposition in the initiation phase, they have little effect once the propagation phase has become established when fibrosis and calcification are the dominant pathological processes.

Lipoprotein(a)

Lipoprotein(a), the preferential plasma carrier of oxidized phospholipids, is an LDL-like particle, containing additional apolipoprotein(a) and apolipoprotein-B100. A causal relationship between AVC and a single nucleotide polymorphism in the LPA locus was suggested. Although the precise mechanisms of action of Lp(a) require further elucidation, there is considerable interest in investigating whether Lp(a) is a modifiable target in CAVS. Statins are ineffective in reducing Lp(a); however, several other therapeutic agents are currently in different stages of investigation. IONIS-APO(a) Rx and IONIS-APO(a)-L Rx ([Ligand-conjugated] antisense oligonucleotides targeting hepatic apolipoprotein(a) mRNA) have been investigated in Phase 1 and 2 trials, demonstrating an ability to reduce Lp(a) concentrations. Other promising Lp(a) lowering alternatives are proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors and Niacin. The effects of Niacin/PCSK9 on aortic stenosis are currently being investigated ('EAVaLL'. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02109614 and 'PCSK9 inhibitors in the progression of aortic stenosis', Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03051360).

### Effects of rosuvastatin on progression of stenosis in adult patients with congenital aortic stenosis (PROCAS trial) [^561622ff]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Recent trials have failed to show that statin therapy halts the progression of calcific aortic stenosis (AS). We hypothesized that statin therapy in younger patients with congenital AS would be more beneficial, because the valve is less calcified. In the present double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 63 patients with congenital AS (age 18 to 45 years) were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg of rosuvastatin daily (n = 30) or matched placebo (n = 33). The primary end point was the progression of peak aortic valve velocity. The secondary end points were temporal changes in the left ventricular mass, ascending aortic diameter, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). The median follow-up was 2.4 years (interquartile range 1.9 to 3.0). The mean increase in peak velocity was 0.05 ± 0.21 m/s annually in the rosuvastatin group and 0.09 ± 0.24 m/s annually in the placebo group (p = 0.435). The annualized change in the ascending aorta diameter (0.4 ± 1.7 mm with rosuvastatin vs 0.5 ± 1.6 mm with placebo; p = 0.826) and left ventricular mass (1.1 ± 15.8 g with rosuvastatin vs -3.7 ± 30.9 g with placebo; p = 0.476) were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Within the statin group, the NT-proBNP level was 50 pg/ml (range 19 to 98) at baseline and 21 pg/ml (interquartile range 12 to 65) at follow-up (p = 0.638). NT-proBNP increased from 40 pg/ml (interquartile range 20 to 92) to 56 pg/ml (range 26 to 130) within the placebo group (p = 0.008). In conclusion, lipid-lowering therapy with rosuvastatin 10 mg did not reduce the progression of congenital AS in asymptomatic young adult patients. Interestingly, statins halted the increase in NT-proBNP, suggesting a potential positive effect of statins on cardiac function in young patients with congenital AS.

### Lipoprotein (a) is robustly associated with aortic valve calcium [^6c1e0278]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Lp(a) is considered to play a role during both the initiation and progression phase of AVS. However, as calcium begets calcium, Lp(a) lowering is less likely to abrogate the accelerated calcification phase towards clinically overt AVS. This notion is in line with previous trials which found low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering with statins and/or ezetimibe to be an unsuccessful strategy to attenuate AVS progression, despite LDL-C being implicated in the development of AVS. Namely, a recent post-hoc subanalysis of the Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) trial indicated that simvastatin/ezetimibe seemed to impede aortic jet velocity progression in a subgroup of patients with mild stenosis and high baseline LDL-C levels, whereas those who already had moderate stenosis and low baseline LDL-C did not benefit. Similarly, we envision that those with elevated Lp(a) would benefit most from Lp(a) lowering at earlier stages of AVC.

We show that the individuals with Lp(a) concentrations above the 80th percentile are characterised by a vastly increased prevalence of AVC from a young age. It may be hypothesised that the prolonged presence of AVC in these individuals predisposes to progression to end-stage AVS, supported by an association between Lp(a) and AVC quantity in the current study. Moreover, previous imaging studies using sodium fluoride indeed showed that asymptomatic patients with AVS with higher Lp(a) are characterised by increased active valvular calcification, more progression on follow-up echocardiography and CT, and more valve-related events. With Lp(a) lowering therapies on the horizon, timing of intervention in those who would benefit most is crucial. CT imaging might be a promising method to screen asymptomatic individuals with high Lp(a) for the presence of AVC, the earliest discernible disease stage of AVS. Such a cohort would provide an ideal testing ground to assess whether Lp(a) lowering therapy can delay or prevent end-stage aortic valve disease. As 28.9% of individuals with AVC are characterised by elevated Lp(a) concentrations (≥ 80th percentile, corresponding to approximately 50 mg/dL), more than one in four individuals with AVC may benefit from Lp(a) lowering treatment.

### Bone modifiers and the quest to slow progression of aortic stenosis [^27060d82]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) will likely become increasingly frequent with the aging of the American population. The difficulties in treating elderly patients with critical AS emphasize the potential value of a strategy to slow the advancement of aortic valve calcification. Recent prospective trials of statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been disappointing. New options are needed to achieve a truly effective strategy for retarding the advancement of AS. In this context, the observations of Skolnick et al appearing in this issue of The American Journal of Cardiology are particularly intriguing. In a retrospective review of patients followed for mild or moderate AS, these investigators found that 18 patients receiving treatment for osteoporosis had significantly less decrement in aortic valve area on follow-up echocardiography than 37 not receiving such treatment. The most attractive explanation is an action of drug therapy for osteoporosis, most often bisphosphonates, to retard aortic valve calcification. The mechanism for this action is not clear, although numerous possibilities can be postulated on the basis of the multiple complex processes controlling tissue calcification. In conclusion, the investigators' findings deserve further study to clarify drug impact on aortic valve calcification as well as confirm the clinical findings in a larger and more diverse population. Such investigation should also assess the role of vitamin D and calcium supplementation, common features of treatment for osteoporosis. Currently available results are too preliminary to justify the use of bisphosphonates or other osteoporosis therapies to slow the progression of AS.

Methods

Study populations

Patients investigated in this study were drawn from across 2 multimodality imaging studies that prospectively collected data with respect to AS progression and adverse clinical events: the Ring of Fire studyand the SALTIRE (Scottish Aortic Stenosis and Lipid Lowering Trial, Impact on Regression)(Figure 1). Both studies were conducted with local research ethics committee approval and with the written informed consent of all participants.

In the Ring of Fire study, patients age > 50 years and matched control subjects were recruited from the outpatient department of the Edinburgh Heart Centre. PET, CT calcium scoring, and echocardiography were performed to assess disease activity and progression in a total of 81 patients. Patients were prospectively followed at the outpatient clinic for adverse clinical outcomes. For the present study, we included all AS patients who had baseline samples available for Lp(a) and OxPL measurements, as well as available progression data: 80 of 81 (98.8%) patients.

SALTIRE was a prospective trial assessing the effect of high-dose statin on AS progression. Patients with calcific AS, defined as a peak aortic jet velocity > 2.5 m/s and aortic valve calcification on echocardiography, were eligible for inclusion. The main exclusion criteria were pre-existing statin therapy, planned aortic valve replacement, and moderate or severe left ventricular systolic impairment. Echocardiography was performed at baseline, at each annual visit, and before withdrawal from the trial. For the present study, all patients who had baseline Lp(a) and OxPL-apoB measurements and available echocardiographic progression data were included: 65 of 155 (41.9%) patients. These patients had similar baseline characteristics compared with the subjects in whom baseline Lp(a) and OxPL measurements were not available (Online Table 1).

Lp(a), OxPL and autotaxin measurements

Plasma Lp(a) and OxPL-apoB were measured in all patients in both cohorts using chemiluminescent immunoassays, as previously described. Autotaxin (ATX) associated with Lp(a) and apoB was also measured.

### Atorvastatin effect on aortic dilatation and valvular calcification progression in bicuspid aortic valve (BICATOR): a randomized clinical trial [^60f789d4]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Ascending aorta dilation and aortic valve degeneration are common complications in patients with bicuspid aortic valve. Several retrospective studies have suggested the benefit of statins in reducing these complications. This study aimed to determine whether atorvastatin treatment is effective in reducing the growth of aortic diameters in bicuspid aortic valve and if it slows the progression of valve calcification.

Methods

In a randomized clinical trial, 220 patients with bicuspid aortic valve (43 women; 46 ± 13 years of age) were included and treated with either 20 mg of atorvastatin per day or placebo for 3 years. Inclusion criteria were ≥ 18 years of age, nonsevere valvular dysfunction, nonsevere valve calcification, and ascending aorta diameter ≤ 50 mm. Computed tomography and echocardiography studies were performed at baseline and after 3 years of treatment.

Results

During follow-up, 28 patients (12.7%) discontinued medical treatment (15 on atorvastatin and 13 taking placebo). Thus, 192 patients completed the 36 months of treatment. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased significantly in the atorvastatin group (median [interquartile range], -30 mg/dL [-51.65 to -1.75 mg/dL] versus 6 mg/dL [-4, 22.5 mg/dL]; P < 0.001). The maximum ascending aorta diameter increased with no differences between groups: 0.65 mm (95% CI, 0.45–0.85) in the atorvastatin group and 0.74 mm (95% CI, 0.45–1.04) in the placebo group (P = 0.613). Similarly, no significant differences were found for the progression of the aortic valve calcium score (P = 0.167) or valvular dysfunction.

Conclusions

Among patients with bicuspid aortic valve without severe valvular dysfunction, atorvastatin treatment was not effective in reducing the progression of ascending aorta dilation and aortic valve calcification during 3 years of treatment despite a significant reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^ab8da454]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) medical therapy — hypertension in patients at risk of developing AS (Stage A) and in patients with asymptomatic AS (Stages B and C) should be treated according to standard guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), started at a low dose, and gradually titrated upward as needed, with appropriate clinical monitoring (COR 1, LOE B-NR). In all patients with calcific AS, statin therapy is indicated for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerosis on the basis of standard risk scores (COR 1, LOE A). In patients who have undergone TAVI, renin–angiotensin system blocker therapy (ACE inhibitor or ARB) may be considered to reduce the long-term risk of all-cause mortality (COR 2b, LOE B-NR). In patients with calcific AS (Stages B and C), statin therapy is not indicated for prevention of hemodynamic progression of AS (COR 3: No Benefit, LOE A).

### High-sensitivity troponin I concentrations are a marker of an advanced hypertrophic response and adverse outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis [^15ea219c]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Two cohorts of stable patients with aortic stenosis were recruited from cardiology outpatient clinics across three centres in Southeast Scotland. First, we determined the association between plasma cardiac troponin I (cTnI) concentrations and LV functional and structural abnormalities on cardiac magnetic resonance (Mechanism Cohort), and second, we examined the prognostic role of plasma cTnI concentrations in patients with aortic stenosis (Outcome Cohort). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local research ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Patient populations

Mechanism Cohort

Patients with mild to severe aortic stenosis were recruited prospectively. We excluded patients who had other significant (moderate or severe) valvular heart disease or cardiomyopathies (acquired or inherited). Presence of coronary artery disease was defined by previous infarction, clinical symptoms of angina (in those with mild or moderate aortic stenosis), evidence of myocardial ischaemia, or > 50% luminal stenosis in a major epicardial vessel. In addition, thirteen age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers without clinically significant heart disease were recruited from the local community.

Outcome Cohort

The Outcome Cohort comprised patients recruited into the Scottish Aortic Stenosis and Lipid Lowering Trial, Impact of REgression (SALTIRE) study. The study design and inclusion and exclusion criteria have been described previously. In brief, from March 2001 to April 2002, 155 patients with asymptomatic moderate to severe aortic stenosis were randomly assigned to receive either atorvastatin 80 mg or placebo once daily. Patients were excluded if they were already on a statin, if AVR was planned, or if they had moderate or severe LV systolic impairment. Only patients with plasma samples available for cTnI analysis were included in the present analysis.

### Pathophysiology, emerging techniques for the assessment and novel treatment of aortic stenosis [^b92fe5d2]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our perspectives are shifting from passive monitoring to active management for the assessment and treatment of those with AS. Insight into the two stages of CAS, initiation and propagation, have proven to be invaluable, providing novel management options. Of particular interest is Lp(a), which can play a multifaceted role in genetic screening, biomarker measurement and targeted treatment. Further studies into cellular pathology are warranted to contextualise current research and identify additional biomarkers, increasing the specificity of a multimarker screening approach. In addition to this, asymptomatic management has the potential to be revolutionised through the use of therapeutics to slow disease progression and CMR to guide early valve replacement. Validation of advanced patient stratification and diagnostic workup could propagate the widespread adoption of personalised AS therapy. Although many pharmacotherapies have exhibited potential, an increase in the number of prospective RCTs, with the larger cohort sizes of retrospective studies, is necessary to validate their clinical efficacy in reducing CAS burden.

### Effect modifications of lipid-lowering therapy on progression of aortic stenosis (from the simvastatin and ezetimibe in aortic stenosis [SEAS] study) [^abe4fc78]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Observational studies indicate that low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol acts as a primary contributor to an active process leading to aortic stenosis (AS) development. However, randomized clinical trials have failed to demonstrate an effect of lipid lowering on impeding AS progression. This study explored if pretreatment LDL levels and AS severity altered the efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy. The study goal was evaluated in the analysis of surviving patients with baseline data in the Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) trial of 1,873 asymptomatic patients with mild-to-moderate AS. Serially measured peak aortic jet velocity was the primary effect estimate. Linear mixed model analysis adjusted by baseline peak jet velocity and pretreatment LDL levels was used to assess effect modifications of treatment. Data were available in 1,579 (84%) patients. In adjusted analyses, lower baseline peak aortic jet velocity and higher pretreatment LDL levels increased the effect of randomized treatment (p = 0.04 for interaction). As such, treatment impeded progression of AS in the highest quartile of LDL among patients with mild AS at baseline (0.06m/s per year slower progression vs placebo in peak aortic jet velocity, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.11, p = 0.03), but not in the 3 other quartiles of LDL. Conversely, among patients with moderate AS, there was no detectable effect of treatment in any of the pretreatment LDL quartiles (all p ≥ 0.14). In conclusion, in a non-prespecified post hoc analysis, the efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy on impeding AS progression increased with higher pretreatment LDL and lower peak aortic jet velocity (SEAS study: NCT00092677).

### Patient information: calcific aortic stenosis… [^e5cba831]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Patients with mild to moderate calcific aortic stenosis often have no symptoms, and even those with severe aortic stenosis can be symptom free for a few years. The most common early symptoms of aortic stenosis are decreased exercise tolerance and shortness of breath with physical activity. Patients with more severe aortic stenosis may have leg swelling, shortness of breath at rest and while lying flat, and extreme fatigue. Chest pain, lightheadedness, and fainting are less common but may occur with severe aortic stenosis. Due to the chronic progressive course of aortic stenosis, patients should promptly report new or worsening symptoms to avoid treatment delays. Asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis should undergo clinical examination and echocardiography at intervals from every 6 months to every 5 years, depending on their disease severity.

Referral to a cardiologist is recommended for patients with severe aortic stenosis or those with symptoms of aortic stenosis and an abnormal aortic valve on echocardiography. No currently available medications slow progression of calcific aortic stenosis. However, management of high blood pressure and smoking cessation can help reduce risk of more rapid progression of aortic stenosis and decrease risk of coronary heart disease. Aortic valve replacement is recommended for patients who have symptoms due to severe aortic stenosis. There are 2 main approaches to AVR: Surgical AVR involves open-heart surgery with removal of the aortic valve and replacement with a new valve that is either mechanical or tissue.

Transcatheter AVR is a less invasive procedure in which a new aortic valve is inserted through a catheter, usually in the groin, and guided through the arterial system to the heart. Once placed, the new valve expands, and the old valve is pushed aside. Patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who do not undergo AVR have a 50% mortality rate at 1 year. However, patients who undergo either SAVR or TAVR have similar survival rates as people without aortic stenosis.

### Rationale, design, and baseline characteristics of a randomized trial to assess the effect of cholesterol lowering on the progression of aortic stenosis: the aortic stenosis progression observation: measuring effects of rosuvastatin (ASTRONOMER) trial [^545199ac]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a common health problem in the western world. Recent studies have suggested that cholesterol lowering may have a salutary effect on the progression of AS. The primary objective of the ASTRONOMER study is to determine whether patients with AS randomized to rosuvastatin will experience less progression in AS severity as measured by aortic transvalvular gradients and valve areas. The secondary objectives are to determine the effect of rosuvastatin on the rate of cardiac death and aortic valve replacement and to assess the time to outcome during a follow-up of 3 to 5 years.

Method

This is a double-blind placebo-controlled study. Patients with mild to moderate AS are randomized to receive 40 mg/d of rosuvastatin or placebo. Patients with any clinical indication for the use of cholesterol-lowering agents according to the 2000 Canadian guidelines are excluded.

Results

Recruitment of 272 patients from 23 Canadian sites was completed in December 2005. Compared with patients with AS in published trials, the patients in the ASTRONOMER study are younger (58.1 ± 13.6 years), have less severe AS (AS jet velocity 3.2 ± 0.4 m/s), and are composed of a great proportion (48.9%) of patients with bicuspid aortic valve.

Conclusions

Prevention of the development of severe AS needs to be tested in large randomized studies. Recruitment for the ASTRONOMER trial has been completed and results will be available at the end of 2008.

### Rosuvastatin affecting aortic valve endothelium to slow the progression of aortic stenosis [^f1fb1ed0]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to test the effect of a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitor on the progression of moderate to severe aortic stenosis as measured by echocardiography.

Background

Recent retrospective studies support the hypothesis that statins slow the progression of aortic stenosis.

Methods

We performed an open-label, prospective study evaluating 121 consecutive patients with asymptomatic moderate to severe aortic stenosis (aortic valve area ≥ 1.0 cm2; mean age 73.7 ± 8.9 years; 57 men and 64 women), treated with and without rosuvastatin according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Echocardiographic, serum lipid, and inflammatory markers were measured at baseline and every 6 months for 18 months.

Results

Sixty-one patients (50.4%) with elevated LDL (159.7 ± 33.4 mg/dl), aortic valve velocity (3.65 ± 0.64 m/s), and aortic valve area (1.23 ± 0.42 cm2) received rosuvastatin (20 mg/day), and 60 (49.6%) with a normal LDL (118.6 ± 37.4 mg/dl), aortic valve velocity (3.62 ± 0.61 m/s), and aortic valve area (1.20 ± 0.35 cm2) received no statin. During a mean follow-up of 73 ± 24 weeks, the change in aortic valve area in the control group was -0.10 ± 0.09 cm2/year versus -0.05 ± 0.12 cm2/year in the rosuvastatin group (p = 0.041). The increase in aortic valve velocity was 0.24 ± 0.30 m/s/year in the control group and 0.04 ± 0.38 m/s/year in the rosuvastatin group (p = 0.007). There was significant improvement in serum lipid and echocardiographic measures of aortic stenosis in the statin group.

Conclusions

Prospective treatment of aortic stenosis with rosuvastatin by targeting serum LDL slowed the hemodynamic progression of aortic stenosis. This is the first prospective study that shows a positive effect of statin therapy for this disease process.

### Lipoprotein (a) and the apolipoprotein B / A1 ratio independently associate with surgery for aortic stenosis only in patients with concomitant coronary artery disease [^6f970586]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Lipids and Risk of AS

Several lipoproteins are associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Previously, in a large cohort, Apo B and non‐HDL cholesterol were strongly correlated with the presence of coronary calcium. 34 However, the Apo B/Apo A1 ratio may predict the risk of atherosclerotic disease better than the LDL/HDL ratio, 9 and a high Apo B/A1 ratio was strongly associated with MI in the INTERHEART case‐control study. 35 High levels of total cholesterol and LDL have also been associated with the presence and development of AS. 36, 37, 38, 39

Based on this knowledge, 3 randomized placebo‐controlled trials were performed with the aim of reducing progression of aortic valve stenosis with statins: the SALTIER (Scottish Aortic Stenosis and Lipid Lowering Trial, Impact on Regression), the SEAS (Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis), and the ASTRONOMER trials. In the SALTIER trial, 155 patients with asymptomatic aortic valve calcium deposits were followed for 25 months. 40 LDL levels were lowered by 53% in the treatment arm, but no differences in aortic‐jet velocity were identified. In the SEAS trial, 1873 patients with mild to moderate asymptomatic stenosis were followed for 52 months. 3 The primary outcome was a composite of major cardiovascular events including AVR. LDL levels were reduced by 54% in the treatment arm, but neither a change in peak aortic‐jet velocity nor the incidence of AVR differed between arms. However, the incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events was lower in the active treatment arm. Notably, levels of Apo B were significantly lower in the treatment arm, 41 but Apo B levels did not predict AS in another study. 13 In the ASTRONOMER trial 269 patients with mild to moderate AS were followed for 3.5 years. 5 LDL‐cholesterol was reduced by 55%, but no effects were observed on progression rate. Lp(a) levels were not reported in the SEAS or the SALTIER trials.

The development of AS is a complex process involving several pathways, including lipid deposition, inflammation, and calcification. 1 Once these processes are initiated, statins and LDL‐lowering treatments may not affect the process; however, most trials have implemented relatively short treatment periods. A potentially positive effect of statins may be counteracted by an increase in Lp(a) levels. 42 Furthermore, clinical trials typically include patients who fulfill specific criteria; thus, the results of those studies may not be generalizable to patients with multiple comorbidities and risk factors for AS.

### Impact of high-dose atorvastatin therapy and clinical risk factors on incident aortic valve stenosis in patients with cardiovascular disease (from TNT, IDEAL, and SPARCL) [^31ed8b33]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical trials have not provided evidence for a role of statin therapy in reducing aortic valve stenosis (AVS) severity in patients with documented AVS. However, whether statin therapy could prevent the onset of AVS is unknown. Our objectives were (1) to compare the incidence rates of AVS among patients treated with high-dose versus usual-dose statin or placebo and (2) to identify clinical risk factors associated with the development of AVS. We conducted post hoc analyses in 23,508 participants from 3 large-scale multicenter atorvastatin randomized blinded clinical trials: Treating to New Targets, the Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering, and the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels. The main outcome measure was the incidence of clinical AVS over a median follow-up of 4.9 years (82 cases). Among patients who developed AVS, 39 (47.6%) were treated with atorvastatin 80 mg and 43 (52.4%) were treated with lower dose statin (atorvastatin 10 mg in Treating to New Targets, simvastatin 20 to 40 mg in Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering, or placebo in Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels; hazard ratio [HR] 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59 to 1.41, p = 0.67). In multivariate analyses forcing treatment, sex, and race into the model, factors that were significantly associated with AVS included age (HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.61 to 2.93, p < 0.0001 per 1-SD increment), diabetes (HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.80, p = 0.05), vitamin K antagonist use (HR 3.25, 95% CI 2.06 to 5.16, p < 0.0001), and previous statin use (HR 2.65, 95% CI 1.54 to 4.60, p = 0.0008). In conclusion, random allocation to high-dose versus usual-dose statin therapy or placebo did not impact the incidence of AVS among patients without known AVS. Age, diabetes, vitamin K antagonists, and previous statin use were significant predictors of incident AVS in these high-risk patients.

### Association of high-sensitivity troponin T with outcomes in asymptomatic non-severe aortic stenosis: a post-hoc substudy of the SEAS trial [^92632c0b]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Degenerative calcific aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a growing, global health problem affecting up to 12.4%of the projected 1.5 billion elderly aged above 65 years in 2050. Due to a shared link with age and atherosclerotic risk factors, coronary artery disease (CAD) coexists in up to 75% of older adults with AS. The association between prevalent AS and CAD, is unmistakable as 1 of 3 symptomatic patients undergo concomitant aortic valve replacement (AVR) and coronary revascularisation. Consequently, it may be challenging to determine whether new-onset symptoms of angina pectoris or heart failure are due to progression of AS or CAD in patients with initially asymptomatic AS.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin is an established biomarker of ischaemia and cardiomyocyte injury due to cardiac pressure overload. Still, there are no guideline recommendations for high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) guided monitoring during the watchful waiting of patients with AS. The current literature mainly consists of observational studies in heterogeneous populations investigating whether single measurements of cardiac troponin levels can be used as a marker of left ventricular remodelling on the pathway to end-stage heart failure and a need for AVR in severe AS. In the clinical setting, it is undetermined which hsTnT levels can be expected in an outpatient population of stable patients with asymptomatic non-severe AS. Similarly, it is unclear if hsTnT primarily associates with CAD or AS severity in patients without hemodynamically significant AS and if serial hsTnT measurements may aid further in this regard.

We, therefore, conducted an observational post-hoc analysis of the large, randomised SEAS trial(Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis), which investigated the effect of lipid-lowering therapy in 1873 patients with asymptomatic mild to moderate-severe AS, preserved systolic function and no history or symptoms of CAD. Our main objectives were: 1) to explore what patient characteristics are associated with hsTnT concentration; 2) hsTnT trajectory during one year of follow-up; and 3) to assess if hsTnT concentration at baseline is associated with adverse clinical outcomes, particularly isolated AVR, ischaemic coronary events (ICE), and all-cause mortality. We hypothesised that an hsTnT level > 14 pg/mL at baseline would be associated with more severe AS and herald a higher risk of isolated AVR, ICE, and mortality.

### Effect of denosumab or alendronic acid on the progression of aortic stenosis: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^74345f18]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

To be clinically meaningful, we posited that a disease-modifying therapy would need to delay the time to surgery by 1 to 2 years. In the previous SEAS trial (Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis),≈40% of trial participants either died (11%) or underwent aortic valve replacement (30%) within 4 years, with an overall rate of disease progression of 0.61 ± 0.59 m/s. This suggests that we would need to see a difference in the rates of disease progression of ≈40% (from 0.16 to 0.10 m/s/year) to delay the need for surgery by 1 to 2 years. On the basis of aortic valve calcium score progression in participants from our previous studies, who had an aortic valve calcium score ≥ 400 (median 2-year change, 565 AU [interquartile range, 190–910]), we calculated that a sample size of 47 participants would be required per group to detect a 40% difference in the primary end point, with a 2-sided 5% level of significance and 80% power. To account for missing data, the total study sample size was increased to 150. For the primary end point and secondary imaging end points, 24- or 12-month change was calculated on the basis of a daily rate of change from baseline to the relevant follow-up scan, using an intention-to-treat analysis regardless of compliance. Both placebo groups were combined for analysis. For the primary end point, if the baseline noncontrast CT scan was degraded by artifact but 12- and 24-month scans were available, these scans were used to determine the daily rate of change. Sensitivity analyses for the primary end point were performed after excluding scans with artifact or incorporating only those participants with at least 50% or 70% compliance.

### HMG CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) and aortic valve calcium [^69450259]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

There is no known pharmacological therapy for calcific aortic valvular sclerosis or stenosis. Because leaflet calcification occurs in areas of lipoprotein deposition, we hypothesised that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG COA) reductase inhibitors (statins) might slow aortic valve calcium (AVC) accumulation. We retrospectively identified 65 patients who had undergone two electron-beam computed tomography scans at a mean (SD) interval of 2.5 (1.6) years. 28 (43%) patients were receiving statins. Patients who were treated with statins had a 62–63% lower median rate of AVC accumulation (p = 0.006) and 44–49% fewer statin patients had definite AVC progression (p = 0.043). These findings suggest that statins may decrease AVC accumulation.

### Is aortic stenosis a preventable disease? [^f04dd9c3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular disease requiring valve replacement. Its prevalence increases with age. When the severity of AS is only mild to moderate, it is well tolerated. When it becomes severe, AS confers significant morbidity and mortality. Adverse events can be avoided if it is possible to prevent or retard the progression from mild or moderate AS to severe AS. Progression of AS parallels the progression of sclerotic changes involving the aortic valve, which share histological and immunochemical similarities with the process of atherosclerosis. Far from being just a degenerative process, the development of AS is a complex and highly regulated process with a number of modifiable factors. One of the key factors appears to be lipoproteins, which are intimately involved in several pathways crucial to the development of AS. The importance of lipoproteins is further supported by epidemiological and clinical studies showing a strong association between lipoproteins and AS. The time has come to initiate prospective studies to assess the effect of cholesterol lowering on the progression of AS.

### Oxidized phospholipids, lipoprotein (a), and progression of calcific aortic valve stenosis [^341b1fb9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is associated with aortic stenosis (AS). Oxidized phospholipids (OxPL) are key mediators of calcification in valvular cells and are carried by Lp(a).

Objectives

This study sought to determine whether Lp(a) and OxPL are associated with hemodynamic progression of AS and AS-related events.

Methods

OxPL on apolipoprotein B-100 (OxPL-apoB), which reflects the biological activity of Lp(a), and Lp(a) levels were measured in 220 patients with mild-to-moderate AS. The primary endpoint was the progression rate of AS, measured by the annualized increase in peak aortic jet velocity in m/s/year by Doppler echocardiography; the secondary endpoint was need for aortic valve replacement and cardiac death during 3.5 ± 1.2 years of follow-up.

Results

AS progression was faster in patients in the top tertiles of Lp(a) (peak aortic jet velocity: +0.26 ± 0.26 vs. +0.17 ± 0.21 m/s/year; p = 0.005) and OxPL-apoB (+0.26 ± 0.26 m/s/year vs. +0.17 ± 0.21 m/s/year; p = 0.01). After multivariable adjustment, elevated Lp(a) or OxPL-apoB levels remained independent predictors of faster AS progression. After adjustment for age, sex, and baseline AS severity, patients in the top tertile of Lp(a) or OxPL-apoB had increased risk of aortic valve replacement and cardiac death.

Conclusions

Elevated Lp(a) and OxPL-apoB levels are associated with faster AS progression and need for aortic valve replacement. These findings support the hypothesis that Lp(a) mediates AS progression through its associated OxPL and provide a rationale for randomized trials of Lp(a)-lowering and OxPL-apoB-lowering therapies in AS.

### Stage-related effect of statin treatment on the progression of aortic valve sclerosis and stenosis [^ec78cf76]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that statins could slow the progression of aortic stenosis (AS), but this hypothesis is still debated and has not been validated in large series of patients by long-term follow-up studies. Moreover, information about the role of statins in patients with different degrees of severity of AS is scarce. From our 1988 to 2007 echocardiographic database, we retrospectively identified all asymptomatic patients with aortic valve sclerosis (abnormal irregular thickening of the aortic valve with a peak aortic velocity [Vmax] ≥ 1.5 and < 2 m/s), mild AS (Vmax ≥ 2 and < 3 m/s), and moderate AS (Vmax ≥ 3 and < 4 m/s), age ≥ 50 years, and with ≥ 2 echocardiographic studies ≥ 2 years apart. Exclusion criteria were moderate/severe aortic regurgitation, bicuspid aortic valve, rheumatic valve disease, and ejection fraction < 40%. The final study population consisted of 1,046 patients (mean age 70 ± 8 years, 587 men); 309 were treated with statins. Mean follow-up duration was 5.6 ± 3.2 years (range 2 to 19). Progression of AS was slower in patients receiving statins compared with untreated patients in aortic sclerosis (0.04 ± 0.09 vs 0.07 ± 0.10 m/s/year, p = 0.01) and mild AS (0.09 ± 0.15 vs 0.15 ± 0.15 m/s/year, p = 0.001), but not in moderate AS (0.21 ± 0.18 vs 0.22 ± 0.15 m/s/year, p = 0.70). In multivariate analysis only statin therapy, initial Vmax, and dialysis were independently related to progression of aortic valve disease. In conclusion, in a large series of patients with long-term follow-up, statins were effective in slowing the progression of aortic valve disease in aortic sclerosis and mild AS, but not in moderate AS. These results suggest that statin therapy should be taken into consideration in the early stages of this common disease.

### Thoracic aorticF-sodium fluoride activity and ischemic stroke in patients with established cardiovascular disease [^856e9338]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study populations

In this post hoc analysis, the study population comprised patients with a primary diagnosis of stable coronary artery disease or aortic stenosis who had undergone 18 F-sodium fluoride PET-CT of the thoracic aorta in 1 of 4 prospective clinical imaging studies conducted at a single institution (see the Supplemental Methods for full details of inclusion criteria, randomization, and study outcomes). Two randomized controlled trials: the DIAMOND (Dual Antiplatelet Therapy to Reduce Myocardial Injury) study (stable multivessel coronary artery disease, n = 220,); and the SALTIRE II (Study Investigating the Effect of Drugs Used to Treat Osteoporosis on the Progression of Calcific Aortic Stenosis) (mild to severe aortic stenosis, n = 199,), as well as 2 observational cohort studies: the Novel Imaging Approaches to Identify Unstable Coronary Plaques study (stable angina undergoing angiography or acute myocardial infarction, n = 80,); and Role of Active Valvular Calcification and Inflammation in Patients With Aortic Stenosis (n = 121). Those with acute myocardial infarction or aortic sclerosis, or control subjects without coronary or aortic valve disease were excluded (see Supplemental Figure 1 for CONSORT diagram). The principal findings of these studies have been reported previously, with both randomized controlled trials reporting no difference in the primary outcome between treatment and placebo groups. Demographics, clinical risk factors, and history of cardiovascular disease were recorded, and 10-year revised Framingham stroke risk score was calculated for each patient. This study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki, with each of the studies approved by regional ethical committees and written, informed consent provided by each participant.

### Lipoprotein (a) in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic stenosis: a European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement [^c85e9dd0]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical guidance: What to do with the patient with high Lp(a)?

In the absence of approved specific Lp(a)-lowering drugs, this panel recommends early, intensive management of other risk factors for individuals with elevated Lp(a) levels, consistent with most guidelines. Personalized management of LDL-C, blood pressure, glucose, and lifestyle factors, taking into account baseline cardiovascular risk and the untreated Lp(a) level, is recommended to reduce ASCVD risk sufficiently to mitigate increased risk caused by an elevated Lp(a) level (Figure 6B).

LDL-C management should be in accordance with current guidelines. Although statins may slightly increase Lp(a) levels, treatment should not be discontinued as the cardiovascular benefits in patients with high Lp(a) far outweigh any potential risk associated with modest increases in Lp(a) levels. Lipoprotein apheresis can be considered in patients with very high Lp(a) and progressive ASCVD despite optimal treatment of other risk factors as uncontrolled data indicate benefit.

In major studies with PCSK9 inhibitors, the absolute cardiovascular risk reduction with this treatment was higher at higher baseline Lp(a) levels. In FOURIER, the absolute risk reduction was 2.41% vs. 1.41% with an Lp(a) > 50 vs. < 50 mg/dLand in ODYSSEY OUTCOMES, 3.7% at Lp(a) > 60 mg/dL vs. 0.5% in the lowest Lp(a) quartile. However, PCSK9 inhibitors are not registered for Lp(a) lowering.

Niacin is not recommended given the lack of clinical benefit in two outcomes studies. Current data also do not support targeting aspirin use based on Lp(a) levels. Whether aspirin might be beneficial among individuals with markedly elevated Lp(a) is uncertain (see Supplementary material online).

### Effect of denosumab or alendronate on vascular calcification: secondary analysis of SALTIRE2 randomized controlled trial [^b9e509ff]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

In the SALTIRE 2 randomized controlled trial, we used state of the art cardiovascular imaging to assess the effects of alendronate and denosumab on both aortic valve and vascular calcification in patients with aortic stenosis. As mentioned in the primary paper, a 50% reduction of serum C‐terminal telopeptide concentration in patients receiving denosumab or alendronic acid could be observed, reflecting the pharmacodynamic effect of these drugs on bone turnover and resorption, and thereby demonstrating that the treatment was effective. Opposed to this, we observed no effect of either drug on calcium scores or 18F‐NaF PET activity in either the aorta or coronary arteries, indicating no effect on either the burden of calcific atherosclerosis or vascular calcification activity. These results were consistent regardless of the measure of calcification used, further bolstering confidence in the outcome. Our results are also similar to other less sophisticated randomized trial data of bisphosphonates and denosumab which reported no differences between treatment and placebo groups in progression of aortic calcification assessed on plain x‐rays. Whilst there appears to be overlap between the pathophysiology of skeletal bone formation and vascular calcification, modulating bone metabolism with drugs, such as alendronate or denosumab, does not appear to have any harmful or beneficial effects on vascular calcification. This is reassuring for patients receiving treatment for osteoporosis, although the development of treatments capable of slowing calcification in the vasculature and heart valves remains an important clinical priority and unmet need.

We recognize several limitations with our analysis. As acknowledged in the primary manuscript, the trial was conducted in a single center and composed of a largely White male population with normal bone health, which may affect generalizability of our results. Not all patients completed 2 years of follow‐up, largely because of aortic valve replacement occurring before trial completion. Vascular calcification is a slow process and we cannot rule out a potential difference between treatment and placebo groups occurring in the longer term as a consequence of the relatively short follow‐up period. Finally, the end points were imaging parameters only and the trial was not designed or powered to investigate clinical events, although both CT calcium scoring and 18F‐NaF PET have been closely associated with such clinical events in previous studies.,

In conclusion, in a randomized controlled trial of patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis, neither alendronic acid nor denosumab were associated with a change in activity or progression of calcification within the coronary arteries or aorta, suggesting that these drugs neither promote nor inhibit vascular calcification.

### Optimization and reproducibility of aortic valve 18F-fluoride positron emission tomography in patients with aortic stenosis [^18abbd87]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is the most common form of valve disease in the Western world and a major healthcare burden that is set to treble by 2050. However, we currently lack any disease-modifying therapies. Calcification seems to be the predominant pathological process driving disease progression, leading to major interest in novel treatment strategies aimed at reducing calcification activity in the valve. However, assessing the efficacy of new therapies requires large trials with prolonged follow-up to demonstrate an impact on disease progression and clinical end points. A noninvasive imaging technique capable of measuring calcification activity in the valve would be highly desirable to assess treatment efficacy in phase 2 clinical trials.

See Editorial by

See Clinical Perspective

18F-Fluoride is a positron-emitting radiotracer that binds to regions of newly developing microcalcification beyond the resolution of computed tomography. It is readily taken up by the valves of patients with aortic stenosis, and, on histology, correlates with markers of calcification activity. Importantly, this technique predicts disease progression both with respect to echocardiography and computed tomography (CT) calcium scoring and with respect to adverse cardiovascular events. – 18F-Fluoride positron emission tomography (PET) imaging therefore holds major promise as a marker of calcification activity in aortic stenosis and is an exploratory secondary end point in the ongoing SALTIRE2 clinical trial (NCT02132026). Briefly, this is a randomized controlled trial investigating the ability of therapies targeting calcium metabolism (denosumab and alendronic acid) to modify disease progression in aortic stenosis.

Here, we sought to optimize 18F-fluoride PET scanning of the aortic valve, reduce the effects of cardiac motion, and assess the scan–rescan reproducibility of this technique to inform its future application as a novel biomarker of calcification activity in clinical trials.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^fcc50776]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Aortic stenosis — Routine follow-up of asymptomatic disease and progression rates: When severe AS is present (aortic velocity ≥ 4.0 m/s), the rate of progression to symptoms is high, with an event-free survival rate of only 30% to 50% at 2 years. With moderate AS (aortic velocity 3.0–3.9 m/s), the average annual rate of progression is an increase in velocity of 0.3 m/s, increase in mean pressure gradient of 7 mm Hg, and decrease in valve area of 0.1 cm2. In patients with aortic sclerosis, defined as focal areas of valve calcification and leaflet thickening with an aortic velocity < 2.0 m/s, progression to severe AS occurs in about 10% of patients within 5 years.

To date, there is no proved medical therapy able to significantly reduce the degenerative process of biologic prosthetic aortic valves. It has recently been suggested that statins may reduce the progression of native aortic valve stenosis. We examined the effect of statin treatment on bioprosthetic aortic valve degeneration and found a beneficial effect of statins in slowing bioprosthetic degeneration.

Lipid‐Lowering Agents

Fourteen trials evaluated the effect of HMG‐CoA reductase inhibitors in mitigating progression of cardiovascular calcification in 3477 participants (median participants 151, range 47–1005; median duration 12 months, range 12–48 months) (Table 1). Attenuation of vascular calcification was the primary outcome in 9 trials, with coronary arteries being the most common site evaluated (n = 13). Aortic valvular calcification was also evaluated in 2 trials. There was participant heterogeneity in the HMG‐CoA reductase trials, which included target populations with, but not limited to, dyslipidemia, HIV infection, systemic lupus erythematosus, and calcific aortic stenosis. Confirmed presence of cardiovascular calcification at baseline was required in some but not all trials. Twelve trials used computed tomography or electron beam, 3 trials used intravascular ultrasound combined with virtual histology software techniques to measure dense calcium or calcified plaque, and 1 trial used optical coherence tomography harnessing catheter‐guided infrared light to measure calcification burden.

Thirteen of the 14 trials did not demonstrate significant cardiovascular calcification attenuation with HMG‐CoA reductase inhibitors, including 9 placebo‐controlled trials. The largest trial with the longest duration of follow‐up by Arad et al evaluated the impact of 20 mg atorvastatin, 1 g vitamin C, and 1000 IU vitamin E daily compared with placebo at 48 months in 1005 participants aged 50 to 70 years with coronary artery calcium score at or above the 80th percentile. In this study, there was no significant difference in the secondary outcome of CAC at 4 years between treatment and control groups. Addition of ezetimibe to HMG‐CoA reductase inhibitors, evaluated by Hougaard et al and Lee et al, did not significantly attenuate cardiovascular calcification.

### Lipoprotein (a) in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic stenosis: a European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement [^087d2abd]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Promise of Lp(a) lowering in aortic valve disease

There is robust evidence that high Lp(a) concentrations are likely causal in the initiation of aortic valve disease and also associate with increased disease activity and progression (Table 2). Randomized controlled trial of Lp(a) lowering in AVS are now required. While tempting to speculate about the impact of Lp(a) lowering on AVS progression, defining the most appropriate patient population and selecting appropriate trial endpoint in aortic stenosis is a challenge.

Consensus panel recommendations for managing high Lp(a) concentration

In the absence of specific Lp(a)-lowering therapies, early risk factor management is recommended for individuals with elevated Lp(a), taking into account their absolute global cardiovascular risk and Lp(a) level.
Among patients with high Lp(a), all cardiovascular risk factors should be comprehensively addressed as per guideline recommendations.
Lipoprotein apheresis can be considered in patients with very high Lp(a) and progressive cardiovascular disease despite optimal management of risk factors.
Niacin is not recommended for Lp(a) lowering.

### Association of cholesterol levels, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme – A reductase inhibitor treatment, and progression of aortic stenosis in the community [^433717d4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to analyze the association among cholesterol levels, lipid-lowering treatment, and progression of aortic stenosis (AS) in the community.

Background

Aortic stenosis is a progressive disease for which there is no known medical treatment to prevent or slow progression. Despite plausible pathologic mechanisms linking hypercholesterolemia to AS progression, clinical studies have been inconsistent and affected by referral bias, and the role of lipid-lowering therapy is uncertain.

Methods

We determined the association between blood cholesterol levels and progression of native AS (assessed by Doppler echocardiography at baseline and at least six months later; mean interval, 3.7 ± 2.3 years) in a community-based study of 156 patients (age 77 ± 12 years; 90 men). Thirty-eight patients received statin treatment during follow-up.

Results

In untreated subjects, mean gradient increased from 22 ± 12 mm Hg to 39 ± 19 mm Hg, and aortic valve area (AVA) decreased from 1.20 ± 0.35 cm(2) to 0.91 ± 0.33 cm(2) (both p < 0.001). The annualized change in AVA was -0.09 ± 0.17 cm(2)/year (-7% ± 13%/year). Neither total cholesterol (r = -0.01, p = 0.92) nor low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.01; p = 0.88) showed a significant correlation to AS progression. Nevertheless, progression of AS was slower in patients receiving statins compared with untreated patients (decrease in AVA -3 ± 10% vs. -7 ± 13% per year, respectively; p = 0.04), even when adjusted for age, gender, cholesterol, and baseline valve area (p = 0.04). The association of statin treatment with slower progression was confirmed when analysis was restricted to patients coming for a systematic follow-up (p = 0.02). The odds ratio of AS progression with statin treatment was 0.46 (95% confidence interval, 0.21 to 0.96).

Conclusions

In the community, progression of AS shows no trend of association with cholesterol levels. Statin treatment, however, is associated with slower progression, suggesting that the effects of statin treatment on progression of AS should be pursued with appropriate clinical trials.

### Detecting native and bioprosthetic aortic valve disease usingF-sodium fluoride: clinical implications [^669703f8]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Calcification as the Driver of Disease in Native Aortic Valve Stenosis

Due to a strong overlap between risk factors for developing atherosclerosis and aortic stenosis, the lipid-lowering effect of statins was initially investigated as a means of slowing aortic stenosis progression. Frustratingly, multiple randomized controlled trials did not demonstrate a reduction in aortic valve velocity or calcium score progression over medium-term follow-up. While disappointing, the results also questioned the understood inflammatory mechanisms driving the process of aortic stenosis.

To explore the relative contributions of inflammatory and calcific processes to aortic stenosis in vivo, researchers performed hybrid positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT), comparing 18 F-fluorodeoxygloucose, (18 F-FGD), a non-specific marker of inflammation, and 18 F-sodium fluoride (18 F-NaF), which preferentially binds to developing microcalcification, in a cohort of patients with varying degrees of aortic stenosis. The results demonstrated that calcification activity dominated over inflammation in aortic stenosis, particularly in the latter stages of moderate or severe stenosis (Fig. 1). The reverse situation was observed in concomitant regions of atheroma, with inflammation predominating: an observation that perhaps explains the differential effects of statins in these two conditions. Importantly, the anatomical pattern of 18 F-NaF uptake at baseline was different to the presence of baseline calcium on CT, confirming that these two modalities provide different information. However, this baseline 18 F-NaF PET activity did predict where new regions of calcium on CT would develop after 1–2 years of follow-up (Fig. 2). Similar observations have been made in different cardiovascular conditions (e.g. mitral annular calcification and coronary atherosclerosis), supporting 18 F-NaF PET as a marker of newly developing calcification beyond the resolution of CT and as a marker of disease activity in aortic stenosis. Overall in the population of 121 patients, baseline 18 F-NaF closely predicted progression of aortic valve calcium score after 2 years (R = .80, P < .001) as well as clinical events (aortic valve replacement or death).

### Impact of metabolic syndrome on progression of aortic stenosis: influence of age and statin therapy [^d4a7087a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aims of this study were to examine prospectively the relationship between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and aortic stenosis (AS) progression and to evaluate the effect of age and statin therapy on AS progression in patients with or without MetS.

Background

Despite the clear benefits of statin therapy in primary and secondary coronary heart disease prevention, several recent randomized trials have failed to demonstrate any significant effect of this class of drugs on the progression of AS. Previous retrospective studies have reported an association between MetS and faster AS progression.

Methods

This predefined substudy included 243 of the 269 patients enrolled in the ASTRONOMER (AS Progression Observation: Measuring Effects of Rosuvastatin) trial. Follow-up was 3.4 ± 1.3 years. AS progression rate was measured by calculating the annualized increase in peak aortic jet velocity measured by Doppler echocardiography.

Results

Patients with MetS (27%) had faster stenosis progression (+0.25 ± 0.21 m/s/year vs. +0.19 ± 0.19 m/s/year, p = 0.03). Predictors of faster AS progression in multivariate analysis were older age (p = 0.01), higher degree of valve calcification (p = 0.01), higher peak aortic jet velocity at baseline (p = 0.007), and MetS (p = 0.005). Impact of MetS on AS progression was most significant in younger (< 57 years) patients (MetS: +0.24 ± 0.19 m/s/year vs. no MetS: +0.13 ± 0.18 m/s/year, p = 0.008) and among patients receiving statin therapy (+0.27 ± 0.23 m/s/year vs. +0.19 ± 0.18 m/s/year, p = 0.045). In multivariate analysis, the MetS-age interaction was significant (p = 0.01), but the MetS-statin use interaction was not.

Conclusions

MetS was found to be a powerful and independent predictor of faster AS progression, with more pronounced impact in younger patients. These findings emphasize the importance of routinely identifying and treating MetS in AS patients. The apparent faster stenosis progression in the subset of normocholesterolemic patients with MetS receiving the statin will need to be confirmed by future studies.

### Lipoprotein (a) and calcific aortic valve stenosis progression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7be800e7]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

There are currently no pharmacological treatments available to slow hemodynamic progression of aortic stenosis. Plasma lipoprotein(a) concentrations predict incident aortic stenosis but its association with hemodynamic progression is controversial.

Objective

To determine the association between plasma lipoprotein(a) concentrations and hemodynamic progression in patients with aortic stenosis.

Design, Settings and Participants

The study included patients with aortic stenosis from 5 longitudinal clinical studies conducted from March 2001 to March 2023 in Canada and the UK. Of 757 total patients, data on plasma lipoprotein(a) concentrations and rates of hemodynamic progression assessed by echocardiography were available for 710, who were included in this analysis. Data were analyzed from March 2023 to April 2024.

Exposure

Cohort-specific plasma lipoprotein(a) concentration tertiles.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Hemodynamic aortic stenosis progression on echocardiography as assessed by annualized change in peak aortic jet velocity, mean transvalvular gradient, and aortic valve area.

Results

Among the included patients, 497 (70%) were male and 213 (30%) were female. The mean (SD) age was 65.2 (13.1) years. Patients in the top lipoprotein(a) tertile demonstrated 41% (estimate, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.13–1.75) faster progression of peak aortic jet velocity and 57% (estimate, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.18–2.10) faster progression of mean transvalvular gradient than patients in the bottom tertile. There was no evidence of heterogeneity across the individual cohorts. Progression of aortic valve area was comparable between groups (estimate, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.71–2.12). Similar results were observed when plasma lipoprotein(a) concentrations were treated as a continuous variable.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, higher plasma lipoprotein(a) concentrations were associated with faster rates of hemodynamic progression in patients with aortic stenosis. Lowering plasma lipoprotein(a) concentrations warrants further investigation in the prevention and treatment of aortic stenosis.

### Effect of denosumab or alendronic acid on the progression of aortic stenosis: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^bb8b2dfe]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this single-center, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, we demonstrate that treatment with denosumab or alendronic acid had no significant effect on the progression of aortic valve calcification over 24 months in asymptomatic patients with calcific aortic stenosis. We confirmed that both active trial interventions achieved inhibition of bone resorption but were unable to demonstrate an effect on the progression of aortic stenosis. We conclude that these treatments for osteoporosis do not have a major effect on the progression of aortic stenosis.

There remains a major unmet need for an effective disease-modifying noninvasive therapy in aortic stenosis. After the failure of lipid-lowering therapies, – we hypothesized that targeting active valvular calcification might be a feasible therapeutic avenue to slow disease progression. This hypothesis was based on preclinical data demonstrating the importance of molecular triggers for calcification in the valve, as well as clinical observational data showing the close association between calcification activity measured with 18 F-NaF PET and the subsequent progression of aortic valve calcification and stenosis severity. Moreover, several reports have linked increased bone resorption and osteoporosis with calcification in the aorta and aortic valve, and the role of active aortic valve calcification has been highlighted in previous consensus statements. The close associations between osteoporosis, bone turnover, and calcific aortic stenosis led to our repurposing of drugs used to treat osteoporosis to test this hypothesis. Our results did not reject the null hypothesis.

### Lipoprotein (a) and oxidized phospholipids promote valve calcification in patients with aortic Stenosis [^2f691107]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Our data support a post hoc analysis of the ASTRONOMER (Aortic Stenosis Progression Observation: Measuring Effects of Rosuvastatin) trial, in which patients with mild to moderate AS and elevated Lp(a) (top tertile > 58.5 mg/dl) or OxPL-apoB levels were reported to have faster AS progression. However, the ASTRONOMER trial only examined echocardiographic progression. Furthermore, the patient population was considerably younger than that encountered in routine clinical practice (mean age 57 years), and nearly one-half of patients had a bicuspid valve. This led many to question the relevance of Lp(a) as a therapeutic target in the majority of elderly patients seen clinically with AS. Here, we find that in a study population with a mean age of 70 years, elevated Lp(a) (using a cut-off of 35 mg/dl) and OxPL-apoB (> 2.8 nmol/l) were associated with a 2- to 3-fold faster rate of disease progression measured by echocardiography and CT calcium scoring. Our data therefore extend the generalizability of Lp(a) and its associated OxPL as independent risk factors driving AS progression to the wider clinical population and suggest that patients with elevated Lp(a) and OxPL-apoB levels might benefit from a reduction in these levels to slow disease progression.

What is the mechanism for these observations? Our in vitro data confirm that Lp(a) increases expression of key osteogenic genes in human VICs, committing them to an osteoblastic-like cell type. Using the monoclonal antibody E06, we demonstrate that blocking the OxPL moiety carried by Lp(a) diminishes the osteogenic response of VICs to Lp(a). Moreover, we substantiated the key role of OxPL in eliciting this pro-osteogenic response using r-apo(a) constructs with or without the capacity to bind OxPL. Together, these data support emerging published data that suggest an important role for the OxPL content of Lp(a) in valve calcification. They also suggest that novel therapies targeting OxPL may be useful in slowing aortic valvular calcification, as well as atherosclerosis, as recently demonstrated using a hypercholesterolemic mouse model expressing a single-chain variable fragment of E06.

### Potential causality and emerging medical therapies for lipoprotein (a) and its associated oxidized phospholipids in calcific aortic valve stenosis [^bd74f0ab]. Circulation Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of calcific aortic valve disease is increasing with aging of the population. Current treatment options for advanced or symptomatic aortic stenosis are limited to traditional surgical or percutaneous aortic valve replacement. Medical therapies that impact the progression of calcific aortic valve disease do not currently exist. New pathophysiological insights suggest that the processes leading to calcific aortic valve disease are metabolically active for many years before and during the clinical expression of disease. The identification of genetic and potentially causal mediators of calcific aortic valve disease allows opportunities for therapies that may slow progression to the point where aortic valve replacement can be avoided. Recent studies suggest that approximately one-third of aortic stenosis cases are associated with highly elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and pathways related to the metabolism of procalcifying oxidized phospholipids. Oxidized phospholipids can be carried by Lp(a) into valve leaflets but can also be formed in situ from cell membranes, lipoproteins, and apoptotic cells. This review will summarize the clinical data implicating the potential causality of Lp(a)/oxidized phospholipids, describe emerging therapeutic agents, and propose clinical trial designs to test the hypothesis that lowering Lp(a) will reduce progression aortic stenosis and the need for aortic valve replacement.

### Lipoprotein (a) and oxidized phospholipids promote valve calcification in patients with aortic Stenosis [^e9e2341d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is the commonest form of valvular heart disease in developed countries, and its disease burden is anticipated to double over the next 50 years. Following the failure of statins in reducing AS progression, effective medical therapies are lacking. The only treatment option is surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (AVR), after patients develop severe stenosis and symptoms. Patients with AS are elderly, often have multiple comorbidities and are not well suited to major surgery or intervention. Moreover, these procedures are expensive and are associated with perioperative as well as long-term morbidity and mortality. There is, therefore, an unmet clinical need for novel therapies to slow AS progression, thereby obviating the requirement for AVR altogether.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is a major carrier of oxidized phospholipids (OxPL), and has been established as a causal risk factor for AS in several genetic and population studies. Lp(a) is unaffected by statin therapy, but levels can now be reduced with novel compounds, making Lp(a) a potential therapeutic target in AS. The risk factors associated with incident AS may differ from those associated with disease progression, due to pathophysiological differences in the initiation and propagation phases of the disease. Before Lp(a) or its associated OxPL can be considered viable targets for therapeutic intervention in AS, prospective longitudinal studies are required to establish whether Lp(a) and OxPL are associated with disease progression — in addition to mechanistic work investigating the cellular mechanisms linking Lp(a) and OxPL with valvular calcification.

### The 'wait for symptoms' strategy in asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis [^40cc7175]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Calcific aortic stenosis is a prevalent and worrisome healthcare problem. The therapeutic approach in asymptomatic aortic stenosis is not well established. We argue that the natural history of this disease is based on old incomplete studies with many limitations. Likewise, studies suggesting that replacement, either surgical or percutaneous, improves prognosis in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis have important drawbacks and do not support this strategy as the treatment of choice. Despite the lack of evidence, some groups recommend early valve replacement in patients with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis. There are five ongoing randomised trials which will shed light on this topic. Our conclusion is that unless a randomised study changes the evidence, valve replacement cannot be recommended in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis.

### Ideal cardiovascular health and the prevalence and severity of aortic stenosis in elderly patients [^63264be1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Our finding that better achievement of ideal cardiovascular health metrics through midlife to late life predicts a lower prevalence of AS and sclerosis in late life is particularly relevant given the growing public health burden of AS related to the aging population. The emerging importance of AV stenosis at the population level is highlighted by a recent meta‐analysis and simulation study that estimated that 290 000 people > 75 years of age in Europe and North America are candidates for transcatheter AV replacement, with 27 000 new candidates annually. 48 These findings argue forcefully for efforts to prevent progression of AV disease to hemodynamic significance in elderly individuals. Although several studies suggested potential for treatment with hydroxymethylglutaryl–coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) in this regard, 49, 50 randomized clinical trials have failed to demonstrate efficacy of statin therapy to delay disease progression, assessed by either AV peak velocity or clinical outcomes, among people with mild‐to‐moderate AS. One potential explanation for the negative findings in these studies is the relatively advanced stage of disease process at the time of intervention. However, given the long time period over which calcific AV disease develops and the relatively low incidence of significant stenosis, a primary prevention intervention trial is likely not feasible. Indeed, there is no medical therapy available for primary or secondary prevention of calcific AV disease or AS. 21 More important, in our analysis, AV disease prevalence was associated with CVHS assessed over ≈25 years. Our findings suggest that up to 31% of AV dysfunction (sclerosis or stenosis) could be prevented if the percentage attained CVHS through midlife to late life were uniformly > 70%. Furthermore, our analysis of the relationship between trajectories of CVHS through midlife to late life and late life AV dysfunction demonstrate that worse CVHS trajectory is associated with a greater prevalence of AV dysfunction. More important, we also found that improvement in CVHS through midlife to late life (trajectory 5) was associated with a late‐life prevalence of aortic sclerosis similar to people with similar baseline CVHS who continued to decline (trajectory 3) but a significantly lower prevalence of AS, which more closely approximated the prevalence of AS in participants with a higher CVHS through most of midlife to late life (trajectory 2). These findings suggest that, although midlife CVHS is associated with progressive valve dysfunction, improvement in CVHS through late life may predict a lower prevalence of stenosis in late life. Although these findings are observational, they suggest that consistent attainment of ideal cardiovascular health metrics through midlife to late life has the potential to significantly affect the prevalence of calcific AV disease in late life, extending the importance of ideal cardiovascular health metrics to the primary prevention of AV disease.

### Association between triglyceride-glucose-body mass index and risk of aortic stenosis progression in patients with non-severe aortic stenosis: a retrospective cohort study [^46499771]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

In this study, we demonstrated that higher TyG-BMI index was significantly associated with higher risk of AS progression after fully adjusting for potential confounders in patients with non-severe AS. In subgroup analyses, results were consistent except for the use of lipid-lowering medication. In previous studies, it has been found that lipid-lowering medication have not shown good efficacy in combating calcific aortic valve stenosis. Given the key role of lipid peroxidation and infiltration, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are the most promising targets. Early animal studies found that atorvastatin inhibits osteogenesis in the aortic valve by increasing the expression and activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase. However, in numerous large randomized controlled trials, statins have not slowed the progression of AS. The AHA/ACC guidelines do not recommend the use of statin therapy to prevent the hemodynamic progression of AS. In a secondary analysis of the FOURIER trial, PCSK9 inhibitors may reduce the risk of development or progression of AS, but this was a post-hoc analysis involving a small number of events and requires further validation by dedicated large randomized controlled trials. The use of other lipid-lowering treatments, including cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors and antisense oligonucleotides targeting apolipoprotein A and apolipoprotein B, in slowing or reversing AS has not yet been studied. In this result, it may be due to the short follow-up period, small sample size, and limited number of AS progression events. Further research with a larger sample size and longer follow-up time is needed to prove the reliability of our study results. In conclusion, TyG-BMI index was significantly associated with AS progression in patients with non-severe AS.

At present, the exact biological mechanism of IR and AS progression is not clear. Existing studies have found that IR not only affects the occurrence of aortic stenosis, but also participates in the progression of the disease. Aortic valve stromal cells differentiate into myofibroblasts and osteoblasts, promoting valve calcification and osteogenic changes, and further aggravating valve stenosis. Osteoblasts are one of the target cells of insulin, and the survival, proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts are regulated by the insulin signaling receptor pathway. Lack of insulin receptors increases the incidence of obesity and IR. IR is a disorganized biological response to insulin stimulation, which increases the level of oxidative stress by disrupting different molecular pathways in target tissues and affecting the body's glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism. However, there is no research on the correlation mechanism between IR and progression of AS, and such correlation research is needed in the future.

### Anemia, increased shear stress, and the progression of aortic stenosis [^0c0ecda1]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2024). Medium credibility.

Calcific aortic stenosis is increasingly prevalent and found at echocardiography in up to 2% of asymptomatic subjects older than 65 years of age. The rate at which aortic stenosis progresses in severity over time is highly variable and difficult to predict. Despite great interest in disease prevention, medical interventions such as statin therapy and bisphosphonates have not been shown to modify disease progression as compared with untreated controls. Thus, our current approach to manage asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis uses close medical follow-up for the development of symptoms coupled with serial echocardiography at selected intervals to quantify aortic valve area and aortic outflow pressure gradients to identify the rate of change of aortic valve area as an index of the individual rate of progression of disease.

Anemia is common in patients with aortic stenosis, and it increases in severity as a function of age. A hemoglobin level of < 10.9 g/dL is found in almost 40% of subjects with severe aortic stenosis. Anemia negatively impacts aortic stenosis in a variety of ways. First, it contributes to symptoms of myocardial ischemia due to reduced oxygen-carrying capacity, which can arise from pressure overload and left ventricular hypertrophy in the setting of normal coronary arteries. Second, it accentuates the pressure gradient associated with any aortic valve area because a higher cardiac output is required to meet systemic oxygen delivery at rest as well as increases during exercise. In addition to these physiological effects, anemia also increases the local shear stress on the stenotic aortic valve itself, which, as discussed later in this article, activates a number of shear-dependent molecular pathways.

The Statin Paradox

There are many histopathological similarities between aortic valve calcification and atherosclerosis, which have led to a number of attempts at comparing the two diseases. It was shown that a high‐cholesterol diet in pigs leads to increased αSMA expression in aortic valve leaflets. 46 Human VICs were used by the Yacoub group to investigate the effect of HMG‐CoA reductase inhibitors/statins on the osteogenic response. They showed that atorvastatin inhibited both ALP activity and cytokine expression triggered by TGFβ1, TGFβ3, TNFα, and BMP4. This effect was also alleviated by atorvastatin in healthy human VICs. 71 In addition to inhibiting the osteoblast pathway, statins exerted an effect on myofibroblastic differentiation. In cultured porcine VICs simvastatin completely inhibited collagen gel contraction, even when the cells were stimulated with TGFβ1. 80 Nodule formation by cultured porcine VICs was inhibited by pravastatin, acting via Rho kinase, HMG‐CoA, and myosin light chain kinase, inhibiting expression of αSMA. However, although the formation of nodules was suppressed, the already formed nodules were not resolved. 56 The effect of statins (simvastatin at least) on nodule formation could possibly be mediated by the C‐natriuretic peptide, which is expressed by VECs populating the ventricular side of the valve. 26

The data on statins remain highly controversial as 3 randomized clinical trials using statins for treatment of aortic valve calcification — SALTIRE (Scottish Aortic Stenosis and Lipid Lowering Trial, Impact on Regression), SEAS (Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis), and ASTRONOMER (Aortic Stenosis Progression Observation: Measuring Effects of Rosuvastatin) — failed to demonstrate any beneficial effects. 113 Instead, we now have a statin paradox — although vascular calcification is reduced by statin use, bone mineralization and aortic valve calcification are actually increased. 6 A recent study by Monzack and colleagues showed that in porcine VICs treated with osteogenic medium or under reduced serum conditions (where the cells expressed high levels of αSMA), statins actually increased ALP activity and the expression of osteocalcin. 65 Statins are now the front line in prevention of atherosclerosis, but the present conclusion is that they have no effect in preventing aortic valve calcification. Possibly the statins might inhibit development in healthy valves, but once the calcification process has started, the statins cannot stop it.

### Higher left ventricular mass-wall stress-heart rate product and outcome in aortic valve stenosis [^0dd5e00e]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

The SEAS study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study performed during the years 2002–2008 which assessed the effect of combined simvastatin and ezetimibe on AS progression and CV morbidity and mortality in 1873 patients with initially asymptomatic, mild-to-moderate AS. Of these, the core lab received baseline echocardiograms on 1788. LV mass could be assessed in 1730 patients at baseline, and in 1656 of these also on at least 1 follow-up echocardiogram. Due to lack of end-echocardiography blood pressure measurements, the circumferential end-systolic stress (CESS) could only be calculated in 1623 patients at baseline, leaving 1522 patient with data on CESS, heart rate and LV mass measured both at the baseline and at least 1 follow-up echocardiogram eligible for the current study population. Sex, age and peak aortic jet velocity did not differ significantly between eligible and non-eligible patients (all p > 0.3), but non-eligible patients had a lower likelihood of suffering a primary study endpoint (p < 0.001).

All patients signed informed consent prior to study enrolment.

### The effect of statins on valve function and calcification in aortic stenosis: a meta-analysis [^fdf1f202]. Atherosclerosis (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Aortic calcification has been shown to share the same risk factors as atherosclerosis which suggested a potential benefit from statins therapy. In view of the existing conflicting results, we aimed to provide objective evidence on the effect of statins in aortic stenosis (AS).

Methods and Results

A meta-analysis of eligible studies that used statins in AS was performed. Fourteen studies were identified, 5 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 9 observational studies. In the 14 studies as a whole, no significant differences were found in all cause mortality (OR = 0.98, p = 0.91), cardiovascular mortality (OR = 0.80, P = 0.23) or the need for valve replacement (OR = 0.93, p = 0.45) between the statins and the control groups. LDL-cholesterol dropped in the statins groups in both < 24 months and ≥ 24 months follow-up (p < 0.001 for both) but not in controls (p = 0.35 and p = 0.33, respectively). In the < 24 months statins group, the annual increase in peak aortic velocity and peak gradient was less (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.004, respectively), but the mean gradient, valve area and calcification score were not different from controls. In the ≥ 24 months statins group, none of the above parameters was different from controls.

Conclusions

Despite the consistent beneficial effect of statins on LDL-cholesterol levels, the available evidence showed no effect on aortic valve structure, function or calcification and no benefit for clinical outcomes.

### Effect of rosuvastatin on C-reactive protein and progression of aortic stenosis [^38d78283]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) is a common finding in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) and may be associated with rapid AS progression and worse outcome. The purpose of the study was to examine the role of high-sensitivity CRP and its interaction with rosuvastatin on the progression of AS.

Methods

We measured CRP at baseline, 1 year, and end of follow-up in 260 patients with a median follow-up of 3.5 years. Analyses were performed based on baseline CRP tertiles and baseline CRP > 3 and ≤ 3 mg/L.

Results

After adjustment for baseline characteristics, higher CRP levels were associated with age, female gender, body mass index, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels but not with AS severity. Treatment with rosuvastatin led to a persistent decrease in CRP at 1 year and end of follow-up. Progression of AS was detected in patients in all 3 CRP tertiles, and rosuvastatin treatment had no impact on progression in all 3 tertiles. Similar findings were observed using CRP > 3 mg/L as the cutpoint. Multiple linear regression showed that baseline AS velocity (P < .001), but not CRP, was the only predictor of progression of AS; age (P = 0.05) and baseline AS velocity (P < .001), but not CRP and rosuvastatin treatment, were predictors of outcome events.

Conclusion

C-reactive protein does not predict severity, progression, and prognosis in patients with mild to moderate AS. Treatment with rosuvastatin reduces CRP levels but has no effect on the progression and clinical events of AS.

### Ancient remedy for a modern disease: will celastrol become a treatment for aortic valve stenosis? [^011dbda8]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

As the population ages, developing medical therapies to prevent the development of CAVD is will be critically important, and cost-effective therapies will need to be directed toward preventing progression of disease. The early stage of CAVD, aortic sclerosis, has no hemodynamic consequences, but has a prevalence of 25% in individuals > 65 years of age. The risk of progression from aortic sclerosis to AS is only approximately 2% per year. However, once AS is established, the vast majority of patients experience hemodynamic progression and are at risk of developing severe AS. Therefore, the true test of a clinically useful therapy would be one that effectively prevents progression of established AS and not simply development of CAVD. Statins, although effective at low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering, failed to show efficacy in preventing progression of mild-to-moderate AS in randomized clinical trials. Whether celastrol will live up to the promise of being the first effective medical therapy for AS depends on whether it can: 1) prevent progression of established AS; 2) be effective for patients who have risk factors other than hypercholesterolemia; and 3) demonstrate safety. Because of the lack of currently available medical therapies for AS and the significant unmet clinical need that will become even more urgent as our population ages, this study provides an impetus to further evaluate celastrol preclinically to assess its safety and efficacy in the hope that it can eventually enter clinical trials.

### Cholesterol crystal dissolution rate of serum predicts outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^f5be3a3c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

In general, lipid‐lowering strategies using β‐hydroxy β‐methylglutaryl‐CoA reductase and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors to reduce LDL cholesterol levels are among the most effective interventions to modify the cardiovascular risk profile. According to the current guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology for the management of dyslipidemias, the greatest possible reduction of LDL levels is recommended to prevent cardiovascular diseases, especially in high‐risk and very high‐risk patients. However, in patients with mild‐to‐moderate AS, several randomized trials have failed to show a beneficial effect of a lipid‐lowering therapy in slowing the progression of the stenosis. This might be explained by the fact that new biomarkers of the cholesterol metabolism, such as the cholesterol efflux capacity, are more sensitive in predicting cardiovascular events and may be more promising targets for AS treatment. In our study, LDL‐cholesterol levels were similar in both low and high CCDR patients (P = 0.35). Interestingly, a statin treatment was associated with significantly reduced LDL‐ and total cholesterol levels only in the low CCDR group (P = 0.003).

### Insights into aortic sclerosis and its relationship with coronary artery disease [^1432bda2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Retrospective investigations into the impact of statin use on the progression of AS have produced conflicting results (Table 3). Several studies ranging from 65 to 211 subjects showed a statistically significant trend toward slower evolution of AS with administration of statins.– However, a larger‐scale study of 1257 patients found no significant statin effect. In 1 analysis of people with existing AS, statins but not cholesterol levels affected the progression of AS. Thus, given the conflicting results and the inconsistencies in methodologies used in these studies, it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding the anti‐inflammatory, pleotrophic, or lipid‐lowering effects of statins on AS.

Table 3.
Retrospective Studies on the Impact of Statins on AVS and AS

Although there are inconsistent retrospective reports on the use of statin therapy, recent prospective studies have demonstrated failure to delay the progression of AS. The largest randomized controlled trial to date (1873 participants with mild to moderate AS) with the longest follow‐up (4.4 years) revealed that simvastatin in conjunction with ezetimibe did not reduce a variety of major cardiovascular outcomes, including those attributed to valvular dysfunction. In fact, rates of AV replacement were the same (myocardial infarction 1.00, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.18). Similar results were observed in studies of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin (Table 4). – Additionally, several meta‐analyses found no significant differences between subjects treated with and without statins in terms of major echocardiographic findings (mean AV pressure gradient and AV area) or overall clinical outcomes. – These collective findings suggest that (1) statins are unlikely to significantly affect the course of AS, (2) AVS may be a more appropriate target for statins but further research is needed given the scarcity of data, and (3) statins have multifactorial effects that may not be fully characterized yet.

### ApoB / apoA-I ratio is associated with faster hemodynamic progression of aortic stenosis: results from the PROGRESSA (metabolic determinants of the progression of aortic stenosis) study [^6b936fee]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

A recent study using a Mendelian randomization design reported an association between the genetic predisposition for elevated LDL‐C and the presence of aortic valve calcification as well as incident AS. 15 Previous studies have also reported an association of elevated serum LDL‐C with development and faster progression of AS. 6, 46, 47, 48 In the present study, higher apoB/apoA‐I ratio was associated with faster AS progression independently of the level of LDL‐C, which did not reach significance level. In patients with coronary artery disease, several studies reported that apoB/apoA‐I ratio is a powerful predictor of adverse events and is superior to conventional lipid parameters, especially in patients with LDL‐C within normal ranges. 29, 49, 50 In our study, the level of LDL‐C was within normal limits in the vast majority of patients, and apoB/apoA‐I ratio outweighed LDL‐C to predict disease progression in this series. This could be explained by the fact that apoB/apoA‐I ratio captures both dyslipidemia and a dysmetabolic state often typified by lower HDL levels.

Clinical Implications

There is compelling evidence suggesting that calcific AS is an active and multifaceted disease involving lipid deposition, chronic inflammation, and active mineralization. 1, 4, 5 However, three randomized clinical trials focused on lipid‐lowering therapy to prevent AS progression have failed to demonstrate any benefit regarding AS progression or occurrence of AS‐related events, 16, 17, 18 and currently there is no effective pharmacological therapy to slow the progression of AS. The lack of effect of statins on AS progression in these trials may be explained by: (1) the study populations included predominantly older patients with moderate AS; (2) the benefit of LDL‐lowering by statins may have been counterbalanced by some negative effects including increase in insulin resistance and associated deterioration in LDL particle phenotype as well as increase in Lp(a) plasma levels; these factors have been shown to be associated with a faster progression rate of AS. 9, 14

In this context, the results of this study may have important clinical implications. Indeed, independently of traditional risk factors, increased apoB/apoA‐I ratio, which reflects altered lipid metabolism linked to visceral fat accumulation, predicts the progression rate of AS in younger patients. Though the present work does not establish a cause‐and‐effect relationship, it provides further impetus to investigate the links between lipids and visceral obesity‐associated metabolic factors with the pathobiology of AS.

### Can statins slow the progression of aortic stenosis?… [^d90e3f0c]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

No proven medical treatment is currently available that can delay or reverse the progression of aortic stenosis. New insight into the development and progression of aortic stenosis has resulted in the hypothesis that cholesterol may play a role, implying that lipid-lowering agents may slow progression of the disease. This association between aortic stenosis and hyperlipidemia has been inconsistent in the literature, with some studies reporting a positive correlation and others reporting little or no correlation. Bellamy and associates conducted a community-based study to analyze the effect of hyperlipidemia on the progression of aortic stenosis and to evaluate the impact of lipid-lowering agents, particularly statins, on this progression. Participants in the study were obtained by screening all adults with aortic stenosis in one county from January 1987 to March 2000. Aortic stenosis was defined as an aortic mean gradient of at least 10 mm Hg and an aortic valve area of
2. 0 cm.

In addition, all drug treatments given to the subjects who participated in the study were recorded. A total of 156 subjects were enrolled in the study, of which 38 subjects received lipid-lowering treatment during the follow-up period. In the 118 participants who did not receive any statin therapy, the aortic valve mean gradient increased from 22 mm Hg to 39 mm Hg and the aortic valve area decreased from 1. 20 cm. 2 to 0. 92 cm
2. The annualized decrease in the aortic valve area was 0. 09 cm 2 per year. No correlation was found between the total cholesterol or low-density cholesterol levels and the progression of aortic stenosis. Progression of aortic stenosis was significantly slower in patients receiving statin therapy when compared with those who did not receive this class of medications, even when controlling for other variables.

The association between statin therapy and slower progression of aortic stenosis was confirmed when the analysis was restricted to patients presenting for systematic follow-up. The authors conclude that in a community-based population, the progression of aortic stenosis is not correlated with cholesterol levels. The authors add that patients who are receiving statin therapy experience slower progression of aortic stenosis. The results of this study suggest that there is a promise of safe and effective medical treatment for aortic stenosis.

### Impact of lipoprotein (a) on valvular and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with calcific aortic valve stenosis [^e7cdf3a4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study has strengths and limitations. The strengths include the large data set, allowing us to identify 1962 patients with CAVS meeting a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria and Lp(a) results. The large sample size provided statistical power for valve replacement and other important composite outcomes and for subgroup analyses including by sex, age, and hs‐CRP level. However, this study has several limitations including the method for identifying CAVS using self‐report or electronic health records. The CAVS diagnosis was not confirmed by trained medical personnel through echocardiographic assessment, and it is possible that some participants may have had aortic sclerosis rather than CAVS; this might explain the relatively low event rate in this study compared with the randomized, controlled SEAS (Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis) trial of patients with mild to moderate CAVS. Also, for some individual outcomes, there may have been limited power to assess for Lp(a) associations. Additionally, in the absence of randomization, it is possible that unmeasured baseline differences between those patients with high versus low Lp(a), including in severity of CAVS disease, may have biased the results. It is also possible that our results may underestimate the importance of Lp(a) in CAVS progression. The participants with lifelong low Lp(a) might have developed CAVS through a different pathogenesis than patients with disease resulting from high Lp(a). Finally, an overwhelming majority of the participants included in this study were of European ancestry, thus limiting the applicability of the results to other ethnicities.

Conclusions

In conclusion, this analysis from the UK Biobank showed that high Lp(a) was associated with the incidence of CAVS‐progression related events as defined by the occurrence of valve replacement and other relevant cardiovascular outcomes over a minimum follow up of 2.5 years and maximum follow up of 5 years. The results support the need for assessing Lp(a) lowering in clinical trials.

### Lipoprotein (a) associated molecules are prominent components in plasma and valve leaflets in calcific aortic valve stenosis [^23ed56af]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2017). Low credibility.

With the extension of lifespan and aging of the population in the 21st century, calcific aortic valve disease, which encompasses early lesions as well as stenotic disease (clinically seen as calcific aortic valve stenosis [CAVS]), is becoming an increasingly prevalent disorder. It is estimated that hemodynamically significant CAVS is present in > 1 million patients in the United States and that approximately 2.5 million cases will be present worldwide by 2020 and 4.5 million in 2030. Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is the only option for palliation of symptoms and prevention of complications. Unfortunately, by the time AVR is needed, patients are often octogenarians and a large percentage are not eligible for AVR due to advanced frailty and other significant comorbidities. For example, a recent report comparing surgical AVR versus transcatheter AVR revealed 33% to 39% all-cause mortality, 12% to 19% rate of stroke, and 40% to 48% major adverse cardiac event rate at 3-year follow-up in both groups.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is a genetically determined, likely causal, and independent risk factor for the presence and progression of CAVS. Lp(a) is the major lipoprotein carrier of phosphocholine-containing oxidized phospholipids (PC-OxPLs), that may contribute to inflammation and induce calcification in valvular cells. For example, in the ASTRONOMER (Aortic Stenosis Progression Observation: Measuring Effects of Rosuvastatin) trial, patients with elevated Lp(a) and OxPL on apolipoprotein B-100 (OxPL-apoB) levels had the fastest progression rate and higher need for AVR. Autotaxin (ATX), which breaks down lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) derived from OxPL to lysophosphatidic acid (LysoPA), was also recently shown to be strongly associated with CAVS. In turn, because OxPL and oxidized low-density lipoprotein have been shown to be present in CAVS, it is likely that a significant portion of the LysoPC is derived from hydrolysis of the truncated oxidized sn2 fatty acids found in OxPL present in oxidized low-density lipoprotein, which are generated by such enzymes as lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A 2 and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase. In recent findings, ATX activity and either Lp(a) or OxPL-apoB strongly interacted to predict the presence of CAVS in patients undergoing AVR with concomitant coronary artery disease.

### Effect of denosumab or alendronic acid on the progression of aortic stenosis: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^5e3f9d77]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Would a larger study in a population with less severe aortic stenosis demonstrate a difference? The majority (85%) of our trial population had mild or moderate disease. The natural history of aortic stenosis dictates that many years will elapse before mild aortic stenosis will become severe. Because the trial was powered for an effect size of 40%, it is possible that we failed to detect a smaller treatment effect that could delay surgery in the longer term. However, we have recently examined the contemporary use of aortic valve calcium scoring for assessing disease progression and demonstrated that modest sample sizes, not dissimilar to our present study, are needed to detect the desired effect size sought here.

Given that the trial intervention achieved its intended pharmacological effect and that multiple measures of disease severity and progression did not detect a treatment effect, was the underlying hypothesis incorrect? The molecular mechanisms underlying our hypothesis have been demonstrated in preclinical models, but the direct in vivo exploration of human valvular interstitial cell osteoclastic and osteoblastic differentiation and turnover has not been established and would be very challenging to undertake. We have demonstrated previously that microcalcification activity correlates well with aortic stenosis progression, as measured by both aortic valve macrocalcification on noncontrast CT and hemodynamic stenosis on Doppler echocardiography. Severe aortic valve calcification on noncontrast CT is also strongly associated with future aortic valve replacement. We therefore continue to believe that valvular calcification remains a major pathogenetic determinant of aortic stenosis progression. However, multiple other pathways lead to calcification in the valve, with many proinflammatory mediators that initiate and promulgate disease progression. We chose denosumab and alendronic acid as established treatments for osteoporosis in an attempt to slow valvular calcification while maintaining bone health. The absence of a detectable beneficial effect on valvular calcification may suggest that the pathophysiology of calcification in aortic stenosis is independent of these pathways or that much higher doses than those used for the treatment of osteoporosis may have been needed. However, given the observed effect on markers of bone turnover, we believe the latter explanation is unlikely.

### Relation of lipid-lowering therapy to need for aortic valve replacement in patients with asymptomatic mild to moderate aortic stenosis [^38776d43]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

In this study, we aimed to determine if pretreatment low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and aortic stenosis (AS) severity alter the efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy on reducing aortic valve replacement (AVR). We used 1,687 patients with asymptomatic mild-to-moderate AS, who were randomly assigned (1:1) to 40/10 mg simvastatin/ezetimibe combination versus. placebo in the simvastatin and ezetimibe in aortic stenosis (SEAS) trial. Pretreatment LDL levels (> 4 mmol/L) and peak aortic jet velocity (3 m/s) were used to partition study participants into 4 groups, which were followed for a primary endpoint of AVR. Cox regression with tests for interaction was used to study the effect of randomized treatment in each subgroup. During a median follow-up of 4.3 years (IQR 4.2 to 4.7 years; total 7,396 patient-years of follow-up), 478 (28%) patients underwent AVR and 146 (9%) died. A significant risk dependency was detected between simvastatin/ezetimibe combination, LDL levels and mild versus moderate AS on rates of AVR (p = 0.01 for interaction). In stratified analyses, randomized treatment, therefore, reduced the rate of AVR in patients with LDL levels > 4 mmol and mild AS at baseline (HR 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.9). There was no detectable effect of randomized treatment on the need for AVR in the 3 other participants subgroups. We conclude, that in a secondary analysis from a prospective randomized clinical trial, treatment with simvastatin/ezetimibe combination reduced the need for AVR in a subset of patients with mild AS and high pretreatment LDL levels (Unique identifier on clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00092677).

### Insulin resistance and LVH progression in patients with calcific aortic stenosis: a substudy of the ASTRONOMER trial [^839df7f9]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this substudy of the ASTRONOMER (Aortic Stenosis Progression Observation: Measuring Effects of Rosuvastatin) trial was to examine the association between insulin resistance and progression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with aortic stenosis (AS).

Background

In a recent cross-sectional study, the authors reported that the metabolic syndrome was associated with an increased prevalence of concentric LVH in patients with AS. As a central feature of the metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance could be an important mediator of this association.

Methods

This substudy included 250 of 269 patients enrolled in ASTRONOMER. Follow-up was 3.4 ± 1.3 years. Insulin resistance was evaluated using the homeostatic assessment model (HOMA) index, and patients were dichotomized using the median HOMA index value (1.24). The rate of LVH progression was estimated by calculating the annualized change in LV mass index (LVMi), measured on echocardiography. The presence of LVH was defined as an LVMi > 47 g/m(2.7) in women and > 49 g/m(2.7) in men.

Results

There was a significant progression of LVH among the patients without LVH at baseline (n = 134; p < 0.0001) but not in those with it (n = 116; p = NS). In those without LVH at baseline, the annualized progression rate of LVMi was significantly faster in the subset with HOMA > 1.24 compared to that in the subset with HOMA < 1.24 (2.49 ± 4.38 g/m(2.7)/year vs. -0.03 ± 3.90 g/m(2.7)/year; p = 0.001). During follow-up, LVH developed in 46% of patients with HOMA > 1.24 compared to 11% of those with HOMA < 1.24 (p = 0.0005). Independent predictors of faster LVH progression identified on multivariate analysis were history of hypertension (p = 0.048), degree of aortic valve calcification (p = 0.035), and HOMA index (p = 0.02).

Conclusions

In this ASTRONOMER substudy, insulin resistance was a powerful independent predictor of progression to LVH in patients with AS. Visceral obesity and ensuing insulin resistance may thus present novel therapeutic targets in AS patients.

### Statins for aortic valve stenosis [^3b5fd7be]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Aortic valve stenosis is the most common type of valvular heart disease in the USA and Europe. Aortic valve stenosis is considered similar to atherosclerotic disease. Some studies have evaluated statins for aortic valve stenosis.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of statins in aortic valve stenosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS - IBECS, Web of Science and CINAHL Plus. These databases were searched from their inception to 24 November 2015. We also searched trials in registers for ongoing trials. We used no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) comparing statins alone or in association with other systemic drugs to reduce cholesterol levels versus placebo or usual care.

Data Collection and Analysis

Primary outcomes were severity of aortic valve stenosis (evaluated by echocardiographic criteria: mean pressure gradient, valve area and aortic jet velocity), freedom from valve replacement and death from cardiovascular cause. Secondary outcomes were hospitalisation for any reason, overall mortality, adverse events and patient quality of life. Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. The GRADE methodology was employed to assess the quality of result findings and the GRADE profiler (GRADEPRO) was used to import data from Review Manager 5.3 to create a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included four RCTs with 2360 participants comparing statins (1185 participants) with placebo (1175 participants). We found low-quality evidence for our primary outcome of severity of aortic valve stenosis, evaluated by mean pressure gradient (mean difference (MD) -0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.88 to 0.80; participants = 1935; studies = 2), valve area (MD -0.07, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.14; participants = 127; studies = 2), and aortic jet velocity (MD -0.06, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.14; participants = 155; study = 1). Moderate-quality evidence showed no effect on freedom from valve replacement with statins (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06; participants = 2360; studies = 4), and no effect on muscle pain as an adverse event (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.09; participants = 2204; studies = 3; moderate-quality evidence). Low- and very low-quality evidence showed uncertainty around the effect of statins on death from cardiovascular cause (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.15; participants = 2297; studies = 3; low-quality evidence) and hospitalisation for any reason (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.84; participants = 155; study = 1; very low-quality evidence). None of the four included studies reported on overall mortality and patient quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Result findings showed uncertainty surrounding the effect of statins for aortic valve stenosis. The quality of evidence from the reported outcomes ranged from moderate to very low. These results give support to European and USA guidelines (2012 and 2014, respectively) that so far there is no clinical treatment option for aortic valve stenosis.

### High sensitivity C reactive protein as a prognostic marker in patients with mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis during lipid-lowering treatment: an SEAS substudy [^0bbc7432]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Although treatment with simvastatin 40 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg reduced both cholesterol and hsCRP, the treatment-associated reduction in ICE seemed to be related to the reduction in hsCRP rather than in cholesterol. hsCRP reduction was associated with fewer MCE and the prognostic benefit of a 1-year reduction in hsCRP was larger in patients with high baseline hsCRP.

### 2022 ACC / AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^582c6058]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Atherosclerotic disease of the aorta — pharmacotherapy guidance: In patients with aortic atherosclerotic disease and concomitant coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease (PAD), or both, it is recommended to prescribe antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulant therapy or both, guided by the clinical setting. In patients with aortic atherosclerotic disease and risk factors for confirmed coronary artery disease, it is reasonable to prescribe a moderate- or high-intensity statin. In patients with aortic atheromas of a thickness ≥ 4 mm, statin therapy may be reasonable.

### Effect of denosumab or alendronate on vascular calcification: secondary analysis of SALTIRE2 randomized controlled trial [^29cac0f3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with osteoporosis demonstrate increased vascular calcification but the effect of osteoporosis treatments on vascular calcification remains unclear. The present study aimed to examine whether coronary or aortic calcification are influenced by denosumab and alendronic acid treatment.

Methods and Results

In a double-blind randomized controlled SALTIRE2 (Study Investigating the Effect of Drugs Used to Treat Osteoporosis on the Progression of Calcific Aortic Stenosis) trial, patients with aortic stenosis were randomized 2:1:2:1 to denosumab, placebo injection, alendronic acid, or placebo capsule. Participants underwent serial imaging with computed tomography and 18F-sodium fluoride positron emission tomography for the assessment of vascular calcium burden and calcification activity, respectively. We report the prespecified secondary analyses of 24-month change in coronary calcium score, and 12-month changes in thoracic aorta calcium score, coronary and aortic 18F-sodium fluoride activity. One hundred fifty patients with aortic stenosis (72 ± 8years; 21% female) were randomized to denosumab (n = 49), alendronic acid (n = 51), and placebo (injection n = 25, capsule n = 25). There were no differences in change in coronary calcium scores between placebo (16 [-64 to 148] Agatston units) and either denosumab (94 [0–212] Agatston units, P = 0.24) or alendronic acid (34 [-62 to 134], P = 0.99). There were no differences in change in thoracic aorta calcium scores between placebo (132 [22–512] Agatston units) and either denosumab (118 [11–340], P = 0.75) or alendronic acid (116 [26–498] Agatston units, P = 0.62). There were no differences in changes in coronary or aortic 18F-sodium fluoride activity between treatment groups.

Conclusions

Neither alendronic acid nor denosumab are associated with changes in the activity or progression of coronary or aortic calcification. Osteoporosis treatments do not appear to have major impact on vascular calcification of atherosclerosis.

### Lipoprotein (a) associated molecules are prominent components in plasma and valve leaflets in calcific aortic valve stenosis [^6d60ebfa]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2017). Low credibility.

There are no effective medical therapies to prevent the development or progression of CAVS, and statins have failed to reduce progression of AVR in 4 randomized trials. Statins additionally may significantly raise plasma Lp(a) and OxPL-apoB, which may be counterproductive in preventing CAVS. For example, rosuvastatin raised Lp(a) levels 20% in the ASTRONOMER trial. However, novel Lp(a)-lowering agents may be used in the near future to test the hypothesis that lowering Lp(a) reduces progression of CAVS.

The objective of this study was 3-fold: 1) to develop plasma measures of autotaxin carried by apoB and Lp(a); 2) to define lysophophatidic and phosphocholine-containing oxidized phospholipids within aortic valve leaflets; and 3) to document the presence of Lp(a) and oxidation-specific epitopes in aortic valve leaflets obtained following aortic valve replacement.

The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for aortic stenosis, more specifically with respect to indications for referral, ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider consulting with or referring to a primary or comprehensive heart valve center when discussing treatment options for:

- asymptomatic patients with severe valvular heart disease

- patients likely to benefit from valve repair versus valve replacement

- patients with multiple comorbidities considered for valve intervention.

### Relation of left ventricular mass to prognosis in initially asymptomatic mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis [^4776d0b4]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The prognostic importance of left ventricular (LV) mass in nonsevere asymptomatic aortic stenosis has not been documented in a large prospective study.

Methods and Results

Cox regression analysis was used to assess the impact of echocardiographic LV mass on rate of major cardiovascular events in 1656 patients (mean age, 67 years; 39.6% women) with mild-to-moderate asymptomatic aortic stenosis participating in the Simvastatin Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) study. Patients were followed during 4.3 years of randomized treatment with combined simvastatin 40 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg daily or placebo. At baseline, LV mass index was 45.9+14.9 g/m(2.7), and peak aortic jet velocity was 3.09+0.54 m/s. During follow-up, 558 major cardiovascular events occurred. In Cox regression analyses, 1 SD (15 g/m(2.7)) higher baseline LV mass index predicted increases in hazards of 12% for major cardiovascular events, 28% for ischemic cardiovascular events, 34% for cardiovascular mortality, and 23% for combined total mortality and hospitalization for heart failure (all P < 0.01), independent of confounders. In time-varying models, taking the progressive increase in LV mass index during follow-up into account, 1 SD higher in-study LV mass index was consistently associated with 13% to 61% higher hazard for cardiovascular events (all P < 0.01), independent of age, sex, body mass index, valvuloarterial impedance, LV ejection fraction and concentricity, and the presence of concomitant hypertension.

Conclusions

Higher LV mass index is independently associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality during progression of aortic stenosis.

### Association between calcific aortic stenosis and hypercholesterolemia: is there a need for a randomized controlled trial of cholesterol-lowering therapy? [^03c59f12]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Calcific aortic stenosis may have common etiological factors with atherosclerosis.

Hypothesis

In this retrospective, case-control study, we aimed to determine whether there is an association between hypercholesterolemia and calcific aortic valve stenosis.

Methods

Consecutive patients undergoing single aortic or mitral valve replacement in a regional cardiothoracic surgical center were reviewed and preoperative patient characteristics were recorded: demographics, comorbidity (including coronary artery disease and associated risk factors), serum total cholesterol, lipid-lowering therapy, and serum creatinine.

Results

Serum total cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher in patients with calcific aortic stenosis than in controls (6.2 ± 1.1 vs. 5.3 ± 1.1 mmol/l; p < 0.001). The significant difference in serum cholesterol concentrations remained following correction for gender and body mass index (p = 0.02) and when patients with coronary artery disease were excluded (6.3 ± 1.1 vs. 5.3 ± 1.4 mmol/l; p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the association between elevated serum cholesterol concentrations and calcific aortic stenosis was particularly strong in patients with tricuspid aortic valves (6.4 ± 1.2 vs. 5.3 ± 1.1 mmol/l; p < 0.001) compared with those with bicuspid valves (5.9 ± 1.1 vs. 5.3 ± 1.1 mmol/l; p = 0.06).

Conclusions

We conclude that hypercholesterolemia is associated with calcific aortic stenosis and may be implicated in its pathogenesis and progression. We believe that there is now a need for a randomized, controlled trial of cholesterol-lowering therapy in patients with calcific aortic stenosis.
