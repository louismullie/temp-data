## Question

Levaquin oral bioavailability

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the oral bioavailability of Levaquin (levofloxacin). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative source for pharmacokinetic data. Then, I should verify the exact bioavailability figures and whether they differ by tablet strength. Next, I will check whether oral and intravenous exposures are truly interchangeable. After that, I should review how food affects absorption and whether that changes clinical administration. Finally, I will consider any exceptions or caveats that could alter bioavailability in real-world use, such as drug–drug interactions or pediatric formulations, and then synthesize a concise, clinically actionable answer.

> Let me first confirm the primary source. The FDA prescribing information is the most reliable authority for pharmacokinetics, and multiple FDA labels consistently state that levofloxacin is rapidly and essentially completely absorbed after oral administration, with an absolute oral bioavailability of approximately 99% for both the 500 mg and 750 mg tablet strengths, indicating near-complete oral absorption [^b8b1a207] [^4c0f2afa] [^5b2223bb] [^0c985072].

> Wait, let me verify the exact figures and whether there is any meaningful difference between strengths. The labels specify that the absolute bioavailability from a 500 mg tablet is 0.99 ± 0.08 and from a 750 mg tablet is 0.99 ± 0.06, confirming that both strengths have essentially 99% bioavailability with minimal variability, and that oral and IV exposures are comparable when equal milligram doses are given, supporting interchangeability in clinical practice [^0c985072] [^b8b1a207] [^4c0f2afa].

> I should confirm the clinical implication of this high bioavailability. Because oral exposure approximates IV exposure, oral levofloxacin can often substitute for IV therapy when patients can take oral medications, which is reflected in guideline recommendations that list oral fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, as acceptable options for step-down or even initial oral therapy in selected infections, and in observational data showing similar outcomes whether fluoroquinolones are started orally or intravenously in hospitalized CAP patients [^f56c04c2] [^de3f8c28] [^66bbb8bd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about administration with food. I initially thought food might not matter at all, but I need to check the magnitude of any food effect. The FDA labeling indicates that taking a 500 mg dose with food delays the time to peak by about 1 hour and reduces the peak concentration by roughly 14% for tablets and about 25% for the oral solution, while the overall exposure (AUC) is not significantly affected; therefore, tablets can be administered without regard to food, whereas the oral solution is preferably given 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals to minimize the Cmax reduction [^b8b1a207] [^4c0f2afa] [^5b2223bb].

> But wait, what if coadministered agents impair absorption. I need to ensure I flag chelation interactions. Divalent and trivalent cations such as magnesium, aluminum, iron, zinc, and calcium-containing antacids or supplements, as well as sucralfate and buffered didanosine, can bind fluoroquinolones and markedly reduce oral absorption; clinically, levofloxacin should be separated by at least 2 hours from these agents to avoid subtherapeutic exposure and resistance selection, which is a key caveat despite the intrinsically high bioavailability [^bc507247] [^5698046b] [^011c74b4].

> Let me consider pediatric and special formulations, because I should double-check whether bioavailability differs in children. Population pharmacokinetic analyses in children show that dispersible 100 mg tablets achieve higher apparent oral bioavailability than nondispersible 250 mg tablets, with the nondispersible formulation showing about 29% lower relative bioavailability; this formulation effect explains why pediatric dosing recommendations often prefer dispersible tablets and why weight-based pediatric doses may appear higher when using nondispersible tablets to achieve comparable exposures to adults [^334ca8ad] [^2d3214bb] [^b356d864].

> I should confirm that I am not overstating anything about clinical outcomes. While the 99% oral bioavailability supports IV-to-PO conversion, outcomes still depend on infection site, severity, and host factors; nonetheless, multiple guidelines endorse oral fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, as appropriate options for conditions like complicated UTIs, intra-abdominal infections, and selected bone and joint infections when patients are clinically stable and can absorb oral medications, reinforcing the practical relevance of the high oral bioavailability in real-world care pathways [^f56c04c2] [^de3f8c28] [^20773f23].

> In summary, after verifying across FDA sources and supportive literature, levofloxacin (Levaquin) exhibits approximately 99% oral bioavailability for both 500 mg and 750 mg tablets, with oral and IV exposures that are essentially interchangeable milligram-for-milligram; tablets can be taken without regard to food, though a modest delay in Tmax and reduction in Cmax occurs with food, and absorption can be markedly reduced by coadministration with divalent/trivalent cation–containing agents, which should be separated by at least 2 hours [^b8b1a207] [^4c0f2afa] [^0c985072] [^bc507247].

---

Levaquin (levofloxacin) has an **oral bioavailability of approximately 99%** [^b8b1a207], indicating near-complete absorption after oral administration [^4c0f2afa]. Peak plasma concentrations are typically achieved within 1–2 hours [^b8b1a207], and food delays the time to peak by about 1 hour while reducing the peak concentration by roughly 14% [^b8b1a207]; however, the overall exposure (AUC) remains unchanged, so tablets can be taken with or without food [^b8b1a207]. Because oral and IV formulations yield similar systemic exposure, they are clinically interchangeable for the same milligram dose [^ca3afce0].

---

## Pharmacokinetic parameters influencing bioavailability

Several **pharmacokinetic parameters** influence the bioavailability of levofloxacin:

- **Absorption**: Levofloxacin is rapidly and essentially completely absorbed after oral administration [^b8b1a207], with peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) typically achieved within 1–2 hours [^b8b1a207].

- **Food effect**: Administration with food delays the time to peak concentration (Tmax) by approximately 1 hour and reduces the peak concentration (Cmax) by about 14% for tablets and 25% for oral solution [^b8b1a207]. However, the overall exposure (area under the curve, AUC) remains unchanged, indicating that food does not significantly affect total absorption [^b8b1a207].

- **Formulation differences**: The oral tablet and oral solution formulations are bioequivalent, meaning they have similar pharmacokinetic profiles and can be used interchangeably [^4c0f2afa].

---

## Clinical implications of high oral bioavailability

The **high oral bioavailability** of levofloxacin has several important clinical implications:

- **Oral and IV interchangeability**: The oral and intravenous formulations of levofloxacin are clinically interchangeable, allowing for seamless transitions between routes of administration without affecting therapeutic efficacy [^ca3afce0].

- **Convenience and adherence**: The high oral bioavailability enables effective outpatient treatment, reducing the need for hospitalization or intravenous therapy, thereby improving patient adherence and quality of life.

- **Cost-effectiveness**: Oral administration reduces healthcare costs associated with intravenous therapy, such as hospitalization, nursing care, and equipment.

---

## Factors influencing bioavailability variability

While levofloxacin exhibits high oral bioavailability, certain factors can influence **variability in absorption**:

- **Age**: Elderly patients may experience slight delays in absorption due to age-related changes in gastrointestinal motility, but overall bioavailability remains high [^notfound].

- **Renal impairment**: Levofloxacin is primarily eliminated unchanged by the kidneys, and renal impairment can affect its pharmacokinetics. However, bioavailability itself is not significantly altered, though dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with renal impairment [^bc507247].

- **Drug interactions**: Coadministration with divalent or trivalent cation-containing agents (e.g. antacids, sucralfate, iron supplements) can significantly reduce levofloxacin absorption, thereby decreasing its bioavailability. It is recommended to administer these agents at least 2 hours before or after levofloxacin [^bc507247] [^5698046b].

---

## Comparison with other fluoroquinolones

Levofloxacin's oral bioavailability is among the highest among fluoroquinolones, making it a preferred agent for oral therapy. For comparison, **ciprofloxacin** has an oral bioavailability of approximately 70–80%, while **moxifloxacin** also has high oral bioavailability (approximately 90%) [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of **high oral bioavailability** agents like levofloxacin for outpatient therapy and IV-to-oral conversions. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommend levofloxacin for various infections, including community-acquired pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections, citing its excellent oral bioavailability and clinical efficacy [^f56c04c2] [^4fa57258].

---

Levaquin (levofloxacin) has an **oral bioavailability of approximately 99%**, allowing for effective oral therapy with clinical outcomes comparable to intravenous administration. This high bioavailability, coupled with favorable pharmacokinetic properties, makes levofloxacin a valuable option for outpatient treatment and IV-to-oral conversions.

Absorption

Levofloxacin is rapidly and essentially completely absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations are usually attained one to two hours after oral dosing. The absolute bioavailability of levofloxacin from a 500 mg tablet and a 750 mg tablet of levofloxacinare both approximately 99%, demonstrating complete oral absorption of levofloxacin. Following a single intravenous dose of levofloxacin to healthy volunteers, the mean ± SD peak plasma concentration attained was 6.2 ± 1 mcg/mL after a 500 mg dose infused over 60 minutes and 11.5 ± 4 mcg/mL after a 750 mg dose infused over 90 minutes. Oral administration of a 500 mg dose of levofloxacin with food prolongs the time to peak concentration by approximately 1 hour and decreases the peak concentration by approximately 14% following tablet and approximately 25% following oral solution administration. Therefore, levofloxacin tablets can be administered without regard to food.

The plasma concentration profile of levofloxacin after IV administration is similar and comparable in extent of exposure (AUC) to that observed for levofloxacin tablets when equal doses (mg/mg) are administered. Therefore, the oral and IV routes of administration can be considered interchangeable.

Distribution

The mean volume of distribution of levofloxacin generally ranges from 74 to 112 L after single and multiple 500 mg or 750 mg doses, indicating widespread distribution into body tissues. Levofloxacin reaches its peak levels in skin tissues and in blister fluid of healthy subjects at approximately 3 hours after dosing. The skin tissue biopsy to plasma AUC ratio is approximately 2 and the blister fluid to plasma AUC ratio is approximately 1 following multiple once-daily oral administration of 750 mg and 500 mg doses of levofloxacin, respectively, to healthy subjects. Levofloxacin also penetrates well into lung tissues. Lung tissue concentrations were generally 2- to 5-fold higher than plasma concentrations and ranged from approximately 2.4 to 11.3 mcg/g over a 24-hour period after a single 500 mg oral dose.

### Bioavailability of two oral formulations of a single dose of levofloxacin 500 mg: an open-label, randomized, two-period crossover comparison in healthy Mexican volunteers [^82f6ae31]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Levofloxacin is a synthetic fluoroquinolone with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. It is indicated for the treatment of respiratory, sinus, skin, and urinary tract infections. Although generic formulations of oral levofloxacin are marketed in Mexico, a literature search did not identify published data concerning the bioavailability of these formulations; these data would be relevant to secure marketing of a test formulation in Mexico.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the bioavailability and determine the bioequivalence of a test formulation (an oral tablet containing levofloxacin 500 mg) with its corresponding listed reference-drug formulation in Mexico (a list issued by Mexican Health Authorities).

Methods

A single-dose, open-label, randomized-sequence, 2-period crossover design was used in this study. Eligible participants were healthy Mexican adults of either sex, randomly assigned to receive the test formulation followed by the corresponding reference formulation, or vice versa, with a 1-week washout period between doses. After a 10-hour overnight fast, the participants received the assigned formulation. Plasma concentrations of levofloxacin were determined using high-performance thin-layer chromatography, and densitometric analysis was performed at 300 nm. For the analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters, including Cmax, AUC₀–₂₄, and AUC₀–∞, blood samples were drawn at baseline and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after administration. The test formulation was considered to meet the criteria for bioequivalence if the geometric mean ratios (test/reference) were with- in the predetermined range of 80% to 125%. Tolerability was determined by clinical assessment, vital signs, laboratory analysis, and interviews with participants about adverse events.

Results

A total of 26 participants were enrolled, including 14 men and 12 women with a mean (SD) age of 24 (4) years (range, 18–34 years), weight of 62.2 (10.0) kg (range, 45.5–80.0 kg), height of 163 (9) cm (range, 148–176 cm), and body mass index of 23.3 (2.4) kg/m² (range, 19.2–27.1 kg/m²). The 90% CIs for log-transformed Cmax, AUC₀–₂₄, and AUC₀–∞ were 94.48% to 106.22%, 90.01% to 116.44%, and 85.11% to 114.00%, respectively. Eleven participants reported a total of 20 adverse events during the study. None of the adverse events were considered serious.

Conclusions

In this small study in healthy, fasting Mexican adults, a single 500-mg dose of the test formulation of orally administered levofloxacin met the regulatory requirements to assume bioequivalence based on the rate and extent of absorption. Both formulations were well tolerated.

### Levofloxacin in 5% dextrose (levofloxacin) [^4c0f2afa]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Levofloxacin is a member of the fluoroquinolone class of antibacterial agents [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The mean ± SD pharmacokinetic parameters of levofloxacin determined under single and steady-state conditions following oral tablet, oral solution, or intravenous (IV) doses of levofloxacin are summarized in Table 8.

Absorption

Levofloxacin is rapidly and essentially completely absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations are usually attained one to two hours after oral dosing. The absolute bioavailability of levofloxacin from a 500 mg tablet and a 750 mg tablet of levofloxacin are both approximately 99%, demonstrating complete oral absorption of levofloxacin. Following a single intravenous dose of levofloxacin to healthy volunteers, the mean ± SD peak plasma concentration attained was 6.2 ± 1.0 mcg/mL after a 500 mg dose infused over 60 minutes and 11.5 ± 4.0 mcg/mL after a 750 mg dose infused over 90 minutes. Levofloxacin oral solution and tablet formulations are bioequivalent.

Levofloxacin pharmacokinetics are linear and predictable after single and multiple oral or IV dosing regimens. Steady-state conditions are reached within 48 hours following a 500 mg or 750 mg once-daily dosage regimen. The mean ± SD peak and trough plasma concentrations attained following multiple once-daily oral dosage regimens were approximately 5.7 ± 1.4 and 0.5 ± 0.2 mcg/mL after the 500 mg doses, and 8.6 ± 1.9 and 1.1 ± 0.4 mcg/mL after the 750 mg doses, respectively. The mean ± SD peak and trough plasma concentrations attained following multiple once-daily IV regimens were approximately 6.4 ± 0.8 and 0.6 ± 0.2 mcg/mL after the 500 mg doses, and 12.1 ± 4.1 and 1.3 ± 0.71 mcg/mL after the 750 mg doses, respectively. Oral administration of a 500 mg dose of levofloxacin with food prolongs the time to peak concentration by approximately 1 hour and decreases the peak concentration by approximately 14% following tablet and approximately 25% following oral solution administration. Therefore, levofloxacin tablets can be administered without regard to food. It is recommended that levofloxacin oral solution be taken 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating.

### Identification and quantification ofvariants in fluoroquinolone-resistant in a meltArray reaction [^3554c3bd]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Fluoroquinolones (FQs), particularly moxifloxacin (MXF) and levofloxacin (LEV), are essential components for treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB). Renowned for their potent bactericidal activity, excellent tissue penetration, and high oral bioavailability, FQs are integral to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended shorter all-oral regimens. While their proper use has reduced morbidity and mortality from resistant strains, the alarming rise in FQs resistance is fueling the emergence of pre-extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (pre-XDR-TB), defined as MDR-TB with additional resistance to any FQs, posing a critical threat to global tuberculosis control efforts.

The acquisition of resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is predominantly driven by mutations occurring within the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of gyrA, which encodes DNA gyrase, with alterations, especially at codons 90, 91, and 94, changing the quinolone binding pocket and causing cross-resistance to all FQs. One challenge in managing FQs resistance lies in the diverse phenotypic resistance levels associated with different gyrA mutation types, ranging from low-level, which is treatable with standard or higher doses, to high-level resistance, which typically requires exclusion from treatment regimens. Moreover, while a single gyrA mutation in patients may result in low-level resistance, multiple co-occurring mutations can elevate resistance to a high level. Consequently, the identification of mutation types and their co-occurrence is important for predicting resistance level.

Pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers

In 6 fasting healthy male volunteers, approximately 95% to 98% of a single oral dose of lomefloxacin was absorbed. Absorption was rapid following single doses of 200 and 400 mg (Tmax0.8 to 1.4 hours). Mean plasma concentration increased proportionally between 100 and 400 mg as shown below:

In 6 healthy male volunteers administered 400 mg of lomefloxacin on an empty stomach qd for 7 days, the following mean pharmacokinetic parameter values were obtained:

The elimination half-life in 8 subjects with normal renal function was approximately 8 hours. At 24 hours postdose, subjects with normal renal function receiving single doses of 200 or 400 mg had mean plasma lomefloxacin concentrations of 0.10 and 0.24 µg/mL, respectively. Steady-state concentrations were achieved within 48 hours of initiating therapy with one-a-day dosing. There was no drug accumulation with single-daily dosing in patients with normal renal function.

Approximately 65% of an orally administered dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug in patients with normal renal function. Following a 400-mg dose of lomefloxacin administered qd for 7 days, the mean urine concentration 4 hours postdose was in excess of 300 µg/mL. The mean urine concentration exceeded 35 µg/mL for at least 24 hours after dosing.

Following a single 400-mg dose, the solubility of lomefloxacin in urine usually exceeded its peak urinary concentration 2- to 6-fold. In this study, urine pH affected the solubility of lomefloxacin with solubilities ranging from 7.8 mg/mL at pH 5.2, to 2.4 mg/mL at pH 6.5, and 3.03 mg/mL at pH 8.12.

The urinary excretion of lomefloxacin was virtually complete within 72 hours after cessation of dosing, with approximately 65% of the dose being recovered as parent drug and 9% as its glucuronide metabolite. The mean renal clearance was 145 mL/min in subjects with normal renal function (GFR = 120 mL/min). This may indicate tubular secretion.

Food effect

When lomefloxacin and food were administered concomitantly, the rate of drug absorption was delayed (Tmaxincreased to 2 hours [delayed by 41%], Cmaxdecreased by 18%), and the extent of absorption (AUC) was decreased by 12%.

### Levofloxacin in 5% dextrose (levofloxacin) [^1d83c2b9]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

There are no significant differences in levofloxacin pharmacokinetics between young and elderly subjects when the subjects' differences in creatinine clearance are taken into consideration. Following a 500 mg oral dose of levofloxacin to healthy elderly subjects (66 to 80 years of age), the mean terminal plasma elimination half-life of levofloxacin was about 7.6 hours, as compared to approximately 6 hours in younger adults. The difference was attributable to the variation in renal function status of the subjects and was not believed to be clinically significant. Drug absorption appears to be unaffected by age. Levofloxacin dose adjustment based on age alone is not necessary [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Pediatrics

The pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin following a single 7 mg/kg intravenous dose were investigated in pediatric patients ranging in age from 6 months to 16 years. Pediatric patients cleared levofloxacin faster than adult patients, resulting in lower plasma exposures than adults for a given mg/kg dose. Subsequent pharmacokinetic analyses predicted that a dosage regimen of 8 mg/kg every 12 hours (not to exceed 250 mg per dose) for pediatric patients 6 months to 17 years of age would achieve comparable steady state plasma exposures (AUC₀–₂₄ and Cmax) to those observed in adult patients administered 500 mg of levofloxacin once every 24 hours.

### Llevofloxacin (levofloxacin) [^ca3afce0]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The plasma concentration profile of levofloxacin after IV administration is similar and comparable in extent of exposure (AUC) to that observed for levofloxacin tablets when equal doses (mg/mg) are administered. Therefore, the oral and IV routes of administration can be considered interchangeable.

Distribution

The mean volume of distribution of levofloxacin generally ranges from 74 to 112 L after single and multiple 500 mg or 750 mg doses, indicating widespread distribution into body tissues. Levofloxacin reaches its peak levels in skin tissues and in blister fluid of healthy subjects at approximately 3 hours after dosing. The skin tissue biopsy to plasma AUC ratio is approximately 2 and the blister fluid to plasma AUC ratio is approximately 1 following multiple once-daily oral administration of 750 mg and 500 mg doses of levofloxacin, respectively, to healthy subjects. Levofloxacin also penetrates well into lung tissues. Lung tissue concentrations were generally 2- to 5-fold higher than plasma concentrations and ranged from approximately 2.4 to 11.3 mcg/g over a 24 hour period after a single 500 mg oral dose.

In vitro, over a clinically relevant range (1 to 10 mcg/mL) of serum/plasma levofloxacin concentrations, levofloxacin is approximately 24 to 38% bound to serum proteins across all species studied, as determined by the equilibrium dialysis method. Levofloxacin is mainly bound to serum albumin in humans. Levofloxacin binding to serum proteins is independent of the drug concentration.

### Ocular penetration of levofloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in eyes with functioning filtering blebs: investigator masked, randomised clinical trial [^6e372f27]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

To compare the penetration of levofloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in the aqueous humour of eyes with functioning filtering blebs.

Methods

In this investigator-masked study, 48 patients with functioning filtering blebs requiring cataract surgery were randomised into six groups of eight patients. Groups 1, 2 and 3 received topical ofloxacin 0.3% (Ocuflox), ciprofloxacin 0.3% (Ciloxan) and levofloxacin (Quixin) respectively; Groups 4, 5 and 6 received the same treatment with the corresponding oral dose of ofloxacin 400 mg (Floxin), ciprofloxacin 400 mg (Cipro) and levofloxacin 250 mg (Levaquin). Aqueous antibiotic levels were determined by mass spectrometry of aqueous samples from each patient.

Results

The mean aqueous level for topical levofloxacin was significantly higher than those achieved by topical ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin (p value = 0.02 and 0.01, respectively). The combination of topical and oral levofloxacin was significantly higher than topical levofloxacin alone (p = 0.05) and the ciprofloxacin combination (p = 0.003) but not significantly higher than the ofloxacin combination therapy.

Conclusions

Topical levofloxacin penetrates better than ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin into the aqueous of eyes with functioning filtering blebs. The combination of topical and oral levofloxacin may be preferable in the treatment of bleb-associated infections (NCT 00392275; Clinical trials.gov).

### Pharmacokinetics and optimal dosing of levofloxacin in children for drug-resistant tuberculosis: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^334ca8ad]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Each year 25 000–32 000 children develop rifampicin- or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (RR/MDR-TB), and many more require preventive treatment. Levofloxacin is a key component of RR/MDR-TB treatment and prevention, but the existing pharmacokinetic data in children have not yet been comprehensively summarized. We aimed to characterize levofloxacin pharmacokinetics through an individual patient data meta-analysis of available studies and to determine optimal dosing in children.

Methods

Levofloxacin concentration and demographic data were pooled from 5 studies and analyzed using nonlinear mixed effects modeling. Simulations were performed using current World Health Organization (WHO)–recommended and model-informed optimized doses. Optimal levofloxacin doses were identified to target median adult area under the time-concentration curve AUC₂₄ of 101 mg·h/L given current standard adult doses.

Results

Data from 242 children (2.8 years [0.2–16.8] was used). Apparent clearance was 3.16 L/h for a 13-kg child. Age affected clearance, reaching 50% maturation at birth and 90% maturation at 8 months. Nondispersible tablets had 29% lower apparent oral bioavailability compared to dispersible tablets. Median exposures at current WHO-recommended doses were below the AUC target for children weighing < 24 kg and under < 10 years, resulting in approximately half of the exposure in adults. Model-informed doses of 16–33 mg/kg for dispersible tablets or 16–50 mg/kg for nondispersible tablets were required to meet the AUC target without significantly exceeding the median adult C max.

Conclusions

Revised weight-band dosing guidelines with doses of > 20 mg/kg are required to ensure adequate exposure. Further studies are needed to determine safety and tolerability of these higher doses.

Coadministration of oral divalent or trivalent cation-containing compounds with oral fluoroquinolones may impair fluoroquinolone absorption. Among 3,134 patients who received a course of oral levofloxacin, coadministration was significantly associated with subsequent identification of a levofloxacin-resistant isolate. Strategies to curb the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance should include avoiding the coadministration of divalent or trivalent cation-containing compounds and fluoroquinolone.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) oral antibiotics — dose for patients with normal renal function includes the following regimens: Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875mg-125mg every 8 to 12 hours (note: "Other regimens may be more effective"); Cefpodoxime 200mg to 400mg every 12 hours; Ceftibuten 9mg/kg daily (children) and 400mg daily or 200mg every 12 hours (adults); Cefuroxime 500mg every 12 hours; Cephalexin 500mg to 1000mg every 6 hours (note: "Other regimens may be more effective"); Ciprofloxacin 500mg to 750mg every 12 hours; Levofloxacin 500mg to 750mg daily; Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 800mg-160mg every 12 hours. For other oral beta-lactams (e.g. amoxicillin, cefadroxil, cefaclor, cefdinir), comparative clinical outcomes data vs highly bioavailable oral alternatives are more limited and/or discouraging; consider use with infectious disease pharmacist consultation if alternatives are not available.

Specific Populations

Geriatric Patients

There are no significant differences in levofloxacin pharmacokinetics between young and elderly subjects when the subjects' differences in creatinine clearance are taken into consideration. Following a 500 mg oral dose of levofloxacin to healthy elderly subjects (66 to 80 years of age), the mean terminal plasma elimination half-life of levofloxacin was about 7.6 hours, as compared to approximately 6 hours in younger adults. The difference was attributable to the variation in renal function status of the subjects and was not believed to be clinically significant. Drug absorption appears to be unaffected by age. Levofloxacin dose adjustment based on age alone is not necessary [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Pediatric Patients

The pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin following a single 7 mg/kg intravenous dose were investigated in pediatric patients ranging in age from 6 months to 16 years. Pediatric patients cleared levofloxacin faster than adult patients, resulting in lower plasma exposures than adults for a given mg/kg dose. Subsequent pharmacokinetic analyses predicted that a dosage regimen of 8 mg/kg every 12 hours (not to exceed 250 mg per dose) for pediatric patients 6 months to 17 years of age would achieve comparable steady state plasma exposures (AUC0-24and Cmax) to those observed in adult patients administered 500 mg of levofloxacin once every 24 hours. Levofloxacin tablets can only be administered to pediatric patients with inhalational anthrax (post-exposure) or plague who are 30 kg or greater due to the limitations of the available strengths [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Lomefloxacin hydrochloride (Maxaquin) [^41382c36]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Maxaquin (lomefloxacin HCl) may be taken without regard to meals. Sucralfate and antacids containing magnesium or aluminum, or Videx®(didanosine), chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 4 hours before or 2 hours after taking lomefloxacin. Risk of reaction to solar UVA light may be reduced by taking Maxaquin at least 12 hours before exposure to the sun (eg, in the evening). (See Clinical Pharmacology .)

See Indications and Usage for information on appropriate pathogens and patient populations.

Treatment

Patients with normal renal function

The recommended daily dose of Maxaquin is described in the following chart:

Elderly patients

No dosage adjustment is needed for elderly patients with normal renal function (ClCr ≥ 40 mL/min/1.73 m²).

Patients with impaired renal function

Lomefloxacin is primarily eliminated by renal excretion. (See Clinical Pharmacology .) Modification of dosage is recommended in patients with renal dysfunction. In patients with a creatinine clearance > 10 mL/min/1.73 m²but < 40 mL/min/1.73 m², the recommended dosage is an initial loading dose of 400 mg followed by daily maintenance doses of 200 mg (1/2 tablet) once daily for the duration of treatment. It is suggested that serial determinations of lomefloxacin levels be performed to determine any necessary alteration in the appropriate next dosing interval.

If only the serum creatinine is known, the following formula may be used to estimate creatinine clearance.

Men: (weight in kg) × (140 – age)

(72) × serum creatinine (mg/dL)

Women: (0.85) × (calculated value for men)

Dialysis patients

Hemodialysis removes only a negligible amount of lomefloxacin (3% in 4 hours). Hemodialysis patients should receive an initial loading dose of 400 mg followed by daily maintenance doses of 200 mg (1/2 tablet) once daily for the duration of treatment.

Patients with cirrhosis

Cirrhosis does not reduce the nonrenal clearance of lomefloxacin. The need for a dosage reduction in this population should be based on the degree of renal function of the patient and on the plasma concentrations. (See Clinical Pharmacology and Dosage and Administration — Patients with impaired renal function .)

Prevention / prophylaxis

The recommended dose of Maxaquin is described in the following chart:

PHARMACOKINETICS

Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics (PK) and disposition of delafloxacin following a single intravenous dose administered to healthy male volunteers showed the mean C max, area under the curve (AUC 0-∞), T max, and T ½ to be 8.98 mg/L, 21.31 mg.h/L, 1 h, and 2.35 h, respectively. Excretion was predominantly (66%) via the kidney, with a lower proportion (29%) of the dose excreted in the feces. The predominant circulating components were determined to be delafloxacin and its direct glucuronide conjugate. Delafloxacin exhibits linear PK that reach steady-state following 3 days of daily oral dosing, with minimal accumulation. Delafloxacin oral bioavailability is 58.8%, which is lower than for levofloxacin or moxifloxacin, but total systemic exposure (AUC 0-t and AUC 0-∞) following a single intravenous (300 mg) and a single oral dose (450 mg) of delafloxacin was equivalent (Table 2). Thus, a transition between dosing routes with daily dose adjustment is possible and has been approved in the United States. The mean absolute bioavailability of delafloxacin was not affected by food. The steady state volume of distribution of delafloxacin is 30–48 L, which approximates total body water. The plasma protein binding of delafloxacin is approximately 84% (involving primarily albumin). Plasma protein binding of delafloxacin is not significantly affected by renal impairment. In a mass balance study, the mean half-life for delafloxacin was 3.7 h (standard deviation [SD] 0.7 h) after a single dose intravenous administration. The mean half-life values for delafloxacin ranged from 4.2 to 8.5 h following multiple oral administrations.

### Efficacy and safety of higher doses of levofloxacin for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial [^75e0041f]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We have confirmed previous observations that higher doses of levofloxacin result in higher exposures. However, these higher exposures did not result in faster times to culture conversion. Moreover, the proportion of participants with grade ≥ 3 AEs and SAEs was increased in those receiving higher levofloxacin doses (> 1,000 mg). Although there was no obvious relationship between levofloxacin and the type of AE, our goal was to determine the type of TB treatment that is associated with the lowest rate of AEs overall, even if one was not expected based on levofloxacin-related toxicities identified to date. This suggests no benefit in efficacy with increasing doses to > 1,000 mg/d. There was no observable increase in toxicity when people weighing < 60 kg received 1,000 mg/d. Although we saw limited variability in AUC in our small study sample, there is wide variability in levofloxacin absorption, and a 750-mg dose might result in some participants achieving drug levels below the target exposure. For this reason, we propose that a dose of 1,000 mg/d may be preferred as likely to achieve the target concentration in the largest number of patients. In programs using a fixed dose, 1,000 mg will ensure everyone is dosed adequately.

14.9 Inhalational Anthrax (Post-Exposure)

The effectiveness of levofloxacin for this indication is based on plasma concentrations achieved in humans, a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Levofloxacin has not been tested in humans for the post-exposure prevention of inhalation anthrax. The mean plasma concentrations of levofloxacin associated with a statistically significant improvement in survival over placebo in the rhesus monkey model of inhalational anthrax are reached or exceeded in adult and pediatric patients receiving the recommended oral and intravenous dosage regimens [see Indications and Usage (1.13) and Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)].

Levofloxacin pharmacokinetics have been evaluated in adult and pediatric patients. The mean (± SD) steady state peak plasma concentration in human adults receiving 500 mg orally or intravenously once daily is 5.7 ± 1.4 and 6.4 ± 0.8 mcg/mL, respectively; and the corresponding total plasma exposure (AUC0-24) is 47.5 ± 6.7 and 54.6 ± 11.1 mcg.h/mL, respectively. The predicted steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters in pediatric patients ranging in age from 6 months to 17 years receiving 8 mg/kg orally every 12 hours (not to exceed 250 mg per dose) were calculated to be comparable to those observed in adults receiving 500 mg orally once daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Levofloxacin tablets can only be administered to pediatric patients with inhalational anthrax (post-exposure) or plague who are 30 kg or greater due to the limitations of the available strengths [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

DISCUSSION

This study provides an IPD-MA of the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin in a large number of well-characterized children who received treatment for RR/MDR-TB exposure or disease. Levofloxacin exposures in children who received the current WHO-recommended doses were lower than the target exposure extrapolated from adults who received a 750-mg daily dose across all studies, especially for younger and smaller children, placing them at higher risk for unsuccessful treatment. Dispersible levofloxacin tablets had higher bioavailability compared with nondispersible tablets and also allowed for more precise dosing. However, the proposed model-optimized doses, which would achieve adequate exposure in all children and align with current WHO weight bands, can be practically implemented with both available oral formulations.

Our study showed that levofloxacin exposure in children aged < 10 years or who weighed < 24 kg was substantially lower than the target exposure derived from adults who received a standard daily dose of 750 mg. Failure to meet the adult levofloxacin exposure median places children at higher risk for unfavorable treatment outcomes. Our model structure did not significantly differ from previously published models of levofloxacin pharmacokinetics in children, and we consistently report that exposure in children is below the target extrapolated from adults and similar model-informed dosing recommendations. It is also important to highlight that even though there were 20 children (8%) with HIV, an effect of the disease or of concomitant administration of antiretrovirals could not be identified in the model. Similarly, even though there is substantial representation of malnourished children, an effect of malnutrition (in addition to the effects of weight and age already included in the model) could not be identified.

### Efficacy and safety of higher doses of levofloxacin for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial [^4219b0f6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we have shown that doses of levofloxacin > 1,000 mg/d do not reduce time to culture conversion but do result in an increased risk of grade ≥ 3 AEs, with higher exposures also associated with slightly more QTcF prolongation. In our study, a dose of 750 mg was adequate to achieve the target AUC/MIC of 100. However, because there was no detectable difference in toxicity between doses of 750 mg/d and 1,000 mg/d and there is wide variability of AUCs achieved with oral levofloxacin, we conclude that a dose of 1,000 mg/d will most reliably achieve target levels without incurring unnecessary toxicity.

METHODS

Clinical Studies and Data

We undertook a systematic review of studies reporting on levofloxacin pharmacokinetics in children and adolescents for any indication. Additional methods for identifying eligible studies are described in the Supplementary materials. Primary authors of eligible studies were asked to provide available patient-level information on demographics (age, sex, weight, height), clinical characteristics (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] status, indication for anti-TB therapy), and levofloxacin administration details (drug dose, formulation, route of administration, dosing time, dosing interval, pharmacokinetic sampling time, plasma levofloxacin concentrations). Informed consent was obtained from all participants in the 5 studies for which deidentified data were used for the IPD-MA. This IPD-MA was approved by the Stellenbosch University Health Research Ethics Committee.

Data Analyses

Levofloxacin concentration data were pooled and analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling with the software NONMEM and first-order conditional estimation with interaction for parameter estimation. Samples reported as below the limit of quantification were imputed at half the lower limit of quantification and included in the analysis. Additive, proportional, and combined error models were tested. Random effects at interindividual, interoccasion, and between-study variability were modeled exponentially. One- and 2-compartment models were evaluated with first-order absorption and linear and nonlinear elimination.

Model building was based on a likelihood ratio test, known as the objective function value (OFV), with a significance level of P < .05 and inspection of simulation-based diagnostics. Stepwise covariate modeling (P < .05 forward selection; P < .01 backward deletion) was performed to identify predictors of volume, clearance, bioavailability, and absorption, including weight, formulation, administration route (oral vs nasogastric tube), age, nutritional status (weight-for-age [WAZ], height-for-age [HAZ], weight-for-height [WHZ], and body mass index-for-age z scores [BMZ] based on WHO reference standards), HIV status, sex, and indication for treatment (TB disease or TPT). The final selection of the relevant covariates was guided by statistical significance and by clinical and physiological plausibility. Relative standard error (RSE) and 95% confidence interval for parameter estimates were determined using nonparametric bootstrapping with 500 samples.

14.10 Plague

Efficacy studies of levofloxacin could not be conducted in humans with pneumonic plague for ethical and feasibility reasons. Therefore, approval of this indication was based on an efficacy study conducted in animals.

The mean plasma concentrations of levofloxacin associated with a statistically significant improvement in survival over placebo in an African green monkey model of pneumonic plague are reached or exceeded in adult and pediatric patients receiving the recommended oral and intravenous dosage regimens [see Indications and Usage (1.14) and Dosage and Administration (2.1), (2.2)].

Levofloxacin pharmacokinetics have been evaluated in adult and pediatric patients. The mean (± SD) steady state peak plasma concentration in human adults receiving 500 mg orally or intravenously once daily is 5.7 ± 1.4 and 6.4 ± 0.8 mcg/mL, respectively; and the corresponding total plasma exposure (AUC0-24) is 47.5 ± 6.7 and 54.6 ± 11.1 mcg.h/mL, respectively. The predicted steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters in pediatric patients ranging in age from 6 months to 17 years receiving 8 mg/kg orally every 12 hours (not to exceed 250 mg per dose) were calculated to be comparable to those observed in adults receiving 500 mg orally once daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Levofloxacin tablets can only be administered to pediatric patients with inhalational anthrax (post-exposure) or plague who are 30 kg or greater due to the limitations of the available strengths [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

PHARMACODYNAMICS

Monte Carlo simulation analyses using clinical PK and non-clinical PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) data were used to determine target attainment (TA) probabilities, which were used to support dose selection decisions. Probabilities were determined for delafloxacin doses of 200–450 mg given intravenously every 12 hours, revealing high percent probabilities of TA for MIC values ≤ 0.5 mg/L with intravenous and oral doses of 300 mg and 450 mg respectively, which were chosen for the Phase 3 studies.

Several studies have evaluated the comparative PD of delafloxacin versus other fluoroquinolones, mainly levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, against multiple clinically relevant pathogens including S. aureus, E. coli, S. pneumoniae, and K. pneumoniae in both in vitro and in vivo model systems. Exposure of ciprofloxacin-susceptible and ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of S. aureus to clinically achievable ratios of AUC to MIC of delafloxacin and levofloxacin in a model simulating the PK of single and multiple doses of the 2 fluoroquinolones showed that delafloxacin was capable of producing greater anti-staphylococcal effects than levofloxacin at clinically achievable AUC/MICs. Moreover, delafloxacin was more effective in the prevention of the selection of resistant mutants in S. aureus, as shown by appreciable differences in the clinically achievable AUC 24 /MIC ratios (for the same organism, delafloxacin was capable of reaching an AUC 24h /MIC ratio of 870 h, which significantly exceeded the protective value of 240 h, whereas levofloxacin achieved a value of only 70 h, which was considerably lower than its protective value of 200 h). Examination of the killing kinetics of E. coli and P. aeruginosa exposed to single and multiple doses of delafloxacin and ciprofloxacin at clinically achievable AUC/MIC ratios showed that the killing effect of delafloxacin on E. coli at its clinically achievable AUC/MIC ratio (1740 h) was significantly higher than that seen with ciprofloxacin at its clinically achievable AUC/MIC ratio (2200 h). In the case of P. aeruginosa, two 12 h doses of delafloxacin (AUC/MIC 2 × 140 h) were more efficient at killing than ciprofloxacin (AUC/MIC 120 h). This study showed that clinically achievable AUC/MICs of delafloxacin and ciprofloxacin were comparable with regard to efficacy against E. coli (quaque die [QD] vs bis in die [BID] dosing) and against P. aeruginosa (at BID dosing but not QD dosing of delafloxacin). A subsequent animal study predicted significantly greater efficacy of clinically achievable AUC/MIC ratios of delafloxacin versus levofloxacin against ciprofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae and similar efficacy against ciprofloxacin-susceptible isolates. Evaluation of the PK/PD targets of delafloxacin for S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and K. pneumoniae in a murine lung infection model showed its activity against these pathogens, including isolates exhibiting resistance to other classes of antimicrobial agents (in this study, the authors measured the free AUC 24h /MIC ratio and observed that at least 1 log 10 kill was achieved for S. aureus when exposing the animals to values similar to those observed in humans during conventional therapy). A more recent study evaluated the PD of delafloxacin against a panel of pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia including S. pneumoniae, MSSA, MRSA, and K. pneumoniae in a neutropenic murine lung infection model and documented in vitro and in vivo activity (as measured by the change in log 10 colony forming unit (CFU) at 24 h compared to 0 h controls) as well as its high degree of penetration into the lung compartment, as evidenced by significantly higher concentrations in epithelial lining fluid compared with free drug in plasma.

ORH-2014 safety profile

All 12 patients were included in the safety analysis set. No DLT was reported during the four-week DLT observation period. Eight subjects (66.7%) had drug-related AE; the incidence of AE was identical in the three dose groups (66.3%) (Table 3). The most common drug-related AE were nausea (n = 5), diarrhea (n = 4), and headache (n = 3). All but one drug-related AE were mild or moderate (grade I II). Grade III AE of QTcF prolongation occurred in one subject (8.3%) outside of the DLT observation period (on day 68), and was attributed to ORH-2014 and concomitant levofloxacine (Levaquin ®; a fluoroquinolone antibiotic). Since both levofloxacin and ATO are known to induce QT prolongation, both were stopped. The AE resolved, and treatment with ORH-2014 alone was resumed at the same dose (5 mg), without any further occurrence of QT prolongation. The patient was able to receive ORH-2014 at 5 mg QD for a total of 171 days. There were very few renal, hepatic, and hematologic AE related to the underlying disease state, with the exception of grade I transaminitis attributed to ORH-2014; this event resolved on its own without treatment interruption or any medications. Two deaths occurred (on days 35 and 40 post dose) due to progression of the disease, both unrelated to ORH-2014.

Intra-abdominal infection (IAI) oral step-down therapy — We recommend use of selected oral agents with good bioavailability as a substitute for IV agents when the patient has return of adequate gastrointestinal function, and oral antibiotics should only be used to complete a short course of treatment and not to prolong antimicrobial therapy (Grade 1-B). We suggest use of oral amoxicillin–clavulanic acid as an acceptable regimen for adults and children older than one month (Grade 2-B). We suggest use of oral moxifloxacin as an acceptable regimen for adults (Grade 2-B), and we do not recommend the use of oral moxifloxacin for the treatment of IAI in children, unless no other option is available (Grade 1-B). We recommend use of oral ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole as an acceptable regimen for adults (Grade 1-B), and we suggest that oral ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole may be used in children older than one month, if other options are not suitable (Grade 2-B). We suggest that oral levofloxacin plus metronidazole, an oral first-, second-, or third-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole, or oral trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole plus metronidazole are potential regimens that could be used selectively to complete a short course of antibiotic therapy in adults and children older than one month, if other oral agents are not suitable (Grade 2-C).

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Published literature reports that levofloxacin is present in human milk following intravenous and oral administration (see Data). There is no information regarding effects of levofloxacin on milk production or the breastfed infant. Because of the potential risks of serious adverse reactions, in breastfed infants, for most indications, a lactating woman may consider pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment with levofloxacin and an additional two days (five half-lives) after the last dose. Alternatively, advise a lactating woman that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with levofloxacin and for an additional two days (five half-lives) after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

However, for inhalation anthrax (post exposure), during an incident resulting in exposure to anthrax, the risk-benefit assessment of continuing breastfeeding while the mother (and potentially the infant) is (are) on levofloxacin may be acceptable [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Pediatric Use (8.4), and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for levofloxacin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from levofloxacin or from the underlying maternal condition.

Data

A published literature reports that peak levofloxacin human milk concentration was 8.2 mg/L at 5 hours after dosing in a woman who received 500 mg of intravenous, followed by oral, levofloxacin daily. For an infant fed exclusively with human milk (approximately 900 ml/day), an estimated maximum daily dose of levofloxacin through breastfeeding is 5 mg (i.e., approximately 1% of maternal daily dose). The above data come from a single case and may not be generalizable to the general population of lactating women.

### Shortened treatment regimens versus the standard regimen for drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis [^7e814a83]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

The need for combination therapy for tuberculosis is a result of the distinctive cellular structure of M tuberculosis (a complex array of lipids, proteins, and glycolipids) and the tendency of the bacilli to develop resistance to monotherapy (Kerantzas 2017). Combinations of drugs are required to treat M tuberculosis: combining drugs with both bactericidal activity and sterilizing activity can help target the various bacterial subpopulations (actively dividing, slow growing, and dormant bacilli) present (Mitchison 1985). The bactericidal activity of a drug refers to its ability to kill metabolically active bacilli. An effective bactericidal drug prevents transmission of the bacilli and development of resistance to other drugs given as part of the regimen. The sterilizing activity of a drug refers to its ability to kill all viable bacilli, including the micro‐organisms tolerant to treatment with drugs. Drugs with good sterilizing capacity have the potential to shorten the duration of tuberculosis treatment (Ma 2010). In recent years, various drugs have been tried in differing combinations to shorten the standard six‐month treatment regimen, and these have shown promising preliminary results (Conde 2011).

Some of the desired characteristics of new anti‐tuberculosis drug compounds include the following (Ma 2010).

Effectiveness against both replicating and dormant tuberculosis bacilli.
Novel mechanism of action.
Improved safety profile (versus the standard treatment regimen).
Good oral bioavailability.
Low resistance development barrier.
Minimal interaction with cytochrome p450 enzymes.
Low cost.

Currently 10 compounds are in clinical development for the treatment of tuberculosis, six have been specifically developed, and four existing drugs have been re‐purposed. Drugs at the forefront of this quest include the fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and gatifloxacin), rifamycins (rifabutin and rifapentine), nitroimidazoles, diarylquinolines, oxazolidinediones, and ethylenediamines. These drugs have been investigated in clinical trials in combination with, or as substitutes for, one of the standard first‐line anti‐tuberculosis drugs, with the aim of shortening treatment duration (Lienhardt 2010). Second‐line anti‐tuberculosis drugs, including amoxicillin clavulanate, linezolid, carbapenems, and clofazimine, are also potential candidates for shorter‐duration anti‐tuberculosis regimens (D'Ambrosio 2015).

### The future approach for the management of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections [^6e8e7142]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

A potential limitation related to its use may be represented by authorities' call for more restricted use of fluoroquinolones. However, in people with multiple allergies and intolerances (including severe penicillin allergy), people taking other medicines that interact with the standard antibiotic options, or in people who develop myelosuppression with linezolid, delafloxacin may be considered a suitable oral option. Moreover, in patients with severe disease, the availability of both parenteral and oral formulations may allow a switch from i.v. infusion to delafloxacin tablets as soon as patients are clinically stable and able to take oral drugs.

Omadacycline is an aminomethylcycline antibiotic, semisynthetic tetracycline derivative, that inhibits ribosomal synthesis by blocking the interaction between the 30 s ribosomal subunits and aminoacyl tRNA. The specific structure of omadacycline determines resistance towards many bacterial mechanisms that cause tetracycline resistance, such as hyperexpression of efflux pumps or the production of ribosomal protective proteins, such as protection protein Tet(O) that interacts with the 70S ribosome and determines resistance to other tetracycline. Omadacycline remains active against many tetracycline-resistant strains. It displays in-vitro activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA and VRE strains resistant to tetracycline, Panton-Valentine leucocidin producing MRSA, penicillin or macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and β-haemolytic streptococci. It is also active against Gram-negative bacteria, including ESBL-producing Enterobacterales and approximately 50% of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), but has no activity against Proteus spp. Finally, it is active against anaerobes and Mycobacterium abscessus. Like delafloxacin, omadacycline is available both as oral (300 mg daily) and i.v. (100 mg daily) formulation. The oral bioavailability is approximately 34.5%. Two recent meta-analyses showed that both oral and i.v. omadacycline had better clinical cure rates and microbiological eradication compared to linezolid, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin. A post hoc analysis of three Phase 3 RCT of patients with ABSSSI and secondary bacteraemia suggested omadacycline as a possible therapeutic option in this subset.

### Association between initial route of fluoroquinolone administration and outcomes in patients hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia [^66bbb8bd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Fluoroquinolones have equivalent oral and intravenous bioavailability, but hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) generally are treated intravenously. Our objectives were to compare outcomes of hospitalized CAP patients initially receiving intravenous vs oral respiratory fluoroquinolones.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study utilizing data from 340 hospitals involving CAP patients admitted to a non-intensive care unit (ICU) setting from 2007 to 2010, who received intravenous or oral levofloxacin or moxifloxacin. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included clinical deterioration (transfer to ICU, initiation of vasopressors, or invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV] initiated after the second hospital day), antibiotic escalation, length of stay (LOS), and cost.

Results

Of 36 405 patients who met inclusion criteria, 34 200 (94%) initially received intravenous treatment and 2205 (6%) received oral treatment. Patients who received oral fluoroquinolones had lower unadjusted mortality (1.4% vs 2.5%; P = 0.002), and shorter mean LOS (5.0 vs 5.3; P < .001). Multivariable models using stabilized inverse propensity treatment weighting revealed lower rates of antibiotic escalation for oral vs intravenous therapy (odds ratio [OR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI].74-.96) but no differences in hospital mortality (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, .58–1.15), LOS (difference in days 0.03; 95% CI, -.09-.15), cost (difference in $-7.7; 95% CI, -197.4–182.0), late ICU admission (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, .80–1.36), late IMV (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, .87–1.56), or late vasopressor use (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, .68–1.30).

Conclusions

Among hospitalized patients who received fluoroquinolones for CAP, there was no association between initial route of administration and outcomes. More patients may be treated orally without worsening outcomes.

### Is more than one quinolone needed in clinical practice? [^b470b27f]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review clinical information on fluoroquinolone antimicrobials to distinguish between these agents and help define their place in clinical practice.

Data Sources

Primary and review articles on fluoroquinolones available commercially in the US as of August 2000 were identified through MEDLINE (from 1993-August 2000) and secondary sources.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All pertinent, published, clinical trials for levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and gatifloxacin were included. Minimal data were included for quinolones with restricted or limited uses, including trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, enoxacin, and lomefloxacin. Due to the quantity of data on ciprofloxacin, only more recent or pivotal trials or articles summarizing data on specific infections were included. Relevant information was included if it was believed to assist in differentiating between the fluoroquinolones for infections for which these agents would most commonly be considered.

Data Synthesis

Fluoroquinolones are a potent class of intravenous and oral broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents used for treating a wide range of community-acquired and nosocomial infections. More than 10 quinolones have been approved for use; although some of these have been withdrawn from the market, numerous others are under investigation. It has become increasingly important to be able to differentiate between these agents.

Conclusions

Differences in safety, antimicrobial spectrum of activity, and resistance development support the selective use of various fluoroquinolones in differing clinical situations.

### Efficacy and safety of higher doses of levofloxacin for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial [^a42e9553]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Culture conversion was high and treatment failure rare, and therefore our study results are not inconsistent with the observation that a levofloxacin AUC during the most recent 24-hour dosing interval (AUC 0–24)/MIC of > 100 can be expected to be associated with a successful outcome of MDR-TB treatment with a levofloxacin-containing regimen. Notably, all patients receiving levofloxacin at any of the doses in our study were able to achieve this target when the MIC was ≤ 1.0 μg/ml (the usual range in M. tuberculosis isolates susceptible to levofloxacin). This is in contradiction to the report of Ghimire and coworkers, who concluded that doses of 1,000 mg/d did not consistently achieve this target. The fact that all of our study participants had an AUC 0–24 /MIC above this threshold indicates that an AUC 0–24 /MIC of > 100 was above the inflection point on the activity/concentration curve; this in turn implies that further increases in AUC may not offer additional clinical benefit in the range of MICs that are encountered with susceptible M. tuberculosis isolates. Had we included lower doses of levofloxacin in our study, we might have observed this inflection, but we truncated our dose range so that no participants received less than the recommended adult dose of ≥ 750 mg of levofloxacin for the treatment of TB.

We found a minimal increase in QTcF interval prolongation with higher exposures to levofloxacin: a ΔQTcF of 6.9 ms (95% CI, −4.0 to 17.9 ms) at 16 weeks between the lower and upper tertiles of AUC. This effect is less pronounced than with moxifloxacin, another member of the fluoroquinolone class. Formal QT prolongation studies have revealed substantial QT prolongation with moxifloxacin at 400 mg/d but none with levofloxacin at doses as high as 1,500 mg/d. This represents one of the advantages of levofloxacin, a safe, tolerable drug that can be safely used in combination with anti-TB agents that have QT-prolonging effects. Bedaquiline, one such drug, is part of every current WHO-recommended regimen for the treatment of MDR/rifampicin-resistant TB. Although a growing body of literature shows that bedaquiline-linked QT interval prolongations are rarely clinically important, even when bedaquiline is used in combination with delamanid, it will still be beneficial to patients and TB programs to minimize the additive cardiac toxicity risk conferred by companion drugs.

Safety and effectiveness of levofloxacin in pediatric patients below the age of six months have not been established.

Pharmacokinetics following Intravenous Administration

The pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin following a single intravenous dose were investigated in pediatric patients ranging in age from six months to 16 years. Pediatric patients cleared levofloxacin faster than adult patients resulting in lower plasma exposures than adults for a given mg/kg dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.9)].

Dosage in Pediatric Patients with Inhalational Anthrax or Plague

For the recommended levofloxacin tablet dosage in pediatric patients with inhalational anthrax or plague [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Levofloxacin tablets cannot be administered to pediatric patients who weigh less than 30 kg because of the limitations of the available strengths. Alternative formulations of levofloxacin may be considered for pediatric patients who weigh less than 30 kg.

Adverse Reactions

In clinical trials, 1,534 pediatric patients (6 months to 16 years of age) were treated with oral and intravenous levofloxacin. Pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years of age received levofloxacin 10 mg/kg twice a day and pediatric patients greater than 5 years of age received 10 mg/kg once a day (maximum 500 mg per day) for approximately 10 days. Levofloxacin tablets can only be administered to pediatric patients with inhalational anthrax (post-exposure) or plague who are 30 kg or greater due to the limitations of the available strengths [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

2.1 Dosage of Levofloxacin Tablets in Adult Patients with Creatinine Clearance ≥ 50 mL/minute

The usual dose of levofloxacin tablets is 250 mg, 500 mg, or 750 mg administered orally every 24 hours, as indicated by infection and described in Table 1.

These recommendations apply to patients with creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/minute. For patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min, adjustments to the dosing regimen are required [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

2.2 Dosage of Levofloxacin Tablets in Pediatric Patients with Inhalational Anthrax or Plague

The dosage of levofloxacin tablets for inhalational anthrax (post-exposure) and plague in pediatric patients who weigh 30 kg or greater is described below in Table 2. Levofloxacin tablets cannot be administered to patients who weigh less than 30 kg because of the limitations of the available strength. Alternative formulations of levofloxacin may be considered for pediatric patients who weigh less than 30 kg.

2.3 Dosage Adjustment in Adults with Renal Impairment

Administer levofloxacin tabletswith caution in patients with renal impairment. Careful clinical observation and appropriate laboratory studies should be performed prior to and during therapy since elimination of levofloxacin may be reduced in these patients.

In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min), adjustment of the dosage regimen is necessary to avoid the accumulation of levofloxacin due to decreased clearance [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. No adjustment is necessary for patients with a creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 50 mL/minute.

Table 3 shows how to adjust dose based on creatinine clearance.

2.4 Drug Interaction with Chelation Agents: Antacids, Sucralfate, Metal Cations, Multivitamins

Levofloxacin tablets should be administered at least two hours before or two hours after antacids containing magnesium, aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc or didanosine chewable/buffered tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

2.5 Important Administration Instructions

Levofloxacin tablets can be administered without regard to food.

If patients miss a dose, they should take it as soon as possible anytime up to 8 hours prior to their next scheduled dose. If less than 8 hours remain before the next dose, wait until their next scheduled dose.

### Pharmacokinetics and optimal dosing of levofloxacin in children for drug-resistant tuberculosis: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^1f409592]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Exposure Evaluation

AUC₂₄, ss (24-hour AUC at steady state) was calculated as in Equation (1) (CL, clearance; F, apparent bioavailability) for all participants in the meta-analysis.

Steady-state pharmacokinetics were simulated 500 times using the aggregated pediatric TB population from the included studies using current WHO weight band dosing and compared with the median AUC 24, ss and C max in adults following a standard 750-mg dose once daily using 250-mg nondispersible levofloxacin tablets (AUC 24, ss of 101 mg × h/L and Cmax 11.9 mg/L).

Dose Optimization

Optimal dosing of levofloxacin using either commercially available 100-mg dispersible tablets or 250-mg nondispersible tablets was calculated targeting AUC 24, ss of 101 mg × h/L using the final model developed above. Optimal doses were rounded to half-tablet increments, when possible, for both formulations, and the current WHO dosing weight bands were retained. Steady-state pharmacokinetics were again simulated 500 times as described above, and exposure parameters were compared to adult standards.

Statistics and Software

NONMEM 7.5.1 and Perl-speaks NONMEM 4.8.1 were used for modeling and simulation. Selection between models was based on the minimum value of the objective function provided by NONMEM, which is equal to −2 × log likelihood (−2LL). For nested models that differed in 1 parameter, −2LL differences of 3.84 (P = 0.05) were considered significant. Visual diagnostics were performed with "Xpose4" (4.7.2) and "vpc" (1.2.1) R packages in R 4.2.0. Models were diagnosed using visual exploration of the goodness-of-fit plots and visual predictive checks. Parameter precision was further evaluated through 500 nonparametric bootstraps.

### Safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic properties of intravenous delafloxacin after single and multiple doses in healthy volunteers [^d7de7f8d]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this report was to determine the pharmacokinetic properties, safety, and tolerability of single and multiple doses of intravenous delafloxacin. In addition, the absolute bioavailability (BA) of the 450-mg tablet formulation of delafloxacin was determined.

Methods

Three clinical trials are summarized. The first study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single- (300, 450, 600, 750, 900, and 1200 mg) ascending-dose study of IV delafloxacin in 62 (52 active, 10 placebo) healthy volunteers. The second study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of IV delafloxacin (300 mg) given as a single dose on day 1, followed by twice-daily dosing on days 2 through 14; 12 (8 active, 4 placebo) healthy volunteers were enrolled. The third study was an open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2-sequence crossover study in which 56 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 sequences of a single oral dose of delafloxacin (450-mg tablet) or IV delafloxacin (300 mg). Serial blood samples were collected, and plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of delafloxacin were calculated.

Findings

Delafloxacin Cmax values increased proportionally with increasing single IV dose for the dose range of 300 to 1200 mg, whereas the AUC values increased more than proportionally to dose for the same dose range. The mean terminal half-life of delafloxacin was approximately 12 hours (ranging from 8 to 17 hours). The volume of distribution (Vd) at steady state was approximately 35 L, which is similar to the volume of total body water. There was minimal accumulation of delafloxacin after twice-daily IV administration of 300 mg with an accumulation ratio of 1.09. The delafloxacin total exposure after a single 1-hour IV infusion of 300 mg and a single oral dose of a 450-mg tablet were equivalent with geometric least square mean ratio (90% CI) of 0.8768 (0.8356–0.9200) for AUC₀–∞ and 0.8445 (0.8090–0.8815) for AUC₀–t, respectively. The Cmax values of delafloxacin were not equivalent for the 2 formulations with a ratio (90% CI) of 0.5516 (0.5150–0.5908), respectively. The mean absolute bioavailability of delafloxacin was 58.8%.

Implications

Delafloxacin was well tolerated in healthy volunteers after single and multiple IV doses. The total systemic exposure to IV (300 mg) and oral (450 mg) delafloxacin is comparable, supporting that a switch between the 2 formulations is appropriate.

### Profile of a novel anionic fluoroquinolone-delafloxacin [^d4cbe3e6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Fluoroquinolones have been in clinical use for over 50 years with significant efficacy. However, increasing resistance and emergence of some marked adverse events have limited their usage. The most recently approved class member, delafloxacin, is the only available anionic (non-zwitterionic) fluoroquinolone. Its unique molecular structure provides improved in vitro activity against most Gram-positive pathogens, including quinolone-resistant strains, which is further enhanced at acid pH. Delafloxacin shows favorable pharmacological properties, with about 60% bioavailability after oral administration, only mild inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A, and no evidence of cardiac- or phototoxicity in healthy volunteers (tested against positive controls). Its twice daily dosing, suitability for intravenous, oral, or switch dosing, the lack of many clinically significant drug-drug interactions, and acceptable adverse event profile in registration clinical trials supports its use in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, and potentially in other infections, where resistance to other agents, safety, and/or the need for early discharge is of concern.

### Deriving dosages for levofloxacin tuberculosis preventive treatment for young people exposed to rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis [^25590168]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Population Pharmacokinetic Model

Published population PK models of levofloxacin for children via PubMed search were reviewed using the following search terms: ("child" OR "neonat" OR "pediatr" [All Fields]) AND "levofloxacin" [All Fields] AND "pharmacokinetic" [All Fields] AND "model" [All Fields]. Six population PK models of levofloxacin in children were identified from this search.

The model by White et al was used, given the fact that it is an individual participant data meta-analysis, encompassing PK data from 242 children and adolescents in 5 different pediatric PK studies of levofloxacin for TB. While 3 of these studies had been used to build population PK models elsewhere, 2 of these studies had not previously been analyzed by compartmental analysis and contributed data from children outside Africa and adolescents (MDR-PK2 Study). The population used in building this PK model included those who received levofloxacin for treatment of MDR-TB disease as well as TPT, and its age and weight range spanned 0.2 to 16.3 years and 4.0 to 48.5 kg, respectively. The effect of the indication (levofloxacin used for MDR-TB or TPT) on the primary PK parameters was explored but was not identified as a significant covariate. The model accounted for the effect of weight and young age by allometric scaling of clearance and volume of distribution, and by including a maturation function of clearance with age, with an estimated Hill coefficient that determines the shape of the curve of 3.46, and a postmenstrual age (gestational + postnatal age) at which 50% of maturation is reached at 8.94 months. The levofloxacin formulations included in the analysis were the 100 mg dispersible tablets and the 250 mg and 500 mg conventional tablets. Relative bioavailability of the conventional tablets was estimated to be 28.7% lower than that of 100 mg dispersible tablets.

Additionally, for children aged ≥ 5 years, PK models identified in the literature built with adult data were used and explored for dosing simulations. The results obtained after the simulation with the adult models were then compared with those obtained from the model developed by White et al. This comparison was motivated by the fact that a relatively small number of patients in the higher weight bands was included in the pediatric model developed, and because of uncertainty of whether adolescent exposures are better predicted with pediatric or adult models. Parameter estimates of these models are summarized in Supplementary Table 2.

### High rate of coadministration of di-or tri-valent cation-containing compounds with oral fluoroquinolones: risk factors and potential implications [^011c74b4]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The characteristics of fluoroquinolone use that increase the risk of selecting for fluoroquinolone resistance remain unclear. Exposure to subtherapeutic levels of fluoroquinolone promotes bacterial development of fluoroquinolone resistance. Oral fluoroquinolone absorption is significantly impaired by coadministration with many common di- or tri-valent cation-containing compounds (DTCCs), and this interaction has been associated with therapeutic failure. However, the prevalence of, and risk factors for, in-hospital coadministration of oral fluoroquinolones with DTCCs is unknown.

Design

Case-control study.

Setting

A 625-bed, tertiary-care medical center.

Patients

All inpatients who were dispensed oral levofloxacin from July 1, 1999, to June 30, 2001, were included. Coadministration was defined by documented administration of any DTCC within 2 hours of levofloxacin. Complete coadministration was defined as coadministration complicating every dose of a course of levofloxacin.

Results

A subset of 3,227 (41.0%) of 7,871 doses of levofloxacin that occurred during the same calendar day as any DTCC was selected for further review. Overall, 1,904 (77.1%) of 2,470 doses of oral levofloxacin reviewed were complicated by coadministration with at least one DTCC. On multivariable analysis, an increased number of prescribed medications was significantly associated with complete coadministration (per increase of one medication: OR, 1.05; CI95, 1.01–1.10; P = 0.036), whereas patient location in an ICU was protective (OR, 0.51; CI95, 0.30–0.87; P = 0.013). If our prevalence results are extrapolated to all patients receiving oral levofloxacin at our hospital, approximately one in three doses was complicated by coadministration.

Conclusion

Coadministration of fluoroquinolones with DTCCs is extremely common and significantly associated with polypharmacy.

### Pharmacokinetics and dosing of levofloxacin in children treated for active or latent multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, Federated States Of Micronesia and republic of the Marshall Islands [^217fd78c]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In the Federated States of Micronesia and then the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), levofloxacin pharmacokinetics were studied in children receiving directly observed once-daily regimens (10 mg/kg, age > 5 years; 15–20 mg/kg, age ≤ 5 years) for either multidrug-resistant tuberculosis disease or latent infection after multidrug-resistant tuberculosis exposure, to inform future dosing strategies.

Methods

Blood samples were collected at 0 (RMI only), 1, 2 and 6 hours (50 children, aged 6 months to 15 years) after oral levofloxacin at > 6 weeks of treatment. Clinical characteristics and maximal drug concentration (Cmax) of levofloxacin, elimination half-life and area under the curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24 hours × μg/mL) were correlated to determine the optimal dosage and to examine associations. Population pharmacokinetics and target attainment were modeled. With results from the Federated States of Micronesia, dosages were increased in RMI toward the target Cmax for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 8–12 µg/mL.

Results

Cmax correlated linearly with per-weight dosage. Neither Cmax nor half-life was associated with gender, age, body mass index, concurrent medications or predose meals. At levofloxacin dosage of 15–20 mg/kg, Cmax ≥ 8 µg/mL was observed, and modeling corroborated a high target attainment across the ratio of the area under the free concentration versus time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (fAUCss,0–24/MIC) values.

Conclusions

Levofloxacin dosage should be 15–20 mg/kg for Cmax ≥ 8 µg/mL and a high target attainment across fAUCss,0–24/MIC values in children ≥ 2 years of age.

### Antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis of plague: recommendations for naturally acquired infections and bioterrorism response [^1b936d45]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

§ Recommended postexposure prophylaxis duration is 7 days.

¶ Data on use of fluoroquinolones and doxycycline in neonates are extremely limited; however, successful use of these antimicrobials in neonates has been reported (Sources: Kaguelidou F, Turner MA, Choonara I, Jacqz-Aigrain E. Ciprofloxacin use in neonates. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2011;30:e29–e37. Newby BD, Timberlake KE, Lepp LM, Mihic T, Dersch-Mills DA. Levofloxacin Use in the Neonate: A case series. J Pediatr Pharmacol Ther 2017;22:304–13. Forti G, Benincori C. Doxycycline and the teeth. Lancet 1969;1:782).

 Not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for prophylaxis of plague. In some instances, these antimicrobials have been used off label for the prophylaxis of naturally occurring plague. Large-scale distribution and use of these antimicrobials during a bioterrorism response might be under FDA-issued Emergency Use Authorization.

†† Ofloxacin suspension for oral liquid administration is not available in the United States.

Three important factors should be considered when selecting antimicrobials for treatment and prophylaxis of plague among neonates. First, many medications must be given to neonates via the IV route to ensure that the full desired dose is successfully administered. Some neonates regularly experience gastresophageal reflux (spitting up), making it difficult to administer a full medication dose orally. Moreover, neonates regularly ingest breast milk or formula, which have substantial amounts of calcium and other minerals that can inhibit absorption of some antimicrobials. For example, bioavailability of oral fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines is reduced by ingestion of milk. Although ofloxacin has not been examined directly, reduced bioavailability with co-ingestion with milk is possible because it is a fluoroquinolone. Second, many antimicrobials have not been specifically evaluated or approved for use in neonates. Third, some antimicrobials also carry specific or enhanced risks for neonates, such as bilirubin displacement and the potential for kernicterus associated with sulfonamides. Antimicrobial use in neonates also can lead to general adverse reactions such as disruption of the gut microbiome.

### Efficacy and safety of higher doses of levofloxacin for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial [^fc5ad87c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

We designed the Opti-Q trial to determine the optimal dose of levofloxacin as part of a regimen for the treatment of fluoroquinolone-susceptible multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Levofloxacin was given as weight-adjusted doses based on standard practice for levofloxacin dosing at the time, with a wide range of doses from 11 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg. A dose of 5 mg/kg would have led to a substantial number of study participants receiving less than the World Health Organization (WHO)– recommended dose. However, the dose of 11 mg/kg was known to be well tolerated in several studies, and the 20-mg/kg dose had been studied in a TB meningitis in study of 15 adults and in a larger study of 2,523 children in which a small increase in musculoskeletal disorders was seen at this dose; this was therefore the rationale for the range of doses evaluated in our trial. Because our goal was to determine if higher doses would be more effective, and because weight is an important determinant of levofloxacin exposure, we used weight-based dosing to control for this parameter. We developed our study design to evaluate the contribution of a range of doses of this antimicrobial agent within a multidrug regimen. The goal of the trial was to identify the dose of levofloxacin that would achieve the drug exposure associated with maximal efficacy and acceptable safety and tolerability.

### Association between aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection with fluoroquinolones use in patients with urinary tract infections: a population-based cohort study [^69d6550f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs), including cystitis and pyelonephritis, are the most common outpatient infections worldwide. The prevalence of UTIs increases with age, and UTIs are predominant in women. The overall prevalence of UTIs in women was approximately 11%, and it increased to approximately 20% in women aged over age 65 years and 20% to 30% in women with multiple UTI recurrences. In addition, UTIs account for a higher number of infections (> 560 000) than other hospital‐acquired infections, with an estimated mortality rate of 2.3%; this rate can increase to 26% in the presence of bacteremia or septic shock.

According to the European Association of Urology guidelines on urological infections, UTIs can be classified into uncomplicated and complicated types according to sex, anatomical and functional abnormalities, and comorbidities. The antimicrobials cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones are recommended for disease management because of their high oral bioavailability and broad spectrum, and because of the susceptibility of causative pathogens to these antibiotics. Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin, have been widely used to treat various infections ranging from respiratory infections to UTIs. The European Association of Urology guidelines recommend the use of first‐ or second‐generation cephalosporins for uncomplicated cystitis and recurrent UTIs. For uncomplicated pyelonephritis, fluoroquinolones and third‐generation cephalosporins are recommended, with both antibiotics administered through oral and intravenous routes. For complicated UTIs, fluoroquinolones can be prescribed to patients with less‐severe symptoms, and third‐generation cephalosporins can be prescribed to patients with systemic symptoms.

### Prosthetic hip infection due to… [^d5906ec9]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A woman in her 60s with a left hip prosthesis was presented with left hip pain and fever. She had an elevated white blood cell count and inflammatory markers. Synovial fluid Gram stain demonstrated curved Gram-negative rods identified as Campylobacter jejuni The patient initially refused surgery and after 3 months underwent one-stage exchange after which she was treated with 12 weeks of levofloxacin. Her inflammatory markers normalised and she was clinically doing well at her 6-month follow-up. C. jejuni is a rare cause of prosthetic joint infection and should be included in the differential diagnosis when a patient has risk factors even without significant preceding gastrointestinal symptoms. Per most recent Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines, treatment after one-stage revision includes 4–6 weeks of intravenous antimicrobials followed by possible oral suppression therapy, while the European guidelines recommend 12 weeks of orally bioavailable antibiotics.

RESULTS

Patients and Sampling

Five studies were identified for inclusion in this analysis (see Supplementary materials). Details are shown in Table 1. In all studies, pharmacokinetic sampling was performed after at least 7 days of levofloxacin dosing. Patient characteristics for the 242 children with available pharmacokinetic data are summarized in Table 2. Thirty-one children contributed pharmacokinetic samples on more than 1 occasion. Seven samples were excluded from the meta-analysis due to levels and pharmacokinetic profile inconsistent with dosing time. Median WAZ was below zero for all studies, and 28% of children had at least 1 nutrition parameter with a z score < −2 (WAZ, HAZ, WHZ, and BMZ). Levofloxacin concentrations were below the lower limit of quantification in 66 of the 1475 samples tested across all studies (4.5%), mostly in predose samples.

Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Children Treated With Levofloxacin

Population Pharmacokinetics

Levofloxacin pharmacokinetic profiles were notable for slightly higher plasma concentrations in children who received dispersible tablets but were otherwise similar between studies (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 1). The population pharmacokinetics were best described with 1-compartment distribution with first-order absorption with a lag time and linear elimination. Although addition of a second distribution compartment improved the OFV, parameter estimates were imprecise. The model diagnostics did not show significant improvement; therefore, a 1-compartment model was chosen for the final model structure.

Levofloxacin pharmacokinetic profiles in children included in individual patient data meta-analysis stratified by formulation. Dashed lines connect individual observed concentrations.

Allometric scaling of volume of distribution and clearance by body weight improved the model fit. Apparent clearance or bioavailability did not differ significantly by nutritional status (WAZ, HAZ, WHZ, and BMZ as continuous covariates or the presence of any z score < −2 as a categorical covariate) or indication for treatment (preventive treatment or disease). Children with HIV did not have significantly different clearance compared with children without HIV. Relative bioavailability of nondispersible 250-mg tablets was 29% lower than for dispersible 100-mg tablets. Absorption was not significantly affected by administration with nasogastric tube, although these data were missing for 10% of participants.

14.3 Community-Acquired Pneumonia: 5-day Treatment Regimen

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the higher dose and shorter course of levofloxacin, 528 outpatient and hospitalized adults with clinically and radiologically determined mild to severe community-acquired pneumonia were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, prospective, multicenter study comparing levofloxacin 750 mg, IV or orally, every day for five days or levofloxacin 500 mg IV or orally, every day for 10 days.

Clinical success rates (cure plus improvement) in the clinically evaluable population were 90.9% in the levofloxacin 750 mg group and 91.1% in the levofloxacin 500 mg group. The 95% CI for the difference of response rates (levofloxacin 750 minus levofloxacin 500) was [-5.9, 5.4]. In the clinically evaluable population (31 to 38 days after enrollment) pneumonia was observed in 7 out of 151 patients in the levofloxacin 750 mg group and 2 out of 147 patients in the levofloxacin 500 mg group. Given the small numbers observed, the significance of this finding cannot be determined statistically. The microbiological efficacy of the 5-day regimen was documented for infections listed in Table 13.

### Efficacy and safety of higher doses of levofloxacin for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial [^996f1c0b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Evaluation of optimal dosing has generally been inadequate during TB drug development. Fluoroquinolones are central to TB treatment. We aimed to determine the dose of levofloxacin needed to achieve maximal efficacy and acceptable safety and tolerability as part of a multidrug TB regimen.

Methods

Opti-Q was an international, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II trial. Eligible participants with TB resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin but susceptible to fluoroquinolones (MDR-TB) were randomized to receive one of four weight-adjusted once-daily doses of levofloxacin given for 24 weeks(168 doses): 11mg/kg(750mg), 14mg/kg(750mg/1000mg), 17 mg/kg(1000mg/1250mg) or 20mg/kg(1250mg/1500mg) alongside a multidrug regimen. The primary efficacy outcome was time to sputum culture conversion and the primary safety outcome was grade 3 or higher adverse events.

Findings

111 participants were randomized from three sites in South Africa and Peru. 83(75%) had cavities on chest x-ray, 55(50%) had a smear grading of 3+, median BMI was 20.4 kg/m². Median levofloxacin AUC/MIC was 573, 633, 918 and 1343 across the four treatment arms. There was no difference in time to culture conversion on solid or liquid media by treatment arm (stratified log-rank p = 0.282), by tertile of AUC/MIC (p = 0.350), or by dose received (p = 0.723); 69.3%, 74.8%, 70.6% and 78.3% achieved culture conversion after 8 weeks on solid media respectively across the treatment arms; 64.6%, 69.5%, 52.6% and 69.6% in liquid culture. More participants experienced a grade 3–5 adverse event by dose (37.0% and 16.0% in the highest and lowest dose groups respectively, p = 0.042, Cochran-Armitage test for trend) and by tertile of AUC (p = 0.011).

Interpretation

As part of a multidrug regimen, doses of levofloxacin above 1000mg resulted in greater exposures and increased frequency of adverse events but did not result in faster time to sputum culture conversion. A dose of 1000mg daily can achieve the target exposure in nearly all adults and was well tolerated.

### Gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin: the role of 3 newer fluoroquinolones [^afce2d06]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin are the newest fluoroquinolones and show excellent in vitro activity against a wide variety of respiratory tract pathogens, many gram-negative aerobic organisms, and Bacteroides fragilis. These agents may be administered as oral and/or intravenous formulations with excellent bioavailability. The pharmacodynamics of these 3 new fluoroquinolones is more favorable than that of levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin for Streptococcus pneumoniae. All 3 agents are approved for the treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and community-acquired pneumonia. In addition, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin are approved for the treatment of sinusitis. The toxicity of these 3 agents appears to be similar to that of the other fluoroquinolones in terms of gastrointestinal and central nervous system disturbances. All 3 agents have a low risk of phototoxicity, but gemifloxacin is associated with an increased risk of skin rash that is not a photoreaction. These agents can be useful for treatment of bacterial respiratory tract infections in patients who are allergic to beta-lactams, but caution must be exercised to avoid the potential for selection of widespread resistance, which may occur with indiscriminate use.

### Pharmacokinetics and optimal dosing of levofloxacin in children for drug-resistant tuberculosis: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^2406c02c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The predicted exposure across all weight bands was improved using model-informed dosing of 16–33 mg/kg of dispersible tablet formulations so that projected median exposure would be approximately 101 mg × h/L. This represents an increase of up to 50% in doses compared with the current WHO dosing recommendations of dispersible tablets and should therefore be implemented with caution. Adequate exposure can also be achieved using nondispersible tablets, although projected median exposure in the lowest weight bands (3–4.9 kg, 5.0–6.9 kg) would be well above or below the target if doses were rounded to the nearest half tablet, increasing the risk of poor outcomes in this younger age group. Similarly, although the rounded model-derived dose of nondispersible tablets results in projected exposure that is slightly below the target for 7–9.9 kg, 10–15.9 kg, and 16–23.9 kg weight bands, increasing the dose for each weight band by 0.5 tablets resulted in projected exposure and C max well above the adult median, a recommendation that is not yet supported by adequate safety data. Given the difficulty of achieving target exposures in the 3–4.9 kg and 5.0–6.9 kg weight bands with 250-mg nondispersible tablets, use of the child-friendly 100-mg dispersible tablet formulation in this weight band is strongly preferred when available. If 100-mg dispersible tablets are not available, we recommend dissolving a single 250-mg nondispersible levofloxacin tablet in a small volume of water, for example, 10 mL, and to allow for administration of more precise doses (Table 4). This method is not preferred due to its complexity and potential for medication administration errors. Similarly, in children who weigh < 24 kg, the use of the child-friendly 100-mg dispersible tablet formulation would be preferred since the exposures would be more optimal. The safety of implementing treatment regimens that use higher doses of levofloxacin is supported by the model-predicted C max, which aligns with the median C max in adults following standard 750-mg daily dosing and is below the C max in adults following a higher 1000-mg dose. Additionally, in a small study in Thailand in which 5 children with TB were treated with doses above the current WHO recommendation (20–30 mg/kg; median, 25 mg/kg), no QT prolongation or other grade 3 or 4 adverse events were observed. However, larger prospective studies are needed to definitively assess the safety of the higher proposed doses of levofloxacin in children, both for prevention and treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of higher doses of levofloxacin for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial [^b6b3ac36]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Evaluation of optimal dosing has generally been inadequate during tuberculosis (TB) drug development. Fluoroquinolones are central to TB treatment.

Objective

To determine the dose of levofloxacin needed to achieve maximal efficacy and acceptable safety and tolerability as part of a multidrug TB regimen.

Methods

Opti-Q was an international, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial. Eligible participants with TB resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin but susceptible to fluoroquinolones were randomized to receive one of four weight-adjusted once-daily doses of levofloxacin for 24 weeks (168 doses) alongside a multidrug regimen: 11 mg/kg (750 mg), 14 mg/kg (750 mg/1,000 mg), 17 mg/kg (1,000 mg/1,250 mg) or 20 mg/kg (1,250 mg/1,500 mg). The primary efficacy outcome was time to sputum culture conversion, and the primary safety outcome was grade ≥ 3 adverse events (AEs).

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 111 participants were randomized from three sites in South Africa and Peru. Eighty-three (75%) had cavities on chest X-ray, 55 (50%) had a smear grading of 3+, and the median body mass index was 20.4 kg/m². Median levofloxacin areas under the curve (AUCs)/minimum inhibitory concentrations were 573, 633, 918, and 1,343 across the four treatment arms. There was no difference in time to culture conversion on solid or liquid media by treatment arm (stratified log-rank P = 0.282), by tertile of AUC/minimum inhibitory concentration (P = 0.350), or by dose received (P = 0.723); 69.3%, 74.8%, 70.6%, and 78.3% exhibited culture conversion after 8 weeks on solid media, respectively, across the treatment arms; along with 64.6%, 69.5%, 52.6%, and 69.6% on liquid culture. More participants experienced a grade 3–5 AE at higher doses (37.0% and 16.0% in the highest and lowest dose groups, respectively; P = 0.042, Cochran-Armitage test for trend) and higher tertiles of AUC (P = 0.011).

Conclusions

As part of a multidrug regimen, doses of levofloxacin > 1,000 mg/d resulted in greater exposures and increased frequency of AEs but did not result in faster time to sputum culture conversion. A dose of 1,000 mg/d can achieve the target exposure in nearly all adults and was well tolerated.

### Steady-state plasma and intrapulmonary concentrations of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in healthy adult subjects [^1ef7b4e6]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To determine the steady-state plasma, epithelial lining fluid (ELF), and alveolar macrophage (AM) concentrations of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin.

Design

Multiple-dose, open-label, randomized pharmacokinetic study.

Participants

Thirty-six healthy, nonsmoking adult subjects were randomized either to oral levofloxacin, 500 or 750 mg once daily for five doses, or ciprofloxacin, 500 mg q12h for nine doses.

Interventions

Venipuncture, bronchoscopy, and BAL were performed in each subject at 4 h, 12 h, or 24 h after the last administered dose of antibiotic.

Measurement and Results

Mean plasma concentrations of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were similar to those previously reported. For once-daily dosing of levofloxacin, 500 mg, the mean (± SD) steady-state concentrations at 4 h, 12 h, and 24 h in ELF were 9.9 ± 2.7 microg/mL, 6.5 ± 2.5 microg/mL, and 0.7 ± 0.4 microg/mL, respectively; AM concentrations were 97.9 ± 80.0 microg/mL, 36.7 ± 23.4 microg/mL, and 13.8 ± 16.0 microg/mL, respectively. For levofloxacin, 750 mg, the mean steady-state concentrations in ELF were 22.1 ± 14.9 microg/mL, 9.2 ± 5.3 microg/mL, and 1.5 ± 0.8 microg/mL, respectively; AM concentrations were 105.1 ± 65.5 microg/mL, 36.2 ± 26.1 microg/mL, and 15.1 ± 2.0 microg/mL, respectively. The concentrations of ciprofloxacin at 4 h and 12 h in ELF were 1.9 ± 0.9 microg/mL and 0.4 ± 0.1 microg/mL, respectively; AM concentrations were 34.9 ± 23.2 microg/mL and 6.8 ± 5.9 microg/mL, respectively. The differences in the ELF concentrations of the two levofloxacin groups vs those of the ciprofloxacin group were significant (p < 0.05) at each sampling time.

Conclusions

Levofloxacin was more extensively distributed into intrapulmonary compartments than ciprofloxacin and achieved significantly higher steady-state concentrations in plasma and ELF during the 24 h after drug administration.

### Quinolones in 2005: an update [^f1b0840e]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Quinolones are one of the largest classes of antimicrobial agents used worldwide. This review considers the quinolones that are available currently and used widely in Europe (norfoxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) within their historical perspective, while trying to position them in the context of recent and possible future advances based on an understanding of: (1) their chemical structures and how these impact on activity and toxicity; (2) resistance mechanisms (mutations in target genes, efflux pumps); (3) their pharmacodynamic properties (AUC/MIC and Cmax/MIC ratios; mutant prevention concentration and mutant selection window); and (4) epidemiological considerations (risk of emergence of resistance, clonal spread). Their main indications are examined in relation to their advantages and drawbacks. Overall, it is concluded that these important agents should be used in an educated fashion, based on a careful balance between their ease of use and efficacy vs. the risk of emerging resistance and toxicity. However, there is now substantial evidence to support use of the most potent drug at the appropriate dose whenever this is required.

### Human aqueous humor levels of oral ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin [^dbe75270]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the penetration of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin into the aqueous humor after oral administration.

Setting

Alcorcon Hospital, Madrid, Spain.

Methods

Forty-two patients having cataract surgery were randomly divided into 3 groups the day before surgery. The first group received 2 oral 500 mg doses of ciprofloxacin at 12-hour intervals. The second group received a single oral 500 mg dose of levofloxacin. The third group received a single oral 400 mg dose of moxifloxacin. At the time of surgery, 0.1 mL aqueous fluid was aspirated from the anterior chamber just before the operation and immediately stored at -80 degrees C. Drug concentrations were measured using a biological assay.

Results

The mean aqueous level of ciprofloxacin was 0.50 microg/mL ± 0.25 (SD); of levofloxacin, 1.50 ± 0.50 microg/mL; and of moxifloxacin, 2.33 ± 0.85 microg/mL. The mean aqueous levels of levofloxacin and moxifloxacin were above the 90% minimum inhibitory concentration for most of the common microorganisms that cause endophthalmitis.

Conclusions

Therapeutic concentrations of fluoroquinolones, mainly levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, were reached with oral administration. These antibiotics may be effective for prophylaxis and adjuvant therapy of bacterial endophthalmitis.

### Challenges in the management of community-acquired pneumonia: the role of quinolones and moxifloxacin [^e0f17060]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Current strategies and guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia are directed toward making care cost effective, by treating patients on an outpatient basis whenever possible. The use of the new fluoroquinolones could help to achieve these goals. These agents are highly bioavailable and can facilitate the oral treatment of certain patients who otherwise might be admitted to the hospital, as outpatients. The good absorption and bioavailability of these agents can allow moderately ill patients to rapidly achieve effective serum levels of the drug after oral administration and can also facilitate early discontinuation of intravenous therapy and early discharge for responding inpatients. For inpatients or outpatients with clinical risk factors for acquiring drug-resistant pneumococci, quinolones represent a reliable monotherapy option and an effective alternative to a beta-lactam/macrolide combination. Although the in vitro differences among the various quinolones remain of unclear clinical relevance, preliminary data suggest that agents with enhanced in vitro activity against pneumococci, such as moxifloxacin, may have greater clinical efficacy and may lead to more-rapid resolution of fever and, potentially, less selection of future pneumococcal resistance to quinolones than that associated with agents with less intrinsic activity.

### Pharmacokinetics and optimal dosing of levofloxacin in children for drug-resistant tuberculosis: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^7a8d9b2a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Optimal Dosing Simulations

Model-informed optimized and practically implementable doses (rounded to the nearest half-tablet increment) were 16–50 mg/kg of the 250-mg nondispersible levofloxacin tablets for children who weighed 3–46 kg and 16–33 mg/kg of the 100-mg dispersible levofloxacin tablets for children who weighed 3–24 kg, with lighter patients requiring the highest milligram per kilogram dose. Model-informed dosing resulted in higher predicted exposures approaching the target AUC 24 of 101 mg·h/L based on typical adult exposure with predicted C max, similar to that observed in adults who received a standard 750-mg dose of nondispersible levofloxacin (Figure 4, Supplementary Figure 2). Model-informed dosing was up to double the current WHO-recommended dosing with the largest increases in the lightest weight bands (Table 4).

### Two open-label, randomized, crossover studies assessing the bioequivalence of ofloxacin administered as immediate-and extended-release formulations in healthy subjects [^4b8a134f]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Ofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone agent available as an immediate-release (IR) tablet formulation administered twice daily. An extended-release (ER) formulation of ofloxacin has been developed for oncedaily administration.

Objectives

The present studies compared the pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profiles of the ER and IR formulations of ofloxacin.

Methods

Based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, healthy adult male and female volunteers were selected to receive single and multiple oral doses of ofloxacin ER 400 mg QD and ofloxacin IR 200 mg BID in 2 separate open-label, randomized, crossover studies. Multiple blood samples were collected, and plasma concentrations of ofloxacin were analyzed using a high-throughput liquid chromatography system. PK parameters were calculated using noncompartmental methods. Safety was assessed in the clinical pharmacology unit based on vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and reported adverse events. The relationship of an adverse event to study drugs (definitely, probably, possibly, remotely, or unrelated) was assessed by the principal investigator.

Results

Forty healthy subjects were included in each study. Thirty-seven subjects (28 men, 9 women; mean age, 37 years; mean weight, 71.2 kg) completed the single-dose study, and 38 subjects (33 men, 5 women; mean age, 36 years; mean weight, 72.2 kg) completed the multiple-dose study. With the exception of 3 black subjects in each study of African-American origin, all subjects in both studies were white. The mean AUC(0–24) values for the ER formulation in the single-and multiple-dose studies (18.6 and 21.4 mg. h/L, respectively) were similar to those for the IR formulation (17.7 and 22.8 mg x h/L), with the 90% CIs falling between 80.0 and 125.0. Mean C(max) values for the ER formulation in the single- and multiple-dose studies (2.02 and 2.12 mg/L) were also similar to those for the IR formulation (1.74 and 1.85 mg/L). Under steady-state conditions, median T(max) values for the ER formulation were significantly longer than those for the IR formulation (5.00 vs 2.00 hours, respectively; P < 0.05). All vital signs and ECGs were within normal ranges during the single- and multipledose studies. Adverse events probably related to study drugs (eg, nausea, loose stools, emesis) were similar in nature and frequency between the 2 formulations. No serious adverse events were reported during either study.

Conclusion

In these 2 trials in a selected group of healthy adult male and female volunteers, the ER and IR formulations of ofloxacin displayed a similar rate and extent of bioavailability and comparable safety profiles.
