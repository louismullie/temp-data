## Question

Antianxiety meds safe in people with alcohol abuse

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which anti-anxiety medications are safe and appropriate for patients with alcohol use disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the patient is in acute alcohol withdrawal versus stable recovery. Then, I should verify which medication classes are contraindicated or high risk and why. Next, I will identify safer pharmacologic options with supporting evidence and outline dosing and monitoring. After that, I need to consider special populations and comorbidities. Finally, I will integrate nonpharmacologic strategies and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with clear guardrails for safety and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because the meaning of "safe" differs markedly between acute alcohol withdrawal and stable recovery. In acute withdrawal, benzodiazepines remain first-line due to seizure and delirium prevention, but they require close monitoring and should not be continued beyond the detoxification window because of misuse and respiratory depression risks when combined with alcohol or opioids [^111TShss] [^115usay9] [^111YLi17]. In contrast, for ongoing anxiety management in stable recovery, benzodiazepines are generally contraindicated outside of carefully supervised, short-term detoxification, so I need to ensure I am not conflating these scenarios [^115QrLxg] [^116kRmwk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about benzodiazepines in recovery. I initially thought "never use", but wait, I should verify guideline nuance. The APA advises not using benzodiazepines in AUD except for acute withdrawal or a concurrent disorder, and CRISM explicitly recommends against benzodiazepines for ongoing AUD management, which in practice means they are not appropriate for maintenance anxiety treatment in recovery due to misuse, diversion, and dangerous synergy with alcohol [^115QrLxg] [^116kRmwk]. I should also confirm that FDA labeling for benzodiazepines and related sedatives warns strongly about concomitant alcohol use and respiratory depression, reinforcing avoidance in this population outside detox protocols [^114UnzsC].

> Next, I should review safer pharmacologic options for anxiety in stable recovery. Let me consider gabapentin first, because it has both anxiolytic properties and evidence for reducing heavy drinking and supporting abstinence, and importantly, it is considered safe in patients who continue to drink, which is clinically relevant during early recovery or slips [^114cM5Jx]. I need to check misuse risk; ASAM highlights elevated misuse rates among people with substance use disorders, so I should screen carefully, use the lowest effective dose, and monitor closely, but the balance of evidence still supports its use for anxiety and AUD in many patients [^116Z9fng]. Typical dosing ranges from 300 to 1200 mg per day in divided doses, with titration based on response and tolerability, and it can be combined with naltrexone in select cases to improve early abstinence outcomes [^113syJoN].

> I will now examine topiramate as another option. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence. Guidelines suggest topiramate can reduce heavy drinking and may help anxiety symptoms, though it is not FDA-approved for AUD and requires careful monitoring for cognitive effects and paresthesias; nonetheless, it is a reasonable alternative when first-line AUD medications are not suitable or not tolerated [^111qobAn] [^116CR4HQ]. Dosing is typically titrated slowly to mitigate adverse effects, and patient selection should consider renal function and psychiatric comorbidity profiles [^notfound].

> Let me consider buspirone, since it is a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic. I should confirm whether it helps with alcohol outcomes. Evidence for buspirone in AUD without comorbid anxiety is inconsistent, but in patients with co-occurring anxiety disorders it may be reasonable, and importantly it lacks cross-tolerance with alcohol and does not cause sedation or respiratory depression, which improves safety in recovery [^1134JJCq]. If used, I would start low and titrate slowly, and I would avoid expecting it to reduce alcohol consumption per se unless anxiety is a prominent driver of drinking [^1134JJCq].

> But wait, what about antidepressants for anxiety in AUD. I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize. Guidelines advise against using antidepressants solely to reduce alcohol use in the absence of a mood disorder, yet SSRIs or SNRIs are appropriate when there is a comorbid anxiety or depressive disorder, with sertraline or SNRIs as common choices; I should screen for untreated mood or anxiety disorders before prescribing and monitor for any increase in suicidality or activation early in treatment [^115oMvdT] [^113DpUxm]. If anxiety is secondary to active drinking, I should prioritize AUD treatment and relapse prevention first, then reassess anxiety symptoms after stabilization [^notfound].

> I should double-check medications to avoid or use with extreme caution. Benzodiazepines outside of acute withdrawal are inappropriate due to misuse, diversion, and dangerous interaction with alcohol; sedative-hypnotics like zolpidem carry similar risks and should generally be avoided in patients with alcohol use disorder; and although pregabalin has anxiolytic effects, its abuse liability and euphoria potential warrant caution and careful monitoring if considered at all [^115QrLxg] [^112cVKaP] [^1167wD8y]. If any sedative must be used short term, it should be in the smallest quantity with close supervision and a clear exit plan to taper off promptly [^1154SefQ].

> Next, I should review special populations and comorbidities that modify risk. In older adults, falls, cognitive impairment, and motor vehicle accidents are more likely with sedatives, so I should avoid benzodiazepines and favor non-sedating options like buspirone or SSRIs/SNRIs when indicated, with careful dose adjustments and monitoring for delirium and oversedation [^1135Z5eT]. In patients with significant liver disease, I should prefer agents with minimal hepatic metabolism and avoid benzodiazepines that can precipitate encephalopathy; lorazepam or oxazepam are preferred if a benzodiazepine is absolutely necessary during withdrawal due to their metabolism profile, but again, use should be short and closely monitored [^115VHUT8] [^115fpmrY]. In pregnancy, I should avoid teratogenic agents and coordinate care with obstetrics and addiction specialists if pharmacotherapy is needed [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I integrate nonpharmacologic treatments because medication alone is rarely sufficient for anxiety in recovery. Cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety, mindfulness-based interventions, and exercise can meaningfully reduce anxiety symptoms and support relapse prevention, and they carry none of the pharmacologic risks discussed above; I should build these into the care plan from the outset and reassess anxiety control as recovery progresses [^notfound]. Let me also remember that anxiety often fluctuates with alcohol use patterns, so stabilizing AUD with first-line agents like naltrexone or acamprosate may indirectly improve anxiety, which should be tracked over time [^notfound].

> Putting this together, my practical, risk-stratified approach is as follows. First, distinguish acute withdrawal from stable recovery; if acute, use benzodiazepines with close monitoring and stop within 10 to 14 days, then transition to recovery-phase care [^111TShss] [^111YLi17]. If stable, avoid benzodiazepines and sedative-hypnotics; consider gabapentin as a first-line anxiolytic with AUD benefits, topiramate as an alternative, buspirone when anxiety is prominent and comorbid, and SSRIs or SNRIs only for diagnosed anxiety or mood disorders; pair all pharmacotherapy with CBT-based anxiety treatment and relapse prevention strategies, and monitor closely for misuse, adverse effects, and efficacy at frequent intervals [^114cM5Jx] [^111qobAn] [^1134JJCq] [^115oMvdT]. I should confirm at each visit that the risk–benefit balance remains favorable and be prepared to taper any sedating agent that no longer clearly helps or that elevates risk, using slow, individualized tapers to avoid withdrawal complications [^115c4QRS].

> Finally, I should verify that my plan aligns with major guidelines and safety communications. The APA advises against benzodiazepines in AUD outside acute withdrawal, CRISM recommends against benzodiazepines for ongoing AUD management, and ASAM emphasizes minimizing doses and duration with close monitoring if benzodiazepines are used for withdrawal; FDA labeling reinforces the dangers of combining benzodiazepines with alcohol or opioids, supporting my avoidance strategy in recovery-phase anxiety care [^115QrLxg] [^116kRmwk] [^1154SefQ] [^111NypVy] [^114UnzsC]. If I adhere to these principles, I can reduce the risk of misuse, respiratory depression, and cognitive harm while still effectively treating anxiety in patients recovering from alcohol use disorder [^112Jkbhm].

In patients with alcohol use disorder, **benzodiazepines are first-line for acute withdrawal** [^111TShss] but should be avoided for chronic anxiety due to misuse and respiratory depression risks [^115QrLxg] [^1133BRU5]. For long-term anxiety, **gabapentin or buspirone are preferred**: gabapentin reduces anxiety and heavy drinking [^114cM5Jx] [^1145zm9j], and buspirone is non-sedating and non-addictive [^notfound]. SSRIs/SNRIs are appropriate when anxiety co-occurs with depression, but monitor for increased alcohol use [^notfound]. Avoid benzodiazepines for maintenance, and use the lowest effective doses with close monitoring [^116kRmwk] [^113aKWh7].

## Benzodiazepines

### Indications and risks

- **Indications**: Benzodiazepines are first-line for acute alcohol withdrawal [^111TShss] due to efficacy in preventing seizures and delirium tremens [^111VSZDt] [^112tkVyM].
- **Risks**: High misuse, dependence, and respiratory depression risk, especially with alcohol; avoid chronic use in AUD [^1154SefQ] [^115QrLxg] [^111NypVy].

---

### Clinical guidelines

- **ASAM 2020**: Use benzodiazepines short-term for withdrawal with close monitoring; avoid outpatient use in patients with benzodiazepine misuse or adverse reactions [^1154SefQ] [^111TShss].
- **APA 2018**: Do not use benzodiazepines for ongoing anxiety in AUD unless for acute withdrawal or a concurrent disorder [^115QrLxg].
- **VA/DoD 2021**: Use benzodiazepines for moderate-severe withdrawal with monitoring; consider carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid if benzodiazepine risks outweigh benefits [^1132QtAR] [^113ub1T2].

---

## Non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics

### Gabapentin

Gabapentin is effective for anxiety and reduces heavy drinking and relapse risk; it is **safe for patients who continue drinking** [^114cM5Jx] [^1145zm9j]. It is generally well tolerated; monitor for dizziness, somnolence, and misuse, especially at high doses [^116Z9fng].

---

### Buspirone

Buspirone is effective for generalized anxiety, is non-sedating, non-addictive, and has no significant interaction with alcohol [^notfound]. It is generally well tolerated; monitor for dizziness, nausea, and headache.

---

## Antidepressants

### SSRIs and SNRIs

SSRIs/SNRIs are indicated for co-occurring anxiety and depression; monitor for increased alcohol use or activation [^notfound]. They are generally well tolerated; monitor for gastrointestinal upset, sexual dysfunction, and activation.

---

## Clinical recommendations

| **Medication class** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Benzodiazepines | Acute withdrawal | First-line, short-term | - Misuse <br/> - Respiratory depression <br/> - Sedation |
| Gabapentin | Chronic anxiety | Preferred | - Misuse <br/> - Sedation |
| Buspirone | Chronic anxiety | Preferred | Minimal |
| SSRIs/SNRIs | Co-occurring anxiety and depression | Appropriate | - Activation <br/> - Alcohol use |

---

## Special considerations

- **Liver disease**: Prefer gabapentin or buspirone; avoid benzodiazepines with hepatic metabolism [^115VHUT8] [^111SxPPp].
- **Pregnancy**: Avoid benzodiazepines; consider buspirone or SSRIs with caution [^111f74BQ].
- **Elderly**: Avoid benzodiazepines due to fall and cognitive risks; use gabapentin or buspirone cautiously [^1135Z5eT].

---

## Conclusion

Benzodiazepines are for **acute withdrawal only**; for chronic anxiety in AUD, **gabapentin and buspirone are preferred** for efficacy and safety, with SSRIs/SNRIs for co-occurring depression. Use the lowest effective doses with close monitoring.

### Is there a safe limit for consumption of alcohol? [^115g8Yz3]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

In order to understand and curb the harms related to alcohol, it will be necessary to think beyond patterns of use that meet criteria for a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder or addiction. Current research suggests that regular daily alcohol use does not confer a health benefit, and, for many persons, even relatively low consumption is associated with a health risk. Determining a safe limit for alcohol consumption is challenging both for the individual person and for society. We conclude that excessive drinking is always risky. We provide a list of circumstances, such as chronic illness, driving a vehicle, or pregnancy where persons should be advised to abstain from alcohol. We recognise the need to encourage less consumption of alcohol, particularly in young adults and older adults with co-morbid conditions (especially if taking multiple medications). Finally, we offer the modest proposal that, for persons without the contributing negative influences described above, consumption which adheres to one drink per session, with interspersed abstinent days, does not constitute a meaningful risk to health.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^111TShss]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal prophylaxis — preventative pharmacotherapy states that for patients at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or complications of alcohol withdrawal, preventative pharmacotherapy should be provided, and benzodiazepines are first-line treatment. For patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use, phenobarbital can be used by providers experienced with its use, and in settings with close monitoring, phenobarbital adjunct to benzodiazepines is also appropriate. A front loading regimen is recommended for patients at high risk of severe withdrawal syndrome, and providing at least a single dose of preventative medication is appropriate for patients at lower levels of risk not experiencing significant signs or symptoms but have a history of severe or complicated withdrawal, an acute medical, psychiatric, or surgical illness, severe coronary artery disease, or displaying signs or symptoms of withdrawal concurrent with a positive blood alcohol content.

### Is phenobarbital an effective treatment for alcohol withdrawal syndrome? [^116unbpE]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcohol use disorder is associated with a variety of complications, including alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), which may occur in those who decrease or stop alcohol consumption suddenly. AWS is associated with a range of signs and symptoms, which are most commonly treated with GABAergic medications.

Clinical Question

Is phenobarbital an effective treatment for AWS?

Evidence Review

Studies retrieved included two prospective, randomized, double-blind studies and three systematic reviews. These studies provided estimates of the effectiveness and safety of phenobarbital for treatment of AWS.

Conclusions

Based on the available literature, phenobarbital is reasonable to consider for treatment of AWS. Clinicians must consider the individual patient, clinical situation, and comorbidities when selecting a medication for treatment of AWS.

### Important drug-drug interactions for the addiction psychiatrist [^116T77Na]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The misuse of illicit substances, prescribed medications, and alcohol poses obvious health risks to afflicted individuals. When addressing these health risks, the overarching concerns generally relate to the direct effects that various substances can have on the functioning of multiple organ systems: cardiac, pulmonary, central nervous system, and others. What is not always evident, but potentially equally or even more dire, are the risks arising from drug-drug interactions involving illicit drugs and alcohol, whether with each other, or with prescribed medications. This review provides some basics that enable the reader to fruitfully approach the broad topic of drug-drug interactions.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114x9Mxg]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to benzodiazepines, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to do not prescribe benzodiazepines in outpatient settings for patients with a history of even mild adverse events with benzodiazepine use, as rapid intervention is not typically available. Use benzodiazepines with caution in patients with a high risk of benzodiazepine diversion, including patients with a current or past benzodiazepine use disorder for the short period of acute alcohol withdrawal. Consider managing the risk by dispensing or prescribing a small number of doses.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1154SefQ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — ambulatory benzodiazepine prescribing cautions: In ambulatory management, some situations exist where the risks of benzodiazepines outweigh benefits; in these cases, patients can be offered an alternative medication, and individuals with a history of even mild adverse events with benzodiazepine use should not be prescribed benzodiazepines because continuous monitoring is lacking. Benzodiazepines should be prescribed with extra caution by dispensing or prescribing a very small number of doses and using more frequent monitoring; even patients at high risk for misuse or diversion, or with current or past benzodiazepine use disorder, can be prescribed benzodiazepines if managed cautiously, and the potential for misuse is limited during the short period of supervised withdrawal.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1121LzJs]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Level of care considerations for benzodiazepine (BZD) tapering — Although BZD tapering can typically be managed in outpatient settings, clinicians should consider inpatient care for BZD tapering when patient presentation indicates an imminent risk of significant harm related to continued use of the BZD medication that is unlikely to be rapidly mitigated by the initial dose reduction of the BZD taper (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation), when patient symptoms and/or co-occurring physical or mental health conditions are anticipated to complicate BZD tapering in a way that cannot be safely managed in an outpatient setting (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation), or when the patient is experiencing or imminently anticipated to experience severe or complicated BZD withdrawal (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Implementation considerations specify that clinicians should use the risk–benefit assessment to inform decisions regarding level of care, that most patients with physical dependence to BZDs can complete tapering in outpatient settings but clinicians should consider inpatient tapering when imminent risk to patient safety cannot be mitigated rapidly with outpatient treatment, that clinicians should consider prior history of severe or complicated BZD or alcohol withdrawal when determining patients' current withdrawal risk, and that if the clinician cannot obtain authorization for inpatient care, they should consider whether attempting an outpatient taper or continuing the medication poses a greater risk.

### Medications for alcohol use disorder [^113DpUxm]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that clinicians screen adults for alcohol misuse and provide persons engaged in risky or hazardous drinking behaviors with brief behavioral counseling to reduce alcohol misuse. However, only a minority of American adults with high-risk alcohol use receive treatment. Three medications are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat alcohol use disorder: acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone. Acamprosate and naltrexone reduce alcohol consumption and increase abstinence rates, although the effects appear to be modest. Disulfiram has been used for years, but evidence supporting its effectiveness is inconsistent. Other medications may be beneficial to reduce heavy alcohol use. The anticonvulsants topiramate and gabapentin may reduce alcohol ingestion, although long-term studies are lacking. Antidepressants do not decrease alcohol use in patients without mood disorders, but sertraline and fluoxetine may help depressed patients decrease alcohol ingestion. Ondansetron may reduce alcohol use, particularly in selected subpopulations. Further study is needed for genetically targeted or as-needed medications to reduce alcohol use.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^116Z9fng]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — gabapentin misuse, abuse, and diversion — notes that gabapentin is FDA approved for epilepsy and post-herpetic neuralgia but has commonly been used off-label for other conditions including alcohol use disorder or chronic pain, and reports that although gabapentin was only misused by 1% of the general population, 40–65% of individuals prescribed gabapentin have misused or abused the medication, with patients with a substance use disorder more likely to misuse gabapentin. The box adds that some states have reclassified gabapentin as a Schedule-V medication and that, given recent evidence, recommendations about the risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion should be interpreted cautiously.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^115WUMUG]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Assessing risks and benefits of continued benzodiazepine prescribing — clinicians should review BZD use frequently for patients with a history of substance use disorders (SUDs), recognize higher morbidity and mortality risks when BZDs co-occur with alcohol use disorder (AUD) or opioid use disorder (OUD) due to CNS and respiratory depressant effects, and should carefully consider these risks when deciding on continued BZD prescribing.

### Anti-obesity medications and investigational agents: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2022 [^1162VQ2Z]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Table 2 — Phentermine (sympathomimetic amine) is a DEA Schedule IV stimulant approved for short-term use (12 weeks) for weight management in individuals age 17 years or older, with an average weight reduction of about 3–8%. Side effects include headache, high blood pressure, rapid or irregular heart rate, overstimulation, tremor, dry mouth, and insomnia, and it is contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease, stroke, uncontrolled hypertension, within 14 days of monoamine oxidase inhibitors, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, agitated states, or with a history of drug abuse. It may have interactions with other sympathomimetics, alcohol, adrenergic neuron blocking drugs, and possibly some anesthetic agents, and it should not be taken during or within 14 days following monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors.

### Effectiveness of varenicline and cytisine for alcohol use reduction among people with HIV and substance use: a randomized clinical trial [^116FFiYQ]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Our results are important to individuals with HIV, their clinicians, and the larger general population. Most individuals with HIV and others who smoke and engage in risky drinking do not receive treatment for these conditions. Despite myriad reasons for lack of treatment, our results suggest that clinicians should dispel the notions that individuals with HIV and potentially others with multimorbidity cannot or will not use these medications and that if used, these medications will not be successful for smoking cessation. Importantly, our results do not support the use of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonists solely to decrease alcohol consumption. However, our findings, combined with prior large, randomized clinical trials using placebo controls that demonstrated the efficacy of these medications for smoking cessation, provide strong evidence that these medications may be used safely and effectively for smoking cessation among individuals with HIV who have multimorbidity and a history of substance use or active substance use disorders. Furthermore, given that risky drinking is common among individuals with HIV who smoke, our results suggest that the need for clinicians to treat such patients should be reinforced. In addition to the benefits of smoking cessation, it is possible that this treatment could result in decreased alcohol consumption, such as in the collateral benefit that has been described from the use of antidepressants among people with depression who also have alcohol use disorder.

Limitations

This trial has several limitations that warrant discussion. First, it was conducted at a single site and included only White men and women in St Petersburg, Russia, living with HIV infection and who had a high prevalence of comorbidities, potentially limiting generalizability to a healthier population with only risky drinking. Second, for ethical reasons, this trial was designed with a proven smoking cessation medication (as opposed to placebo control) in all treatment groups. Thus, we cannot know definitively if these drugs reduced alcohol consumption in this population. To know definitively if varenicline, cytisine, or even NRT reduced alcohol consumption independent of reduction or cessation of cigarette smoking would require a larger, placebo-controlled trial of individuals who engage in risky alcohol drinking and do not smoke. Most placebo-controlled trials of varenicline for alcohol use have been conducted in individuals who smoke; in our study and in other published studies, the sample size of individuals who did not smoke was too small to address this specific question. Additionally, we anticipated larger effect sizes in the design phase of this trial; thus, the study may have been underpowered to detect differences of the observed magnitude.

Level of Care Considerations

Recommendation for Level of Care Considerations

5. Although BZD tapering can typically be managed in outpatient settings, clinicians should consider inpatient care for BZD tapering when:
Patient presentation indicates an imminent risk of significant harm related to continued use of the BZD medication (e.g. medication interaction, overdose, accidents, falls, suicidality or other self-harm) that is unlikely to be rapidly mitigated by the initial dose reduction of the BZD taper (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)
Patient symptoms and/or co-occurring physical or mental health conditions are anticipated to complicate BZD tapering in a way that cannot be safely managed in an outpatient setting (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)
The patient is experiencing or imminently anticipated to experience severe or complicated BZD withdrawal (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)

Implementation Considerations
Clinicians should use the risk–benefit assessment to inform decisions regarding level of care.
Most patients who have developed physical dependence to BZDs can complete tapering in outpatient settings. Clinicians should consider inpatient tapering when imminent risks to patient safety cannot be mitigated rapidly with outpatient treatment.
Clinicians should consider prior history of severe or complicated BZD or alcohol withdrawal when determining patients' current withdrawal risk.
If the clinician cannot obtain authorization for inpatient care, they should consider whether attempting an outpatient taper or continuing the medication poses a greater risk.

Rationale

BZD tapering can typically be accomplished in outpatient settings. Although no direct evidence was found regarding level of care decisions for BZD tapering, the CGC agreed that most patients can undergo tapering in outpatient settings. In our systematic review, 42 of the 57 studies included were conducted in outpatient settings. This section of the Guideline details situations where additional support may be required to accomplish BZD tapering. The level of care options for many patients may be limited to outpatient or inpatient settings or, in rare instances, skilled nursing facilities.

Patients with suspected or confirmed SUD or other psychiatric disorders may require additional support, especially if they have had previous unsuccessful attempts to taper from BZDs. These patients may be eligible for a broader range of services, including intensive outpatient treatment, partial hospitalization programs, and residential care within the specialty addiction and mental health treatment systems. Specific considerations for these patients are discussed in " Patients with Benzodiazepine and Other Substance Use Disorders " and " Patients with Co-occurring Psychiatric Disorders".

### Debate: are benzodiazepines appropriate treatments for patients with substance use disorders? Yes [^1131ASMs]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines are a controversial treatment for anxiety in patients with substance use disorders. Concerns include risk of addiction, overdose, and diversion. But benzodiazepines are among the most effective and well-tolerated treatments for anxiety, and are safe for the majority of patients who take them. Though not appropriate for all cases, particularly in those with an active opioid use disorder, benzodiazepines should be considered as a treatment for patients with substance use disorders after careful weighing of benefits and harms.

### Gabapentin misuse, abuse and diversion: a systematic review [^116eF3vn]. Addiction (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Since its market release, gabapentin has been presumed to have no abuse potential and subsequently has been prescribed widely off-label, despite increasing reports of gabapentin misuse. This review estimates and describes the prevalence and effects of, motivations behind and risk factors for gabapentin misuse, abuse and diversion.

Methods

Databases were searched for peer-reviewed papers demonstrating gabapentin misuse, characterized by taking a larger dosage than prescribed or taking gabapentin without a prescription, and diversion. All types of studies were considered; grey literature was excluded. Thirty-three papers met inclusion criteria, consisting of 23 case studies and 11 epidemiological reports. Published reports came from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Finland, India, South Africa and France, and two analyzed websites not specific to a particular country.

Results

Prevalence of gabapentin misuse in the general population was reported to be 1%, 40–65% among individuals with prescriptions and between 15 and 22% within populations of people who abuse opioids. An array of subjective experiences reminiscent of opioids, benzodiazepines and psychedelics were reported over a range of doses, including those within clinical recommendations. Gabapentin was misused primarily for recreational purposes, self-medication or intentional self-harm and was misused alone or in combination with other substances, especially opioids, benzodiazepines and/or alcohol. Individuals with histories of drug abuse were most often involved in its misuse.

Conclusions

Epidemiological and case report evidence suggests that the anti-epileptic and analgesic medication gabapentin is being misused internationally, with substance abuse populations at special risk for misuse/abuse.

### Diagnosis and pharmacotherapy of alcohol use disorder: a review [^114TwxyN]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Alcohol consumption is associated with 88 000 US deaths annually. Although routine screening for heavy alcohol use can identify patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and has been recommended, only 1 in 6 US adults report ever having been asked by a health professional about their drinking behavior. Alcohol use disorder, a problematic pattern of alcohol use accompanied by clinically significant impairment or distress, is present in up to 14% of US adults during a 1-year period, although only about 8% of affected individuals are treated in an alcohol treatment facility.

Observations

Four medications are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat AUD: disulfiram, naltrexone (oral and long-acting injectable formulations), and acamprosate. However, patients with AUD most commonly receive counseling. Medications are prescribed to less than 9% of patients who are likely to benefit from them, given evidence that they exert clinically meaningful effects and their inclusion in clinical practice guidelines as first-line treatments for moderate to severe AUD. Naltrexone, which can be given once daily, reduces the likelihood of a return to any drinking by 5% and binge-drinking risk by 10%. Randomized clinical trials also show that some medications approved for other indications, including seizure disorder (eg, topiramate), are efficacious in treating AUD. Currently, there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of pharmacogenetics to personalize AUD treatments.

Conclusions and Relevance

Alcohol consumption is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality, and heavy alcohol use is the major risk factor for AUD. Simple, valid screening methods can be used to identify patients with heavy alcohol use, who can then be evaluated for the presence of an AUD. Patients receiving a diagnosis of the disorder should be given brief counseling and prescribed a first-line medication (eg, naltrexone) or referred for a more intensive psychosocial intervention.

Assessing Risks and Benefits of Continued Benzodiazepine Prescribing

Clinicians should review BZD use frequently for patients who have a history of SUDs, as these individuals are at increased risk of developing SUDs to other substances compared to those without a history of SUD. In addition, patients who use BZDs and have co-occurring alcohol use disorder (AUD) or OUD are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality because of the cross-tolerance and combined CNS and respiratory depressant effects of these substances. Clinicians should carefully consider these risks when determining the appropriateness of continued BZD prescribing.

Considerations for Benzodiazepine Tapering in Patients with Substance Use Disorder

Abrupt cessation of BZDs is dangerous. The CGC recommends clinicians develop gradual tapering strategies that are individualized based on a patient's response. If more rapid tapering is indicated — for example, due to imminent safety risks or when alternate treatment options have been unsuccessful — clinicians can consider use of very long-acting agents (see "Tapering with Very Long-Acting Agents"). Clinicians should consider patients' psychosocial concerns and co-occurring disorders when determining the appropriate timing of BZD tapering.

Tapering can be complicated when patients have been obtaining BZDs from the illicit drug market, where counterfeit pills can include novel synthetic BZDs (e.g. etizolam, flubromazolam). These novel synthetic BZDs have not been well studied and may not be detected with standard drug testing or toxicology assays. The European Union Drugs Agency's New benzodiazepines in Europe – a review provides helpful information on emerging new BZDs. In addition, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) tracks emerging threats related to BZDs. Determining an equivalent BZD dose to begin tapering is complicated when patients are taking BZDs from the illicit drug market. In general, clinicians should titrate the BZD dose to the minimum dose necessary to control a patient's withdrawal symptoms and taper from that point. Clinicians should consider residential treatment if patients need after-hours clinical monitoring or medical management to support safe and effective BZD tapering.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1146a48U]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — patients at risk of developing new or worsening signs or symptoms of withdrawal while away from the ambulatory treatment setting should be provided with pharmacotherapy, with benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin appropriate for monotherapy. Providing at least a single dose of benzodiazepine followed by ongoing treatment according to symptom severity is also appropriate, and if the risk is unknown patients should be reassessed frequently over the next 24 hours to monitor their need for withdrawal medication.

What are temazepam capsules?

Temazepam capsules are a prescription sleep medicine. Temazepam capsules are used in adults for the short-term (usually 7 to 10 days) treatment of a sleep problem called insomnia. Symptoms of insomnia include trouble falling asleep and waking up often during the night.
Temazepam capsules are a federal controlled substance (CIV) because it can be abused or lead to dependence. Keep temazepam capsules in a safe place to prevent misuse and abuse. Selling or giving away temazepam capsules may harm others, and is against the law. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription medicines or street drugs.
It is not known if temazepam capsules are safe and effective in children.
It is not known if temazepam capsules are safe and effective for use longer than 2 weeks.

Do not take temazepam capsules if you:

are allergic to temazepam or any of the ingredients in temazepam capsules. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in temazepam capsules.

Before you take temazepam capsules, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:

have a history of depression, mental illness or, suicidal thoughts
have a history of drug or alcohol abuse or addiction
have lung disease or breathing problems
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Temazepam may cause birth defects or harm your unborn baby.
are breastfeeding, or plan to breastfeed. Temazepam may pass through your breast milk and may harm your baby. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby if you take temazepam capsules.

### Approach to the pharmacological management of chronic pain in patients with an alcohol use disorder [^114dXQZ3]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

This paper provides an overview of research, guidelines, and clinical considerations for the use of medications for chronic pain in the management of patients with an alcohol use disorder. A review of the literature identified randomized controlled trials, epidemiological cohort studies, consensus guidelines, and one systematic review and meta-analysis. Where gaps in the literature existed, clinical experience of the authors is included. Use of nonopioid medications should be given priority and may offer a more favorable risk profile as well as benefits beyond pain management, such as improvement in anxiety, depression, or insomnia. Pregabalin and gabapentin have additional benefits to decrease alcohol cravings or time to relapse after a period of abstinence from alcohol. Drug interactions between selected analgesics and alcohol, disulfiram, or naltrexone require careful consideration.

### Potential for alcohol and drug interactions in older adults: evidence from the Irish longitudinal study on ageing [^111Gy4fQ]. BMC Geriatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Although exposure to AI medications varied by therapeutic class, an examination of concurrent alcohol use suggests consistency across therapeutic classes. Concurrent alcohol use ranged between approximately 50–60% for most therapeutic classes, with the exception of muscle relaxants (80%). Similarly, heavy drinking was identified in approximately one in five older adults reporting concurrent use of cardiovascular, blood and anti-diabetic agents. The concurrent use of psychotropics with heavy alcohol consumption is of particular concern, as they may cause the most dangerous alcohol related adverse drug reactions. Sixteen percent of older adults taking CNS agents were identified as heavy drinkers; 14.8% of people taking opioid analgesics reported heavy drinking. Similarly, 13% of people taking anti-epileptics, antipsychotics or hypnotics reported heavy drinking, with almost one in five of those taking antidepressants also reporting heavy drinking. This is consistent with other studies, which suggest that concurrent use of psychotropic drugs and alcohol has become more prevalent in older adults. However, this may be an artefact of increased use of psychotropic medications with age. We also found a high prevalence of alcohol consumption among people with conditions known to be exacerbated by alcohol consumption.

Although we are unable to ascertain the reasons behind alcohol consumption, particularly heavy consumption, in combination with AI medications, previous research has shown that many older adults are often unaware of the potential risk. This may be compounded by the fact that older people are less likely to reveal a history of excessive alcohol consumption, and healthcare workers have a lower degree of suspicion when assessing older people. In light of these findings, general practitioners should take the opportunity to review their patients' alcohol consumption prior to prescribing AI medications. Knowing how much alcohol their older patients are drinking would facilitate an effective assessment of risk, and identify those patients in need of counselling in relation to the safe use of alcohol and medications. Counselling patients on long-term AI medications is particularly important, as it may be easier to abstain from alcohol if concomitant medications are for defined short time periods compared to long-term medications. Pharmacists are also in a position to educate patients in relation to the potential risk associated with alcohol consumption and AI medication at the point of dispensing AI medications.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^115x2gNR]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Although many patients who have been taking BZDs for a short period of time (e.g. less than a month) are able to discontinue the medication without a taper, some will experience significant withdrawal symptoms. Similarly, some patients who have been taking BZDs at a low dose for an intermediate amount of time (e.g. 6 weeks) may not be physically dependent. Defining strict thresholds for the risk of physical dependence and withdrawal is difficult because many factors beyond the dose and duration of BZD use impact risk, including age, co-occurring physical and mental health conditions, the pharmacological properties of the given BZD, other medication and substance use, and prior history of withdrawal, among others.

Table 3 summarizes the risk of withdrawal by dose, duration, and frequency of BZD use. While no direct evidence was found for predicting risk of withdrawal, the CGC agreed that these factors were most salient in the determination. Clinicians should consider this information in the context of each patient's presentation when determining if patients are likely to be physically dependent and tapering is indicated. It should be noted that alprazolam — which is unique in having a very short half-life, rapid onset of action, and no active metabolites — tends to be associated with a more rapid onset of physical dependence. Therefore, a taper may be appropriate for patients taking this medication daily, even for a short duration (e.g. 2–4 weeks).

If physical dependence is difficult to determine, clinicians should elicit information from patients regarding any concerns about discontinuation or preferences for tapering. Clinicians should gather information about each patient's likelihood for physical dependence and risk of withdrawal, including asking if they have experienced withdrawal symptoms following missed doses in the past. Clinicians should also ask patients about any past experiences with withdrawal symptoms associated with tapering or discontinuing BZDs, especially adverse events such as seizures. Determining use of alcohol is also important, particularly if patients engage in ongoing daily alcohol use or have experienced severe withdrawal from alcohol or other substances in the past; slower and/or alternate tapering strategies may be indicated in these situations. If SUD may be present, clinicians should consider consulting addiction specialists, when possible.

If physical dependence is unlikely and the decision is made to discontinue the BZD without a taper, clinicians should educate patients about potential withdrawal and/or rebound symptoms that may occur and encourage patients to report these symptoms. If patients report significant symptoms, clinicians can consider initiating a taper.

### Approach to the pharmacological management of chronic pain in patients with an alcohol use disorder [^115CoXL5]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

CNCP is a major problem in society, affecting 25% of the general population. The prevalence of chronic pain is estimated to be higher among patients with substance use disorders than among the general population. The approach to management of CNCP in a patient with a comorbid alcohol use disorder requires careful consideration of risks and benefits of analgesic and adjunctive options for pain, such as acetaminophen, NSAIDs, opioids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and cannabinoids. The patient with comorbid alcohol use disorder and chronic pain needs his/her alcohol disorder diagnosed and treated in an integrated way with the treatment of the pain. Considerations about selection of treatment for the pain must depend on treatment strategy and the success of the treatment strategy for the alcohol use disorder.

Acetaminophen may be a reasonable option short-term; however, risks of long-term use of acetaminophen in patients who continue to abuse alcohol remain unquantified. Risks associated with NSAID use generally outweigh potential benefits in patients with an alcohol use disorder. If NSAID therapy is chosen, the lowest effective dose is recommended and proton-pump inhibitor therapy should be considered in patients at increased risk of GI bleeds. Alcohol increases the risk of overdose and CNS depressant effects of opioids through pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic mechanisms. There is risk of opioid misuse in patients with a history of a substance use disorder. For chronic neuropathic pain, gabapentinoids or SNRIs are alternatives to consider. Pregabalin has demonstrated benefits in preliminary clinical trials for reducing cravings, prolonging time to heavy drinking after withdrawal, and promotion of abstinence.SNRIs and TCAs are first line for treating neuropathic pain; however, their use is limited by adverse effects and drug interactions. Cannabinoids should generally be avoided due to their potential for worsening alcohol dependence and CNS depressant effects.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^113aKWh7]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

In 2020, the FDA updated the required Boxed Warning for BZD medications to describe the risks of physical dependence, withdrawal, and BZD use disorder. The associated Drug Safety Communication encouraged prescribers to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of BZD medication, limit the dose and duration to what is needed to achieve the clinical goal, and monitor patients for BZD misuse and BZD use disorder. When prescribing BZDs, clinicians should have a thoughtful strategy for medication management that regularly reassesses the risks and benefits of continued prescribing, as well as a patient-centered plan for tapering the medication when the benefits no longer outweigh the risks (Fig. 2).

Figure 2
Outpatient taper management

The risks of BZD use evolve as a patient continues to take the medication. Although most patients taking BZDs as prescribed will not develop BZD use disorder, the risk of physical dependence and BZD use disorder increases with time, particularly in patients who use alcohol or other substances. Long-term BZD use is often associated with more risks than benefits. Significant risks include oversedation and other sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, falls, motor vehicle accidents, and fatal and nonfatal overdose. Despite these known risks, clinicians often encounter patients who have been taking prescribed BZD for years.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^112Wp76S]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — patients who take opioids: Patients who are on chronic opioid medication (opioid agonist therapy for opioid use disorder or pain) should be monitored closely when benzodiazepines are prescribed, due to the increased risk of respiratory depression; similarly, patients taking sedative-hypnotic medications exhibit tolerance to benzodiazepines and should be monitored closely for appropriate dose. For patients with concurrent alcohol withdrawal and opioid use disorder, stabilize opioid use disorder (e.g., with methadone or buprenorphine) concomitantly with treating alcohol withdrawal.

### Oxycodone hydrochloride (Oxaydo) [^116jbp2X]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse

OXAYDO contains oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, OXAYDO exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)].

Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed OXAYDO. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. The risk of opioid-related overdose or overdose-related death is increased with higher opioid doses, and this risk persists over the course of therapy. In postmarketing studies, addiction, abuse, misuse, and fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose were observed in patients with long-term opioid use [see Postmarketing Experience (6.2)].

Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing OXAYDO, and reassess all patients receiving OXAYDO for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as OXAYDO but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of OXAYDO along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing an opioid overdose reversal agent [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing OXAYDO. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and on the proper disposal of unused drug. Contact the local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.

### Zolpidem tartrate (zolpidem) [^112cVKaP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

9.1 Controlled Substance

Zolpidem Tartrate is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by federal regulation.

9.2 Abuse

Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Abuse is characterized by misuse of the drug for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drug effects over time. Tolerance may occur to both desired and undesired effects of drugs and may develop at different rates for different effects.

Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiological disease with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, using a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common.

Studies of abuse potential in former drug abusers found that the effects of single doses of Zolpidem Tartrate 40 mg were similar, but not identical, to diazepam 20 mg, while Zolpidem Tartrate 10 mg was difficult to distinguish from placebo.

Because persons with a history of addiction to, or abuse of, drugs or alcohol are at increased risk for misuse, abuse and addiction of Zolpidem, they should be monitored carefully when receiving Zolpidem or any other hypnotic.

Alcohol — management of unhealthy alcohol use in people with HIV: Ongoing alcohol use is not a contraindication for a person to receive antiretroviral therapy (ART), but treatment for unhealthy alcohol use may improve HIV treatment outcomes. Behavioral treatments for unhealthy alcohol use among people with HIV demonstrate a small but significant reduction in alcohol use. Pharmacotherapy also can reduce alcohol use among people with HIV, and the FDA has approved three pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder (AUD): naltrexone, disulfiram, and acamprosate. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of naltrexone in reducing the number of heavy drinking days among those with HIV, naltrexone appears to be safe to use in people with HIV and is not associated with significant drug–drug interactions or irreversible hepatotoxicity, but it is not recommended for individuals with decompensated liver disease and should be used with caution in individuals with elevated transaminase levels. Use of naltrexone in people with HIV and AUD can improve HIV treatment outcomes.

### Overview of alcohol use disorder [^115RT2i4]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Alcohol is regularly consumed throughout most of the world, including by nearly half the U.S. population age 12 or older. Heavy drinking, which is also common, contributes to multiple adverse medical, psychiatric, and social outcomes and more than 140,000 deaths annually in the United States. It is the major risk factor for alcohol use disorder (AUD), whose current U.S. prevalence is 11%. However, AUD is undertreated, with less than 15% of individuals with a lifetime diagnosis receiving any treatment. Risk of AUD is nearly equally genetic and environmental. AUD is responsive to psychosocial treatments, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and motivational enhancement therapy. Alcohol affects multiple neurotransmitter systems, and thus pharmacotherapy for AUD is also effective. The three medications approved in the United States to treat AUD-disulfiram, naltrexone (oral and long-acting injectable formulations), and acamprosate-are underprescribed, despite being considered first-line treatments in clinical practice guidelines. Two medications not approved for treating AUD, topiramate and gabapentin, have shown efficacy in treating the disorder and are used off-label. Recent studies of novel drug candidates, including psychedelics and phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors, are promising additions for the treatment of AUD, although they require further evaluation before being used clinically. Despite the growing availability of efficacious psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for AUD, it remains a highly stigmatized condition. Research aimed at enhancing the identification and treatment of AUD, including precision therapeutics, could broaden the acceptability of AUD treatment, benefiting affected individuals and their families and reducing the stigma associated with the disorder.

The short-term study samples included men and women aged 18–65 years, with a DSM-5 diagnosis of bipolar I disorder and displaying an acute manic episode with or without mixed features requiring hospitalization. Diagnosis was confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI;) and a history of one or more previous manic episodes (with or without mixed features), with manic symptoms of sufficient severity to require one of the following interventions: hospitalization or treatment with a mood stabilizer, or treatment with an antipsychotic agent. Eligible patients also had to have a Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS;) score of ⩾24 at screening and baseline.

Short-term study exclusion criteria included unwillingness to practice two different methods of birth control or remaining abstinent during the studies and for 30 days after the last dose of study medication; having a history of DSM-5 diagnosis other than bipolar I disorder, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, MDD, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, delirium, dementia, amnestic, or other cognitive disorders; or a current DSM-5 diagnosis or history of substance or alcohol use disorder, or positive drug screen for cocaine or other drugs of abuse. Other exclusion criteria included having a current manic episode lasting for more than four weeks overall or requiring hospitalization for > 21 days for the current acute episode (to prevent patients with persistent manic symptoms from being exposed to placebo); being unresponsive to clozapine or only being responsive to clozapine; being considered resistant or refractory to treatment for manic symptoms by history; having had electroconvulsive treatment within the past two months; clinically significant abnormalities (as determined by laboratory testing); or taking concomitant medications that would interfere with the safety and efficacy assessments. The following medications were prohibited during the trials: all psychotropic agents (including, but not limited to, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, mood stabilizers (including lithium)], prescription stimulants, and opioid analgesics), hypnotics (including ramelteon and other non-benzodiazepine sleep aids), antihistamines (except loratadine and cetirizine), varenicline, vitamins/nutritional supplements/herbal preparations (unless approved in advance by the medical monitor), investigational agents, and CYP2D6 inhibitors or CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers.

### The role of a prescription in anxiety medication use, abuse, and dependence [^116HVBFE]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Prescriptions for anxiety medications have increased substantially in recent years. Individuals with anxiety disorders are at risk of nonmedical use of these medications, but information about whether this risk is elevated among patients with a prescription for such medications is lacking. The authors compared risk of nonmedical use in individuals in a national sample with and without a prescription for anxiety medication and identified characteristics associated with nonmedical use.

Method

Data were drawn from face-to-face surveys of 34,653 adult participants in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. The risk of nonmedical use of prescription anxiety medication and associated drug use disorders was computed for individuals who had or had not ever received a prescription for anxiety medication; among those who had received a prescription, characteristics associated with nonmedical use were analyzed.

Results

Prescription of anxiety medication was associated with lifetime and past-year nonmedical use (odds ratios, 1.6 and 1.9, respectively) and lifetime DSM-IV abuse or dependence (odds ratio, 2.6). Among respondents who received a prescription (N = 4,294), nonmedical use was associated with male sex, younger age, white race, history of use of illicit drugs, history of other drug use disorders, and history of illegal behaviors.

Conclusions

These results indicate that prescription for anxiety medications is associated with nonmedical use of these medications, although the direction of causality cannot be determined in this study. Although anxiety medications have clinical utility, greater clinical attention should be given to the potential for their abuse among patients at particular risk.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1145zm9j]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal — anticonvulsants and adjuncts — reports that evidence suggests anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine, are effective at preventing alcohol withdrawal progression, seizures and delirium, but at this time there is insufficient evidence to support their use over benzodiazepines for patients at increased risk of severe withdrawal, seizures, or delirium. Carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate medications for treating low risk patients and are appropriate alternatives for patients with a benzodiazepine contraindication. Gabapentin may provide an effective bridge therapy from alcohol withdrawal treatment to long-term alcohol use disorder treatment, improving rates of abstinence and reducing heavy drinking days compared with placebo during the maintenance phase. Use of carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid as an adjunct to benzodiazepines is an appropriate therapy for patients experiencing mild or moderate withdrawal. While valproic acid is promising, more evidence is needed before it can be recommended as monotherapy; its use as an adjunct to benzodiazepines is supported, and it should not be used in patients with hematological or hepatic disorders including acute liver impairment or in women of childbearing potential because of teratogenic risk.

3.3.1 Step 1: review general principles and assess medication status

Examination of a patient presenting in a manic state should include an immediate assessment for risk of aggressive behaviour, violence and safety threat to others, suicide risk especially in those with mixed features, degree of insight and the ability to adhere to treatment, comorbidity (including substance use that may be aggravating or contributing to clinical presentation), and availability of a psychosocial support network. A physical examination with laboratory investigations (described in Section 8) should be conducted, but may be deferred for patients who are uncooperative. Results of the overall assessment should be used to establish the most appropriate treatment setting (eg, ambulatory or inpatient).

Before initiating pharmacological treatment for a manic episode, it is imperative to rule out symptoms secondary to drugs of abuse, medications, other treatments, or a general medical or neurological condition (although, even in these cases, symptomatic treatment may be applied on a short‐term basis). Steps should be taken to rule out any other factors that may be perpetuating symptoms such as prescribed medication, illicit drug use/abuse or an endocrine disorder. Any patients presenting with mania who have been taking antidepressants should have these medications discontinued. If there is a previous diagnosis of BD, it is appropriate to immediately commence antimanic agents. If this is the first emergence of manic symptoms, clinicians are advised to confirm the diagnosis of BD by monitoring patients for a period of time after antidepressant discontinuation and obtain collateral information to confirm whether symptoms remain and antimanic treatment is necessary. Patients should also be supported to discontinue stimulant use, including caffeine and alcohol. Current and prior therapies should be assessed, including appropriateness of medications, dosing, and trough serum levels (where indicated), as well as past response; and this should be used to direct subsequent therapeutic choices. Attention should be paid to managing withdrawal symptoms that may occur in manic patients with histories of substance abuse.

When the symptoms of mania have remitted, behavioural and educational strategies should be applied to promote ongoing medication adherence, reduce residual symptoms, help identify early signs of relapse, and support functional recovery (see Section 2).

3.3.2 Step 2: initiate or optimize therapy and check adherence

It is recommended that, for all patients (including those who are untreated as well as those receiving a non‐first‐line treatment), therapy be initiated with one of the available first‐line monotherapy or combination treatments.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1135Z5eT]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine (BZD) risks and vulnerable populations — despite potential harms, long-term use of BZDs (i.e., ≥ 120 days) is common; BZD use is associated with an increased risk of adverse events including falls, motor vehicle accidents, cognitive impairment, delirium, overdose, and death, particularly when BZDs are used in combination with CNS depressants such as alcohol or opioids; evidence also suggests that use of BZDs is associated with increased suicide risk; older adults (i.e., ≥ 65 years old) have the highest BZD prescription rates and are at higher risk of experiencing adverse events related to BZD use, with some older adults having taken BZDs continuously for decades and, in some instances, use so prolonged that the original reason for the BZD prescription may be unclear.

Stabilization and withdrawal — Alcohol use disorder: For the treatment of moderate-severe alcohol withdrawal, we recommend using benzodiazepines with adequate monitoring. For managing mild-moderate alcohol withdrawal in patients for whom risks of benzodiazepines outweigh benefits (e.g., inadequate monitoring available, abuse liability, or allergy/adverse reactions), we suggest considering carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid as an alternative.

### Evaluation in alcohol use disorders-insights from the nalmefene experience [^112QoWKy]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In addition, and from a clinical perspective, marketing a drug for people who continue to drink (especially if it is ineffective) may have seriously detrimental psychological and social implications. The licensing of nalmefene may suggest to some people that they can continue drinking when they might otherwise have come to the realisation that they need to stop. Given that people with alcohol problems are often in denial about the harmful effects of drinking, and accustomed to looking for a chemical solution for their problems, this is a real danger that may actually perpetuate harmful drinking in the long term.

Therefore, scientists and clinicians need to engage in a collaborative effort to reach an evidence-based consensus that extends beyond the case of nalmefene and concerns all regulation of medication for alcohol dependence. In our opinion, this implies changes in our current research paradigm. First, we propose doing away with alcohol consumption as a surrogate for treatment success. We propose instead the use of mortality and health outcomes (motor vehicle crashes, injuries and harm). Alternatively, quality of life could be considered, providing unambiguous tools are developed to asses it in an optimal way. Although simple in appearance, these changes would be revolutionary in the field of alcohol use disorders, where very few trials have reported these health outcomes (or when they have done so, they had not been designed or powered to assess them correctly). A meta-analysis including 22,803 participants concluded that the evidence from trials was insufficient to draw any conclusions about improved health outcomes attributable to pharmacotherapy.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111UY244]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering guideline — scope and exclusions states that the Guideline focuses on whether and how to taper benzodiazepine (BZD) medications, including assessing risks and benefits, partnering with patients, level of care, and tapering strategies with withdrawal management. It pertains to patients taking BZDs regularly and at risk of physical dependence and withdrawal, and addresses population-specific considerations including co-prescribed BZDs and opioids, SUD, other psychiatric disorders, older adults, and pregnant and lactating patients. It is not applicable to patients who are prescribed BZDs but are not taking them regularly, nor to those prescribed BZDs for a short period of time (e.g., for under 2 weeks for the management of agitation, acute anxiety, or alcohol withdrawal); non-BZD medications acting on GABA receptors and children and adolescents (i.e., < 18 years old) are beyond the scope.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) other medications — evidence summary: Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of baclofen for AUD provided low quality evidence with inconsistent effects on alcohol consumption, and abrupt withdrawal of baclofen can be associated with hallucinations and seizures; there are no large, randomized, double-blind studies of valproic acid for AUD, with two very small trials showing low to moderate quality evidence for a positive effect on alcohol consumption; and buspirone, citalopram, fluoxetine, and quetiapine showed either no benefit or inconsistent benefit in typically very low or low quality studies. Outside the systematic evidence review, an RCT of prazosin in individuals with AUD but without posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) demonstrated reduced alcohol consumption compared to placebo over time, and an RCT of varenicline demonstrated reduced heavy drinking among men compared to placebo, with less effect on drinking among women in the active condition.

### Effect of alcohol coadministration on the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and safety of lemborexant: a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study [^112E5qBq]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Insomnia is a common sleep–wake disorder, with 30–50% of the adult population experiencing occasional short-term symptoms, and up to 10% meeting diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder. The societal burden of insomnia is substantial, with well-established relationships between poor sleep quality and impaired daytime functioning, underperformance in the workplace, substance abuse, psychiatric and medical comorbidities, and increased healthcare resource utilization. Common strategies for the treatment of sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance insomnia include cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia or pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine Z-drugs, and antidepressants with sedative properties. However, these pharmacotherapies may be associated with adverse sleep-related behaviors and cognitive/psychomotor impairment, affecting driving performance and increasing the risk of falls in elderly patients.

Insomnia treatments may be taken regularly for extended periods, increasing the possibility that individuals will take their medication after having consumed alcohol. As the result of the sedative effects of alcohol, individuals may also use alcohol to self-treat insomnia. Alcohol consumption is known to impair sustained attention, disrupt the ability to learn new information, impair coordination, increase body sway, and to lower self-rated alertness. In addition, alcohol consumption is associated with falls, accidents, and accident-related injuries. Therefore, it is considered of clinical importance to assess the combination of alcohol with new sleep-promoting drugs to determine the potential consequence of the combination.

Lemborexant is an orally active, dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) approved in multiple countries, including the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, and several Asian countries for the treatment of insomnia in adults. In randomized controlled trials of adults with insomnia disorder, lemborexant 5 and 10 mg improved sleep onset and sleep maintenance compared with placebo without producing clinically meaningful residual morning sleepiness. During the clinical development of lemborexant, the potential for residual effects with single and chronic dosing was assessed in nine clinical studies using a variety of measures, including postural stability, cognitive performance, and on-road driving. A recently published overview of these studies indicated that lemborexant has a low propensity to impair next-day functioning among healthy subjects and subjects with insomnia.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions for the treatment of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^112tkVyM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol abuse and dependence represents a very serious health problem worldwide with major social, interpersonal and legal interpolations. Pharmacological treatments presently used are of uncertain effectiveness and there is even more doubt on the comparative effects and value for money.

Objectives

To summarize Cochrane reviews that assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (30 November 2010). Two authors independently screened, extracted data, summarised key characteristics of the included reviews and assessed their quality using AMSTAR; the quality of the evidence was summarised according to the GRADE methodology.

Main Results

Five reviews, 114 studies, 7333 participants, satisfied criteria for inclusions. The outcomes considered were alcohol withdrawal seizures, adverse events and dropouts. Comparing the five treatments with placebo, benzodiazepines performed better for seizures, three studies, 324 participants, RR 0.16 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.69), moderate quality of evidence. Comparing each of the five treatments versus specific class of drugs, benzodiazepines performed better than antipsychotics for seizures, 4 studies, 633 participants, RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.88) high quality of the evidence. Comparing different benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants among themselves, 28 comparisons, results never reached statistical significance but chlordiazepoxide performed better. The quality of evidence was high for 3% of the results, moderate for 28%, low for 48% and very low for 20%.

Authors' Conclusions

Among the treatments considered, benzodiazepines showed a protective benefit against seizures, when compared to placebo and a potentially protective benefit for many outcomes when compared with antipsychotics. Nevertheless, no definite conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of benzodiazepines were possible, because of the heterogeneity of the trials both in interventions and in the assessment of outcomes. Data on potential harms are sparse and fragmented. Results do not provide sufficient evidence in favour of anticonvulsants for the treatment of AWS, but anticonvulsants seem to have limited side effects. There is also not enough evidence of effectiveness and safety of baclofen, because only one study consider this treatment and of GHB for which no strong differences were observed in the comparisons with placebo, benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^115AK69k]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM benzodiazepine dosing regimens — at short-term observational settings with continuous monitoring (e.g. Level 2–WM), symptom-triggered treatment conducted by trained staff is the preferred benzodiazepine dosing method, with front loading under clinical supervision or fixed dosing with additional as-needed medication also appropriate. At settings without extended on-site monitoring (Level 1–WM), symptom-triggered dosing is appropriate if patients or a caregiver can reliably monitor signs and symptoms with a withdrawal severity scale and follow dosing guidance.

### Approach to the pharmacological management of chronic pain in patients with an alcohol use disorder [^114ukgDu]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Case vignette

The patient's pain was considered to be mixed nature, primarily neuropathic, though there seemed to be some component of nociceptive and, specifically, musculoskeletal pain. Opioids are not a preferred alternative because of the patient's high risk profile for misuse. Because of the patient's reported ongoing use of alcohol, acetaminophen and NSAIDs are not considered safe alternatives. Pregabalin was selected as a preferred therapeutic alternative for the management of the patient's primarily neuropathic pain. It also has potential to decrease cravings for alcohol, which is in line with the patient's goals.

### Oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen (Percocet) [^111jGbc4]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Controlled Substance

PERCOCET contains oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance.

Abuse

PERCOCET contains oxycodone, a substance with high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction [see WARNINGS].

Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed.

Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects.

Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence.

Misuse and abuse of PERCOCET increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of PERCOCET with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction.

All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of PERCOCET abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing oxycodone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use PERCOCET in combination with other abused drugs.

### Baclofen for alcohol withdrawal [^111dzsj5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Baclofen shows potential for rapidly reducing symptoms of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) in people with alcoholism. Treatment with baclofen is easy to manage and rarely produces euphoria or other pleasant effects, or craving for the drug. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in 2015, Issue 4.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of baclofen for people with AWS.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to March 2017: the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL. We also searched registers of ongoing trials. We handsearched the references quoted in the identified trials, and sought information from researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and relevant trial authors about unpublished or uncompleted trials. We placed no restrictions on language.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating baclofen versus placebo or any other treatment for people with AWS. We excluded uncontrolled, non-randomised, or quasi-randomised trials. We included both parallel group and cross-over studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included three RCTs with 141 randomised participants. We did not perform meta-analyses due to the different control interventions. For the comparison of baclofen and placebo (1 study, 31 participants), there was no significant difference in Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale, Revised (CIWA-Ar) scores (very low quality evidence). For the comparison of baclofen and diazepam (1 study, 37 participants), there was no significant difference in CIWA-Ar scores (very low quality evidence), adverse events (risk difference (RD) 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.10 to 0.10; very low quality evidence), dropouts (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.10; very low quality evidence), and dropouts due to adverse events (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.10; very low quality evidence). For the comparison of baclofen and chlordiazepoxide (1 study, 60 participants), there was no significant difference in CIWA-Ar scores (mean difference (MD) 1.00, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.30; very low quality evidence), global improvement (MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.23; very low quality evidence), adverse events (RD 2.50, 95% CI 0.88 to 7.10; very low quality of evidence), dropouts (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.06; very low quality evidence), and dropouts due to adverse events (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.06; very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

No conclusions can be drawn about the efficacy and safety of baclofen for the management of alcohol withdrawal because we found insufficient and very low quality evidence.

### Oxycodone and aspirin [^114HjbUz]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse

Oxycodone and aspirin tablets contain Oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, oxycodone and aspirin tablets exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).

Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed oxycodone and aspirin tablets. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.

Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing oxycodone and aspirin tablets, and monitor all patients receiving oxycodone and aspirin tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as oxycodone and aspirin tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of oxycodone and aspirin tablets along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.

Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing oxycodone and aspirin tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug (see PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients). Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.

### Gabapentin combined with naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence [^113syJoN]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Naltrexone, an efficacious medication for alcohol dependence, does not work for everyone. Symptoms such as insomnia and mood instability that are most evident during early abstinence might respond better to a different pharmacotherapy. Gabapentin may reduce these symptoms and help prevent early relapse. This clinical trial evaluated whether the combination of naltrexone and gabapentin was better than naltrexone alone and/or placebo during the early drinking cessation phase (first 6 weeks), and if so, whether this effect persisted.

Method

A total of 150 alcohol-dependent individuals were randomly assigned to a 16-week course of naltrexone alone (50 mg/day [N = 50]), naltrexone (50 mg/day) with gabapentin (up to 1,200 mg/day [N = 50]) added for the first 6 weeks, or double placebo (N = 50). All participants received medical management.

Results

During the first 6 weeks, the naltrexone-gabapentin group had a longer interval to heavy drinking than the naltrexone-alone group, which had an interval similar to that of the placebo group; had fewer heavy drinking days than the naltrexone-alone group, which in turn had more than the placebo group; and had fewer drinks per drinking day than the naltrexone-alone group and the placebo group. These differences faded over the remaining weeks of the study. Poor sleep was associated with more drinking in the naltrexone-alone group but not in the naltrexone-gabapentin group, while a history of alcohol withdrawal was associated with better response in the naltrexone-gabapentin group.

Conclusions

The addition of gabapentin to naltrexone improved drinking outcomes over naltrexone alone during the first 6 weeks after cessation of drinking. This effect did not endure after gabapentin was discontinued.

### Pregabalin capsules, cv [^1167wD8y]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

Pregabalin is a Schedule V controlled substance.

Pregabalin is not known to be active at receptor sites associated with drugs of abuse. As with any CNS active drug, carefully evaluate patients for history of drug abuse and observe them for signs of pregabalin misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, dose escalation, drug-seeking behavior).

9.2 Abuse

In a study of recreational users (N = 15) of sedative/hypnotic drugs, including alcohol, pregabalin (450 mg, single dose) received subjective ratings of "good drug effect", "high" and "liking" to a degree that was similar to diazepam (30 mg, single dose). In controlled clinical studies in over 5500 patients, 4% of pregabalin-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients overall reported euphoria as an adverse reaction, though in some patient populations studied, this reporting rate was higher and ranged from 1 to 12%.

9.3 Dependence

In clinical studies, following abrupt or rapid discontinuation of pregabalin, some patients reported symptoms including insomnia, nausea, headache or diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)], consistent with physical dependence. In the postmarketing setting, in addition to these reported symptoms, other reported adverse reactions include, but are not limited to, seizures, depression, suicidal ideation and behavior, agitation, confusion, disorientation, psychotic symptoms, pain, sweating, tremor, dizziness, and malaise.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1169kqWT]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering in patients with SUD — abrupt cessation of BZDs is dangerous; the CGC recommends clinicians develop gradual tapering strategies that are individualized based on a patient's response; if more rapid tapering is indicated due to imminent safety risks or unsuccessful alternate treatments, clinicians can consider use of very long-acting agents; and clinicians should consider patients' psychosocial concerns and co-occurring disorders when determining the timing of BZD tapering.

Pregabalin is not known to be active at receptor sites associated with drugs of abuse. As with any CNS active drug, carefully evaluate patients for history of drug abuse and observe them for signs of pregabalin misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, dose escalation, drug-seeking behavior).

9.2 Abuse

In a study of recreational users (N = 15) of sedative/hypnotic drugs, including alcohol, pregabalin (450 mg, single dose) received subjective ratings of "good drug effect", "high" and "liking" to a degree that was similar to diazepam (30 mg, single dose).

9.3 Dependence

In clinical studies, following abrupt or rapid discontinuation of pregabalin, some patients reported symptoms including insomnia, nausea, headache or diarrhea [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)], consistent with physical dependence. In the postmarketing experience, in addition to these reported symptoms there have also been reported cases of anxiety and hyperhidrosis.

### The management of substance use disorders: synopsis of the 2021 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^111VSZDt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Alcohol use disorder — moderate-severe alcohol withdrawal — guidance and evidence: For the treatment of moderate-severe alcohol withdrawal, we recommend using benzodiazepines with adequate monitoring (Strong for | Not reviewed, Amended). Moderate quality evidence from a meta-analysis supports benzodiazepines over placebo (risk ratio [RR]: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.69) for reducing seizure for moderate-severe alcohol withdrawal; compared to placebo, benzodiazepines reduce withdrawal severity, incidences of delirium, and withdrawal seizures, are generally well tolerated although some sedation can occur, and adequate monitoring during alcohol withdrawal is required; supportive care includes appropriate monitoring of vital signs and replacing fluids and electrolytes.

### Medications for alcohol use disorder among birthing people with an alcohol-related diagnosis [^117PobjB]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Although safety and effectiveness of medications for alcohol use disorder (AUD) are well established for adults, literature on these medications in pregnancy is limited. Given known adverse effects of untreated AUD during pregnancy, clinicians and researchers have recently begun to call for reconsidering use of medications for AUD in pregnancy. Thus, we sought to estimate the proportion of birthing people with an alcohol-related diagnosis who received a prescription for medication related to AUD treatment.

Methods

Data were from Meritive MarketScan, a national private insurance claims database. The study cohort included birthing people aged 25–50 who gave birth to a singleton in the United States between 2006 and 2019 and were matched with an infant. Variables included an alcohol-related diagnosis within a year of birth and receiving a prescription for a medication related to AUD treatment. We calculated proportions with alcohol-related diagnoses who received any AUD medication and each medication type.

Results

Of 1,432,979 birthing person-infant dyads, 2517 (0.18%) had an alcohol-related diagnosis. Of those with an alcohol-related diagnosis, 8.70% (n = 219) received any medication. The most common was gabapentin (4.69%, n = 118), with benzodiazepines for withdrawal as the second most common (2.19%, n = 55). Approximately 2% received naltrexone (1.91%, n = 48) and/or disulfiram (1.39%, n = 35); 0.56% (n = 14) received acamprosate. No one with an alcohol-related diagnosis received phenobarbital. Almost all medications were received postpartum.

Conclusions

Very few pregnant/postpartum people with alcohol-related diagnoses are prescribed medications related to AUD treatment. Research is needed to examine whether benefits of these medications during pregnancy outweigh harms.

### Symptom-triggered alcohol withdrawal management delivered over telemedicine [^111SxPPp]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

There are important limitations to our study. Firstly, there was no comparator group; therefore, it is unclear how telemedicine-based symptom-triggered alcohol withdrawal management compares to in-person symptom-triggered alcohol withdrawal management. A randomized controlled trial comparing these interventions would be informative to determine whether the treatments are equivalent or whether one intervention is superior to the other. However, it is important to note that many people do not have immediate access to in-person symptom-triggered withdrawal management; therefore, this intervention could still play an important role in enhancing access to care even were it to prove inferior. It should be noted that the studies showing superiority of symptom-triggered versus nonmonitored withdrawal management approaches were conducted in monitored settings (i.e. inpatient or partial hospitalization settings) rather than outpatient settings. It will be important to assess how our protocol compares to other at-home approaches. This includes unmonitored fixed-dose approaches as well as approaches that use self-reported withdrawal severity to guide treatment, which have been found to have similar outcomes to fixed-dose approaches. Our approach also did not use at-home vital sign monitoring to guide treatment, which could have potentially provided additional information about withdrawal severity but may have been more burdensome for participants. Secondly, our intervention only tested the use of diazepam, which is a benzodiazepine that generates metabolites with long half-lives. We selected this medication as it is less likely to lead to rebound withdrawal symptoms than benzodiazepines with a shorter half-life and is safer than other sedatives like phenobarbital. However, guidelines recommend considering lorazepam and oxazepam for individuals with significant liver diseaseand it is unclear from our study whether these medications would be equally effective or safe for telemedicine-delivered symptom-triggered withdrawal management. Thirdly, although our patients consumed alcohol at relatively high levels (10.4 standard drinks per day for males, 6.3 standard drinks per day for females on average), some individuals consume much higher levels of alcohol. These individuals are at increased risk of both withdrawal seizuresand delirium tremens. We excluded patients with a history of seizures, hallucinosis, and delirium as well as patients with severe liver disease or current opioid or sedative use disorder from our study. Telemedicine-based medical withdrawal management should not be used for patients with a history of these conditions without further study.

Key takeaways — risk–benefit assessment and special populations: For adult patients who have been taking BZDs regularly and may be at risk of physical dependence, clinicians should base recommendations on ongoing assessment of the risks and benefits of continued BZD use and of tapering/discontinuation, and tapering is generally indicated when the risks of continuing medication outweigh the benefits; clinicians should conduct more frequent risk–benefit assessments for patients concomitantly taking opioid medication, patients who have an SUD, and those with additional risk factors such as obstructive sleep apnea or bipolar spectrum disorder; clinicians should use caution if utilizing urine drug screen immunoassays for BZDs due to known limitations; and clinicians should taper BZDs in most older adults (i.e., ≥ 65 years) unless there are compelling reasons for continuation.

5.1	Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including XANAX, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe XANAX concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of XANAX than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking XANAX, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response.

Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when XANAX is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.2	Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

The use of benzodiazepines, including XANAX, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].

Before prescribing XANAX and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of XANAX, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of XANAX along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.

### Evaluation of drinking risk levels as outcomes in alcohol pharmacotherapy trials: a secondary analysis of 3 randomized clinical trials [^115XYAym]. JAMA Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Importance

The US Food and Drug Administration recognizes total abstinence and no heavy drinking days as outcomes for pivotal pharmacotherapy trials for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Many patients have difficulty achieving these outcomes, which can discourage seeking treatment and has slowed the development of medications that affect alcohol use.

Objective

To compare 2 drinking-reduction outcomes with total abstinence and no heavy drinking outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Data were obtained from 3 multisite, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of medications for treating alcohol dependence (naltrexone, varenicline, and topiramate) in adults with DSM-IV-categorized alcohol dependence.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Within each trial, the percentage of participants in active and placebo conditions who met responder definitions of abstinence, no heavy drinking days, a WHO 1-level reduction, and a WHO 2-level reduction was computed by month with corresponding effect sizes (Cohen h).

Results

Across the 3 trials (N = 1169; mean [SD] age, 45 [10] years; 824 [70.5%] men), the percentage of participants classified as responders during the last 4 weeks of treatment was lowest for abstinence (naltrexone, 34.7% [100 of 288]; varenicline, 7.3% [7 of 96]; topiramate, 11.7% [21 of 179]) followed by no heavy drinking days (naltrexone, 51.0% [147 of 288]; varenicline, 24.0% [23 of 96]; topiramate, 20.7% [37 of 179]), WHO 2-level reduction (naltrexone, 75.0% [216 of 288]; varenicline, 55.2% [53 of 96]; topiramate, 44.7% [80 of 179]), and WHO 1-level reduction (naltrexone, 83.3% [240 of 288]; varenicline, 69.8 [67 of 96]; topiramate, 54.7% [98 of 179]) outcomes. Standardized treatment effects observed for the WHO 2-level reduction outcomes (naltrexone, Cohen h = 0.214 [95% CI, 0.053–0.375]; varenicline, 0.273 [95% CI, -0.006 to 0.553]; topiramate, 0.230 [95% CI, 0.024–0.435]) and WHO 1-level reduction (naltrexone, Cohen h = 0.116 [95% CI, -0.046 to 0.277]; varenicline, 0.338 [95% CI, 0.058–0.617]; topiramate, 0.014 [95% CI, -0.192 to 0.219]) were comparable with those obtained using abstinence (naltrexone, Cohen h = 0.142 [95% CI, -0.020 to 0.303]; varenicline, 0.146 [95% CI, -0.133 to 0.426]; topiramate, 0.369 [95% CI, 0.163–0.574]) and no heavy drinking days (naltrexone, Cohen h = 0.140 [95% CI, -0.021 to 0.302]; varenicline, 0.232 [95% CI, -0.048 to 0.511]; topiramate, 0.207 [95% CI, 0.002–0.413]).

Conclusions and Relevance

WHO drinking risk level reductions appear to be worthwhile indicators of treatment outcome in AUD pharmacotherapy trials. These outcomes may align with drinking reduction goals of many patients and capture clinically meaningful improvements experienced by more patients than either abstinence or no heavy drinking days.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^111GFJKH]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal — patients who take opioids: Patients who are on chronic opioid medication (opioid agonist therapy for opioid use disorder or pain) should be monitored closely when benzodiazepines are prescribed, due to the increased risk of respiratory depression, and patients taking sedative-hypnotic medications exhibit tolerance to benzodiazepines and should be monitored closely for appropriate dose. For patients with concomitant alcohol withdrawal and opioid use disorder, stabilize opioid use disorder (e.g., with methadone or buprenorphine) concomitantly with treating alcohol withdrawal. Benzodiazepines may be given but should be used with caution and only in facilities with close monitoring, and patients receiving opioid agonist therapy with concomitant alcohol withdrawal should be admitted and managed in a hospital setting or other setting with the resources to manage increased risk of respiratory depression and other complications. Patients who are using sedative-hypnotic medication are at higher risk of major complications and may exhibit tolerance to benzodiazepines and require dose adjustment, and these patients should be monitored closely.

### Midazolam (Nayzilam) [^114UnzsC]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

9.1 Controlled Substance

NAYZILAM contains midazolam, a Schedule IV controlled substance.

9.2 Abuse

NAYZILAM is a benzodiazepine and a CNS depressant with a potential for abuse and addiction. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Even taking benzodiazepines as prescribed may put patients at risk for abuse and misuse of their medication. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines may lead to addiction.

Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death. Benzodiazepines are often sought by individuals who abuse drugs and other substances, and by individuals with addictive disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^114pu3vn]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

FINAL THOUGHTS

Many of the topics discussed in this Guideline lacked controlled studies. Our systematic review found no trials comparing BZD tapering strategies or other important aspects of managing patients who are taking prescribed BZDs and likely to have developed physical dependence. Further research into best practices for BZD tapering strategies that support patient safety and optimal outcomes is urgently needed.

- the danger of drug-drug interactions between benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants (impairment and respiratory depression)

- the risks associated with combining alcohol and benzodiazepines and importance of abstinence from alcohol

- the risks associated with driving or use of heavy machinery for the first few days of benzodiazepine administration

- instructions to reduce the benzodiazepine dose if drowsiness occurs.

Background

BZDs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to manage a wide range of conditions, including acute conditions (e.g. panic and acute anxiety, alcohol withdrawal, seizures) and common chronic conditions (e.g. anxiety disorders, primary insomnia). These medications are commonly prescribed and represent important therapeutic tools; however, data on long-term safety and efficacy are limited. BZD use is associated with an increased risk of adverse events including falls, motor vehicle accidents, cognitive impairment, delirium, overdose, and death, particularly when BZDs are used in combination with CNS depressants such as alcohol or opioids. –

Since 2000, fatal overdoses involving BZDs have increased nearly tenfold, often involving the combination of opioids and BZDs. Although prescribing rates for BZDs have fallen since the most recent peak in 2013, in the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 9.1% of US adults reported use of BZDs in the past year, with more than 15% of those reporting BZD misuse. Between 1996 and 2013, the number of adults filling BZD prescriptions increased from 4.1 to 5.6%, while the total quantity of BZD prescriptions filled more than tripled, from 1.1 to 3.6 kg lorazepam equivalents per 100,000 adults. Over this time, emergency department (ED) visits related to BZDs also tripled, and BZD-related overdose deaths quadrupled. Since 2013, however, BZD prescriptions dispensed from outpatient and mail-order pharmacies have fallen by approximately 33%.

### Medications for alcohol use disorder… [^117R7DH4]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Naltrexone. Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, reduces alcohol consumption in patients with AUD, and is more successful in those who are abstinent before starting the medication. 8 The opioid receptor system mediates the pleasurable effects of alcohol. Alcohol ingestion stimulates endogenous opioid release and increases dopamine transmission. Naltrexone blocks these effects, reducing euphoria and cravings. 20 Naltrexone is available in oral and injectable long-acting formulations. Naltrexone is well tolerated and is not habit-forming. Because it is metabolized by the liver, hepatotoxicity is possible, although uncommon. Patients with AUD may have liver dysfunction; therefore, caution is warranted. Naltrexone can precipitate severe opioid withdrawal in patients who are opioid-dependent, so these agents should not be used together, and opioids should not be used for at least seven days before starting naltrexone.

12, 27, 28 An open-label study compared topiramate plus psychotherapy with psychotherapy alone in hospitalized patients after alcohol withdrawal treatment. The topiramate group had lower rates of depression and anxiety and a lower relapse rate after four months. 29 However, a randomized trial of 106 patients did not show a difference in alcohol consumption between topiramate therapy and placebo. 30 Another randomized trial found that topiramate increased abstinence rates in patients with a specific genetic polymorphism. 31 Such targeted medication use for specific populations warrants further study. 35 Antidepressants. Antidepressants are not effective in decreasing alcohol use in persons without coexisting mental health disorders. 36 Antidepressants can be helpful in some instances, however, because patients with AUD often have coexisting mental health disorders.

A trial randomized 170 patients with alcohol dependence and depression to 14 weeks of cognitive behavior therapy plus sertraline, naltrexone, both medications, or double placebo. Ondansetron. Ondansetron may decrease alcohol consumption in patients with AUD. In three studies, ondansetron combined with cognitive behavior therapy decreased alcohol consumption and cravings and increased abstinence in young adults with early AUD. 39–41 In another trial, a higher dosage of ondansetron combined with cognitive behavior therapy decreased depression, anxiety, and hostility.

### Study details | Baclofen for treating anxiety and alcoholism… [^111sfKxn]. ClinicalTrials (2012). Low credibility.

Baclofen for Treating Anxiety and AlcoholismClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Background:

- Baclofen is a drug used to control muscle stiffness in people with neurological diseases. Some studies suggest that baclofen may reduce alcohol craving and use. It helps to reduce anxiety in alcoholics, which in turn can help to reduce cravings. Researchers want to see if baclofen can be a safe and effective treatment for alcoholics who have high anxiety levels.
- A final follow-up visit will be required 1 week after the overnight study visit. Participants will receive information about other alcohol abuse treatment programs. Objective: The selective GABAB receptor agonist baclofen has been identified as a possible medication able to reduce alcohol craving and intake in alcohol dependent individuals. In keeping with several preclinical studies, most of the clinical studies have demonstrated baclofen s effects in reducing alcohol craving and intake and promoting alcohol abstinence.

However, one trial with alcoholics with a low severity of dependence found a robust treatment effect, but no differences between baclofen and placebo. The inconsistency of baclofen s effects on alcohol drinking among previous treatment trials suggests that different AD individuals may respond differently to baclofen. Baclofen has been demonstrated to consistently reduce anxiety in alcoholic patients, and analyses of positive vs. null findings with baclofen suggest that alcoholic patients with higher levels of anxiety at baseline may represent a sub-population particularly responsive to baclofen treatment. Therefore, this study will systematically test, for the first time, the specific role of baclofen on alcohol-related outcomes in alcoholic individuals with high anxiety levels. Furthermore, the biobehavioral mechanisms by which baclofen reduces drinking are not well characterized.

A human laboratory pilot study conducted at Brown University with non-treatment seeking alcohol-dependent individuals suggests that baclofen reduces alcohol consumption both in the naturalistic environment as well as in a well-controlled lab setting and that this could be mediated by baclofen s ability to alter alcohol-related biphasic effects. Outcome measures: Alcohol drinking during the ASA will be measured as the primary outcome. Secondary objectives include baclofen s effects on alcohol cue-induced responses, on the subjective effects of alcohol and on anxiety levels. We will also explore the role of possible moderators of baclofen s effects, namely family history of alcoholism, early vs. later onset of alcoholism, pre-treatment anxiety levels and genetic moderators.
