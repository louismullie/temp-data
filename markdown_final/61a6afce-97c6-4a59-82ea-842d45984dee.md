## Question

A patient with newly diagnosed Ulcerative Colitis
What are guidelines directed therapy to proceed with it

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about guideline-directed therapy for a patient with newly diagnosed ulcerative colitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and establishing baseline disease extent and severity. Then, I should stratify risk and determine whether the presentation is mild-to-moderate versus moderate-to-severe. Next, I will align induction strategies to severity, followed by maintenance planning and treat-to-target monitoring. After that, I need to address special scenarios like acute severe UC, extraintestinal manifestations, and pregnancy considerations. Finally, I will integrate patient-specific factors, access and payer issues, and summarize a practical algorithm with timelines and checkpoints, making sure I verify each step against current ACG, AGA, ECCO, and BSG guidance as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and baseline assessment because I need to ensure we are truly dealing with UC and not an infectious colitis or other mimics. Stool testing for C. difficile is recommended in suspected UC, and serologic antibody panels should not be used to diagnose or prognosticate UC, so I should avoid those pitfalls and rely on endoscopy with histology to define extent and activity, using Mayo endoscopic subscores to standardize severity and plan therapy accordingly [^112tiRnr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severity. I should classify disease extent as proctitis, left-sided, or extensive and grade activity as mild, moderate, or severe using clinical features and endoscopy, since this classification directly drives therapy selection and prognosis, and I should also screen for high-risk features such as age under 40, extensive disease, deep ulcers, elevated CRP, anemia, and extraintestinal manifestations that portend a more aggressive course and may justify earlier advanced therapy [^113FB1Tu] [^1128HkQw].

> Next, I should review prognostic stratification because guidelines emphasize that prognosis should guide therapy as much as current activity. Patients with moderate-to-severe activity or high-risk features warrant therapies with proven efficacy in trials and real-world cohorts, and I should remember that patients often respond better to their first advanced therapy than after multiple failures, so early appropriate escalation can be advantageous when risk is high [^113FB1Tu] [^1137xL3P].

> For mild-to-moderate disease, let me think about 5-ASA as first-line induction and maintenance. Oral mesalamine at 2.0–2.4 g/day is effective and once-daily dosing is comparable to divided dosing, while combined oral plus rectal therapy improves induction rates, especially in distal disease, and rectal mesalamine is preferred for proctitis, with rectal corticosteroids as an alternative if mesalamine is not tolerated or insufficient, and I should reassess response within about 8 weeks to decide on escalation [^114qQfBA] [^116Sz9xS] [^114gomj3].

> Wait, I should verify steroid strategy in this stratum. Systemic corticosteroids are not for maintenance, so if I use oral prednisone or budesonide MMX for induction, I must plan a steroid-sparing maintenance exit strategy and avoid repeated steroid bursts because of dependency risks and inferior long-term outcomes [^112nmbSC] [^1128HkQw] [^113nAQJ7].

> Now, for moderate-to-severe disease, I need to ensure I do not delay effective therapy. Guidelines support early advanced therapy with or without immunomodulators rather than step-up after 5-ASA failure, and infliximab is often preferred among anti-TNFs, with vedolizumab or anti-IL-23 strategies reasonable when infection risk or extraintestinal features favor them, and combination therapy with infliximab plus a thiopurine can improve efficacy at induction in appropriate candidates [^114BBWTb] [^1137xL3P] [^116p1MbG].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said adalimumab is preferred for maintenance after induction. Hold on, I should verify comparative data because ACG suggests vedolizumab over adalimumab for induction and maintenance in moderate-to-severe UC, and BSG 2025 goes further to recommend avoiding adalimumab for maintenance, so I should correct that and position vedolizumab, ustekinumab, tofacitinib, or JAK inhibition such as upadacitinib as appropriate options based on patient profile and prior exposure [^113VuJyx] [^111NwEMF] [^114MrCv8].

> I will now examine maintenance planning because the induction agent generally dictates maintenance. If remission is achieved with an advanced therapy, I should continue the same agent for maintenance, and if combination therapy achieved remission, I should generally maintain the combination rather than de-escalate prematurely, while avoiding systemic corticosteroids for maintenance and considering thiopurines only selectively for corticosteroid-induced remission or when advanced therapies are not feasible [^113Ueo4a] [^112nmbSC] [^111xt2pr] [^114WG2Rw].

> Let me consider treat-to-target monitoring so I do not miss subclinical inflammation. I should aim for endoscopic improvement defined by Mayo endoscopic score 0 or 1, use fecal calprotectin to track response and detect relapse, and reassess objectively at 6–12 weeks after induction, recognizing that symptoms alone can be discordant with mucosal healing and that achieving both clinical and endoscopic remission reduces relapse, hospitalization, and colectomy over time [^113p4Y7H] [^111rGK88] [^117CJA5v].

> But wait, what if the patient presents with acute severe UC; I should hospitalize, obtain stool studies including C. difficile, and start IV methylprednisolone 40–60 mg daily with close monitoring, and if there is no improvement in 3–5 days, I should pivot to rescue therapy with infliximab or cyclosporine, involve surgery early in the conversation, and avoid routine antibiotics in the absence of infection, while planning maintenance with vedolizumab or thiopurines if remission is achieved with cyclosporine [^1142k52w] [^116C6zk4] [^116VevPQ].

> I need to check extraintestinal manifestations because they can steer therapy. Concomitant inflammatory arthritis may respond better to anti-TNF or JAK inhibitors, and inflammatory skin disease may favor IL-23 pathways, so aligning mechanism with involved organ systems can improve both intestinal and extraintestinal outcomes [^111NdPeT] [^111rGK88].

> Hold on, I should verify pregnancy and future family planning considerations. While this ACG update does not detail pregnancy-specific management, it notes this will be addressed in a forthcoming consensus, so in the interim I should avoid teratogenic agents such as methotrexate and coordinate with maternal-fetal medicine when selecting advanced therapies and timing of conception, favoring agents with favorable reproductive safety profiles when possible [^1117JQCQ].

> Next, I should review patient-specific factors that modify risk-benefit. Older age, malignancy risk, and infection risk may favor gut-selective options like vedolizumab or anti-IL-23s over systemic immunosuppression, whereas a young patient with high inflammatory burden and deep ulcers may benefit from early anti-TNF combination therapy, and I should incorporate shared decision-making and patient preferences throughout [^111NdPeT] [^1137xL3P].

> I should double-check access and payer constraints because step-therapy mandates can delay appropriate care. ACG emphasizes that patients should have access to all medical options and that step-therapy requirements should not interfere with clinician-patient decisions, and biosimilars can be considered equivalent to originators to facilitate access and cost-effective care [^111NdPeT] [^115qYxFd].

> Let me reconsider 5-ASA discontinuation after escalation. In patients who failed 5-ASA and escalated to advanced therapy, stopping 5-ASA is generally reasonable, though a subset with residual proctitis may benefit from continued rectal mesalamine, and I should not assume ongoing oral 5-ASA adds benefit after adequate response to advanced therapy [^112HXqed] [^111LmBH4].

> I should confirm monitoring cadence and loss-of-response strategy. Reassess at 6–12 weeks after induction, then every 3–6 months in maintenance with symptoms, biomarkers, and periodic endoscopic assessment as needed, and if a patient on anti-TNF loses response, check trough and anti-drug antibodies to distinguish underexposure from immunogenicity before switching mechanisms or agents [^111rGK88] [^1147Viaq].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical algorithm to ensure nothing is missed; confirm UC with endoscopy and histology and exclude C. difficile, classify extent and severity and screen for high-risk features, treat mild-to-moderate disease with optimized 5-ASA and rectal therapy and reassess at 8 weeks, treat moderate-to-severe disease with early advanced therapy such as infliximab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, tofacitinib, or upadacitinib with or without immunomodulators based on risk and comorbidities, continue the effective induction agent for maintenance with treat-to-target goals of endoscopic improvement and steroid-free remission, and escalate or switch mechanisms promptly if targets are not met, engaging surgery early when medical therapy fails or severe colitis is refractory [^113FB1Tu] [^114BBWTb] [^1133EkY5] [^113Ueo4a].

For newly diagnosed ulcerative colitis, **start with 5-ASA** (oral ± rectal) for induction and maintenance in mild disease [^116Sz9xS], escalating to systemic corticosteroids if needed [^116Sz9xS]. For moderate–severe disease, **initiate advanced therapy early** (anti-TNF, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, or JAK inhibitor) [^114BBWTb] with or without an immunomodulator [^114BBWTb], and avoid thiopurine or methotrexate monotherapy [^111qEnHx]. Treat-to-target with endoscopic improvement (Mayo 0–1) [^113p4Y7H] and use fecal calprotectin to monitor response [^113p4Y7H]; reassess at 6–12 weeks [^111rGK88] and adjust therapy to achieve corticosteroid-free remission [^1133EkY5]. Individualize choices by disease extent, severity, comorbidities, and patient preferences, and coordinate care with gastroenterology [^113FB1Tu].

---

## Initial assessment and stratification

Accurate assessment of disease extent and severity is essential to guide therapy; **classify disease** as mild, moderate, or severe using clinical symptoms, endoscopic findings, and biomarkers (CRP, fecal calprotectin) [^112tiRnr]. Determine **extent** — proctitis, left-sided, or extensive (pancolitis) — via colonoscopy with biopsies [^113FB1Tu].

---

## Induction therapy

### Mild-to-moderate disease

- **5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA)**: First-line therapy for induction and maintenance [^116Sz9xS]; oral ± rectal therapy is effective [^116Sz9xS].

- **Rectal therapy**: Enemas or suppositories for distal disease; combine with oral 5-ASA for better outcomes [^116Sz9xS].

- **Corticosteroids**: Use if 5-ASA fails; rectal steroids for distal disease, oral prednisone for more extensive disease [^116Sz9xS].

---

### Moderate-to-severe disease

- **Advanced therapies**: Early use of anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab), vedolizumab, ustekinumab, or JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, upadacitinib) is recommended [^114BBWTb] [^114j9hV6].

- **Combination therapy**: Infliximab plus immunomodulator (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate) improves efficacy [^116p1MbG] [^114vYMTn].

- **Corticosteroids**: Short-term use for rapid control; not for maintenance [^111qCkN8].

---

## Maintenance therapy

- **5-ASA**: Maintain remission in mild disease; oral ≥ 1.5 g/day for left-sided or extensive disease [^115FXMbR].

- **Advanced therapies**: Continue the agent that induced remission (anti-TNF, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, JAK inhibitor) [^114qHe3L] [^116N263f] [^114ZWKCn].

- **Thiopurines**: Consider for maintenance after corticosteroid-induced remission; avoid monotherapy in moderate–severe disease [^111xt2pr] [^111qEnHx].

---

## Treat-to-target strategy

Treat-to-target aims for **endoscopic improvement** (Mayo 0–1) to sustain steroid-free remission and reduce hospitalization and colectomy [^113p4Y7H] [^115FP6i9]. Fecal calprotectin is recommended to **monitor response and detect relapse** [^11424nNb]. Reassess at **6–12 weeks** after induction and adjust therapy to achieve remission [^111rGK88].

---

## Special considerations

- **Acute severe UC**: Hospitalize, give IV corticosteroids, and escalate to infliximab or cyclosporine if no improvement in 3–5 days [^1142k52w].

- **Extraintestinal manifestations**: Tailor therapy to concurrent arthritis or skin involvement [^111NdPeT].

- **Pregnancy**: Prefer 5-ASA; avoid methotrexate and thalidomide.

---

## Patient education and shared decision-making

Patient education should explain the **chronic nature of UC**, treatment goals, and potential adverse effects [^1133EkY5]. Shared decision-making should incorporate **patient preferences, comorbidities, and lifestyle** into treatment choices [^113Ueo4a].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up should track **symptoms, biomarkers, and endoscopic activity** [^117CJA5v]. Drug safety monitoring includes periodic **CBC, liver function tests, and infection screening** [^notfound]. Therapeutic drug monitoring can guide **anti-TNF dosing and manage loss of response** [^1147Viaq].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Disease severity** | **Induction therapy** | **Maintenance therapy** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild-to-moderate | 5-ASA (oral ± rectal); corticosteroids if refractory | 5-ASA |
| Moderate-to-severe | Anti-TNF ± immunomodulator; vedolizumab; ustekinumab; JAK inhibitor | Same agent that induced remission; thiopurines if steroid-induced remission |

---

Guideline-directed therapy for newly diagnosed UC emphasizes **early, individualized treatment** aligned with disease severity and patient factors, with treat-to-target monitoring to achieve and maintain corticosteroid-free remission [^112ijUva].

Key concept statements for mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis (UC) emphasize that patients with a number of prognostic factors associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or surgery should be treated with therapies for moderate-to-severe disease. Patients with mildly to moderately active UC should be reassessed to determine response to induction therapy within 8 weeks. There is not sufficient evidence for routine use of probiotics, prebiotics, or other alternative therapies as primary induction therapy for patients with mildly to moderately active UC, and there is not sufficient evidence of an optimal approach to fecal microbial transfer as a primary induction treatment. Patients with previously mildly to moderately active UC who have achieved remission should be treated with maintenance therapy with demonstrated efficacy in prevention of relapse, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of a probiotic as primary or adjunctive maintenance therapy.

### A Treat-to-target update in ulcerative colitis: a systematic review [^114MR9qx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVES:

In 2015, the Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (STRIDE) program proposed shifting the therapeutic focus on ulcerative colitis (UC) toward altering the natural history of the disease course by regularly monitoring objective measurements of disease activity and tailoring treatment accordingly. The therapeutic paradigm shift was well received in the research community and is often cited. However, new evidence on optimal UC treatment targets continues to accumulate since the time of the STRIDE guidelines. This systematic review summarizes the evidence accrued since the STRIDE UC recommendations, discusses the barriers for adoption of treat-to-target approaches in clinical practice in UC, and suggests directions for future research.

METHODS:

We systematically reviewed MEDLINE for studies from the time of the STRIDE systematic review up to March 31, 2018, that assessed the potential treatment targets identified by the STRIDE recommendations.

RESULTS:

Each potential treatment target literature search returned > 200 articles, which were then reviewed by 2 independent investigators for relevant studies. Selected studies of clinical factors, patient-reported outcomes, endoscopy, histology, imaging, and biomarkers and implications on treatment targets are summarized.

CONCLUSIONS:

It appears that the relative weight given to different therapeutic targets in the development and improvement of UC treatments could be optimized, with an increased emphasis on endoscopic and histological targets over clinical or symptomatic targets. For this evolution to occur, however, new research has to demonstrate that the treat-to-target approach will deliver on the promise of better long-term outcomes compared with current approaches.

### Use of biologics and small molecule drugs for the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: IG-IBD clinical guidelines based on the GRADE methodology [^116oGcBw]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

The management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis has undergone significant changes over the past 15 years due to the regulatory approval of several new drugs. In particular, following the approval of the first biological, i.e. infliximab, a number of further biological drugs, such as adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab and ustekinumab, and small molecules, such as tofacitinib, have been approved, thus enriching the therapeutic armamentarium for ulcerative colitis. Choice of therapy must take into consideration not only the need to induce and maintain disease remission according to the patient's profile, but also age, co-morbidities, and prior treatments. To guide these decisions, the Italian Group for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease has developed clinical guidelines that supersede its earlier document from 2011. These new guidelines were developed following the GRADE methodology for rating the quality of the evidence and for determining the strength of the recommendations. This article presents the methodology and results, in the form of 20 statements with commentary on the use of the five biologics and tofacitinib for managing the intestinal manifestations of active ulcerative colitis and for maintaining remission. A separate technical review reports the analyses of the evidence upon which the present recommendations are based.

### Ulcerative colitis care pathway [^112uueFa]. Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis care pathway — risk stratification and remission targets emphasize that the standard assessment of ulcerative colitis (UC) activity at a single time point is insufficient and that disease risk is important; patients with mild or moderate symptoms but deep ulcers on colonoscopy should receive immunomodulatory and/or biologic therapy, treatment success is defined as steroid-free clinical remission, and clinical remission remains the primary therapeutic goal.

---

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^1133EkY5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — goals for managing patients — UC is a chronic condition for which therapy is required to induce and maintain remission; therapeutic decisions should be categorized into those for (i) induction and (ii) maintenance, and strategies for management of UC should reflect the patient's and provider's goals and recognize the chronic nature of the disease. Symptomatic remission relates to improvement in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) while endoscopic mucosal healing is defined as restoration of intact mucosa without friability; deep remission implies both symptomatic and endoscopic remission and should be assessed as a preferred goal of management, and corticosteroid-free remission is defined based on symptomatic and endoscopic response during a steroid-free period of time (usually more than 12 wk). Initial treatment of UC should focus on restoration of normal bowel frequency and control of the primary symptoms of bleeding and bowel urgency; an endoscopically healed mucosa is associated with sustained remission and reduced risk of colectomy. Histologic remission is associated with some improved clinical outcomes but has not yet been validated prospectively as a preferred target for treatment, and control of mucosal inflammation may reduce dysplasia risk. Given the chronic nature of UC and the therapies for UC, monitoring for disease-related and drug-related complications is important, routine visits are recommended to monitor for relapse and address health maintenance needs, and patients with UC should be screened for coexistent anxiety and depressive disorders with resources provided when identified.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis [^111b3wvi]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

AGA living clinical practice guideline — PICO questions for adult outpatients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis outline comparisons of pharmacologic strategies and key outcomes. Immunomodulator monotherapy options listed are thiopurines (azathioprine, mercaptopurine) and methotrexate (oral or SC). For tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists, combination therapy with a TNF antagonist and an immunomodulator (thiopurines or methotrexate) is assessed with outcomes including induction of clinical remission and maintenance of clinical remission. For non-TNF biologics, combination therapy with a non-TNF antagonist biologic and an immunomodulator (thiopurines or methotrexate) is compared with non-TNF antagonist biologic monotherapy and immunomodulator monotherapy (thiopurines or methotrexate), with outcomes of induction of clinical remission and maintenance of clinical remission. Among patients in steroid-free remission on combination therapy, discontinuation of an immunomodulator or discontinuation of a biologic is contrasted with continuation of combination therapy, focusing on prevention of relapse. Treatment strategies are also contrasted as top-down therapy (upfront use of advanced therapies and/or immunomodulator therapy; upfront use of biologic-based combination therapy) versus step therapy (acceleration to advanced therapy only after failure of 5-ASA; initial use of immunomodulator or advanced therapy).

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^1137xL3P]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) — therapy positioning for moderately to severely active disease emphasizes access and selection principles: "There are no validated therapeutic biomarkers or companion diagnostic tests to enhance selection or predict response to treatment for the patient with active UC". Patients "should have available all medical options" and step-therapy requirements "should not come between the patient and their health care team" when making decisions. Patients with moderate to severe UC "have higher rates of response and remission with their first therapies than after failure of one or more other advanced therapies", and distinguishing between "primary nonresponse and secondary nonresponse is important" to select the next option. "Post hoc subgroup analyses and network meta-analyses provide hypothesis-generating data but are not sufficient to stratify therapies for individual patients". "Infliximab is the preferred anti-TNF therapy for patients with moderately to severely active UC". For those at higher infectious risk, some "may benefit from vedolizumab or an anti-IL-23 strategy over more systemically immunosuppressive medical options". Therapy selection "may be chosen based on extra-intestinal manifestations", including joints or skin, when therapies have efficacy in both UC and the extraintestinal organ.

Positioning considerations — moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC): For patients who are responders to anti–tumor necrosis factor (anti‑TNF) therapy and are losing response, we suggest measuring serum drug levels and antidrug antibodies (if there is not sufficient drug present) to assess reason for loss of response (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). For overall agent selection, in patients with moderately to severely active UC, we recommend vedolizumab as compared with adalimumab for the induction and maintenance of remission (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).

Ulcerative colitis in adults — key concept statements indicate that there are no validated therapeutic biomarkers or companion diagnostic tests to enhance selection or predict response to treatment for the patient with active ulcerative colitis (UC); patients with UC should have available all medical options as recommended by their doctor and healthcare team, and third-party payers and requirements for step therapy should not come between the patient and their healthcare team in making decisions about treatment for UC; patients with moderately to severely active UC have higher rates of response and remission with their first therapies than after failure of one or more other advanced therapies; given the expanding number of therapies per mechanistic class, a distinction between primary nonresponse and secondary nonresponse is important to select the next therapeutic option; post hoc subgroup analyses and network meta-analyses provide hypothesis-generating data but are not sufficient to stratify therapies for individual patients; infliximab is the preferred anti-TNF therapy for patients with moderately to severely active UC; some patients with moderately to severely active UC who are at higher risk for infectious complications may benefit from vedolizumab or an anti-IL-23 strategy over more systemically immunosuppressed medical options; and initial and subsequent therapies for moderately to severely active UC may be chosen based on extraintestinal manifestations, including the involvement of joints or skin, in which therapies having efficacy for both UC and the extraintestinal organ is known.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the medical management of nonhospitalized ulcerative colitis: the toronto consensus [^112XwXkq]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The medical management of ulcerative colitis (UC) has improved through the development of new therapies and novel approaches that optimize existing drugs. Previous Canadian consensus guidelines addressed the management of severe UC in the hospitalized patient. We now present consensus guidelines for the treatment of ambulatory patients with mild to severe active UC.

Methods

A systematic literature search identified studies on the management of UC. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Statements were developed through an iterative online platform and then finalized and voted on by a working group of specialists.

Results

The participants concluded that the goal of therapy is complete remission, defined as both symptomatic and endoscopic remission without corticosteroid therapy. The consensus includes 34 statements focused on 5 main drug classes: 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA), corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapies, and other therapies. Oral and rectal 5-ASA are recommended first-line therapy for mild to moderate UC, with corticosteroid therapy for those who fail to achieve remission. Patients with moderate to severe UC should undergo a course of oral corticosteroid therapy, with transition to 5-ASA, thiopurine, anti-TNF (with or without thiopurine or methotrexate), or vedolizumab maintenance therapy in those who successfully achieve symptomatic remission. For patients with corticosteroid-resistant/dependent UC, anti-TNF or vedolizumab therapy is recommended. Timely assessments of response and remission are critical to ensuring optimal outcomes.

Conclusions

Optimal management of UC requires careful patient assessment, evidence-based use of existing therapies, and thorough assessment to define treatment success.

Guideline scope and effect metrics — management of mild–moderate ulcerative colitis centers on 5-ASA–based therapies with defined interpretation of relative risk. Therapeutic efficacy and safety are similar with different 5-ASA formulations, and comparability of the different commercial formulations of mesalamine at equivalent doses was assumed. The guideline addresses the medical management of patients with mild–moderate UC, focusing on oral and topical 5-ASA medications, rectal corticosteroids, and oral budesonide, and it does not present separate recommendations for induction and maintenance of remission. It notes that some patients will not respond adequately and may need to escalate therapy to systemic corticosteroids, immunomodulators, or biologic therapies, and that the use of biologic therapies and immunomodulators is not specifically addressed. Estimates of medication effects are presented as the risk for failure to induce or maintain remission, and a relative risk (RR) < 1 indicates the agent under evaluation is more effective than the comparison medication or placebo, whereas RR > 1 indicates it is less effective.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic and disabling disorder that may progress without appropriate disease modification. Therapeutic goals include reduced disease activity and the prevention of disease progression and complications. Disease activity and response to therapy in UC can be assessed by a range of endpoints including symptoms, endoscopic mucosal activity, histologic disease activity and biomarkers. Within the same patient, however, considerable discordance exists between these endpoints. Symptoms inherently have a degree of subjectivity and, if used alone for therapeutic decision-making, may lead to undertreatment or overtreatment of disease. Accordingly, consensus recommendations that define treatment targets in UC acknowledge that the resolution of symptoms is not a sufficient treatment target and that objective evaluation of inflammation of the mucosa by endoscopy is necessary. However, it should be recognised that this recommendation is based on expert guidance in the absence of any controlled data to confirm that endoscopic remission is superior to the resolution of symptoms as a treatment target. Nevertheless, the achievement of endoscopic remission is associated with lower rates of relapse, hospitalisation, colectomy and cancer. Furthermore, in newly diagnosed patients with UC at up to 5 years of follow-up, the achievement of both clinical (symptomatic) and endoscopic remission is associated with reduced rates of relapse, hospitalisation and colectomy, relative to the achievement of symptom resolution alone.

### Raising the bar in ulcerative colitis management [^112ijUva]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by growing incidence and prevalence around the world in the last few decades. The range of available existing treatment and strategies for its management is being implemented. Given the introduction of newly developed molecules and the lack of specific guidelines, drug positioning may represent a tough clinical challenge. UC management is mostly medical, and it has been shifting toward a more personalized approach with the aim to create a tailored strategy depending on the patient's profile. A treat-to target strategy seems to be the best approach to reach disease control as it allows to carry out therapeutic choices based on objective and specific parameters: histological, ultrasonographic, and molecular targets may add to the already used clinical, endoscopic, and biochemical targets. In addition, dual-targeted therapy has emerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy for patients not achieving remission. This review aims to provide an overview of the available strategies to raise the bar in UC.

Moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) — upfront advanced therapy versus step-up: In adult outpatients with moderate-to-severe UC, the AGA suggests early use of advanced therapies with or without immunomodulator therapy, rather than gradual step up after failure of 5-ASAs [Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence]. Patients, particularly those with less severe disease, who place higher value on the safety of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) therapy and lower value on the efficacy and risks of adverse effects of advanced therapies and immunomodulators, may reasonably decline early use of these therapies. Since the last guideline published in 2020, no new randomized controlled trials comparing upfront advanced therapies and/or immunomodulator therapy versus step-up therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe UC were identified, and 5-ASAs are not indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe UC.

Ulcerative colitis — early biologic therapy strategy. The AGA suggests early use of biologic agents with or without immunomodulator therapy, rather than gradual step up after failure of 5-ASA (Conditional recommendation, very low quality evidence). Patients, particularly those with less severe disease, who place higher value on the safety of 5-ASA therapy, and lower value on the efficacy of biologic agents, may reasonably choose gradual step therapy with 5-ASA therapy. Evidence notes there were no studies comparing upfront biologic-based therapy or tofacitinib vs gradual step-up therapy, that 5-ASAs have not been specifically studied in moderate to severe disease activity and are limited to mild to moderate disease, and that delaying effective treatment in moderate to severe UC at high risk of colectomy may be harmful; overall evidence supporting this recommendation was rated as very low due to serious indirectness and imprecision.

The guideline states "The current evidence supports use of standard-dose mesalamine or azo-bonded 5-ASAs for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with extensive mild–moderate UC". For extensive disease, "Use of combined oral and rectal 5-ASA… may improve rates of induction of remission, as may escalation to high-dose oral with rectal 5-ASA in patients with suboptimal response to standard-dose therapy", and "Those with moderate symptoms may benefit from early use of combined oral and rectal 5-ASA". For distal disease, "Patients with proctosigmoiditis or proctitis can be treated with topical mesalamines rather than oral 5-ASA", while "Those patients with suboptimal response or intolerance to rectal mesalamine may opt to use rectal corticosteroids enemas or foams".

Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology that seems to be rising in incidence and prevalence throughout the world. These guidelines were developed to indicate the preferred approach to the management of adult patients with ulcerative colitis as established by valid scientific research and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology under the auspices of the Practice Parameters Committee. The scientific evidence for the recommendations made in these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process, assessing the quality of the evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low) and assigning a strength of recommendation based on its apparent clinical benefit (strong or conditional). In instances where the available evidence was not appropriate for a formal Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation recommendation, but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, statements were developed using expert consensus (termed key concept statements). These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable to practitioners regardless of specialty or interest and should be viewed as the preferred, but not only, approach to clinical scenarios. As opposed to standards of care, guidelines are inherently flexible, and physicians should use them as tools in choosing the best course in a specific clinical situation. These guidelines represent the state of the evidence at the time of this publication. As new evidence emerges, these guidelines will be continuously reviewed, and updates will be published as needed to assure continued validity.

### A Treat-to-target update in ulcerative colitis: a systematic review [^1173otqf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

In 2015, the Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (STRIDE) program proposed shifting the therapeutic focus on ulcerative colitis (UC) toward altering the natural history of the disease course by regularly monitoring objective measurements of disease activity and tailoring treatment accordingly. The therapeutic paradigm shift was well received in the research community and is often cited. However, new evidence on optimal UC treatment targets continues to accumulate since the time of the STRIDE guidelines. This systematic review summarizes the evidence accrued since the STRIDE UC recommendations, discusses the barriers for adoption of treat-to-target approaches in clinical practice in UC, and suggests directions for future research.

Methods

We systematically reviewed MEDLINE for studies from the time of the STRIDE systematic review up to March 31, 2018, that assessed the potential treatment targets identified by the STRIDE recommendations.

Results

Each potential treatment target literature search returned > 200 articles, which were then reviewed by 2 independent investigators for relevant studies. Selected studies of clinical factors, patient-reported outcomes, endoscopy, histology, imaging, and biomarkers and implications on treatment targets are summarized.

Conclusions

It appears that the relative weight given to different therapeutic targets in the development and improvement of UC treatments could be optimized, with an increased emphasis on endoscopic and histological targets over clinical or symptomatic targets. For this evolution to occur, however, new research has to demonstrate that the treat-to-target approach will deliver on the promise of better long-term outcomes compared with current approaches.

The treatment recommendations are based on the guidelines produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the joint guidelines produced by the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN). These guidelines provide very useful and comprehensive algorithms, which cover most common clinical eventualities.

Most patients with UC can be treated on an outpatient basis, but with hospitalisation necessary for ASC. The main aim of treatment of UC in children is to achieve maximum possible symptomatic control with minimal side effects, while allowing children to function as normally as possible. The target for treatment increasingly is also looking at intestinal healing beyond simple symptomatic control to try and reduce the risk of long-term complications and surgery. Treatments can be broadly considered as those used to induce remission (at diagnosis or for a subsequent flare), such as 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) agents, corticosteroids and biologics, and those used for long-term maintenance of remission such as 5-ASA agents, biologics and thiopurines.

Acute severe ulcerative colitis — initial inpatient management: among hospitalized patients with ASUC, after excluding alternative etiologies, intravenous methylprednisolone doses of 40–60 mg/d or equivalent are the mainstay of therapy. Routine use of adjunctive antibiotics in patients without infections is not recommended. We advocate for a 3- to 5-day trial of intravenous corticosteroids before transitioning to medical rescue therapy with cyclosporine or infliximab.

### Factors associated with poor outcomes in adults with newly diagnosed ulcerative colitis [^117Xry1C]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

It is a challenge to accurately identify patients with early stage ulcerative colitis (UC) who are at highest risk for a poor outcome and therefore might require salvage therapy. Several epidemiologic and clinical studies have analyzed factors associated with poor prognosis and increased risk for colectomy. We review prognostic factors for adults with newly diagnosed UC and discuss which patients might benefit from rapid and progressive therapy. Patients with poor prognoses tend to be young nonsmokers with high levels of inflammatory biomarkers, low levels of hemoglobin, and extensive disease, based on colonoscopy. We examine these risk factors in 2 hypothetical patients who have been newly diagnosed with UC.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^116oDuJr]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Key concept statements — ulcerative colitis in adults: 5-ASA therapy for maintenance of remission is likely not as effective in prior severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) as compared with prior moderately active UC. Budesonide MMX has not been studied for maintenance of remission of prior moderately to severely active UC. Most clinical trials and available data demonstrate a benefit of using the steroid-sparing therapy that induces remission to maintain that remission. There is insufficient evidence supporting a benefit for proactive therapeutic drug monitoring in all unselected patients with UC in remission. There is insufficient evidence to recommend assessment of serum concentrations of vedolizumab, ustekinumab, guselkumab, mirikizumab, or risankizumab. Patients with moderately to severely active UC who do not maintain remission despite optimized medical therapy should be considered for elective proctocolectomy. A patient with moderately to severely active disease (regardless of the extent of bowel involvement [including isolated proctitis]) should be treated with therapies that have demonstrated efficacy for the activity and severity of the disease.

### ACG releases updated practice guidelines for ulcerative colitis in… [^115Mg8Db]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

The American College of Gastroenterology's Practice Parameters Committee has issued updated practice guidelines for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in adults. The guidelines were generated by an expert panel's review of published evidence and outline the preferred approaches to the treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis, a chronic disease characterized by diffuse mucosal inflammation of the colon and marked by bloody diarrhea, rectal urgency, and tenesmus. Diagnosis and Management In patients with persistently bloody diarrhea, rectal urgency, or tenesmus, stool examinations, sigmoidoscopy, and biopsy should be performed to confirm the presence of colitis and to exclude the presence of infectious etiologies. When obtaining the patient's history, the clinician should inquire about factors known to exacerbate symptoms of ulcerative colitis, such as recent or past smoking cessation or use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Management Treatment for ulcerative colitis seeks to improve quality of life by inducing and maintaining remission of symptoms and inflammation. The extent of the proximal margin of inflammation, assessed by endoscopy, is either distal or extensive. Because an important criterion for treatment of ulcerative colitis is quality of life, patients' quality-of-life concerns should be elicited, particularly as they relate to function in school, at work, or in personal relationships. Management should be tailored to meet these concerns.

Clinical and endoscopic findings will allow the clinician to assess the disorder's severity, which is characterized as mild; moderate; severe; or fulminant. Patients with mild or moderate distal colitis may be treated with: oral aminosalicylate; topical mesalamine; or topical steroids. The combination of oral and topical ASAs is more effective than either alone. If patients do not respond to mesalamine enemas or suppositories, oral prednisone should be administered. Patients with mild or moderate extensive colitis should begin therapy with oral sulfasalazine in daily doses titrated up to 4 to 6 g per day, or an alternative ASA in doses up to 4. 8 g per day of the active 5-ASA moiety. Oral steroids should be reserved for patients whose disease does not respond to other therapies or for patients with troubling symptoms that demand immediate improvement, and patients who receive steroids should be observed for signs of toxicity.

### Real-world effectiveness of advanced therapies among patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in the United States [^1118ADXm]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory disease of the colon characterized by intermittent periods of disease flaring and remission. It affects approximately 900,000 people in the United States. Although the primary clinical symptom is the presence of bloody diarrhea, patients can also experience a range of additional symptoms including urgency and abdominal pain. Individuals can also have more systemic symptoms, such as fever and weight loss.

The goal of treatment in UC is to induce and maintain remission of symptoms and allow for healing of inflammation. For patients with mild to moderate disease severity, conventional treatment typically consists of oral or topical aminosalicylates (5-ASAs) or topical steroids for induction of remission and oral and/or topical 5-ASAs for maintenance. For patients who are refractory to 5-ASA therapy or topical steroids, oral steroids can be used to induce remission. However, steroids are not indicated for maintenance therapy in UC. Despite this, 22% of patients develop steroid dependency, and only half achieve steroid-free remission within a year of their first course of systemic steroids. Inability to taper off steroids is suggestive of a need to switch to advanced therapies.

Approximately half of newly diagnosed patients progress to moderate or severe disease, either continuously or intermittently. In addition, many patients with UC do not respond to conventional therapies, either failing to respond to induction therapy (primary nonresponse) or initially achieving remission but not maintaining it with long-term treatment (secondary nonresponse). For example, 42% of patients fail to achieve clinical improvement with oral 5-ASA induction treatment, and a further subset fail to maintain remission at ≥ 6 months. For patients with moderate to severe disease, advanced therapies available at the time of this study (March 31, 2017) included immunosuppressants (eg, azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine) and biologic therapies (adalimumab, infliximab, golimumab, and vedolizumab), although clinical practice guidelines have recently been updated to include tofacitinib, an oral small molecule Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of UC. In patients with primary nonresponse to one of the tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) biologic therapies, an alternative mechanism of disease control (eg, a different class of therapy) is recommended over switching to a different TNFi.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the management of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis [^1128HkQw]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

AGA clinical practice guidelines — risk features and steroid use in mild–moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) note that certain disease features, even in patients who present initially with mild–moderate disease activity, may predict an aggressive disease course; these include age younger than 40 years at diagnosis, extensive disease, severe endoscopic activity (presence of deep ulcers), extra-intestinal manifestations, and elevated inflammatory markers. Clinicians should be aware of these high-risk features to identify patients who may benefit from more aggressive initial therapy or who might need more rapid intensification of therapy if symptoms are not adequately controlled. In addition, clinicians should avoid repeated courses of corticosteroids, even in those with mild–moderate disease, and consider escalation of therapy in patients who frequently need corticosteroids for disease control.

Ulcerative colitis — Diagnosis, assessment, and goals of management: We recommend stool testing to rule out Clostridioides difficile in patients suspected of having UC (Strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We recommend against serologic antibody testing to establish or rule out a diagnosis of UC (Strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We recommend against serologic antibody testing to determine the prognosis of UC (Strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We recommend treating patients with UC to achieve endoscopic improvement (defined as resolution of inflammatory changes [Mayo endoscopic score 0 or 1]) to increase the likelihood of sustained steroid-free remission and to prevent hospitalizations and surgery (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We recommend the use of FC in UC to assess response to therapy, to evaluate suspected relapse, and during maintenance (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).

General Principals of Management Endoscopic and radiologic studies are used to diagnose the particular disorder and to determine the extent of the disease. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, the patient and the physician work together to establish realistic treatment goals. Therapy is then individualized to meet these goals. When symptoms recur, a careful history, a thorough physical examination and confirmatory laboratory studies are required to make a cost-effective reassessment. Extensive radiologic and endoscopic studies for restaging should be performed only when a major clinical change occurs or a major treatment change is contemplated. Cholestyramine is helpful in patients who develop bile-salt–induced diarrhea after ileal resection. Since this drug binds to many other agents and reduces their bioavailability, it should be used cautiously as long-term therapy.

Cholestyramine can markedly worsen steatorrhea in patients with more extensive ileal resection. In patients with active colitis, significant protein calorie malnutrition with low serum protein and albumin levels is indicative of severe disease that may require hospitalization and intravenous hyperalimentation therapy. Chronic severe malnutrition in patients with short-bowel syndrome due to massive surgical resection of the small intestines is an indication for home intravenous hyperalimentation therapy. Sulfasalazine in a low dosage can be used to maintain remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. In a higher dosage, the drug can be used to treat active ulcerative colitis. 18 A dosage of 4 g per day has the most benefit, but it requires taking 16 tablets per day. A dosage of 2 to 3 g per day is effective in patients with active ulcerative colitis.

In a dosage of 1 to 2 g per day, mesalamine is equal to sulfasalazine in maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis.
19. 20 This tablet has been found to be as effective as sulfasalazine in maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis. 21 It has also been beneficial in the treatment of active Crohn's disease and, in a dosage of 2. 4 g per day, in maintaining remission. 22 In enema or suppository form, mesalamine is the most effective therapy for distal proctosigmoiditis, but it has little efficacy in anorectal Crohn's disease. Corticosteroids Systemic Corticosteroids For the past 30 years, corticosteroids have been the mainstay of therapy in patients with moderate to severe active inflammatory bowel disease. 25 Initial treatment is prednisone, 40 to 60 mg per day. In severely ill hospitalized patients, reasonable initial therapy is hydrocortisone, 100 mg administered intravenously every eight hours.

Intravenous therapy generally produces rapid improvement of symptoms, with maximal benefit occurring when the corticosteroid has been administered for six to eight days. Once improvement has occurred, prednisone is tapered by 5 to 10 mg per week until the dosage is 15 to 20 mg per day. This dosage is then tapered by 2. 5 to 5 mg per week until the drug is discontinued. Confusion over the taper schedule can be avoided if patients are given written instructions and 5-mg tablets are used. The goal is to get patients off corticosteroids within a relatively short time but still maintain disease remission. Concomitant use of 5-ASA agents can be helpful. Alternatively, long-term alternate-day corticosteroid therapy can be used in patients with refractory Crohn's disease, although it may be necessary to use dosages of 20 to 25 mg every other day. Topical Corticosteroids Corticosteroid enemas are beneficial in patients with ulcerative proctosigmoiditis.

### French national consensus clinical guidelines for the management of ulcerative colitis [^111ssH5W]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of multifactorial etiology that primarily affects the colonic mucosa. The disease progresses over time, and clinical management guidelines should reflect its dynamic nature. There is limited evidence supporting UC management in specific clinical situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach.

Aim

To use a formal consensus method - the nominal group technique (NGT) - to develop a clinical practice expert opinion to outline simple algorithms and practices, optimize UC management, and assist clinicians in making treatment decisions.

Methods

The consensus was developed by an expert panel of 37 gastroenterologists from various professional organizations with experience in UC management using the qualitative and iterative NGT, incorporating deliberations based on the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation recommendations, recent reviews of scientific literature, and pertinent discussion topics developed by a steering committee. Examples of clinical cases for which there are limited evidence-based data from clinical trials were used. Two working groups proposed and voted on treatment algorithms that were then discussed and voted for by the nominal group as a whole, in order to reach a consensus.

Results

A clinical practice guideline covering management of the following clinical situations was developed: (i) moderate and severe UC; (ii) acute severe UC; (iii) pouchitis; (iv) refractory proctitis, in the form of treatment algorithms.

Conclusions

Given the limited available evidence-based data, a formal consensus methodology was used to develop simple treatment guidelines for UC management in different clinical situations that is now accessible via an online application.

Conclusion

The guidelines referenced in this review offer a useful summary for how to manage UC. They highlight the need for accurate diagnosis, early initiation of appropriate therapy and ongoing assessment of disease progress and the side effects of treatment. Care is often centralised, but awareness of who and when to refer for assessment both initially and during relapse (particularly for severe colitis) will remain an important part of the overall management of these children.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — conclusions outline disease characterization and management, noting that UC is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory condition of the recto-colon and colon with variable activity and severity and significant morbidity. Appropriate management involves successful induction of both clinical and endoscopic remission followed by use of a corticosteroid-free maintenance strategy and ongoing monitoring for disease and drug-related complications. Choice of therapy is based on activity, severity, extent of inflammation and prognostic factors, and may include oral, topical (rectal), or systemic therapies, as well as surgery. Patients with moderate-to-severe disease should be treated early in their disease course with therapies that have been shown to be effective and should not linger with suboptimal therapy or recurrent courses of corticosteroids. In general, the induction therapy selected drives the choice of maintenance therapy. Positioning considerations include a single head-to-head trial in moderately to severely active UC, separation of induction and maintenance strategies for some patients with ASUC, and considerations of comorbid or concomitantly existing extraintestinal manifestations. We advocate for preservation of the clinician-patient shared decision-making approach to therapy selection and exclusion of limitations imposed by third-party payers.

Ulcerative colitis — therapeutic management guidance: Therapeutic management in UC should be guided by the extent of bowel involvement, an assessment of disease activity and disease prognosis; patients with moderate-to-severely active UC or with high risk of hospitalization or colectomy should be treated with therapies that have evidence for efficacy based on clinical trials and real world studies. We recommend that prognosis should guide choice of therapy as much as activity of inflammation at the time of acute illness.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — future directions highlight unmet needs, stating that this guideline did not address the arenas of endoscopic surveillance or management of UC during pregnancy and that these topics will be addressed in future guidelines and a pregnancy consensus statement by the ACG. There is great interest in the application of IUS to the assessment of UC, and further research is needed to define the timing of this tool and the role for transmural assessment in prognosticating treatment response and outcomes. The authors note a great need for head-to-head RCTs to clarify sequencing and positioning of therapies and to understand the role and optimal timing for elective proctocolectomy, emphasizing that such direct evidence is needed to inform comparative effectiveness. Additional priorities include prediction biomarkers for personalized therapy selection, breaking through the existing therapeutic ceiling in UC via novel mechanisms of action and combinations of therapies to improve efficacy without sacrificing safety while addressing costs and access issues, and determining whether earlier advanced treatment in UC improves long-term outcomes. For future IBD guideline updates, the ACG has initiated a rapid update protocol, with updated guidance released annually to provide timely and practical guidance on the ever-changing field.
