## Question

2.1. Every month Ivan pays a fixed amount from his salary for a mortgage, and the remaining part of the salary is spent on current expenses. In December, Ivan paid 40% of his salary for the mortgage. In January, Ivan's salary increased by 9%. By what percentage did the amount spent on current expenses increase in January (compared to December)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking by what percentage Ivan's current expenses increased in January compared to December, given that his mortgage payment is a fixed dollar amount and his salary rose by 9%. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fixed mortgage payment and how that behaves when salary changes. Then, I should verify how current expenses are defined and what that implies for December versus January. Next, I will set up a concrete example with a symbolic salary to make the math transparent. After that, I should calculate the December and January current expenses and compute the percentage change. Finally, I will double-check the logic and consider whether the answer depends on the absolute salary level or remains constant across incomes.

> Let me first confirm the setup: the mortgage payment is a fixed dollar amount each month, not a percentage of salary, even though in December it happened to equal 40% of that month's salary. That means when the salary increases in January, the mortgage payment stays the same in dollars, so the proportion of salary going to the mortgage will drop, and the remaining amount for current expenses will increase by more than the salary increase itself. Wait, let me verify that intuition before I calculate it explicitly.

> I will now examine December's situation symbolically. If Ivan's December salary is S, then the fixed mortgage payment is 0.40 × S, and current expenses in December are the remainder: S − 0.40S = 0.60S. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with the wording that the remaining part after the fixed mortgage is spent on current expenses, which it does.

> Next, I should review January's situation. After a 9% salary increase, the new salary is 1.09S, but the mortgage payment remains fixed at 0.40S, so current expenses in January become 1.09S − 0.40S = 0.69S. Let me double-check that subtraction to ensure no arithmetic error, and yes, 1.09 minus 0.40 is indeed 0.69.

> Now I need to calculate the percentage increase in current expenses from December to January. The change is 0.69S − 0.60S = 0.09S, and the percentage increase is (0.09S / 0.60S) × 100% = 15%. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the increase might mirror the salary increase at 9%, but that would be incorrect because the fixed mortgage becomes a smaller share of a larger salary, amplifying the gain in discretionary spending. The correct increase is 15%, not 9%.

> To ensure this is not an artifact of symbolic algebra, let me consider a concrete example. Suppose December salary is $1000; then the mortgage is $400 and current expenses are $600. In January, salary rises to $1090, mortgage stays at $400, so current expenses become $690. The increase is $90 on $600, which is exactly 15%. I should confirm that this matches the symbolic result, and it does, reinforcing the conclusion.

> But wait, what if the mortgage had been framed as a percentage of salary rather than a fixed amount? Hold on, I should verify that nuance because it would change the answer. If the mortgage were 40% of salary each month, then current expenses would also be 60% of salary each month, and a 9% salary increase would yield only a 9% increase in current expenses. However, the problem explicitly states Ivan pays a fixed amount for the mortgage, so the fixed-dollar interpretation stands and the 15% increase in current expenses is correct.

> Final answer: Current expenses increased by 15% in January compared to December. I should double-check that I've answered the percentage question directly, and yes, the percentage increase is 15%.

---

The amount spent on current expenses increased by **15%** in January compared to December. Here's why: the mortgage is a fixed dollar amount equal to 40% of December's salary, so when the salary rises by 9%, the mortgage stays the same, making the remaining 60% of December salary grow to 69% of December salary in January — a 15% relative increase in current expenses.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

Let **December salary** be (S).

- **Mortgage payment in December**: 40% of (S) = (0.4S).
- **Current expenses in December**: (S - 0.4S = 0.6S).

In January, the salary increases by 9%, so the **January salary** is (1.09S).

- **Mortgage payment in January**: remains fixed at (0.4S).
- **Current expenses in January**: (1.09S - 0.4S = 0.69S).

---

## Percentage increase in current expenses

The increase in current expenses is (0.69S - 0.6S = 0.09S). The percentage increase is:

[0.09S/0.6S] × 100% = 15%

---

## Conclusion

Current expenses increased by **15%** in January compared to December because the fixed mortgage payment becomes a smaller proportion of the higher salary, leaving a larger share for current expenses.

Measures

At MIDUS 1, participants responded to the following question: "Suppose you (and your spouse or partner) cashed in all your checking and savings accounts, stocks and bonds, real estate, sold your home, your vehicles, and all your valuable possessions. Then suppose you put that money toward paying off your mortgage and all your other loans, debts, and credit cards. Would you have any money left over after paying your debts or would you still owe money?" Participants reported how much that amount would be, using binned response categories that specified ranges of dollar amounts. Amount of money owed was truncated at a value of $0. Net worth that exceeded $1 million was truncated at that value.

Covariates included parental educational level and participant age, self-reported race/ethnicity (analyzed here as non-White vs White), sex (female vs male), history of cancer or heart disease as diagnosed by a medical doctor, and status of ever smoking cigarettes regularly or consuming alcohol regularly (the eMethods 1 in the Supplement provides coding details). At MIDUS 1, participants self-reported on their race. Response options included White, Black and/or African American, Native American or Aleutian Islander, Asian or Pacific Islander, multiracial, or other race. Because of the low number of individuals who identified as a race other than White, we dichotomized race categories into non-White vs White. In addition, data on self-identification as Hispanic or Latino were not available at MIDUS 1.

Mortality follow-up was completed by the MIDUS study team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Date of death was obtained from various sources, including relative responses, other informant reports, newspaper or online obituaries, and the National Death Index (using the 15th day of the month, rather than the exact day of death, to maintain participant confidentiality). Survival time was the number of years between the date when the MIDUS 1 self-administered questionnaires were returned to the MIDUS study team (1994 to 1996) and the date of death; if the participant was alive, the censor date was October 31, 2018, which was the date of the MIDUS study team's latest mortality update.

### Buying cures versus renting health: financing health care with consumer loans [^53724ff6]. Science Translational Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A crisis is building over the prices of new transformative therapies for cancer, hepatitis C virus infection, and rare diseases. The clinical imperative is to offer these therapies as broadly and rapidly as possible. We propose a practical way to increase drug affordability through health care loans (HCLs)-the equivalent of mortgages for large health care expenses. HCLs allow patients in both multipayer and single-payer markets to access a broader set of therapeutics, including expensive short-duration treatments that are curative. HCLs also link payment to clinical benefit and should help lower per-patient cost while incentivizing the development of transformative therapies rather than those that offer small incremental advances. Moreover, we propose the use of securitization-a well-known financial engineering method-to finance a large diversified pool of HCLs through both debt and equity. Numerical simulations suggest that securitization is viable for a wide range of economic environments and cost parameters, allowing a much broader patient population to access transformative therapies while also aligning the interests of patients, payers, and the pharmaceutical industry.

User cost of housing

In the user cost of housing model, the capitalization rate is:The discount rate, δ, represents the interest rate on a mortgage. In the US market, this rate is modified by the marginal income tax rate τ i n c because homeowners can deduct mortgage interest, which effectively decreases the discount rate; note that this will depend on an individual's marginal tax rate. Property taxes are also deductible such that individuals are not double taxed on income used to pay local property taxes, and this too is proportional to the marginal tax rate for an individual's income bracket, (1 − τ i n c). Capitalization also includes depreciation on the physical structure, γ, which in our model we assume is constant and captures maintenance and repair costs (assumed separate from climate risks). The risk premium, r p, reflects the opportunity of investing in a risky asset (housing in our case), and we further parameterize this as a function of the physical system. Expectations of future capital gains are in E [g]. If one expects house prices to increase by X% over the course of holding it for one period, then the capital gain effectively decreases the cost of owning the asset over that period, and vice versa for an expected decrease in property value. Combining equations 1 and 2, the user cost model is:Equation (3) is the basis for C-HOM. The model consists of a fixed number of properties (i.e. the supply of housing is fixed), a pool of agents who generate bid prices for one unit of housing based on Eq. (3), and an investor agent who can purchase multiple units of housing based on the current schedule of agent bid prices and an investor user cost equation similar to Eq. (3).

### Association of cost-driven residential moves with health-related outcomes among California renters [^26511494]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Primary Exposure

The primary exposure was a 3-level categorical variable for residential moving history in the past 3 years, constructed from CHIS questions asking, "About how long have you lived at your current address?" and "The last time you moved, what was your main reason for moving?" Options for the latter are summarized in eTable 2 in Supplement 1. Participants who moved because they "couldn't afford mortgage/rent" were considered to have made cost-driven moves. As comparisons, people who moved for other reasons were classified as having made non–cost-driven moves, while those whose most recent move was more than 3 years ago were classified as having made no move.

Covariates

All multivariable models were adjusted for self-reported individual characteristics, including sex (female or male), race and ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic Asian, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, or other non-Hispanic race [including American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, ≥ 2 races, and self-reported other race]), family composition (married nonparent, married parent, single nonparent, or single parent), age and square of age (years), employment status (employed full time, employed part time, unemployed and seeking work, or unemployed and not seeking work), educational attainment (less than high school diploma; high school diploma; some college, associate's degree, or vocational school; college degree; or graduate school), income (measured as log of total household income as percentage of federal poverty level), citizenship (US-born citizen, naturalized citizen, noncitizen with green card, or noncitizen without green card), limited English language proficiency (yes or no), housing type (rental or other nonhomeownership arrangement), and urbanicity (urban or rural) determined by zip code (full covariate definitions are provided in eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Race and ethnicity were included to examine differences in the prevalence of cost-driven moves and to account for the role of racist social and economic policies in shaping mutually reinforcing risk of exposure to housing and health opportunities. Models of preventive care and ED visits also controlled for health insurance type (employment-based, Medicaid alone, Medicaid and Medicare, Medicare and other insurance, Medicare or other public insurance alone, privately purchased, or not insured).

Patients and caregivers also expressed financial costs for the caregiver. "You know, my wife's home too as she's trying to take care of me and I don't know if that's a good thing because we need money to survive, pay bills and mortgages" (01, patient, income unknown). Another caregiver respondent mentioned how their ability to assist their family member is limited by how much time they are able to take off from work. "Having said that, I was averaging a day a week because of all his medical appointments. And that was interfering with my ability to earn a living". (17, caregiver of low income patient). Additionally, when caregivers supported their family members by conducting IADLs including "going to the grocery store… cleaning his house… doing his laundry", they witnessed losing the opportunity to engage in the relationship presenting as a social cost to caregivers. A caregiver shared the social cost of conducting IADLs for their loved one as limiting the time to "go and visit my father and have quality time with him". (17, caregiver of patient with low income).

2.4	Delayed or Missed Dose

If an entire planned dose or part of a planned dose of PIASKY is missed, administer the missed dose or remainder of the missed dose as soon as possible before the day of the next scheduled dose. Then administer the next dose on the regularly scheduled dosing day. Do not administer two doses or more than the prescribed dose on the same day to make up for a missed dose.

2.5	Preparation and Administration

Each vial of PIASKY is for one-time use in only one patient.

PIASKY is administered as an intravenous infusion (first dose) and as a subcutaneous injection (subsequent doses). Only healthcare providers should administer PIASKY.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. PIASKY is clear to opalescent, and an almost colorless to brownish-yellow solution. PIASKY should be discarded if the medicine looks cloudy, discolored, or has particles in it.

Preparation of Intravenous Infusion

Use aseptic technique to prepare PIASKY for intravenous administration. PIASKY must be diluted and administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes ± 10 minutes (1,000 mg) or 90 minutes ± 10 minutes (1,500 mg).
PIASKY solution must be diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection prior to administration. A 0.2 micron in-line filter must be used with the infusion set during administration. A dedicated infusion line must be used during intravenous administration.
Only dilute PIASKY in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection.

Dilution of Intravenous Infusion

Withdraw the required volume of PIASKY from the vial (see Table 2) using a sterile syringe and dilute into the infusion bag. Use multiple vials to meet the required volume of PIASKY to be added to the infusion bag. Discard any unused portion left in the vial.

Dilution of PIASKY in infusion bags containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection must be in the range of 4–15 mg/mL (final concentration after dilution) (see Table 2).

Intravenous infusion bags of a volume of 100 mL or 250 mL can be used.

Gently mix the infusion bag by slowly inverting the bag. Do not shake.
Inspect the infusion bag for particles and discard if present.
Flushing of infusion line is required to ensure complete administration of the entire dose.

### Micafungin sodium (micafungin) [^481ec8aa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Dilution and Preparation

The diluted solution should be protected from light. It is not necessary to cover the infusion drip chamber or the tubing.

Adult Patients:

Add the appropriate volume of reconstituted micafungin for injection into 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 100 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP.
Appropriately label the bag.

Pediatric Patients

Calculate the total micafungin for injection dose in milligrams (mg) by multiplying the recommended pediatric dose (mg/kg) for a given indication [see Table 2] and the weight of the patient in kilograms (kg).
To calculate the volume (mL) of drug needed, divide the calculated dose (mg) from step 1 by the final concentration of the selected reconstituted vial(s) (either 10 mg per mL for the 50 mg vial or 20 mg per mL for the 100 mg vial), see example below:

 Using 50 mg vials:

Divide the calculated mg dose (from step 1) by 10 mg per mL to determine the volume (mL) needed.

OR

 Using 100 mg vials:

Divide the calculated mg dose (from step 1) by 20 mg per mL to determine the volume (mL) needed.
Withdraw the calculated volume (mL) of drug needed from the selected concentration and size of reconstituted micafungin for injection vial(s) used in Step 2 (ensure the selected concentration and vial size used to calculate the dose is also used to prepare the infusion).
Add the withdrawn volume of drug (step 3) to a 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP intravenous infusion bag or syringe. Ensure that the final concentration of the solution is between 0.5 mg per mL to 4 mg per mL.

To decrease the risk of infusion reactions, concentrations above 1.5 mg per mL should be administered via central catheter [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].
Appropriately label the infusion bag or syringe. For concentrations above 1.5 mg per mL, if required, label to specifically warn to administer the solution via central catheter.

The diluted infusion bag should be protected from light and may be stored for up to 24 hours at room temperature, 25°C (77°F).

Micafungin for injection is preservative-free. Discard partially used vials.

### Projected effects of proposed cuts in federal medicaid expenditures on medicaid enrollment, uninsurance, health care, and health [^e22afd18]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In January 2025, the Republican majority in the House of Representatives' Budget Committee offered a list of possible spending reductions to offset revenue losses from proposed tax cuts. In May, the Committee advanced a bill incorporating several reductions on the list. The Committee estimated that the 6 largest potential Medicaid cuts (for example, work requirements for some Medicaid enrollees) would each reduce the federal government's Medicaid outlays by at least $100 billion over 10 years. On the basis of the Committee's estimates of savings; Congressional Budget Office analyses; and peer-reviewed studies of the coverage, financial, and health impacts of past Medicaid expansions and contractions, the authors project the likely effects of each option and of the House bill advanced by the Budget Committee in May.

Each option individually would reduce federal Medicaid outlays by between $100 billion and $900 billion over a decade, increase the ranks of the uninsured by between 600000 and 3900000 and the annual number of persons forgoing needed medical care by 129060 to 838890, and result in 651 to 12626 medically preventable deaths annually. Enactment of the House bill advanced in May would increase the number of uninsured persons by 7.6 million and the number of deaths by 16642 annually, according to a mid-range estimate. These figures exclude harms from lowering provider payments and shrinking benefits, as well as possible repercussions from states increasing taxes or shifting expenditures from other needs to make up for shortfalls in federal Medicaid funding.

Policy makers should weigh the likely health and financial harms to patients and providers of reducing Medicaid expenditures against the desirability of tax reductions, which would accrue mostly to wealthy Americans.

### Healthcare personnel absenteeism, presenteeism, and staffing challenges during epidemics [^b79efc2d]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

An analysis of biweekly payroll data between December 23, 2009, and December 25, 2019, (254 pay periods) showed that, in both salaried and hourly employees, as ILI increases, the proportion of all absence hours that are unscheduled increases (Fig. 1). ILI is a statistically significant predictor of unscheduled absences in both salaried and hourly workers (P < .01). However, the effect is different in the 2 groups: salaried employees have fewer documented unscheduled absences than hourly workers (P < .01). For every 1% increase in ILI in the population of the state, hourly workers have a 0.14% increase in the percentage of unscheduled absence hours. This effect is lower in salaried workers, with an increase of 0.04% of unscheduled absences for every 1% increase in ILI in the state.

Fig. 1.
Rate of unscheduled absences compared to total hours worked and influenza-like activity in Minnesota over the calendar year. Each point represents one 2-week pay period.

In addition to increased unscheduled absence rates with increased ILI, the proportion of paid hours in which the employees are working increases. For every increase in ILI by 1%, the proportion of paid hours that are worked increases by 0.2% in hourly workers (P = 0.04). We did not detect a statistically significant linear relationship between ILI and proportion of paid hours that are worked by salaried employees.

Expected capital gains

Agents form heterogeneous expectations of capital gains based on past values of market returns. Specifically, each agent evaluates a price return over time, where the time of measuring the return varies between one and 30 years. Agents are randomly assigned one of the thirty price/return time scales to form their expected capital gains. The expected capital gains at the current moment for a given agent is simply the return for one year that would yield the total return the agent found over their assigned time scale. For example, an agent assigned 30 years calculates the annualized capital gain or loss at t based on the ratio of realized property prices 30 years before the previous period (Pₜ₋₃₁) to the previous period (Pₜ₋₁). In this way, some agents are reactionary as they adjust expected returns over short time scales, while others are more sluggish in computing returns over a long time scale. We assume that foresight about future climate change is captured in the risk parameters, and as a practical matter, the influence on owner bids cannot be separately identified from in the denominator of equation (5). We calculate the investor's expected capital gain in each period as the median of owner expected capital gains.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^f29e615a]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Domain 1 — initial assessment and ongoing assessment in palliative care specifies that the initial assessment includes conversations with the patient, family caregivers, clinicians, and others according to the patient's preferences, and that the initial assessment is conducted in person by one or more interdisciplinary team (IDT) members, depending on the needs and concerns of the patient, is documented, and includes patient and family understanding of the serious illness, goals of care, treatment preferences, and a review of signed advance directives, if available; a determination of decision-making capacity or identification of the person with legal decision-making authority; a physical examination including identification of current symptoms and functional status; a thorough review of medical records and relevant laboratory and diagnostic test results; a review of the medical history, therapies, recommended treatments, and prognosis; the identification of comorbid medical, cognitive, and psychiatric disorders; a medication reconciliation, including over-the-counter medications; social determinants of health, including financial vulnerability, housing, nutrition, and safety; social and cultural factors and caregiving support, including caregiver willingness and capacity to meet patient needs; patient and family emotional and spiritual concerns, including previous exposure to trauma; the ability of the patient, family, and care providers to communicate with one another effectively, including considerations of language, literacy, hearing, and cultural norms; and patient and family needs related to anticipatory grief, loss, and bereavement, including assessment of family risk for prolonged grief disorder. The team identifies and documents if the adult patient or a family member served in the military and whether the patient or family member may be eligible for VA benefits, and for pediatric patients the team ascertains the developmental status and children or teens' understanding of their disease, as well as parental preferences for their child's care at the time of initial consultation, which is revisited throughout the trajectory of care; the IDT performs subsequent assessments at regularly defined intervals and whenever the patient's status significantly changes, new problems are identified, or the patient experiences a transition in health care setting or provider.

### Trends in prices of popular brand-name prescription drugs in the United States [^085b0754]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Data Presentation

Total price paid of each claim, representing the sum of out-of-pocket cost paid by a plan member and cost paid by the insurer, was the primary outcome of interest. In instances in which the billed unit quantity differed from an individual claim and the most commonly billed unit quantity, the costs were normalized to the most commonly billed quantity by calculating the cost per billed unit. For example, a paid amount of $100 for 1 unit and $200 for 2 units for the same drug would both be considered $100 per unit. Median costs for the most common prescriptions were summarized in each calendar month. In general, measures of variation (eg, interquartile range) were small and are not presented in the results.

Relative price changes were found by calculating the difference in median costs between 2 dates and then scaling this difference by the preceding date's median cost; the following formula was used: [(S₂ − S₁)/S₁], in which S 1 was the median cost for the most common prescription on the first date and S 2 was for the second date. Relative price changes are presented here as the change in price from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2017. For drugs that were not on the market in January 2012, the earliest available date was used to find S 1, and a 6-year relative price change was also extrapolated by scaling the relative price change to a 72-month period (ie, double the time if the drug had been available for only the minimum 36 months). Likewise, a 3-year relative price change was calculated for all drugs from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2017, for a more appropriate direct comparison of drugs that had entered the market after January 1, 2012, with those on the market before January 1, 2012. Month-to-month relative price changes were identified by calculating the difference in median costs between consecutive months and then scaling the difference by the preceding month's median cost using the following formula: [(Sᵢ − Sᵢ₋₁)/Sᵢ₋₁], in which S i is the median cost for the most common prescription during the i-th month.

### Mental health competencies for pediatric practice [^2c05f3f5]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Brief interventions and escalation — intervention will need to include supports to address social determinants, and "If an identified problem is not an emergency, the clinician can undertake 1 or more brief interventions, as time allows, during the current visit or at follow-up visit(s) (algorithm step 11)". These brief interventions may include "using secondary screening tools, gathering information from school personnel or child care providers, or having the family create a diary of problem behaviors and their triggers", and may also involve "referral of a family member for assistance in addressing his or her own social or mental health problems". When indicated by assessment findings or "failure to respond to brief therapeutic interventions", "a full diagnostic assessment can be performed, either by the pediatrician (algorithm step 15) at a follow-up visit or through referral to a specialist (algorithm step 16), followed by the steps of care planning and implementation, comanagement, and monitoring the child's progress (algorithm steps 17 and 18)".

### Inflation, economic policy changes, and access to essential drugs by retirees in Argentina [^6e88fb6b]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Results

Among 360 essential drugs tracked between December 2020 and January 2024, essential drug prices in Argentina increased a median (IQR) of 1051% (923%-1174%), surpassing the cumulative inflation of 849%, with a notable acceleration in price increases from October 2023 after the national election. Pension benefits had increased by 455% based on the standard adjustment formula and by 744% when including exceptional bonuses (Figure 1). The cost burden of cardiovascular medications on minimum pensions also increased sharply; by January 2024, retirees needed to allocate 34.9% of their pension for a basic treatment regimen of 3 drugs, up from 17.4% in December 2020 (Figure 2). Uninsured patients faced the full retail price, while private insurance typically covered approximately 40% of these costs, leaving patients to pay the remaining 60%. For those with social insurance, including the public health care program for retirees (PAMI), out-of-pocket costs fluctuated, with subsidies covering between 30% to 70% of medication expenses. Additionally, PAMI offers 167 essential medications free of charge to its members.

### Evolving methodology of national tobacco control investment cases [^6dc011d2]. Tobacco Control (2024). Medium credibility.

Identifying the best available data

Data sources for key parameters are listed in table 1. Ideally, data must be credible, nationally representative and recent. For each WHO FCTC investment case, we sought context-specific data to reflect the epidemiological and economic conditions in the country and fill a standardised list of model parameters. These included gross domestic product (GDP), labour force size and employment rates, average salary or wages, average hours worked per day, month and year, excess absenteeism due to smoking, excess presenteeism due to smoking, unsanctioned smoking breaks, healthcare expenditures, the smoking-attributable fraction (SAF) of healthcare expenditures, prevalence of current cigarette smoking, population, life expectancy and death rates.

We worked with government stakeholders to collect, calibrate, and adjust national and locally available data, where available and preferred. To do so, we submitted data collection forms to national health authorities seeking their knowledge of available sources for relevant parameters and often held virtual meetings to follow up and connect with key academic or government authorities.

Some data points were readily available from most — though not all — national governments (eg, employment rates, GDP, healthcare expenditures, population, tobacco use prevalence). Other data were only sometimes forthcoming (eg, average annual salary/wages, annual quit attempt rates among current smokers, price and/or income elasticity of demand measures for tobacco products, rates of use of evidence-based forms of treatment such as nicotine replacement therapy, behavioural therapy), or not or rarely locally available (eg, tobacco-attributable morbidity and mortality, tobacco-related healthcare expenditures and value of a statistical life year (VSLY)).

In cases where no context-specific data were nationally available, with country agreement, we defaulted to use of country-specific data from global models or databases, or regional or income group-specific averages in published online sources.

### Adapting interventions to new contexts-the ADAPT guidance [^324ed39e]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Step 1: Assess the rationale for intervention, and consider intervention-context fit

Define the problem in the target population

Before identifying an intervention, we recommend articulating clearly what the problem is, and why an intervention is needed. This will often include understanding the prevalence of a health problem and its distribution among population subgroups, as well as consideration of causes.

Identify candidate interventions

In some instances, adaptation teams will begin without a predefined intervention in mind, and seek to systematically identify candidate interventions. In other circumstances, intervention developers could have promoted their intervention in new contexts, or a group might have become aware of a potential intervention by other mechanisms. Nevertheless, even if a team already has an intervention in mind, it should critically reflect on whether the intervention does represent the most suitable choice. For some problems and settings, up-to-date reviews comparing effects of different interventions across various contexts will already be available. If none exists, a new review or evidence map might be needed. Systematic review methods are emerging for explicitly considering transferability of evidence to new contexts. Such reviews are likely to provide useful sources of information for intervention selection processes. If no suitable interventions are identified, developing a new intervention might be warranted.

Obtain detailed information on the selected intervention and the contexts in which it has been evaluated

Published information might be enough to enable judgments about which interventions are likely to be suitable. However, gaps will often need to be filled by obtaining manuals, or through contact with developers. Publications from previous evaluations — including data on feasibility, main effects, subgroup analyses, and processes — will provide insights to inform judgments on transferability. Failures to replicate intervention effects are often attributed to differences in context, but might be due to shallow theorisation (meaning that only surface features of an intervention are reproduced). Process evaluations, where conducted and published, could provide vital information on how the intervention worked, to guide replication of intervention mechanisms. Additional research in contexts where the intervention is in use might sometimes be needed to fully theorise the intervention before adaptation. Devlin and Wight undertook qualitative research on an ongoing Italian drug recovery programme, to more fully theorise and contextualise its mechanisms to inform transfer to Scotland.

### Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol and ethinyl estradiol (bekyree) [^d6dccf8b]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

DAY 1 START

Counting the first day of menstruation as "Day 1", tablets are taken without interruption as follows: One white tablet daily for 21 days, one green (inert) tablet daily for 2 days followed by 1 yellow (ethinyl estradiol) tablet daily for 5 days. For all subsequent cycles, the patient then begins a new 28 tablet regimen on the next day after taking the last yellow tablet. [If switching directly from another oral contraceptive, the first white tablet should be taken on the first day of menstruation which begins after the last ACTIVE tablet of the previous product.]

If a patient misses 1 white tablet, she should take the missed tablet as soon as she remembers. If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take 2 tablets the day she remembers and 2 tablets the next day; thereafter, the patient should resume taking 1 tablet daily until she finishes the cycle pack. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has intercourse in the 7 days after missing pills. If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in the third week or if the patient misses 3 or more white tablets in a row at any time during the cycle, the patient should throw out the rest of that cycle pack and start a new cycle pack that same day. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has intercourse in the 7 days after missing pills.

ALL ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, non-functional causes should be borne in mind. In undiagnosed persistent or recurrent abnormal bleeding from the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If both pregnancy and pathology have been excluded, time or a change to another preparation may solve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content, while potentially useful in minimizing menstrual irregularity, should be done only if necessary since this may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.

Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period:

If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued until pregnancy is ruled out.
If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out before continuing oral contraceptive use.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^3cb56dff]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Domain 8: Ethical and legal aspects of care — Guideline 8.4 treatment and ongoing decision-making states that, within the limits of applicable laws and standards, person-centered goals form the basis for the plan of care and decisions related to providing, forgoing, and discontinuing treatments. The patient's plan of care reflects ethical principles and the assessment of treatment preferences and is accurately documented to reflect the patient's previously stated goals in terms of providing, forgoing, and discontinuing care. The IDT ensures that existing treatments align with the patient's goals and the standard practices of care, and the team actively works to prevent medically non-beneficial care. When a family member or surrogate decision-maker seeks to override the patient's documented treatment decisions, the patient's preferences are reviewed, and ethics consultation is sought if needed, and failure to honor patient preferences is considered an ethical concern and is addressed by the IDT. Children receive open and honest, developmentally appropriate information about their serious illness and treatment options and are given the opportunity to participate in decision-making according to their wishes, age, and developmental capacity, and when the child's wishes differ from those of the adult decision-maker, staff is available to assist the child and family work towards a resolution, prioritizing fidelity to the patient. When parents or legal decision-makers express a strong preference for non-disclosure of a poor prognosis to a seriously ill child or adolescent, the IDT assesses family motivations and values regarding truth-telling practices and preferences; while it is sometimes ethically permissible to defer to family values regarding nondisclosure of prognosis, clinicians work collaboratively with the family to meet the child or adolescent's individual needs while respecting the parent or decision-makers' expectations and boundaries. All treatments provided are directed at the relief of suffering, in accordance with the doctrine of double effect, and the IDT educates the patient and family regarding the cost of care and financial burdens associated with treatment options. In cases where the wishes of the patient or surrogate conflict with the clinicians caring for the patient, processes are in place to honor clinician conscientious objection in a manner that ensures patients are never abandoned and continue to receive quality, safe care, and when treatments are forgone or discontinued, the IDT ensures appropriate symptom control at all times, as aligned with the ethical principle of nonmaleficence.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 5 health care abroad [^bc907224]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Health care abroad — insurance and payment considerations advises that travelers "should research their policy thoroughly and identify potential healthcare professionals and facilities at their destination that are 'in-network' for their insurance coverage", and notes that "The US embassy or consulate website for each city that has a US diplomatic post has a list of local hospitals and doctors that can also be used for identifying potential healthcare professionals and facilities abroad". It cautions that "Nationalized healthcare services at a given destination do not necessarily cover healthcare costs of nonresidents", and that "Even with a supplemental travel health insurance policy, receiving medical care abroad usually requires a cash or credit card payment at the point of service, which can result in expenditures of thousands of dollars". US citizens paying for care abroad "should obtain copies of all charges and receipts and, if necessary, contact a US consular officer, who can assist the traveler with transferring funds from the United States".

### Cost-effectiveness analysis for clinicians [^6438d463]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The current economic news is bad. Expenditure on health care is under scrutiny in every country and with predictions of another economic crash comes pressure on the funding of health care systems - systems that, according to the World Health Organizationare meant to deliver quality service to all people, when and where they need them.

At the same time, new products - pharmaceuticals, diagnostic tests, new technologies - continue to be developed and launched. Health care systems are under pressure to pay for all of the potential hope that these provide, sometimes with good reason, sometimes without. This is where cost-effectiveness analysis comes in.

### WHO-led consensus statement on vaccine delivery costing: process, methods, and findings [^e021a98a]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommended costing terminology and principles

After reviewing the definitions of costing terms, the following definitions of costing terms are recommended:
Vaccine delivery costs Costs associated with delivering immunization programs to target populations, exclusive of vaccine costs.
Vaccine cost At a minimum includes the cost of the vaccine and diluent (if applicable); the analysis should include accounting for wastage rates; the analyst should specify whether this also includes injection supplies (syringes), international shipment, insurance, and customs/duties.
Financial cost Monetary outlays, with straight-line depreciation for capital goods; does not include opportunity costs for use of resources or donated goods and services from sources other than the payer(s) defined in the analysis. Definition is dependent on perspective since monetary outlays are specific to the payer(s) defined in the analysis.
Economic cost The value of all resources utilized, regardless of the source of financing. Includes opportunity costs for use of existing resources and any donated goods or services from any source. Capital costs are annualized and discounted.
Undepreciated financial cost Financial costs without depreciation of capital costs (note: such costs have been termed "initial investment" in some costing tools and referred to as fiscal costs in previous analyses.)
Recurrent cost Value of resources that last less than one year. Start-up activity costs may include recurrent costs.
Capital cost Value of resources lasting more than one year such as equipment, buildings, and trainings. Start-up activity costs may include capital costs.
Incremental cost Cost of adding a new service/intervention or a package of services/interventions over and above an existing program; inclusion of existing resources will depend on assumptions made about excess capacity (i.e. whether resources are underemployed; if there are no slack resources (e.g. all personnel time is fully allocated before the addition of the new service/intervention), then their use for the new service or intervention incurs an opportunity cost that should be included — either by measurement or assumption).
Full cost Baseline cost as well as the additional/incremental cost of the new intervention, including vaccine cost.
Cost projection Estimation of future costs of both recurrent and capital inputs.
Prospective data collection Direct observation of resource use during intervention implementation; i.e. data are collected concurrently with intervention implementation.
Retrospective data collection Data collection after resource use is completed.
Start-up cost Cost of initial one-time programmatic activities. Examples may include initial micro-planning, initial training activities, and initial sensitization/social mobilization/information, education, and communication (IEC); does not include routine or repeated programmatic activities such as refresher training or annual microplanning. Start-up activities may include both recurrent and capital costs; they are defined by the non-repeating nature of the activity, not the type of input.
Micro-costing Focuses on granular accounting of input prices and quantities; disaggregates costs of particular output into specific goods and services consumed.
Bottom-up costing Measures input quantities at the client (e.g. per vaccination administered) or activity level.
Top-down costing Divides overall program cost or expenditures, often including those at administrative levels above service delivery level, by number of outputs to calculate unit cost.
Perspective The point of view considered for costs (and benefits, if included) in a costing study, by whom the costs were incurred. Payers are the disbursing agents for a good or service, and may differ from the original source of funding. A provider perspective includes costs incurred by health service providers (can be limited to the government), a payer perspective includes costs to the payer(s), such as government or an external partner, while the societal perspective includes all costs incurred by providers as well as clients.
Shared cost Shared resources that are not used only for immunization, but also for other productive activities.

### Codeine sulfate [^8aab0a63]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1
Important Dosage
and Administration
Instructions

Codeine sulfate tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.
Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of codeine sulfate tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.
Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.
There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with codeine sulfate tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

2.2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of
Opioid Overdose

Discussthe availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with codeine sulfate tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program).

Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)].

Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose.

### Oxymorphone hydrochloride (Opana) [^d4dab7ae]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Selection of patients for treatment with OPANA should be governed by the same principles that apply to the use of similar opioid analgesics [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Physicians should individualize treatment in every case [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)], using non-opioid analgesics, opioids on an as needed basis, combination products, and chronic opioid therapy in a progressive plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the American Pain Society.

OPANA should be administered on an empty stomach, at least one hour prior to or two hours after eating [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]

2.1 Individualization of Dosage

As with any opioid drug product, it is necessary to adjust the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's prior analgesic treatment experience. In the selection of the initial dose of OPANA, attention should be given to the following:

The total daily dose, potency and specific characteristics of the opioid the patient has been taking previously;
The relative potency estimate used to calculate the equivalent oxymorphone dose needed;
The patient's degree of opioid tolerance;
The age, general condition, and medical status of the patient;
Concurrent non-opioid analgesics and other medications;
The type and severity of the patient's pain;
The balance between pain control and adverse experiences;
Risk factors for abuse or addiction, including a prior history of abuse or addiction.

Once therapy is initiated, frequently assess pain relief and other opioid effects. Titrate dose to adequate pain relief (generally mild or no pain). Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment.

If signs of excessive opioid-related adverse experiences are observed, the next dose may be reduced. Adjust dosing to obtain an appropriate balance between pain relief and opioid-related adverse experiences. If significant adverse events occur before the therapeutic goal of mild or no pain is achieved, the events should be treated aggressively. Once adverse events are adequately managed, continue upward titration to an acceptable level of pain control.

During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, frequent contact is recommended between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family. Advise patients and family members of the potential common adverse reactions associated with changing opioid doses.

The dosing recommendations below, therefore, can only be considered as suggested approaches to what is actually a series of clinical decisions over time in the management of the pain of each individual patient.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^6527b9ff]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Adherence support and regimen selection for adults and adolescents with HIV — clinicians should obtain accurate information about a person's adherence and barriers to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and appointment adherence, followed by meaningful discussions on solutions, rather than simply instructing adherence and warning about potential consequences of poor adherence; approaches that do not address barriers erode the patient–provider relationship and have been demonstrated to not improve adherence. Core actions include to regularly assess adherence to ART and appointments; engage people struggling with adherence at any step on the care continuum with a constructive, collaborative, nonjudgmental, and problem-solving approach rather than reprimanding them or lecturing them on the importance of adherence; elicit an individual's barriers to adherence, which may include personal, behavioral, medical, structural, clinic, and system barriers; and tailor approaches to individual needs, for example by changing ART to simplify dosing or reduce side effects, finding resources to assist with copays or other out-of-pocket costs, maintaining an uninterrupted supply of ART, assuring access to clinicians, or linking people to counseling to overcome stigma, substance use, or mental illness. For people with adherence problems, utilize ART regimens with high genetic barriers to resistance — such as DTG, bictegravir, or boosted darunavir regimens — and when selecting the regimen, consider possible side effects, out-of-pocket costs, convenience, and individual preferences, because the only regimen that will work is the one that people can obtain and are willing and able to take. Recognize the need for multidisciplinary approaches to identify and address barriers, and clinicians should help people with HIV understand the importance of adherence to the continuum of care, identify and address immediate barriers, and link them to resources for overcoming obstacles.

### Six ways not to improve patient flow: a qualitative study [^056121c3]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2017). Medium credibility.

Implications

Figure 1 prompts decision-makers to rigorously interrogate proposed initiatives in terms of population, capacity and process. In addition, the following guiding questions provide a framework for considering the three aspects in tandem.
What populations are experiencing flow problems, and what are their needs? Differentiate among the major subgroups with different clusters of need; prioritise those that account for the greatest amount of potentially conservable utilisation.
What capacity is most suitable for meeting the identified needs, bearing in mind that different capacity may be required as patients' needs evolve? If appropriate, consider multiple suitable options, noting which ones are already present in the system.
What process does this population currently experience? Map the process, using data to locate the prime constraint that impedes or delays access to suitable capacity; the process' endpoint should be defined as the point at which the identified needs have been met.
What alternative process (es) could straightforwardly link the population to suitable capacity, avoiding the constraint? If new capacity and/or processes are proposed, how will these impact other populations? What is needed to ensure that new or released capacity is used for its intended purpose?

The suggested thought process conforms to standard flow-improvement methodology, but adds repeated reminders to take a system view, scrutinising how different parts of the system impinge on each other. Such thinking may help organisations move beyond a proliferation of piecemeal initiatives to a coherent strategy of identifying the most important constraints and following these as they move around the system. Without a system perspective to inform improvement efforts, the most promising initiative may become just another dismal entry in 'The How-Not-To Guide' to patient flow.

### Tetrabenazine [^0e1226b0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

When tetrabenazine (5, 15, and 30 mg/kg/day) was orally administered to pregnant rats from the beginning of organogenesis through the lactation period, an increase in stillbirths and offspring postnatal mortality was observed at 15 and 30 mg/kg/day and delayed pup maturation was observed at all doses. A no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity in rats was not identified. The lowest dose tested (5 mg/kg/day) was less than the MRHD on a mg/m² basis.

Because rats dosed orally with tetrabenazine do not produce 9-desmethyl-β-DHTBZ, a major human metabolite of tetrabenazine, the metabolite was directly administered to pregnant and lactating rats. Oral administration of 9-desmethyl-β-DHTBZ (8, 15, and 40 mg/kg/day) throughout the period of organogenesis produced increases in embryofetal mortality at 15 and 40 mg/kg/day and reductions in fetal body weights at 40 mg/kg/day, which was also maternally toxic. When 9-desmethyl-β-DHTBZ (8, 15, and 40 mg/kg/day) was orally administered to pregnant rats from the beginning of organogenesis through the lactation period, increases in gestation duration, stillbirths, and offspring postnatal mortality (40 mg/kg/day); decreases in pup weights (40 mg/kg/day); and neurobehavioral (increased activity, learning and memory deficits) and reproductive (decreased litter size) impairment (15 and 40 mg/kg/day) were observed. Maternal toxicity was seen at the highest dose. The no-effect dose for developmental toxicity in rats (8 mg/kg/day) was associated with plasma exposures (AUC) of 9-desmethyl-β-DHTBZ in pregnant rats lower than that in humans at the MRHD.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of tetrabenazine or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for tetrabenazine tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from tetrabenazine tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

Cost-effectiveness threshold for U.S. clinical guidelines — the writing committee "recommend the use of $120 000 per QALY as the cost-effectiveness threshold for clinical guidelines", with the threshold to be "periodically reexamined", "not be adjusted annually for inflation", and "revised every 10 years (or sooner…)". Supporting estimates include a 2024 Personal Consumption Expenditure update that "suggests a cost-effectiveness threshold of $117 000 per QALY", a welfare economics approach indicating willingness to pay tied to income ("per capita disposable income of $60 300… approximately $142 000 (range: $120 000-$175 000) for 1 QALY"), and a population-level framework using World Bank data estimating "$95 958 ($81 672-$120 181) per QALY", translating to "$112 000 ($96 000-$141 000) per QALY" after GDP growth; while "no single method… can be considered the 'gold standard'", these three approaches "produced similar results".

### Health and safety implications of recruitment payments in migrant construction workers [^6f268f3e]. Occupational Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The Middle East construction sector is heavily reliant on a migrant workforce that predominantly originates from South Asia. It is common practice for migrant construction workers to pay a local labour recruiter the equivalent of one or more years' prospective overseas salary to secure employment, work and travel permits and transportation. The occupational health and safety implications of these financial arrangements remain unexplored.

Aims

To examine associations between payment to a labour recruiter, perceived general health and worksite accidents among migrant construction workers in the Middle East.

Methods

A questionnaire was completed by a convenience sample of predominantly Indian migrant construction workers drawn from a large construction project. The relationship between payment and risk of poor health and workplace accidents was assessed using multivariate logistic regression models (crude and adjusted for socio-demographic and occupational factors).

Results

There were 651 participants. The majority (58%) of migrant construction workers had paid a labour recruiter and ~40% had experienced a worksite accident. Between 3% (labourers) and 9% (foremen) perceived their health to be poor. Labourers and skilled workers who had paid a labour recruiter were significantly more likely to have experienced a worksite accident in the previous 12 months. Skilled workers, but not labourers and foremen, who had paid a labour recruiter were at increased risk of poor health.

Conclusions

The mechanisms linking labour recruiter payments to adverse safety and health outcomes warrant investigation with a view to developing interventions to erode these links.

### Creating genetic reports that are understood by nonspecialists: a case study [^592f6046]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Formative evaluation

The primary goal of the formative evaluation was to identify and address the most serious usability problems with the reports, borrowing the definition of Lavery et al.:"an aspect of the system and/or a demand on the user which makes it unpleasant, inefficient, onerous or impossible for the user to achieve their goals in typical usage situations". Given that typical goals when receiving a genetic report are to (1) understand the contents and (2) to take appropriate next steps if necessary (or to advise the patient of appropriate next steps), we treated as usability problems issues that caused confusion, left participants with incorrect impressions, generated unnecessary anxiety, or decreased the odds that a participant would be able to get the assistance they needed to take appropriate next steps. After rounds 2–3, interviewer notes and partial transcriptions of participants' answers to interview questions were reviewed and coded in MaxQDA to identify and evaluate the most significant problems, highlight cases of poor comprehension, and assess the degree to which the reports met participants' information needs. Full coding and partial transcription from interview recordings were completed post hoc for round 1, but interviewer notes were reviewed and usability problems were enumerated and corrected prior to round 2 nevertheless. Our stop criterion for how many rounds of interviewing to conduct was that by the final round, no major usability problems should remain. Major usability problems are those for which "the user will probably use or attempt to use the product, but will be severely limited in his or her ability to do so"; we considered these to include issues that could leave recipients with a serious misconception.

Because we ultimately wished to run a summative evaluation focusing on subjective comprehension, risk probability comprehension, and communication efficacy, we categorized participant answers to questions intended to highlight usability issues that might affect these constructs in particular, as well as more exploratory constructs of interest (e.g. actionability, the degree to which "consumers of diverse backgrounds and varying levels of health literacy can identify what they can do based on the information presented"). These questions were asked to help determine whether there were problems in any of these domains so severe as to constitute a major usability problem.

Participant Selection and Study Procedure

Participants were recruited through word of mouth and flyers/infographics posted to social media platforms by members of the CRLB. We began each GLA with introductions and a brief icebreaker that encouraged participants to interact with new people (Step 1, Climate Setting). At each GLA session, individual‐level qualitative data were generated by attendees moving around the room and responding to open‐ended prompts displayed on flip charts (Step 2, Generating) throughout the room (eg, "If we really want to engage Tribal members in heart care, we have to… " "Best way/worst way to support people with heart problems is… " "Health care would be more accessible in our community if… ") The initial prompts were drafted across 5 domains (heart disease experience, health care in general, heart health care, community, models/strategies) and then shared with our CRLB for revisions and selection of the final prompts. An example of a completed flipchart is shown in Figure 2, and a full list of prompts can be found in Table S1. After they finished responding, attendees were instructed to walk around the room and look at what others had written (Step 3, Appreciating) noting any ideas that stood out or were surprising (Step 4, Reflecting). The large group was then divided into smaller groups, with 3 to 5 flipchart prompts assigned to each small group. Small groups were instructed to discuss the responses on the charts and to identify 3 common themes/main ideas across the charts (Step 5, Understanding). After each small group identified salient themes from their flip charts, all the attendees reunited, and each small group reported their findings in a round‐robin fashion with each group presenting 1 theme at a time. The facilitator recorded the major themes on a flip chart for the larger group to see. Attendees then recorded their top priority from the major themes to be collected by our team (Step 6, Selecting). At the end of each GLA, participants completed an exit survey containing demographic information and willingness to be contacted for future project activities for Step 7, Action (ie, design workshops).

### Current and future trends in the consumption, sale and purchasing of alcohol-free and low-alcohol products in great britain, 2014 to 2023 [^4f37fb5b]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Indicator 1: Percentage of total alcohol sales volume that are no/lo in the on‐trade

The percentage of total alcohol sales volume that are no/lo in the on‐trade has been increasing at a steadily accelerating rate since 2016 (Figure 1). At the end of our sample period (December 2023) the percentage of total alcohol sales volume in servings that are no/lo in the on‐trade is 0.8% If trends continue as they currently are, by the end of 2025 this is expected to rise to 0.9% (50% prediction interval = 0.8%–1.1%). The prediction intervals presented in this time series are asymmetric due to this series being log transformed for analysis.

FIGURE 1
Percentage of total alcohol sales volume that are no/lo in the on‐trade.

Indicator 2: Percentage of total alcohol sales volume that are no/lo in the off‐trade

The observed data shows substantially greater seasonality than the on‐trade data, with a large peak in January and smaller peaks in the summer months (Figure 2). The trend increases steadily to reach 1.5% by the end of December 2023. The forecast model estimated that this will rise to 2.3% by the end of 2025 (50% prediction interval = 2.1%–2.9%). The shorter time series for the Circana data means the prediction intervals are wider than our on‐trade market forecasts.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

AHA/ACC cost/value methodology — future and societal costs specifies that cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) from a health care sector perspective should "also capture all future costs", including "total health care sector costs during the added years of life" and "health care costs unrelated to the disease of interest", and that CEAs from a societal perspective "should also include non–health care consumption costs during the added years of life". For a societal perspective, analyses "should include illness- or treatment-related productivity losses resulting from decreased participation in formal and informal labor markets or change in household production, the value of the patient's time spent seeking care as well as any caregiver time, and when relevant, any costs borne by other sectors of the economy, such as education or criminal justice"; when elements cannot be measured, "an impact inventory can be used to discuss the limitations", and "a modified societal perspective may include some societal costs, such as patient time and lost productivity, but exclude costs, such as education, from other sectors of the economy".

### America's health care system is broken: what went wrong and how we can fix it. introduction to the series [^575e1cd3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Over the last half-century, medical science has dramatically improved throughout the world. Although costs have risen in all western countries as new technologies have been widely adopted, costs in the United States have risen much more than they have in any other country. Despite using fewer resources (eg, numbers of physicians and nurses, hospital beds) than do peer countries, per-capita spending on health care in the United States is double that in similar countries. The major driving force behind this difference is that we in the United States pay much more for the same products and services. There is no evidence that this increased spending gives better outcomes. Neither the general public nor doctors are happy with our current health care system. Subsequent articles will discuss the components of our system and how they are failing and how they can be improved.

### The current and future burden of long COVID in the United States [^84885dea]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Long COVID, which affects an estimated 44.69–48.04 million people in the U.S., is an ongoing public health concern that will continue to grow as SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread.

Methods

We developed a computational simulation model representing the clinical course, the health effects, and the associated costs of a person with Long COVID.

Results

Simulations show that the average total cost of a Long COVID case can range from $5,084-$11,646 (assuming symptoms only last 1 year) with 92.5%-95.2% of these costs being productivity losses. Therefore, the current number of Long COVID cases could end up costing society at least $2.01-$6.56 billion, employers at least $1.99-$6.49 billion in productivity losses, and third-party payers $21–68.5 million annually (6%-20% probability of developing Long COVID). These cases would accrue 35,808–121,259 QALYs lost and 13,484–45,468 DALYs. Moreover, each year, there may be an additional $698.5 million in total costs, 14,685 QALYs lost, and 5,628 DALYs, if the incidence of COVID is 100 per 10,000 persons (similar to that seen in 2023). Every 10-point increase in COVID incidence results in an additional $365 million in total costs, 5,070 QALYs lost, and 1,900 DALYs each year.

Conclusion

The current health and economic burden of Long COVID may already exceed that of a number of other chronic disease and will continue to grow each year as there are more and more COVID-19 cases. This could be a significant drain on businesses, third party payers, the healthcare system, and all of society.

### Towards spill-free in-bag morcellation: a health failure mode and effects analysis [^fc9cf15b]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Step 4: hazard analysis

For the complete process as determined in step 3, all possible hazards (the so-called failure modes, meaning how and why a process might fail) are identified. To rank these hazards from most to least serious, these failure modes are scored for their impact on patient health or safety ('severity') and their chance of occurring ('probability'). By multiplying the scores for severity and probability, a hazard score is calculated: high scores correspond with serious hazards. Severity was classified according to the following 4 categories: recovery without intervention (1 point), intervention needed for recovery (2 points), permanent damage or loss of function (3 points), and death (4 points) (Table 1). To maximize results of our analysis, any kind or amount of tissue spread or leakage was considered potentially lethal. 'Probability' was defined as occurring in less than 1000 procedures (1 point), between 1 in 100 and 1000 procedures (2 points), between 1 in 10 and 100 procedures (3 points), and 1 in 10 or more (4 points). A mean hazard score was calculated based on the individual scores provided by all participants. All participants calculated the hazard scores individually. Next, the scores were compared during the meetings and, in case of disagreement, discussed and adjusted to reach full agreement upon the final hazard score.

Table 1
Probability and severity score

Red — hazard score ≥ 8 represents a safety issue and should be addressed

Step 5: resolving serious hazards

The HFMEA decision tree is used to identify the failure modes that may cause safety issues and should therefore be eliminated. In short, this decision tree identifies all hazards with a hazard score ≥ 8 as a potential threat that needs to be addressed (Red in Table 1). Readily apparent hazards and hazards that are already known and controlled can be exempted. In addition, the decision tree identifies all critical steps in the process (the so-called single point of weaknesses, meaning that the technique would fail if this single step fails) even with a hazard score < 8.

After identifying these hazards, recommendations were formulated in our final meeting to control the most hazardous steps of the in-bag morcellation procedure.

### Grandparenting in the United States [^ff3bb105]. Innovation in Aging (2017). Low credibility.

Lack of Federal and Employer Supports for Working Families

Despite growing need, neither the U.S. welfare state nor U.S. employers have responded to the needs of young working families. Compared to most European nations, the U.S. welfare state provides little support for working families. Although 127 countries guarantee paid vacations, the United States has no federal vacation policy. This is most problematic for families with lower earnings. Just 27% of employed parents in the bottom quintile of earnings, compared to 77% in the top two quintiles, have paid vacation. Among those who have paid vacation, many working parents and grandparents use paid vacation days to care for children who would otherwise need childcare. Those without paid vacation time have one less option for providing childcare coverage.

Similarly, 44 million U.S. workers do not have paid sick days. Only 24% of employed parents in the lowest earnings quintile, compared to 76% in the upper two earnings quintiles, receive paid sick days. Workers use sick days to cover their own, their children's, and their grandchildren's, illnesses. Those without paid sick days often go to work when they or their children or grandchildren are ill, or face time off with lost wages or job loss.

The United States does not guarantee paid maternal or paternal leaves. Though 180 nations offer paid leave to new mothers and 81 offer paid leave to new fathers, the United States does not. The U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act offers 12 weeks of unpaid leave, but one-half of U.S. employees are ineligible, either because their employer has too few employees, they have not worked at that firm for a full year, they do not work enough hours, or the care recipient does not meet the qualifying criteria. Others opt out because they cannot afford time off without pay. Only 39% of workers earning less than $20,000 a year are covered by this law, compared to 74% of those earning over $100,000. Thus, those with lower incomes, who are single parents, and who are least likely to be able to afford time off without pay, are least likely to be able to take the leaves. When parents have no paid parental leave, they often turn to grandparents for grandchild care.

Step 1: Initial contact and response — purpose and key actions focus on intake, early evaluation, and education. The purpose of Step 1 is to collect information from the inquirer to determine whether the inquiry's concern warrants further follow-up, after which the health agency will need to decide whether to pursue the inquiry further, focusing on obtaining information the inquirer can provide as well as relevant data available to the health agency such as data from cancer registry, census, and environmental databases. The inquirer should be referred quickly to the responsible unit and the problem should not be dismissed prematurely, and although the majority of reports of potential clusters will be closed at the time of initial response because the inquirer's concerns are not consistent with a potential cancer cluster, the first encounter is often the health agency's best opportunity to educate about the nature of cancer and suspected cancer clusters. To be an effective initial responder, the health agency needs to understand the context of the inquirer's concern, the nature of the perceived problem, and the history of how it has or has not been reported to authorities.

### A qualitative analysis of the needs and wishes of people with type 2 diabetes and healthcare professionals for optimal diabetes care [^c31b897a]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Participatory Design

This project was guided by a Participatory Design approach, a user‐centred methodology originated from action research, which provides concerned parties the opportunity to contribute to the definition of a problem, its source and solutions.

The project involved a three‐step iterative process: (1) identification of needs, (2) generation of solution ideas and (3) testing and retesting of solutions (Figure 1). All steps were guided by key stakeholders' contributions, and information uncovered at each step influenced the next until a solution was designed and endorsed by all. Step 1 included a literature review, published separately as a systematic review, and review of grey literature. This article reports the subsequent part of step 1 — focus groups and interviews with stakeholders. The solutions and care pathways generated in steps 2 and 3 will be reported separately.

FIGURE 1
Participatory Design steps

2.2 Recruitment of participants

All PWD participants resided in Southeast Queensland, Australia, and were recruited at the Princess Alexandra Hospital (PAH) specialist diabetes outpatient clinic in Brisbane. Participants were 18 years or older, able to understand spoken and written English, and physically and mentally capable of participating in the study. The diabetes educators at the clinic informed PWD attending an appointment of the study and one researcher (DB) regularly visited the clinic to provide more information to those interested and manage consent and enrolment.

All specialist HCPs were staff members of the PAH diabetes clinic. Specialist diabetes teams include endocrinologists, diabetes educators and dietitians, among others. PWD who have complex diabetes beyond the perceived management capacity of the primary care practitioner are commonly referred to such services for additional support. The principal investigator and clinic director (AR) informed all team members about the study and a researcher (DB) approached them when visiting the clinic, outlining project details and managing consent and enrolment if interested. Primary HCPs were recruited at an external primary care network seminar and via snowball from various clinics in Brisbane.

Recruitment ceased when the sample held enough information power and new insights about the topic, considering the study aim, the use of an established framework and quality of information obtained. This was assessed continuously along the data collection process and initial data analysis.

2.3 Ethical considerations

All participants gave informed consent prior to participation. The project was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Metro South Hospital and Health Service and The University of Queensland (reference number: HREC/2018/QMS/48462).

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^bdeb2e46]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

National Lipid Association dyslipidemia management — statin therapy counseling and shared decision-making notes that the role of health care providers begins with identifying the patient's problem, assessing the patient's level of understanding, and then providing necessary education including verbal explanations and written materials, and that shared decision-making is integral to the provider-patient encounter. When discussing therapeutic options, the provider will need to specifically relate the reason for prescribing medication to the patient's condition; for example, in a patient with post-MI, the need for a high-intensity statin is paramount and has been shown to reduce subsequent cardiovascular events and mortality. It is important to discuss the potential side effects of prescribed atherogenic cholesterol-lowering therapies, including statin therapy, with all patients, including the potential for muscle aches and how the muscle ache might feel on statins; the provider should reinforce that the provider/office staff needs to be contacted if the patient believes he/she is experiencing an adverse effect, and patients should be assured that safety labs are checked when their lipid panel is checked. The provider should also explain that although statins are 1 "class" of drugs, statins individually are very different drugs from one another — a problem with 1 does not usually mean that all statins need to be avoided. A statin prescription should not be an automatic recommendation for a patient with elevated cholesterol; it is critically important to engage the patient in a discussion, review benefit vs risk of statin therapy, discuss all treatment options, and consider patient preferences.

### Bending the cost curve: time series analysis of a value transformation programme at an academic medical centre [^bbc0a10a]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

In the ITS analysis, fully adjusted total variable direct costs per case declined an average of 0.22% per month relative to baseline trends (95% CI −0.31 to −0.13), which was partially offset by a non-significant early increase of 1.95% (95% CI −0.12 to 4.06) in costs. This resulted in a net overall reduction in costs of 7.7% by the end of the study period relative to the expected cost without intervention (table 3). The medical cohort declined an average 0.20% per month (95% CI −0.33 to −0.08), while the surgical cohort declined 0.37% per month (95% CI −0.48 to −0.26). In dollar terms, these savings were equivalent to approximately $59.3 million overall ($10.3 million for medicine and $49.0 million for surgery patients). Intervention costs were approximately $1.5 million per year ($5.375 million in the study period), making net savings approximately $53.9 million.

Table 3
Cost outcomes from interrupted time series analysis

Our wage and CMI-adjusted expense per discharge dropped from 13% above the 50th percentile for COTH hospitals in 2014 Q1 to 2% above the 50th percentile in 2017 Q4. Cleverly and Associates data showed that by the end of 2016 our inpatient Medicare loss per case was close to average for academic medical centres.

LOS in days decreased by 0.25% per month relative to prior trends (95% CI −0.34 to 0.17), which represents an 11.8% relative decline over the course of the study period, or a decrease of approximately half a day (table 4).

Table 4
Length of stay, readmission and mortality outcomes from interrupted time series analysis

We did not find any statistically significant changes in the counterbalancing outcomes of 30-day same-hospital readmission rates and in-hospital mortality rates (table 4). On Hospital Compare, NYULH currently has a better than national average hospital-wide readmission rate and better than average mortality in three of the six reported conditions. Moreover, NYULH is currently ranked five stars (the maximum) in overall Medicare quality — an aggregate of 57 quality measures.

second concern was that the use of the reasonable charge payment had led, in many cases, to payments which were not directly related to the resources used. Under the new system, payments are made under a fee schedule which is based on a resource-based relative value scale. The new system is being phased in over the 1992-. patient contact. The practice expense or overhead component includes all categories of practice expenses. Included are office rents, employee wages, physician compensation, and physician fringe benefits. The malpractice expense component reflects costs of obtaining malpractice insurance. The proportion that each component represents of the total RVU. service. The law requires the establishment of an initial dollar conversion factor. The conversion factor is updated annually beginning in 1992.

The law required the calculation of an initial dollar conversion factor which was budget neutral relative to 1991 predicted expenditure levels. This means that if the initial. conversion factor had applied in 1991, Medicare spending would equal what was projected to be spent under the reasonable charge payment system in that year. The law also contained provisions relating to payment calculations during the 1992–96 phase-in period; these are the transition provisions. The Department's final implementing regulations included an. adjustment to reconcile the calculations required under both the budget neutrality and transition provisions. The initial dollar conversion factor was set at $30.
42. The 1992 update was set at

1. 9 percent. Therefore the 1992 conversion factor was $31.
001.

In 1993 two conversion factors applied — one for surgical services and one for nonsurgical services. The 1993 conversion factor for surgical services was $31. 96, and the conversion factor for nonsurgical services was $31.
25. Beginning in 1994, a third conversion factor applies for primary care services. The 1994 conversion factor for surgical services is $35. 15; the conversion factor for primary care services is $33. 72; the conversion factor for other nonsurgical services is $32.
91. Payment formula. In simplified terms the payment for each service is calculated as follows: PAYMENT = CFx. Transition rules. The law establishes specific payment rules for the 1992–1996 phase-in period. To determine payments in 1992, comparisons were made between the fee schedule amount and the ``adjusted historical payment basis" in the payment locality.

Generally, the AHPB was equal to the average. over or under the fee schedule amount, payments were made on the basis of the fee schedule beginning in 1992. A transition was provided in the case of differences larger than 15 percent. In 1992, the reduced AHPB amounts were increased or decreased by 15 percent of the fee schedule amount, whichever was. appropriate. Thus, for a service more than 15 percent below the fee schedule the payment equaled the reduced AHPB plus 15 percent fee schedule amount. For a service more than 15 percent above the fee schedule, the payment equaled the reduced AHPB minus 15 percent fee schedule amount. For 1993–95, payment is based on a blend of the previous year's amount and the fee schedule amount; over the period, a gradually increasing portion is based on the fee schedule. In 1993, 75 percent was based on the previous year's amount adjusted by the update.

Figure 2 tonic-clonic seizure reduction measure example — calculation details state that the measure requires tracking over two calendar years with a baseline in year 1 and evaluation in year 2. In the example, a neurologist sees 100 patients between January 1 and December 31, 2020 with recorded seizure frequency, including Thirteen seen multiple times. In 2021, all 100 patients return and Ten have multiple visits; for those patients, the first tonic-clonic seizure frequency score collected in 2021 is compared to the last score recorded in 2020. In 2021, the neurologist also sees 25 new patients, who are not included in the measure calculation due to lacking the required baseline or index event. On December 31, 2021, the practice's comparison finds that 53% of her patients have the same or fewer tonic-clonic seizures compared to 2020.

### Six steps in quality intervention development (6SQuID) [^139a29a2]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2016). Low credibility.

Improving the effectiveness of public health interventions relies as much on the attention paid to their design and feasibility as to their evaluation. Yet, compared to the vast literature on how to evaluate interventions, there is little to guide researchers or practitioners on how best to develop such interventions in practical, logical, evidence based ways to maximise likely effectiveness. Existing models for the development of public health interventions tend to have a strong social-psychological, individual behaviour change orientation and some take years to implement. This paper presents a pragmatic guide to six essential Steps for Quality Intervention Development (6SQuID). The focus is on public health interventions but the model should have wider applicability. Once a problem has been identified as needing intervention, the process of designing an intervention can be broken down into six crucial steps: (1) defining and understanding the problem and its causes; (2) identifying which causal or contextual factors are modifiable: which have the greatest scope for change and who would benefit most; (3) deciding on the mechanisms of change; (4) clarifying how these will be delivered; (5) testing and adapting the intervention; and (6) collecting sufficient evidence of effectiveness to proceed to a rigorous evaluation. If each of these steps is carefully addressed, better use will be made of scarce public resources by avoiding the costly evaluation, or implementation, of unpromising interventions.

### Co-producing an intervention to reduce sedentary behaviour in community-dwelling older adults aged ≥ 75 informed by behaviour change theory [^5594f388]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

BCW Stage 1: Understanding of the behaviour

To understand a behaviour, it is necessary to define it in behavioural terms by identifying the target population engaged in the behaviour and the behaviour itself. Following this, one must identify the behaviour(s) that need to be addressed to solve the problem, the locations where the behaviour is carried out, and the population involved. This stage of the BCW was informed by a preceding mixed-method review. A behavioural diagnosis was also undertaken in the second workshop.

Step 1: Define the behaviour in behavioural terms

This study defined the problem as reducing prolonged sedentary behaviour in community-dwelling older adults. The study focus was conveyed to participants during recruitment and reiterated during the first workshop.

Step 2: Selecting the target behaviour

This step involves creating comprehensive lists of all other behaviours that could impact the target behavioural issue. This can be systematically minimised by evaluating the potential influence of each of these behaviours. For this research project, behaviours such as physical inactivity, sedentary behaviour, and sitting time were considered.

Step 3: Specifying the target behaviour

Once a target behaviour is chosen, it must be clearly defined with a detailed description of the behaviour and identification. The co-production group chose their preferred terminology during the first workshop (i.e. reduce time spent sitting and lying down). The target behaviour was further specified as reducing excessive sedentary behaviour in community-dwelling older adults. The behaviour is specified according to the criteria described by the BCW in Table 3.

Table 3
Specification of Behaviour according to the Behaviour Change Wheel

Step 4: Identify what needs to change

The last step of Stage 1 involves identifying necessary changes in the individual and/or surroundings to achieve the desired behavioural change. Intervention developers should conduct a behavioural analysis to identify necessary changes by understanding the target behaviour within its context. A 'behavioural diagnosis' was undertaken in the second workshop, identifying barriers and facilitators to reducing sedentary behaviour. Barriers and facilitators were generated by the group members and supplemented with findings from an earlier review.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analysis perspectives — Table 1 delineates cost components and examples by perspective (Health Care Sector, "Modified Societal", Full Societal). Components and examples include health care costs paid by third-party payers (drug/device costs, hospital services, physician services, home care services, allied health), costs paid out-of-pocket by patients (drug copayment/coinsurance and user fees), patient-time costs (time spent seeking care), unpaid caregiver-time costs (time spent in caregiving), and productivity losses (formal/informal labor earnings lost, cost of unpaid lost productivity due to illness, cost of uncompensated household production). Broader sectors listed include social services, housing, legal or criminal justice, education, and environmental. Footnotes instruct that analysts should attempt to capture all relevant costs from a societal perspective and describe a "modified" societal perspective that includes some societal costs, such as patient time and lost productivity, but excludes costs from other sectors of the economy.

### The economics of vision impairment and its leading causes: a systematic review [^da15fb4b]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

To enhance the comparability of the data, costs reported for any year prior to 2018 were inflated to 2018 values using a country-specific gross domestic product deflator, and then converted to USD ($) purchasing power parities (ppp)to equalise the purchasing power of different currencies. Whenever the year of cost data was not reported, the year of publication was used as a proxy (more details in supplementary Appendix 2 p 2–3).

Cost components reported in each study are summarised in supplementary Table 1 (supplementary Appendix p 4–6). We compared all cost categories against a standard framework (supplementary data Appendix 2 p 2–3) and recategorized components where indicated to increase comparability between studies.

The process outlined by Mandrik et al. was followed to decide whether to combine studies. Costs were synthesized in a structured narrative way using seven summary tables: two for studies reporting global and national estimates and five tables reporting average costs. Costs were reported in four categories: direct costs, productivity costs, informal care costs and intangible costs. The unit of observation was reported for average costs and included costs per episode of care (for all services provided within a specified period of time such as medical appointments, tests and treatments), costs per patient (for all episodes of care provided in a specific period of time), costs per surgery and costs per spectacles. Whenever information was available, we classified direct costs as direct medical (e.g. inpatient care, outpatient care, medical prescriptions and medical examinations) or direct non-medical costs (e.g. home care, transport), and costs of productivity losses as morbidity-related (e.g. absenteeism, presenteeism, reduced workforce participation) or mortality-related productivity losses (i.e. productivity losses due to premature mortality). Intangible costs were reported in non-monetary measures, such as QALYs foregone and DALYs gained, because objective monetary valuation of intangible costs is controversial and there is no common acceptable value across countries, (more details provided in supplementary data Appendix 2 p 2–3).

### Sirolimus [^a405ec1c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

a: Patients received cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

b: Includes patients who prematurely discontinued treatment.

The reduction in the incidence of first biopsy-confirmed acute rejection episodes in patients treated with sirolimus compared with the control groups included a reduction in all grades of rejection.

In Study 1, which was prospectively stratified by race within center, efficacy failure was similar for sirolimus oral solution 2 mg/day and lower for sirolimus oral solution 5 mg/day compared with azathioprine in Black patients. In Study 2, which was not prospectively stratified by race, efficacy failure was similar for both sirolimus oral solution doses compared with placebo in Black patients. The decision to use the higher dose of sirolimus oral solution in Black patients must be weighed against the increased risk of dose-dependent adverse events that were observed with the sirolimus oral solution 5-mg dose [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

 TABLE 11: PERCENTAGE OF EFFICACY FAILURE BY RACE AT 6 MONTHS

a: Patients received cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

b: Includes patients who prematurely discontinued treatment.

Mean glomerular filtration rates (GFR) post-transplant were calculated by using the Nankivell equation at 12 and 24 months for Study 1, and 12 and 36 months for Study 2. Mean GFR was lower in patients treated with cyclosporine and sirolimus oral solution compared with those treated with cyclosporine and the respective azathioprine or placebo control.

 TABLE 12: OVERALL CALCULATED GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATES (Mean ± SEM, cc/min) BY NANKIVELL EQUATION POST-TRANSPLANT

a: Includes patients who prematurely discontinued treatment.

b: Patients who had a graft loss were included in the analysis with GFR set to 0.0.

Within each treatment group in Studies 1 and 2, mean GFR at one-year post-transplant was lower in patients who experienced at least one episode of biopsy-proven acute rejection, compared with those who did not.

Renal function should be monitored, and appropriate adjustment of the immunosuppressive regimen should be considered in patients with elevated or increasing serum creatinine levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

 Sirolimus tablets

The safety and efficacy of sirolimus oral solution and sirolimus tablets for the prevention of organ rejection following renal transplantation were demonstrated to be clinically equivalent in a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Implementation evaluation of multiple complex early years interventions: an evaluation framework and study protocol [^bf774844]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Data collection

Data for the implementation evaluation will be derived from a number of sources:

Quantitative data collected by intervention teams

Prior to the implementation of each intervention, a service design process takes place in collaboration with commissioners, intervention delivery teams, academic researchers and other stakeholders including health professionals and community representatives to ensure each intervention meets the needs of the local population. During this process, recruitment targets and process and outcome data to be collected by intervention teams throughout the delivery period and submitted quarterly to the research team are also agreed. A guide to the service evaluation process and templates including a minimum dataset for implementation evaluation is available on our website.

Satisfaction questionnaires

We have developed a brief six-item satisfaction questionnaire to capture participants' satisfaction across all interventions (see online supplementary additional file 1). Questions are based on the key constructs of commonly used patient satisfaction surveys, but have been adapted following advice from our Community Research Advisory Group (CRAG), composed of local parents and volunteers alongside intervention team managers, commissioners and the research team to ensure acceptability for the local community. This process resulted in a questionnaire that is brief and uses visual cues and simple language that can be easily understood and translated into other languages.

Semi-structured interviews and focus groups

Semistructured interviews and/or focus groups, where appropriate, will be undertaken with intervention participants and delivery teams to allow more in-depth exploration of elements of the conceptual model. Topic guides will be based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). The TDF encompasses a comprehensive range of constructs from theories of behaviour change including beliefs about capabilities, knowledge, skills, emotions and social influences. Furthermore, use of the TDF provides a firm theoretical basis to allow understanding of the mechanisms of action as well as the barriers and facilitators of implementation. It has been extensively applied to investigate and address implementation problems. While the interview questions may differ by intervention, use of the TDF ensures the underlying theoretical concepts explored in all interviews are explored using a consistent approach.

All studies will include data from sources 1 and 2. In-depth qualitative work may be triggered in response to issues identified by interventions such as difficulties in engaging families from particular ethnic groups, low completion rates and priorities highlighted by the commissioning team.

Eligibility

Inclusion criteria for all participants are listed in box 1.

Box 1
