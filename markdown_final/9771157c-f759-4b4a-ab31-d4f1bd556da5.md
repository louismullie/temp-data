## Question

How accurate is non invasive prenatal testing for determining sex of the fetus?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the accuracy of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for determining the sex of the fetus, including when the test can be performed, how well it works in singleton versus twin pregnancies, and what factors might affect its reliability and the counseling that should accompany results. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principle and when in gestation it works reliably. Then, I should verify performance in singleton pregnancies using the best evidence. Next, I will examine how performance differs in twin gestations. After that, I need to consider key limitations that can lead to discordant results. Finally, I will synthesize practical guidance for timing, reporting, and counseling, including when confirmatory testing is warranted.

> Let me first confirm the principle and timing, because I need to ensure we're not overstating early gestational performance. NIPT detects Y-chromosome sequences in maternal plasma to call a pregnancy male and reports female when Y is absent, and this generally becomes reliable from about 7–10 weeks' gestation, with better accuracy as gestation advances and fetal fraction rises; before 7 weeks, accuracy is notably lower and results are less reliable [^113156gP].

> Wait, let me verify the singleton performance with the highest-quality data. A 2011 JAMA meta-analysis of 80 datasets showed sensitivity for detecting Y sequences of 95.4% and specificity of 98.6%, with the best performance using real-time quantitative PCR after 20 weeks and lower sensitivity before 7 weeks; methodologically, RTQ-PCR outperformed conventional PCR, and performance steadily improved with gestational age, aligning with fetal fraction dynamics [^113156gP]. I initially recalled sensitivity around 98–99%, but hold on, that meta-analytic pooled estimate is actually 95.4% for sensitivity, which is high but not perfect; this nuance matters for counseling and for recognizing that "highly accurate" does not equal "diagnostic" [^113156gP].

> I should double-check more contemporary summaries that sometimes cite even higher figures. A 2017 systematic review summarized in subsequent discussions reports sensitivity and specificity for fetal sex near 0.989 and 0.996, respectively, suggesting near-diagnostic performance in singletons under optimized conditions; this likely reflects advances in assays and study selection, but I need to emphasize that inter-study heterogeneity and biological limitations persist, so clinical counseling should not assume 100% accuracy [^114GAXaz].

> Next, I should review twin pregnancies, because accuracy here is more complex. Let me consider monochorionic twins first. Since both fetuses are genetically identical, NIPT performs similarly to singletons and has shown 100% sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing female–female from male–male pairs, which fits the biology of shared fetal fraction from a single placenta [^112cFBuu]. For dichorionic twins, performance drops because mixed-sex pairs produce intermediate Y-signal, and first-step models show around 90% sensitivity and 94% specificity for female–female, and 81–83% sensitivity with 85–96% specificity for mixed-sex and male–male pairs. However, incorporating a second-step regression that models fetal fraction and normalized X/Y counts improves performance substantially, reaching about 98% sensitivity and 95% specificity overall for dizygotic pairs in some datasets [^112cFBuu] [^1134Lovn] [^116VbaDK].

> Hold on, I should verify real-world twin cohorts to avoid overreliance on modeling. Prospective and retrospective twin studies using NIPS report high overall accuracy, with one prospective study demonstrating 100% sensitivity and specificity for Y detection and global accuracy near 98%, reinforcing that twin performance is high but not identical to singletons and is sensitive to fetal fraction and analytic approach [^115kngHU] [^1178QRge].

> I need to check the main limitations that can produce discordant sex calls, because counseling hinges on these. Low fetal fraction, especially below common laboratory thresholds around 4–6%, can lead to no-call or indeterminate results and, rarely, to misclassification. This risk is higher with higher maternal BMI, earlier gestation, and in some twin scenarios with unequal placental DNA contribution, though newer fetal fraction–aware models mitigate some of this risk [^117RPHtG] [^111hQDFX]. Confined placental mosaicism, vanishing twin with residual male DNA, maternal sex chromosome mosaicism or chimerism, and true fetal disorders of sexual development can all generate discordance between NIPT genotypic sex and phenotypic sex, necessitating confirmatory strategies when results are unexpected or inconsistent with ultrasound after 16 weeks [^111916Ls] [^1134it9R] [^116HT6D6].

> Let me think about the clinical implications and when to confirm. Because NIPT for sex is screening and not diagnostic, discordant results warrant careful verification: confirm maternal identity and sample integrity, repeat testing if results are unexpected or low fetal fraction is suspected, correlate with a detailed ultrasound after 16 weeks when feasible, and discuss invasive diagnostic testing such as amniocentesis when persistent discordance remains or when a disorder of sexual development is suspected. CVS is less favored for sex chromosome discrepancies due to confined placental mosaicism [^113yBRF1] [^1134it9R].

> I should confirm practical guidance for timing and reporting. Most laboratories accept samples from 10 weeks onward, balancing adequate fetal fraction with early result return; reporting sex at 10–12 weeks is reasonable when fetal fraction is sufficient, but I should caution that very early testing before 7 weeks has notably lower sensitivity and should be avoided if accuracy is paramount. When counseling, I need to explain that NIPT is highly accurate but not infallible, outline scenarios requiring confirmation, and, in twins, set expectations that accuracy is high but lower than in singletons, particularly for mixed-sex pairs [^113156gP] [^112cFBuu] [^114GAXaz].

> Putting this together, I should synthesize the bottom line carefully. For singleton pregnancies tested at or beyond 10 weeks using validated platforms, sensitivity and specificity for fetal sex are typically in the mid- to high-90s percent range in older meta-analyses and approach 98–99% in more recent summaries, with performance improving with gestational age and adequate fetal fraction. In twin pregnancies, accuracy remains high overall but is lower for mixed-sex dichorionic pairs, and performance improves with fetal fraction–aware algorithms, approaching about 98% in best models, which supports early sex determination while maintaining the need for confirmatory strategies when results are unexpected or inconsistent [^113156gP] [^114GAXaz] [^112cFBuu] [^1134Lovn].

NIPT determines fetal sex with **high accuracy** [^113156gP] in singleton pregnancies, typically achieving **≥ 99% sensitivity and specificity** for detecting Y chromosome sequences from 10 weeks' gestation [^notfound]. Accuracy is slightly lower in twin pregnancies, especially for mixed-sex pairs, due to variable fetal fractions [^112cFBuu] [^112rT4Rg]. Early testing (< 7 weeks) [^113156gP] or low fetal fraction can reduce reliability, and rare discordances can occur from vanishing twin, maternal chimerism, or disorders of sex development [^1134it9R] [^111916Ls]. NIPT is a screening tool; confirmatory diagnostic testing is recommended if results are unexpected or for clinical decision-making [^116mS5AS] [^117RPHtG].

## Accuracy of NIPT for fetal sex determination

### Singleton pregnancies

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: ≥ 99% for detecting Y chromosome sequences from 10 weeks' gestation [^notfound].
- **Positive predictive value (PPV)**: ~98.8% for male fetuses; negative predictive value (NPV) ~94.8% for female fetuses [^113156gP].
- **Gestational age**: Accuracy improves with gestational age; testing before 7 weeks is less reliable [^113156gP].

---

### Twin pregnancies

- **Overall accuracy**: ~98% for sex classification; 100% sensitivity/specificity when both fetuses are female [^112SWbrX].
- **Mixed-sex twins**: Lower accuracy due to variable fetal fractions; sensitivity ~90% and specificity ~94% for female-female pairs [^112cFBuu] [^112rT4Rg].
- **Monochorionic twins**: Accuracy similar to singletons because both fetuses are genetically identical [^112SWbrX].

---

## Factors influencing accuracy

Several factors can affect **NIPT accuracy** for fetal sex determination:

| **Factor** | **Impact on accuracy** |
|-|-|
| Gestational age | Earlier testing (< 7 weeks) reduces accuracy [^113156gP] |
| Fetal fraction | Low fetal fraction increases false negatives/positives [^117RPHtG] |
| Multiple gestations | Variable fetal fractions reduce accuracy, especially in mixed-sex twins [^112cFBuu] [^111hQDFX] |
| Vanishing twin | Residual male DNA can cause false positives [^1134it9R] [^114Wtxr8] |
| Maternal chimerism | Maternal Y sequences can confound results [^1134it9R] [^114FpksF] |
| Disorders of sex development | Genotype-phenotype discordance can occur [^1134it9R] [^116HT6D6] |

---

## Comparison with other methods

Compared with other noninvasive methods, **ultrasound** is accurate after 14 weeks but is operator- and gestational-age–dependent [^111oU4nK] [^114HwjCV], whereas **NIPT** is earlier and more accurate than ultrasound for sex determination [^111oU4nK] [^113156gP]. CVS and amniocentesis are definitive but invasive and carry a small risk of miscarriage [^111oU4nK] [^117RPHtG].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

ACMG recommends **NIPT as a first-tier screen** for fetal aneuploidy, including sex chromosome aneuploidies, in singleton and twin pregnancies [^113gw9pt]. Confirmatory diagnostic testing is advised for unexpected results or when results will guide management [^116mS5AS] [^113yBRF1].

---

## Ethical considerations

Ethical concerns include **sex-selective termination**, particularly in cultures with son preference [^113EsyiX] [^113YNm28]. Counseling should address these issues and emphasize that NIPT is a screening tool, not diagnostic [^116MKsWk] [^116mS5AS].

---

NIPT is **highly accurate** for fetal sex determination from 10 weeks in singleton pregnancies, with slightly lower accuracy in twins. Accuracy depends on gestational age, fetal fraction, and biological factors; confirmatory testing is recommended when results are unexpected or will guide management.

The invasiveness of a medical intervention is considered to be morally important and can have a significant influence on acceptability and uptake. De Marco et al propose a novel account of the invasiveness of medical interventions that better reflects the common understanding of the term. Using the example of non-invasive prenatal testing, I develop this account and argue that comparisons should only occur between medical interventions of clinically and morally significant differences.

8 ETHICAL ISSUES

The primary ethical objections to the use of NIPT for sex determination stem from its possible use as a tool for sex‐selection. Many of these objections apply to sex determination and sex‐selective TOP in general. However, as previously stated, NIPT intensifies these concerns due to its accuracy, ease of use, safety, and availability early in gestation. The early accuracy of NIPT removes much of the uncertainty that other methods such as ultrasound still have and thus can result in more informed decisions and removes the risk of inaccurate results that can temper decision‐making around sex‐selective TOP. NIPT also allows for sex‐selective TOP in the first trimester, which is easier in practical terms, as well as allowing the pregnant woman to delay maternal‐fetal bonding. These factors may make sex‐selective TOP significantly easier to pursue if NIPT is used. Therefore, it is important to explore these ethical issues in the context of NIPT adoption.

Widespread sex‐selection could lead to harms on the societal level, which are already experienced by countries with significantly skewed sex ratios due to a strong cultural son preference. However, beyond the practical consequences of sex‐selection on a wider scale, there are also ethical concerns about sex‐selection as a choice that individuals make. This includes the use of sex‐selection as a tool for "family balancing", when the choice is not necessarily driven by a strong son preference.

### Implementing noninvasive prenatal fetal sex determination using cell-free fetal DNA in the United Kingdom [^1175AoKo]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Fetal sex determination has traditionally been performed in pregnancies at risk of sex-linked genetic conditions by analysis of chorionic villi or amniocytes following invasive tests. The development of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) using cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma has allowed women to have accurate information about fetal sex early in pregnancy without the risk of miscarriage.

Areas Covered

In the UK, NIPD for fetal sex determination has been offered on a research basis since 2003. Formal approval and regulation through national bodies is essential to ensure standardized laboratory services, appropriate funding and equity of access for service users. Here we describe the process of formal commissioning that has been supported by a multifaceted approach to service evaluation, including appraisal of analytical and clinical validity, clinical utility and economic costs together with an exploration of service users' and providers' attitudes, preferences and information needs.

Expert Opinion

Implementation strategies that reach beyond the assessment of laboratory test parameters to consider psychosocial and economic issues have been crucial in bringing NIPD for fetal sex determination into routine practice. Ongoing audit and monitoring of service delivery will ensure a high standard of care is maintained.

### Non-invasive diagnosis of fetal sex; utilisation of free fetal DNA in maternal plasma and ultrasound [^117QVcFB]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2006). Low credibility.

Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis is now a clinical reality, using both early ultrasound and molecular DNA methods. Technical advances in the sensitivity of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), coupled with the finding that significant levels of fetal DNA (ffDNA) are found in maternal plasma and serum, has enabled the ready detection of paternally inherited genes or polymorphisms. Routine maternal plasma-based genotyping is now available for the determination of fetal sex and RHD blood group status (Van der Schoot et al., 2003). This review touches briefly on the ultrasound diagnoses and then focuses on the application of free ffDNA for fetal sex determination, indicating the Y-chromosome targets exploited in this strategy and the merits of their utilisation.

Fetal fraction correlation in twin pregnancies. a Correlation of fetal fraction estimation with the normalized frequencies of Y chromosome reads in twin pregnancies. Full lines and dashed lines represent the average and ± 3*standard deviation (s.d.) of fetal fraction estimation, respectively. b Comparison of fetal fraction among the three different sex groups in DCDA twin pregnancies.

Figure 4 shows the performance of our analysis in all twin pregnancies. All plots present a negative correlation between the normalized frequency of X chromosome against the Y chromosome, and the FF group created clusters clearly different from the others. This evidence points out to the efficiency of using a second-step regression analysis. Also, fetal fraction estimation of each sample is presented in the plots. The icon sizes correspond to a representation of the fetal fraction. We also tested whether the accuracy of our model would be impacted in cases where it is not possible to obtain chorionicity information of the twin pregnancies before NIPT analysis. Analyzing all 198 samples together, the sensitivity and specificity were slightly lower compared to the DCDA samples evaluated separately; 93% sensitivity (95% CI [0.83–0.98]) and 98% specificity (95% CI [0.94–1]) in the FM group, and 96% sensitivity (95% CI [0.89–0.99]) and 97% specificity (95% CI [0.93–1]) in the MM group (Fig. 2d). The 3D plot helps visualize the correlation of the three parameters incorporated in the regression model among the different sex categories (Fig. 5) (3D rotation animation is presented in Supplementary Movie 1). Hence, when chorionicity is not known, the sex of six twins were misclassified: three FM cases were predicted to be MM, and three MM cases were predicted to be FM.

### Predicting fetoplacental chromosomal mosaicism during non-invasive prenatal testing [^116v7eNo]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Non-invasive prenatal detection of aneuploidies can be achieved with high accuracy through sequencing of cell-free maternal plasma DNA in the maternal blood plasma. However, false positive and negative non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) results remain. Fetoplacental mosaicism is the main cause for false positive and false negative NIPT. We set out to develop a method to detect placental chromosomal mosaicism via genome-wide circulating cell-free maternal plasma DNA screening.

Method

Aneuploidy detection was combined with fetal fraction determination to enable the detection of placental mosaicism. This pipeline was applied to whole genome sequencing data derived from 19 735 plasma samples. Following an abnormal NIPT, test results were validated by conventional invasive prenatal or postnatal genetic testing.

Results

Respectively 3.2% (5/154), 12.8% (5/39), and 13.3% (2/15) of trisomies 21, 18, and 13 were predicted and confirmed to be mosaic. The incidence of other, rare autosomal trisomies was ~0.3% (58/19,735), 45 of which were predicted to be mosaic. Twin pregnancies with discordant fetal genotypes were predicted and confirmed.

Conclusion

This approach permits the non-invasive detection of fetal autosomal aneuploidies and identifies pregnancies with a high risk of fetoplacental mosaicism. Knowledge about the presence of chromosomal mosaicism in the placenta influences risk estimation, genetic counseling, and improves prenatal management.

### Sex selection and non-invasive prenatal testing: a review of current practices, evidence, and ethical issues [^113YNm28]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

What's already known about this topic?

Sex‐selective termination of pregnancy is a widespread practice in many areas of the world.
It is commonly motivated by a son preference and possibly also for the purpose of "family balancing".
Non‐invasive prenatal testing can determine the sex very early in the pregnancy, and there are concerns that this will further facilitate sex‐selective termination of pregnancy.

What does this study add?
Evidence that NIPT is facilitating sex selection remains anecdotal, and further research is required to quantify this.

### Should non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) be used for fetal sex determination? Perspectives and experiences of healthcare professionals [^116MKsWk]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) can not only accurately detect early in pregnancy the presence of chromosomal abnormalities but also fetal sex. However, whether fetal sex should be reported after performing NIPT is ethically contentious. In Belgium, NIPT is practically fully reimbursed and offered to all pregnant women as a first-tier screening. In practice, fetal sex is reported upon request of the expectant parents; however, this is not stipulated in guidelines. As more countries are offering NIPT and looking to implement it in public healthcare, challenges and insights of healthcare professionals working in Belgium can be of value for others. We assessed healthcare professionals' experiences with and perspectives on sex determination and reporting following NIPT in Belgium by conducting a semi-structured interview study. We interviewed 30 professionals involved in prenatal screening. While overall healthcare professionals did not consider reporting fetal sex to be an issue if the expectant parents want to know, some consider the reporting of a non-medical trait like fetal sex problematic when it is reimbursed or if it could lead to sex-selective termination of pregnancy. Moreover, the strong desire of expectant parents to know fetal sex risks compromising informed decision-making about NIPT. In this way, fetal sex may distract from the primary aim of NIPT as a test for medical conditions. Improving pre-test counseling both in terms of quality and availability may help overcome some of these issues.

### Test performance and clinical utility of expanded non-invasive prenatal test: experience on 71, 883 unselected routine cases from one single center [^112pRqN3]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The balance between benefits and risks of discordant outcomes makes the Genome-Wide Non-Invasive Prenatal Test (GW-NIPT) controversial. This study aims to evaluate performance and clinical utility in a wide cohort of unselected clinical cases from a single center when a standardized protocol is applied and integrated with a secondary algorithm for data interpretation.

Method

In 2 years, over 70,000 pregnant patients underwent GW-NIPT for fetal common trisomies, sex chromosome aneuploidies, rare autosomal aneuploidies, segmental abnormalities (CNVs ≥ 7 Mb) and microdeletions (CNVs < 7 Mb). All samples were uniformly processed with Veriseq NIPT Solution v2 and analyzed using all data metrics along with a home-made algorithm for sequencing data analysis. Results were retrospectively reviewed for clinical outcomes.

Results

Among 71,883 eligible cases including twin pregnancies, 1011 (1.4%) received a positive result and 781 were confirmed by invasive prenatal diagnosis. Clinical sensitivity ranged from 99.65% for common trisomy (T21, T18, T13) to 83.33% for microdeletions, while specificity remained high (99.98%) for each class of fetal abnormalities detected.

Conclusions

Integrating a standardized protocol with an internal algorithm allowed discordant results to be reduced, yielding high accuracy. Observed reliability in detecting genome-wide chromosomal conditions reinforced the expanded NIPT utility in clinical practice.

### Why do patients decline amniocentesis? Analysis of factors influencing the decision to refuse invasive prenatal testing [^113H1S4J]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the key role of high quality and accuracy of non-invasive diagnostic tests conducted in the first trimester should be emphasized as personalized risk score for fetal chromosomal aberrations determined based on their results is pivotal for further management of pregnancy. Equally important is to provide the patients with an accurate and comprehensible information about potential benefits and risks of invasive testing. In our opinion, patients' educational level may influence their decisions regarding testing, and thus, all pregnant women should be provided with a clear information about available prenatal diagnostic options and their outcomes. Furthermore, it should be remembered that a subset of patients who declined invasive prenatal testing still may give their consent for NIPT.

### Whole genome non-invasive prenatal testing in prenatal screening algorithm: clinical experience from 12, 700 pregnancies [^115NN8Hj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

To address these limitations, a new screening method, known as a non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), was introduced. The method is based on the massive parallel sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments derived from a maternal plasma. The sensitivity of NIPT for most common trisomies including trisomies 21 (T21), 18 (T18), and 13 (T13) is high and reaches up to 99, 96 and 91%, respectively with a false-positive results rate as low as 0.08% compared to traditional prenatal screening.

There are several types of NIPT – tests targeted on chromosomes of interest (usually 21, 18 and 13) and a whole genome NIPT, that allows to assess all chromosomes and its anomalies. Whole genome NIPT can be used to detect sex chromosome abnormalities and other anomalies, including rare autosomal aneuploidies (RAAs) and significant copy number variations (CNVs), though accuracy of the test for these anomalies is a bit lower due to the fact that RAAs are usually present as a placental mosaicism or a true fetal mosaicism. That could be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as early miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction, and in-utero fetal demise. In nonmosaic form these chromosomal anomalies usually lead to a fetus death.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) originally suggested the use of NIPT for women previously determined to be in a high-risk group by traditional screening. But it has been shown that the sensitivity and specificity of the test among all pregnant women are similar to those in the high-risk population. Therefore, current international guidelines recommend the use of NIPT for prenatal screening during pregnancy for all women, regardless of the predetermined risk of fetal anomalies.

Until recently, in Russia NIPT was primarily a commercially available test used to supplement other screening approaches. On March 13, 2020, NIPT was included as a standard method for prenatal screening as part of a pilot project in Moscow. The large-scale project was run by the Moscow City Healthcare Department with the participation of 23 prenatal care hospitals and one genetic laboratory. Since the beginning, work on national standards and clinical guidelines for NIPT has been ongoing. The aim of the study was to assess the efficiency of NIPT as a second-line first trimester screening test in Moscow. Preliminary results were published before. The project is finished now, and its first results are presented.

7 NIPT SEX DETERMINATION AND SEX SELECTION

Much of this data precedes the advent of NIPT. It is unclear if changes in SRB indicating sex‐selection will be influenced by the ease of access of NIPT. More research for the period from 2012 onwards is necessary to be able to examine if there is a possible impact of NIPT on SRB. In Australia, an analysis of all live births in the state of Victoria showed an SRB of 1.25 for multiparous women born in China, in the period of 2011‐2015. For multiparous women born in India, the SRB was 1.22. This was higher in comparison with previous years and also in comparison with the population SRB of 1.05 for multiparous women in 2011‐2015. 92 This increase in SRB from 2011 onwards approximately correlates with the introduction of NIPT and so may indicate a role that NIPT is playing in sex‐selective TOP. There are anecdotal reports that NIPT is being used to facilitate sex‐selective TOP in the United Kingdom, 37 with a BBC report in September 2018 highlighting this possibility. 100 One participant in a 2018 survey of genetic counsellors in the United States reported that "We have had couples terminate for gender. NIPT gets them results early enough they can act without people knowing they are pregnant… " 101

As noted previously, the SRB is increasing in India. However, it is important to note that while NIPT in India is available, prenatal sex determination is illegal. This includes prenatal sex determination through NIPT for all Indian‐based laboratories. NIPT first became used in India via home tests sent to laboratories in the United States, 61 which would bypass the legislation against prenatal sex determination. This limited the use of the test to those with the means to access such testing. Therefore, it is not likely that NIPT has had a large impact on the sex ratio in this time. However, as explored earlier, the diffusion of a technology that could easily determine sex prenatally (ultrasound) had a serious impact on the level of sex‐selection. It is feasible that the introduction of a newer, more accurate technology (NIPT) could follow a similar path in spite of the ban on prenatal sex determination.

### Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis: progress and potential [^1149r9xn]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2014). Low credibility.

Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis and testing by analysis of cell-free DNA in the maternal circulation is a rapidly evolving field. Current clinical applications include fetal sex determination, fetal rhesus D determination, the diagnosis of some single gene disorders, and a highly accurate screening test for aneuploidies. In the future it is likely to be used for the diagnosis of an increasing range of monogenic disorders, and may even be used to profile entire fetal genomes. The introduction of these tests into clinical practice brings clear benefits but also poses several ethical, social and service delivery challenges. Here, we discuss the current clinical applications, discuss some of the technical and ethical challenges, and look to what the future might bring as technology continues to evolve.

### Fetal sex determination in twin pregnancies using non-invasive prenatal testing [^116cDpMs]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is accurate for fetal sex determination in singleton pregnancies, but its accuracy is not well established in twin pregnancies. Here, we present an accurate sex prediction model to discriminate fetal sex in both dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) and monochorionic diamniotic/monochorionic monoamniotic (MCDA/MCMA) twin pregnancies. A retrospective analysis was performed using a total of 198 twin pregnancies with documented sex. The prediction was based on a multinomial logistic regression using the normalized frequency of X and Y chromosomes, and fetal fraction estimation. A second-step regression analysis was applied when one or both twins were predicted to be male. The model determines fetal sex with 100% sensitivity and specificity when both twins are female, and with 98% sensitivity and 95% specificity when a male is present. Since sex determination can be clinically important, implementing fetal sex determination in twins will improve overall twin pregnancies management.

### Trial by Dutch laboratories for evaluation of non-invasive prenatal testing. part I-clinical impact [^115cNVhB]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2016). Low credibility.

As required in the National Prenatal Screening Protocol, all pregnant women were asked whether they wanted to be informed on options for screening for fetal anomalies at the first prenatal care visit. If so, they were counseled by a certified midwife or obstetrician on the FCT and the 20‐week anomaly scan, and about NIPT as an alternative for invasive testing. As part of the TRIDENT study, counselors had received additional training on relevant aspects of NIPT. Written information and a website were available for further reading.

Women with an increased risk based on FCT or medical history were referred for further counseling to one of the eight Centers for Prenatal Diagnosis, or one of their satellite centers. Women were given the choice between NIPT, invasive testing or no (follow‐up) test. Extensive oral and written information on all tests was provided. For counseling on NIPT, performance data from a review by Mersy et al. 9 were used: sensitivity and specificity around 99.0% for trisomy 21. We predicted a turn‐around time (TAT) of 14–21 days. Women were informed that NIPT examines DNA fragments from the placenta cells rather than from the fetus itself, providing a biological explanation for some false positive and very rare false negative results. The study was a nationwide research study on all aspects of introducing NIPT in the prenatal screening program for trisomy 21, 13 and 18. A genome‐wide approach was used allowing the detection of other chromosomal abnormalities. Women were informed that other abnormal results besides trisomy 21, 18 or 13 are occasionally found, and that any potentially clinically relevant abnormal NIPT result would be discussed with them, potentially leading to an offer of detailed ultrasound, invasive testing and/or parental testing. Women were informed that fetal sex and sex chromosomal aneuploidies would not be communicated, as the ministerial license did not allow analysis of sex chromosomes.

### Open source non-invasive prenatal testing platform and its performance in a public health laboratory [^113rdvMF]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to introduce non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for fetal autosomal trisomies and gender in a Danish public health setting, using semi-conductor sequencing and published open source scripts for analysis.

Methods

Plasma-derived DNA from a total of 375 pregnant women (divided into three datasets) was whole-genome sequenced on the Ion Proton™ platform and analyzed using a pipeline based on WISECONDOR for fetal autosomal aneuploidy detection and SeqFF for fetal DNA fraction estimation. We furthermore validated a fetal sex determination analysis.

Results

The pipeline correctly detected 27/27 trisomy 21, 4/4 trisomy 18, and 3/3 trisomy 13 fetuses. Neither false negatives nor false positives (chromosomes 13, 18, and 21) were observed in our validation dataset. Fetal sex was identified correctly in all but one triploid fetus (172/173). SeqFF showed a strong correlation (R(2) = 0.72) to Y-chromosomal content of the male fetus samples.

Discussion

We have implemented NIPT into Danish health care using published open source scripts for autosomal aneuploidy detection and fetal DNA fraction estimation showing excellent false negative and false positive rates. SeqFF provides a good estimation of fetal DNA fraction. This coupled with an analysis of fetal sex that provides a complete NIPT workflow, which may easily be adapted for implementation in other public health laboratories. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

### Replicate real-time PCR testing of DNA in maternal plasma increases the sensitivity of non-invasive fetal sex determination [^116bNDx6]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2003). Low credibility.

Background

We determined fetal sex in pregnancies referred for invasive prenatal diagnosis procedures by analysis of DNA in maternal plasma.

Methods

Twelve pregnancies at risk of X-linked haemophilia and 32 pregnancies at risk of chromosomal aneuploidies at a gestational age ranging from 10 to 18 weeks recruited before chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis were involved in the study. Male fetal DNA in maternal plasma was detected by using real-time polymerase chain reaction with the SRY gene as a marker.

Results

The specificity of the system reached 100% (no Y signal was detected in 17 women pregnant with a female fetus) and the sensitivity reached 100% (SRY amplification in 27 examined samples).

Conclusions

Amplification of free fetal DNA in maternal plasma is a valid and rapid technique for predicting fetal sex in first- and second-trimester pregnancies and could allow the restriction of invasive sampling procedures to male fetuses at risk of X-linked disorders.

### Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) in twin pregnancies affected by early single fetal demise: a systematic review of NIPT and vanishing twins [^111Hvu7s]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2023). Medium credibility.

The screening performance of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) in vanishing twin (VT) pregnancies is relatively unknown. To close this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic review of the available literature. Studies describing the test performance of NIPT for trisomy 21, 18, 13, sex chromosomes and additional findings in pregnancies with a VT were retrieved from a literature search with a publication date until October 4, 2022. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed with the quality assessment tool for diagnostic accuracy studies-2 (QUADAS-2). The screen positive rate of the pooled data and the pooled positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated using a random effects model. Seven studies, with cohort sizes ranging from 5 to 767, were included. The screen positive rate of the pooled data for trisomy 21 was 35/1592 (2.2%), with a PPV of 20% (confirmation in 7/35 cases [95% CI 9.8%-36%]). For trisomy 18, the screen positive rate was 13/1592 (0.91%) and the pooled PPV 25% [95% CI 1.3%-90%]. The screen positive rate for trisomy 13 was 7/1592 (0.44%) and confirmed in 0/7 cases (pooled PPV 0% [95% CI 0%-100%]). The screen positive rate for additional findings was 23/767 (2.9%), of which none could be confirmed. No discordant negative results were reported. There is insufficient data to fully evaluate NIPT performance in pregnancies with a VT. However, existing studies suggest that NIPT can successfully detect common autosomal aneuploidies in pregnancies affected by a VT but with a higher false positive rate. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal timing of NIPT in VT pregnancies.

### Fetal sex determination in twin pregnancies using non-invasive prenatal testing [^116VbaDK]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Multinomial logistic regression model to predict fetal sex in twin pregnancies. A one-step regression was applied in MCDA/MCMA a and DCDA samples b separately. A second-step regression was applied in DCDA samples if a twin pregnancy was classified as non-FF to predict whether the twin sex is FM or MM c. The same strategy was used analyzing DCDA and MCDA/MCMA samples together d. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated based on the prediction results. DCDA dichorionic diamniotic, MCDA monochorionic diamniotic, MCMA monochorionic monoamniotic, FF female–female, FM female–male, MM male–male, 95% confidence interval (CI)

To improve the accuracy of our test we applied a second-step regression in the DCDA samples. Because discrimination of fetal sex relies mostly on the presence or absence of Y chromosome, it is possible to predict with high accuracy whether one of the pairs are male or not in the dizygotic twins. Hence, when the Y chromosome is present the twins can be assumed to be non-FF. Based on this assumption, if the sample is classified as non-FF, a second-step regression was used to predict whether the twin sex is FM or MM. Using this strategy, we were able to discriminate fetal sex with 98% sensitivity (95% CI [0.89–1]) and 95% specificity (95% CI [0.87–0.98]) in the FM group, and with 92% sensitivity (95% CI [0.79–0.97]) and 99% specificity (95% CI [0.93–1]) in the MM group. (Fig. 2c). Four cases of discordant results occurred; one FM case was predicted to be MM, and three MM cases were predicted to be FM. Of note, by incorporating fetal fraction estimation into the regression model a better accuracy was achieved for fetal sex determination (Supplementary Data 1). Plotting the normalized frequencies of Y chromosome reads in function of fetal fraction in the three groups, we can extrapolate the minimum fetal fraction required to discriminate twin sex. Based on the intersecting lines of the three groups, the threshold for discrimination of FM and MM is a fetal fraction of 2.08%, and for MM and FF a fetal fraction of 0.76% (Fig. 3a). This is the theoretical minimum. However, when taking the variation in the normalized Y chromosome reads into account, one can assume that sex determination is accurate for all pregnancies when the fetal fraction is above 10% and will be accurate in over 50% of the cases when above 6%. We also wondered whether the fetal fraction estimation would be different in twin pregnancies with only female fetuses, only male fetuses of male–female fetuses. As expected, no significant difference was observed between these groups (Fig. 3b).

### Don't offer noninvasive prenatal testing to low-risk patients… [^1132o9HG]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

NIPT has only been adequately evaluated in singleton pregnancies at high risk for chromosomal abnormalities. Its utility in low-risk pregnancies remains unclear. False-positive and false-negative results occur with NIPT, particularly for trisomy 13 and 18. Any positive NIPT result should be confirmed with invasive diagnostic testing prior to a termination of pregnancy. If NIPT is performed, adequate pretest counseling must be provided to explain the benefits and limitations.

### Incremental cost of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis versus invasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal sex in england [^114t8Ko3]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Fetal sex determination is performed for women who carry X-linked conditions, for example Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), or those associated with ambiguous genitalia, for example congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma is an alternative to invasive prenatal diagnosis (IPD), which carries a 1% risk of miscarriage. This study aimed to evaluate the incremental cost of NIPD compared with IPD of fetal sex.

Methods

Diagnostic accuracy, invasive testing rate, and pregnancy outcome following NIPD were ascertained from an audit of all cases referred to two laboratories in 2006 to 2009. Care pathways for DMD and CAH were established and key cost drivers for IPD and NIPD identified using costs derived from published estimates and local laboratory values.

Results

The differences in mean costs per pregnancy for NIPD versus IPD were small for DMD [mean difference - £87, 95% confidence interval (CI) - £303 to £131] and CAH (-£193, 95% CI - £301 to - £84). Testing costs associated with NIPD were offset by fewer women requiring invasive testing.

Conclusions

The costs of NIPD and IPD of fetal sex are similar. NIPD can provide benefits for many women by avoiding the risks of invasive testing, without incurring additional costs.

### Noninvasive fetal sex determination using cell-free fetal DNA: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113156gP]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

Context

Noninvasive prenatal determination of fetal sex using cell-free fetal DNA provides an alternative to invasive techniques for some heritable disorders. In some countries this testing has transitioned to clinical care, despite the absence of a formal assessment of performance.

Objective

To document overall test performance of noninvasive fetal sex determination using cell-free fetal DNA and to identify variables that affect performance.

Data Sources

Systematic review and meta-analysis with search of PubMed (January 1, 1997-April 17, 2011) to identify English-language human studies reporting primary data. References from review articles were also searched.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Abstracts were read independently to identify studies reporting primary data suitable for analysis. Covariates included publication year, sample type, DNA amplification methodology, Y chromosome sequence, and gestational age. Data were independently extracted by 2 reviewers.

Results

From 57 selected studies, 80 data sets (representing 3524 male-bearing pregnancies and 3017 female-bearing pregnancies) were analyzed. Overall performance of the test to detect Y chromosome sequences had the following characteristics: sensitivity, 95.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 94.7%-96.1%) and specificity, 98.6% (95% CI, 98.1%-99.0%); diagnostic odds ratio (OR), 885; positive predictive value, 98.8%; negative predictive value, 94.8%; area under curve (AUC), 0.993 (95% CI, 0.989–0.995), with significant interstudy heterogeneity. DNA methodology and gestational age had the largest effects on test performance. Methodology test characteristics were AUC, 0.988 (95% CI, 0.979–0.993) for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and AUC, 0.996 (95% CI, 0.993–0.998) for real-time quantitative PCR (RTQ-PCR) (P = .02). Gestational age test characteristics were AUC, 0.989 (95% CI, 0.965–0.998) (< 7 weeks); AUC, 0.994 (95% CI, 0.987–0.997) (7–12 weeks); AUC, 0.992 (95% CI, 0.983–0.996) (13–20 weeks); and AUC, 0.998 (95% CI, 0.990–0.999) (> 20 weeks) (P = .02 for comparison of diagnostic ORs across age ranges). RTQ-PCR (sensitivity, 96.0%; specificity, 99.0%) outperformed conventional PCR (sensitivity, 94.0%; specificity, 97.3%). Testing after 20 weeks (sensitivity, 99.0%; specificity, 99.6%) outperformed testing prior to 7 weeks (sensitivity, 74.5%; specificity, 99.1%), testing at 7 through 12 weeks (sensitivity, 94.8%; specificity, 98.9%), and 13 through 20 weeks (sensitivity, 95.5%; specificity, 99.1%).

Conclusions

Despite interstudy variability, performance was high using maternal blood. Sensitivity and specificity for detection of Y chromosome sequences was greatest using RTQ-PCR after 20 weeks' gestation. Tests using urine and tests performed before 7 weeks' gestation were unreliable.

4 CURRENT METHODS OF SEX‐SELECTIVE TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY

There are concerns that NIPT, due to its ease, accuracy, and availability early in gestation, may facilitate an increase in sex‐selective termination of pregnancy (TOP). 35 Ultrasound identification of sex is the current most common means of determining the sex, but its level of accuracy only approaches that of NIPT later in the pregnancy (eg, beyond 14 wk). 3 NIPT can determine sex more accurately than ultrasound at earlier stages of gestation. 39

An ultrasound is recommended at 18 to 22 weeks of gestation, 40 and thus, this is the time in pregnancy where parent(s) will be most likely to determine the sex of their fetus, if they wish. However, pregnant women are increasingly requesting sex determination at a first‐trimester ultrasound (eg, 12 weeks' gestation), despite the lower accuracy of sex determination at this gestation. 3 One 2016 study found that from the gestational age of 12 weeks, fetal sex determination was both feasible and accurate in 79% of cases; there is increased sensitivity in the determination of female sex compared with male sex. 41 With increased gestational age (eg, beyond 14 wk), fetal sex determination becomes significantly more accurate than at 12 weeks' gestation. 3

Invasive diagnostic tests such as CVS can also be used to determine fetal sex very accurately. 42 However, generally, CVS is not performed before 10 weeks' gestation, due to an increased risk for limb malformation. 43 The invasive nature of CVS also makes it a less desirable option than NIPT. It carries a risk, albeit small, of miscarriage. 44

If sex‐selective TOP is the rationale behind sex determination, there is an incentive to determine the sex as early as possible, as TOP becomes more complex and expensive with increased gestational age. 45 TOP at the time NIPT identifies fetal sex can be done by a surgical procedure, whereas by the time it can be confidently identified by ultrasound, TOP may require induction and delivery. 45 In the early stages of gestation, NIPT is more accurate than ultrasound 39 and also safer than invasive techniques such as CVS. 42 TOP at earlier stages of gestation is also generally seen as more ethically acceptable due to the increasing moral status of the fetus as it grows and also may be associated with decreased psychological distress for the pregnant woman. 35 Therefore, given that NIPT can allow for early, safe, and accurate sex determination, it is a possibility that this would make it easier to facilitate sex‐selective TOP.

2 NIPT AND SEX DETERMINATION

Non‐invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) was developed to screen for chromosomal conditions such as the trisomy disorders and, in some cases, microdeletions. 11 NIPT can also determine the sex of the fetus early in the pregnancy. NIPT became available in Hong Kong and the United States in 2011, with a rapid spread in availability worldwide. 12 NIPT has many advantages over other methods of screening and/or sex determination. It is non‐invasive (requiring only a blood sample from the mother) and thus carries fewer risks than invasive diagnostic techniques such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling. It is also more accurate and can be done earlier than the other established screening option, combined first trimester screening (CFTS), which does not determine the sex of the fetus. 13

NIPT is very accurate for the determination of fetal sex. A 2017 systematic review of NIPT in singleton pregnancies found that the sensitivity and specificity of NIPT for fetal sex is 0.989 and 0.996, respectively. 14 NIPT is not offered by many providers for twin pregnancies, but it is possible to determine fetal sex of twins through NIPT with a predictive model producing an accurate prediction in 97.8% of cases, 15 with a high sensitivity and specificity for the presence of a Y chromosome. 16 Fetal sex determination can be performed through amplification of Y‐chromosome markers such as SRY and/or DYS14 17 using qPCR. A 2011 systematic review found that fetal sex determination by NIPT before 7 weeks gestation is unreliable. 1 However, a more recent approach using ddPCR may lead to accurate fetal sex determination earlier than seven weeks of gestation. 18 NIPT can also be used to indicate the presence of sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs) and other disorders of sex development. 19, 20 However, it is important to note that the accuracy of NIPT for SCAs varies and is less accurate than its use for the autosomal chromosome disorders. 21 Discordance between sex phenotype and NIPT results can also occur due to translocations, deletions, other disorders of sex development, vanishing twin syndrome, or maternal chimerism. 22, 23

### Non-invasive prenatal testing for aneuploidy and beyond: challenges of responsible innovation in prenatal screening [^116kWfNm]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

This paper contains a joint ESHG/ASHG position document with recommendations regarding responsible innovation in prenatal screening with non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). By virtue of its greater accuracy and safety with respect to prenatal screening for common autosomal aneuploidies, NIPT has the potential of helping the practice better achieve its aim of facilitating autonomous reproductive choices, provided that balanced pretest information and non-directive counseling are available as part of the screening offer. Depending on the health-care setting, different scenarios for NIPT-based screening for common autosomal aneuploidies are possible. The trade-offs involved in these scenarios should be assessed in light of the aim of screening, the balance of benefits and burdens for pregnant women and their partners and considerations of cost-effectiveness and justice. With improving screening technologies and decreasing costs of sequencing and analysis, it will become possible in the near future to significantly expand the scope of prenatal screening beyond common autosomal aneuploidies. Commercial providers have already begun expanding their tests to include sex-chromosomal abnormalities and microdeletions. However, multiple false positives may undermine the main achievement of NIPT in the context of prenatal screening: the significant reduction of the invasive testing rate. This document argues for a cautious expansion of the scope of prenatal screening to serious congenital and childhood disorders, only following sound validation studies and a comprehensive evaluation of all relevant aspects. A further core message of this document is that in countries where prenatal screening is offered as a public health programme, governments and public health authorities should adopt an active role to ensure the responsible innovation of prenatal screening on the basis of ethical principles. Crucial elements are the quality of the screening process as a whole (including non-laboratory aspects such as information and counseling), education of professionals, systematic evaluation of all aspects of prenatal screening, development of better evaluation tools in the light of the aim of the practice, accountability to all stakeholders including children born from screened pregnancies and persons living with the conditions targeted in prenatal screening and promotion of equity of access.

### Clinical application of fetal sex determination using cell-free fetal DNA in pregnant carriers of X-linked genetic disorders [^116Yzg5H]. Journal of Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

As the first step in prenatal diagnosis of X-linked genetic disorders, chorionic villus sampling (CVS) for fetal sex determination is generally performed at 11–13 weeks of gestation. However, as the procedure-related miscarriage rate of CVS is 0.5–1.0%, non-invasive methods such as PCR of cell-free fetal DNA (cff-DNA) in maternal plasma are preferable. Here, we determined fetal sex at 9–12 weeks of gestation using PCR of cff-DNA in three pregnant carriers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The fetal sex was accurately determined in all three cases, as confirmed by ultrasound and amniocentesis at 16 weeks (for the two female fetuses) and CVS at 12 weeks (for the one male fetus). This procedure could avoid unnecessary CVS in female fetuses.

### Discordant sex between fetal screening and postnatal phenotype requires evaluation [^114FpksF]. Journal of Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) utilizes circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to screen for fetal genetic abnormalities. NIPS is the first widely-available prenatal screen to assess genotypic sex. Most pediatricians have limited familiarity with NIPS technology and potential etiologies of discordant results. Increased familiarity may provide diagnostic insight and improve clinical care.

Study Design

We reviewed all patients with discordant genotypic fetal sex assessed by cfDNA and neonatal phenotypic sex referred to our medical center.

Result

Four infants with discordant cfDNA result and phenotypic sex were identified. Etiologies include vanishing twin syndrome, difference of sexual development, sex chromosome aneuploidy and maternal chimerism.

Conclusions

We present four cases illustrating potential etiologies of discordant cfDNA result and postnatal phenotypic sex. Unanticipated cfDNA results offer the perinatologist a unique opportunity for early diagnosis and targeted treatment of various conditions, many of which may not have otherwise been detected in the perinatal period.

### Recommended practice for laboratory reporting of non-invasive prenatal testing of trisomies 13, 18 and 21: a consensus opinion [^117RPHtG]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Non‐invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for aneuploidy is now established as a highly effective prenatal screening test for the major trisomies and is offered in many countries, largely through the commercial sector and private healthcare providers. 1 Some providers also offer sex determination, screening for sex chromosome aneuploidies and screening for other chromosomal rearrangements, for example microdeletion syndromes. Although sensitivity and specificity is high for trisomy 21, the test performance for trisomies 13 and 18 and sex chromosome aneuploidies is more variable. 2

Non‐invasive prenatal testing is based on analysis of circulating cell‐free DNA in maternal plasma. After 10 weeks' gestation, 3% to 20% is of fetal origin 3 and is thought to be derived primarily from the placenta. 4 As such, NIPT is a screening test and does not replace the precision obtained with a diagnostic test, for example chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. NIPT results that are discordant with the diagnostic test result have a number of reported causes that include statistical/technical false positive/negative, low fetal fraction (FF) and biological factors such as confined placental mosaicism, (vanishing) twin pregnancies, maternal mosaicism 5, 6 and maternal malignancy. 7 The FF, the amount of the cell‐free DNA in the maternal blood that is of placental/fetal origin, is used by some providers as a quality parameter with some algorithms using a minimum FF below, which results are not interpreted, whilst others combine FF with other quality metrics to determine if a result is reportable. The FF typically increases with advancing gestational age and is affected by a number of factors that include maternal weight and multiple pregnancies. 8 Furthermore, currently NIPT does not identify the range of chromosome abnormalities detected by karyotyping or microarray analysis of fetal cells obtained following invasive testing. 9 Finally, most performance data reported for NIPT relate to singleton pregnancies, although there is a growing body of data regarding its application to twin pregnancies. 2

### Positive predictive value of non-invasive prenatal screening for fetal chromosome disorders using cell-free DNA in maternal serum: independent clinical experience of a tertiary referral center [^114jNpTX]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Apparent sex discordance can have a variety of causes, including inaccurate sex assessment on ultrasound, a co-twin demise, the statistical limitations of NIPS, and a fetus affected with one of the various disorders of sexual development. NIPS did not include the option of fetal sex assessment during the entire timeframe reported here, and not all patients chose to learn the predicted fetal sex from NIPS. Nevertheless, we are aware of only one instance of confirmed fetal sex discrepancy, in a patient who had a personal history of a renal transplant from a male donor.

Thus, it is imperative that providers make every effort to confirm NIPS results that are abnormal or appear discordant for fetal sex. Ideally, confirmation would be with diagnostic genetic testing done prior to making any irrevocable decisions about pregnancy management. Twenty-two families (42%) in this cohort with abnormal NIPS results chose to have prenatal diagnostic genetic testing (Fig. 5a, b, d, e and Fig. 6). Nine patients in this group continued to term and took advantage of all opportunities to gain information about fetal health during their pregnancies. However, patients may decline prenatal diagnostic testing after an abnormal NIPS result, as did 31 (58%) patients in this series. Patients incorporate other clinical information about fetal status into their decision-making. If serum screen results, NIPS results, and fetal anatomy ultrasound results all suggest the same diagnosis, the patient may not need further confirmation. Or a patient's concern about the suspected condition may not be sufficient to warrant the risk of the invasive procedures needed for prenatal diagnosis. And many patients pursue prenatal genetic screening to be better prepared for the birth, and would never incur the risk of a prenatal invasive procedure, regardless of NIPS results. Twenty-two patients in this cohort with abnormal NIPS results (41%) declined prenatal diagnostic genetic testing with the intention of continuing to term (Fig. 5c, f, h, and i).

### High false-positive non-invasive prenatal screening results for sex chromosome abnormalities: are maternal factors the culprit? [^115a2LQq]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To explore the impact of maternal sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs) and copy number variation (CNV) on false-positive results of non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) for predicting foetal SCAs.

Methods

In total, 22 844 pregnant women were recruited to undergo NIPS. Pregnant women with high-risk of SCAs underwent prenatal diagnosis and maternal copy number variation sequencing (CNV-seq).

Results

Among 117 women with high-risk of SCAs, 72 accepted prenatal diagnosis, 86 accepted maternal CNV-seq, and 21 had maternal sex chromosome abnormalities. The abnormality rate was significantly higher than women at low-risk of SCAs (24.42% vs 3.51%). Using a novel parameter cffDNA (ChrX)/cffDNA, when the ratio was greater than 2, all foetuses had normal karyotype, and 75.0% (6/8) had abnormal maternal chromosome X. If the ratio was less than or equal to 2, only 10% (4/40) of the mothers had chromosome X CNV alterations, while 33.3% (13/40) of their foetuses had sex chromosomes CNV abnormalities.

Conclusions

Approximately 25% of pregnant women with SCAs predicted by NIPS had sex chromosome abnormalities as determined by CNV-seq. The ratio of cffDNA (ChrX)/cffDNA can tentatively distinguish the maternal or foetal origin of abnormal cell-free DNA. In a reanalysis of previous NIPS data, false-positive results caused by maternal CNV might be elucidated.

### Noninvasive detection of fetal sex: the laboratory diagnostician's view [^116Uf2no]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2006). Low credibility.

Toward the end of the twentieth century it was discovered that cell-free fetal DNA sequences could be detected in maternal blood plasma. Initially, Y-chromosome sequences originating from male fetuses were targeted in cell-free DNA extracted from maternal plasma in order to demonstrate proof of this concept towards the development of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis methods. Clinical application of this approach is now possible. Fetal sex can be detected through a procedure that is noninvasive with respect to the fetus. Specifically, the presence of Y-chromosome sequences in maternal blood plasma indicates that the fetus is male, whereas lack of a signal will indicate that the fetus is female. Fetal sex can be detected very early, from at least the 7th week of pregnancy (and even earlier, according to several studies), about two months before this information is available through ultrasound scanning. Although the controversial issue of fetal sexing is not new, it is expected that with the availability of an accurate noninvasive test, public interest will rise. It is therefore imperative that an authorized committee of experts in each country generates an official policy regarding application of the test.

### Sex discordance identification following non-invasive prenatal testing [^117J7Qnu]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The objectives of this study were to characterise genotype-phenotype discordance identified in the routine clinical setting and to explore the associated diagnostic and counselling challenges.

Method

Cases were derived from a cohort of pregnant women who attended a multisite specialist prenatal screening and ultrasound service for non-invasive prenatal testing by cell-free DNA analysis and midtrimester fetal morphology assessment.

Results

Seven cases of genotype-phenotype discordance were identified from a cohort of 12 919 women between June 2013 and March 2017 (incidence 1/1845 pregnancies). A variety of disorders of sexual differentiation were subsequently diagnosed.

Conclusion

Sex chromosomes are the basis of sexual differentiation during embryonic development. Variations of the traditional XX or XY karyotype may result in conditions where the genotype is discordant with the phenotype. Detection of these conditions in the past typically occurred during adolescence, due to delayed puberty, or during adulthood, due to infertility. With the increasing availability of non-invasive prenatal testing and high-resolution ultrasound, more cases of genotype-phenotype sex discordance are being identified in routine clinical practice during early pregnancy. These discordant results present significant diagnostic and counselling challenges, and their potential should be included in increasingly complex pre-NIPT counselling.

### Fetal sex results of noninvasive prenatal testing and differences with ultrasonography [^1134it9R]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Lo et alfirst reported the presence of cell-free fetal DNA in the plasma of pregnant women. This led to the development of noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), which involves analysis of cell-free DNA in maternal plasma to evaluate the risk for common fetal aneuploidies by quantifying the fetal chromosome complement. Fetal sex can be reported from NIPT, although not considered a primary medical indication. Before NIPT, fetal sex was historically reported from ultrasound analysis of fetal external genitalia with high accuracy. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)–based NIPT uses relative SNP allele frequency patterns to determine chromosome copy number. Studies have reported the performance of cell-free DNA analysis for analysis of fetal sex chromosomes with sensitivities of greater than 99% (99.0–100%). Analytic validation of the SNP-based NIPT methodology reported correct fetal sex assignment in 100% (99.0–100%) of cases.

In our experience, approximately 80% of the NIPT requisitions request information on fetal sex. Fetal sex discordance rates of 0.0–0.9% have been reported. Although case reports exist, a PubMed search using the terms "sex discordance or fetal sex discordance" and "NIPT" did not identify any large-scale studies evaluating the frequency and etiology for health care provider- or patient-reported discordance.

Discrepant results between NIPT and prenatal ultrasound or other clinical information may be explained by human error and biological mechanisms. Sources of human error include blood sample mislabeling, laboratory methodologic limitations, transcription errors and the limited performance of ultrasound imaging at early gestational age or with suboptimal visualization of the external genitalia. Biological reasons for discordance include the presence of fetoplacental mosaicism for sex chromosome abnormalities, the presence of a vanishing twin, maternal transplant recipient from a male donor, disorders of sexual development or other fetal abnormalities associated with anomalous or ambiguous external genitalia. The objective of this study was to analyze the causes for discordance between fetal sex predicted by a SNP-based NIPT, and fetal sex based on reported phenotype or genotype, so as to guide clinicians in the counseling, evaluation, and management of these pregnancies.

### Fetal sex determination in twin pregnancies using non-invasive prenatal testing [^113LBLnB]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is changing the standard care in obstetrics. Although the main purpose of NIPT is the screening for the viable autosomal aneuploidies (trisomies 21, 18, and 13), the test was first established in clinical setting for fetal sex determination, based on the presence or absence of Y chromosome sequence in the maternal plasma. Discrimination of fetal sex is clinically relevant not only for families at high risk of sex-linked disorders, such as hemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but also in cases for which the development of external genitalia is ambiguous, and in some endocrine disorders like congenital adrenal hyperplasia, where there is a masculinization of the female fetus that can be preventable with antenatal treatment. It is noteworthy mentioning that the assessment of fetal sex through NIPT offers earlier test results compared to ultrasound, and has been shown to reduce the number of invasive procedures significantly.

Currently, prediction of fetal sex in NIPT is performed using either real-time PCR or Y chromosome read counting. In both methods, the fetus is presumed to be male or female based on whether Y chromosome material is detected or not. It has been demonstrated that the performance of NIPT for aneuploidy detection is best achieved in singleton pregnancies when compared to multiple gestation. However, little information is available about the precision of NIPT for fetal sex determination in twins. Since standard sequential screening tests are not very precise in multiple gestation, and considering the increased risks for complications associated with this type of pregnancy, it is important to develop accurate non-invasive methods to identify aneuploidy and sex discordances in twins to improve overall pregnancy management. Moreover, the rate of multiple gestation has dramatically increased over the last few years. While the incidence of monozygotic twins is about 3–5 per 1000 births, the rate of dizygotic twins varies with maternal age, gravidity, ethnicity, familial history, and the use of assisted reproductive techniques. In Europe and the US for example, the incidence of dizygotic twins corresponded to 8 per 1000 births, but mainly due to in vitro fertilization (IVF) the incidence is rising to 16–30 per 1000 births today. Also, it has been estimated that approximately 24% of successful IVF procedures result in multiple gestation, increasing even the risk of monozygotic twins.

### Non-invasive prenatal testing for aneuploidy and beyond: challenges of responsible innovation in prenatal screening [^114zcuDm]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

NIPT makes it possible in principle to screen for SCA. Some commentators regard this as a 'logical next step' after the introduction of the technology in prenatal screening. The recent statement of the Israeli Society of Medical Genetics includes sex-chromosomal abnormalities in its recommendation that NIPT may be offered to women at an a priori high risk for fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Although commercial companies have already moved to report SCAs in certain countries, taking this step requires a careful assessment of the benefits and harms of doing so. Relevant aspects include test accuracy, counseling challenges, women's preferences, the interests of the future child and misuse of information about fetal sex.

The limited available data indicate that NIPT has a lower accuracy for SCA than for trisomies 21 and 18. This is attributed to several factors including confined placental, placental or true fetal mosaiscism. Moreover, a recent study found that in 8.5% of cases, discordance between NIPT findings and fetal karyotype could be directly attributed by an altered (X-chromosome loss) or mosaic maternal karyotype. The authors recommend maternal karyotyping in case of NIPT results suggesting SCA, in order to improve the interpretation of such findings. Thus routine implementation of screening for sex chromosome abnormalities could reverse the reduction in invasive testing seen following the implementation of NIPT for aneuploidy in the private sector by increasing the false positive rate through the identification of maternal sex chromosome abnormalities.

Specific counseling challenges and psychological impacts of NIPT for SCA have not yet been researched. However, the fact that with NIPT, SCAs are found at the screening step rather than as an additional finding of invasive follow-up testing seems a relevant difference, as it invites women not only to think about whether they would want to continue the pregnancy after a confirmed SCA diagnosis but also whether they would want to take the risk of invasive testing to rule out the probably more than 50% chance of a false alarm. The specifics of different SCAs, for instance the fact that 99% of 45, X fetuses miscarry, and that those who survive often also have abnormalities that are detected by ultrasound screening, will have to be taken into account.

Little is yet known about women's preferences about prenatal screening for SCAs. Recent Chinese studies found that most women having NIPT for common autosomal aneuploidies also wanted information about NIPT results for SCA, but reported very different levels of interest in confirmatory invasive testing.

9 THE FUTURE OF NIPT AND SEX SELECTION

It is unclear as of yet what impact NIPT will have on trends for sex‐selective TOP. There is anecdotal evidence that NIPT is associated with sex‐selective TOP. However, more rigorous evidence is required to determine whether this is indeed occurring and how often. In addition, it is unclear whether NIPT is associated with an increase in sex‐selective TOP, or if it would merely be a different means. It is unknown whether NIPT facilitates sex‐selective TOP more or less than other methods, such as ultrasound and invasive prenatal testing. In addition, as NIPT is less widely accessible than other methods such as ultrasound, it is important to establish the extent to which NIPT contributes to sex‐selective TOP in the context of its availability.

Early sex determination through NIPT raises a number of ethical issues. Many of the ethical issues apply to sex‐selective TOP and sex determination in general. However, NIPT intensifies these issues do its ease, safety, and availability early in gestation. Nevertheless, the lack of good evidence for NIPT facilitating sex‐selective TOP should inform the ethical debates, particularly until more conclusive evidence relating to this can be produced.

Further research is required into the SRB of children born following NIPT to more accurately ascertain whether NIPT use is associated with a bias towards one particular sex. Additional research could also examine the motivations of those using NIPT for sex determination and determine whether sex‐selection forms any part of these. While sex‐selective TOP and skewed SRBs remain a serious issue globally, it is not immediately obvious what role NIPT will play in this problem in the future.

### Mainstreaming genetics into Italian prenatal care: exploring the future implementation of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) in the Italian national healthcare system using stakeholder interviews [^1124TNpD]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

This study also identified several facilitators that could support the transition of NIPT to the public healthcare system. These include the high appreciation surrounding NIPT, its potential to advance fundamental objectives of healthcare systems — such as enhancing and securing equitable access, affordability and widespread availability of prenatal testing and care on the national territory — encourage pregnancies, and its compatibility with the Italian prenatal testing culture. Such findings are consistent with studies which have shown that NIPT users and healthcare professionals have positive attitudes towards NIPT. The reasons for this high level of appreciation, van der Meij et al pointed out, are the non-invasiveness, accuracy and early application of NIPT, being comparable to the justifications given by this study's participants. Work on women's perspectives on NIPT also stresses the importance of responsible, ethical and financially fair implementation of NIPT. The claim that NIPT may reverse low birth rates, contrasts with ethical concerns surrounding the test's use and an increase in pregnancy terminations. In Italy, Law 194/1978 governs the termination of pregnancy, decriminalising abortion up to the 12th week. This decriminalisation period falls within the 9th–14th week time frame for conducting NIPT, which may raise significant concerns. However, it is pivotal to realise that the implementation mode of NIPT along with the cultural context in which NIPT is implemented impacts the relationship between NIPT use and pregnancy termination rates. For instance, sex-selective termination of pregnancy has had several detrimental demographic repercussions in countries such as China and India, leading such countries to outlaw prenatal fetal sex determination. Contrastingly, Hill et al investigated the effect of NIPT on termination of pregnancy in relation to Down syndrome, suggesting that pregnancy termination rates decreased or remained unchanged compared with rates recorded prior to the introduction of NIPT. Thus, performing pilot studies in the Italian context or analysing existing regional data on different NIPT implementation strategies could give a more precise indication of such a relationship.

### Comparing methods for fetal fraction determination and quality control of NIPT samples [^115wJ8vW]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare available analysis methods for determining fetal fraction on single read next generation sequencing data. This is important as the performance of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) procedures depends on the fraction of fetal DNA.

Methods

We tested six different methods for the detection of fetal fraction in NIPT samples. The same clinically obtained data were used for all methods, allowing us to assess the effect of fetal fraction on the test result, and to investigate the use of fetal fraction for quality control.

Results

We show that non-NIPT methods based on body mass index (BMI) and gestational age are unreliable predictors of fetal fraction, male pregnancy specific methods based on read counts on the Y chromosome perform consistently and the fetal sex-independent new methods SeqFF and SANEFALCON are less reliable but can be used to obtain a basic indication of fetal fraction in case of a female fetus.

Conclusion

We recommend the use of a combination of methods to prevent the issue of reports on samples with insufficient fetal DNA; SANEFALCON to check for presence of fetal DNA, SeqFF for estimating the fetal fraction for a female pregnancy and any Y-based method for estimating the fetal fraction for a male pregnancy. © 2017 The Authors.

### SNP-based non-invasive prenatal testing detects sex chromosome aneuploidies with high accuracy [^117R4XRW]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to develop a single-nucleotide polymorphism-based and informatics-based non-invasive prenatal test that detects sex chromosome aneuploidies early in pregnancy.

Methods

Sixteen aneuploid samples, including thirteen 45, X, two 47, XXY, and one 47, XYY, along with 185 euploid controls, were analyzed. Cell-free DNA was isolated from maternal plasma, amplified in a single multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay that targeted 19,488 polymorphic loci covering chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y, and sequenced. Sequencing results were analyzed using a Bayesian-based maximum likelihood statistical method to determine copy number of interrogated chromosomes, calculating sample-specific accuracies.

Results

Of the samples that passed a stringent quality control metric (93%), the algorithm correctly identified copy number at all five chromosomes in all but one of the 187 samples, for 934/935 correct calls as early as 9.4 weeks of gestation. We detected 45, X with 91.7% sensitivity (CI: 61.5–99.8%) and 100% specificity (CI: 97.9–100%), and 47, XXY and 47, XYY. The average calculated accuracy was 99.78%.

Conclusion

This method non-invasively detected 45, X, 47, XXY, and 47, XYY fetuses from cell-free DNA isolated from maternal plasma with high calculated accuracies and thus offers a non-invasive method with the potential to function as a routine screen allowing for early prenatal detection of rarely diagnosed yet commonly occurring sex aneuploidies.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for genetic testing in dystrophinopathies [^114Wtxr8]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Non-invasive foetal sexing

It is now possible to non-invasively determine foetal sex during pregnancy, and this testing should be offered to patients as an alternative to chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis as it will negate the risk of an invasive test where the foetus is female. Non-invasive foetal sexing is possible from 7 to 9 weeks gestation depending on local laboratory policies, and is based on the detection of Y-chromosome specific sequences in the maternal blood during pregnancy. It is important that an ultrasound scan be performed to accurately date and confirm a singleton pregnancy. Testing has limited benefit in twin pregnancies, but may be helpful in the scenario where both foetuses are demonstrated to be female as shown by complete absence of Y-chromosome specific sequence. It is important however that the test is validated on twin pregnancies. Testing is usually carried out using real-time PCR for Y chromosome markers such as SRY, with a housekeeping gene such as CCR5 as a control. There is a test failure rate of up to 5% due to low foetal fraction, and a very small risk of misdiagnosis due to the presence of a vanishing twin (false positive result) or a very low foetal fraction (false negative result).

Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD)

NIPD for dystrophinopathies is likely to increasingly become feasible using methods such as relative haplotype dosage analysis (RHDO). RHDO analysis examines SNPs in the cell-free DNA from a maternal blood sample, and shows whether the male foetus has inherited the high risk or low risk haplotype across the DMD gene, in comparison to a proband for phasing of the haplotypes. It is likely that new genomic approaches also able to directly detect CNVs will be available shortly due to technical and bioinformatics advances.

### Why parents should not be told the sex of their fetus [^111Ju121]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2017). Low credibility.

A new technique called non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has been developed, which can detect a range of genetic and chromosomal diseases, as well as fetal sex earlier, more easily and more reliably. NIPT, therefore, potentially expands the market for sex determination and sex selective abortion. This paper argues that both practices should be prevented by not including fetal sex in prenatal test reports. This is because there is a discrepancy between what parents are concerned with (gender) and what the prenatal test can provide (sex). The paper first presents arguments, which indicate a difference between sex and gender before presenting parental motivations for sex selection and sex determination to show that parents are not concerned with their child's sex chromosomes, or even their genitalia, but the gender role that their child will espouse. That, however, is not something that a prenatal test can provide. We are thus left with a situation in which what parents are told, and what they think they are being told, are two different things. In other words, as the conflation of sex with gender is implicit in the disclosure of fetal sex, it may be more accurate to refer to it as misinformation. This misinformation promotes sexism via gender essentialism, which is neither in the interests of the future child nor society.

### Non-invasive prenatal testing for sex chromosome abnormalities: a source of confusion [^111tk9ZK]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Cell-free fetal DNA has received significant attention for the purposes of prenatal genetic testing in the past decade. Fetal DNA testing is a new method and promising for many applications such as aneuploidy screening, prenatal diagnosis, prediction of preeclampsia and more. A 37-year-old primigravida, with a pregnancy conceived by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), was offered non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) due to advanced maternal age. NIPT performed at 23weeks' gestation reported a diagnosis of monosomy X. She was offered an amniocentesis, which revealed a euploid fetus with no sex chromosome abnormalities. Even with single nucleotide polymorphism-based NIPT, positive predictive value for detection of sex chromosome abnormalities is around 50%. Positive results of NIPT should be heeded with caution and an invasive diagnostic procedure should be performed, especially for rare chromosomal abnormalities and sex chromosome abnormalities where NIPT performs subpar compared to its performance for detection of trisomy 21.

### Non-invasive prenatal testing for aneuploidy and beyond: challenges of responsible innovation in prenatal screening [^1137NwBw]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

After the presence of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal blood was described in 1997, early applications of NIPT included the determination of Rhesus D blood-group status and fetal sex as well as the diagnosis of autosomal dominant disorders of paternal inheritance. The use of NIPT to screen for the presence of fetal aneuploidy became feasible with the development of massive parallel sequencing (MPS) and counting of cfDNA fragments. Most current tests for this purpose use whole genome MPS in order to quantitatively compare the amount of, for example, chromosome 21 DNA molecules in a maternal sample with that of an euploid reference sample. Other tests use targeted sequencing, mapping only the chromosome regions of interest, or use a qualitative SNP-based approach.

NIPT for common autosomal aneuploidies: test performance

In a recent meta-analysis in which the results of a large number of studies were pooled, NIPT was found to have a sensitivity of 99% for trisomy 21, and a specificity of 99.92%. For trisomy 18, the reported figures were 96.8% (sensitivity) and 99.85% (specificity). For trisomy 13, they were 92.1 and 99.80% respectively. It should be noted, however, that the performance of NIPT is better documented in trisomies 21 and 18 than for trisomy 13, which is a less frequent condition.

Only a few of these studies have been conducted in lower risk populations. However, there is growing evidence that comparably good results can also be achieved in general obstetrical populations, making NIPT an alternative to current first-trimester screening protocols. In the prospective multicenter Comparison of Aneuploidy Risk Evaluation (CARE) study (primary analysis cohort of 1914 cases), Bianchi et al compared NIPT as a first-tier screening test with prenatal screening in the many different ways in which it is being performed in the United States. While detecting all eight cases of the three trisomies, this study found a specificity of 99.7 for trisomy 21 (95% CI: 99.3–99.9) and 99.8 for trisomy 18 (95% CI: 99.6–100). A much larger prospective study, carried out in centers in the USA, Canada and Europe (the non-invasive examination of trisomy using cell-free DNA analysis (NEXT) study) is expected to confirm these observations. In this study, NIPT was compared with a standard first-trimester screening in a general risk population of pregnant women.

### Healthcare professionals' perspectives on and experiences with non-invasive prenatal testing: a systematic review [^1144XYJb]. Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Rates of discussing and offering NIPT for fetal sex determination varied. Despite concern, some HPs felt obligated to discuss and offer NIPT for fetal sex out of respect for the autonomy (Agatisa et al; Claesen-Bengtson et al.). In one study, 71% of American and Canadian GCs reported disclosing the ability of NIPT to determine fetal sex during their initial pre-test counseling (Stevens C. et al.). In contrast, studies with Pakistani OBs (Ahmed et al.) and American obstetric professionals (Sayres et al.) reported only 31% and 21% would offer NIPT for non-medical fetal sex determination respectively. A minority of HPs reported only discussing the capability of NIPT to determine fetal sex upon request (6.3%) or that they directed pregnant people to alternative methods of obtaining information about fetal sex (29.1%), such as direct-to-consumer prenatal screening tests or early ultrasound. However, some Belgian GCs reported adopting a directive approach to counselling in the context of fetal sex, placing moral weight on certain actions and reasons. Belgian GCs also referenced their right to conscientiously object to sex-selective abortion, reporting withholding or delaying information or referring couples to other providers (Claesen-Bengtson et al.).

Misinformation among pregnant people was identified as a challenge for the provision of pre-test counseling. Genetic counselors in the USA and Canada reported challenges arising from increasing numbers of pregnant people who believed the primary function of NIPT was to provide information about fetal sex (Agatisa et al; Stevens et al.). Genetic counselors noted challenges in providing genetic counseling for NIPT where other healthcare providers had described NIPT as a test for gender, particularly during post-test counseling following the return of positive results (Stevens et al.). Healthcare professionals additionally noted challenges providing counselling where pregnant people conflated terminology relating to sex and gender. While most HPs reported that people commonly conflated sex and gender, GCs rarely reported discussing differences during their clinical practice (Stevens et al.). A minority of GCs in the USA and Canada reported pregnant people who were interested in NIPT for fetal sex subsequently declining the test once informed about its function for screening fetal aneuploidy (Stevens et al.).

### Sex selection and non-invasive prenatal testing: a review of current practices, evidence, and ethical issues [^115zurmv]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The introduction of non‐invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has the potential to make the practice of sex‐selective termination of pregnancy (TOP) an even more pressing issue. NIPT can determine the sex of the fetus very accurately and very early in the pregnancy. It is increasingly accurate from 7 weeks' gestation. 1 This is earlier than when other techniques that can determine sex, such as ultrasound or chorionic villus sampling (CVS), are generally performed. 2, 3

There can be medical reasons to determine the sex of the fetus. For example, the mother may be a carrier of an X‐linked disorder such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and may request further testing if the fetus is determined to be male, as if the fetus is male, there is a 50% chance he will be affected by the condition. 4 However, it is also common for parents to want to find out the sex of the fetus for non‐medical (social) reasons. 5 These reasons include planning and preparation, the desire for a closer emotional attachment to the fetus, 5 or bestowing a sense of personhood and social identity upon the fetus that is perceived to be lesser when using gender‐neutral pronouns such as "it". 6

Sex determination can also be done for the purpose of sex‐selective TOP. Sex selection can be motivated by a cultural preference for one sex. There is evidence that sex selection in favour of males is occurring in several regions across the world, including India, 7 China, 8 and the Caucasus. 9 Sex selection can also be motivated by for family balancing purposes. 10 This is when a family has one or more children of one sex and wants the next child to be another sex in order to "balance" the family unit. Both rationales for sex selection raise complex ethical issues.

The aim of this paper is to review the current practice of sex‐selective TOP, the evidence for a relationship between NIPT and sex‐selective TOP, and the ethical issues associated with using NIPT to facilitate sex‐selective TOP. This review may be useful for clinicians and health professionals who are involved in the provision of NIPT sex determination, as well as informing policy makers who are considering the issue of prenatal sex determination.

NIPT as a commercial DTC-test

Whereas cFTS screening (because of the ultrasound component) requires direct contact with a health professional, NIPT makes it possible in theory to offer prenatal testing for fetal abnormalities as a direct-to-consumer test. Ethically, this would be a problematic development. In order to maintain minimum quality standards, prenatal testing for fetal abnormalities should always be offered through health professionals with the expertise and training to provide the necessary pre-and post-test information and counseling. This is also how NIPT is currently made available by the companies selling the test. However, direct advertising to the target group of pregnant women who then only need to ask for the right product, may serve to diminish the role of the professional as an independent advisor and is therefore also an issue of concern.

Currently, NIPT is available through the internet as a commercial DTC-test specifically for fetal sex determination and paternity testing. In light of the above discussion of NIPT results being potentially used to abort healthy female fetuses just because of being of the 'wrong' sex, it is clear that DTC-tests for early fetal sex determination should be regarded with concern, given that those who only want to know what color to paint the baby room will have ample opportunity to learn about the sex of the fetus later in pregnancy. Although paternity testing may lead to abortion of healthy fetuses as well, women may have legitimate reasons for wanting to know the identity of the father of the child they are carrying. Paternity testing, however, also raises issues of consent and privacy.

Health care providers have highlighted that their patients often wish to know the sex of the fetus as early as possible, finding NIPT useful for this purpose. 107 A 2019 survey of European health care providers found varying levels of interest (on the part of the providers) in the use of NIPT to determine sex chromosomes, from 51% in France to 78% in Spain. It is important to note that this study did not specify non‐medical sex determination. 108 A 2018 study of 103 genetic counsellors in the United States found that 60% offered NIPT for determination of sex chromosomes to all patients, and there were no participants who did not offer it at all. Seventy‐five percent of participants thought it should be offered universally, although the percentage of those concerned about the use of NIPT for sex determination had increased significantly since a similar survey in 2015 from 1% to 26.5%. 101 In another study from the United States, a 2016 survey of maternal‐fetal medicine fellows, 54.4% of respondents believed that it was somewhat or very likely that NIPT would lead to an increase in sex‐selective TOP. 109 Research from 2016 into the views of Pakistani obstetricians found that 55% would not offer NIPT for sex determination. However, 31% would offer this, despite recognising a strong son preference, with participants suggesting the illegal status of abortion for social reasons in Pakistan as sufficient protection against sex‐selective TOP. 110 A 2017 survey of obstetric professionals in New Zealand found that 37% had been asked about using NIPT for sex determination, and 33% supported the public funding of NIPT sex determination. 111

### Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) for single gene disorders: cost analysis of NIPD and invasive testing pathways [^1136fy2d]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2016). Low credibility.

Costs of NIPD versus invasive testing

Our perspective for the cost analysis was that of the prenatal screening department of a local hospital in a cash‐constrained publicly funded health care system like the English NHS. We considered a narrow range of costs, focusing on the costs of the NIPD and invasive testing pathways only. We did not include childbirth costs, or costs beyond childbirth such as health care costs associated with looking after a child with a single gene disorder as these are unlikely to be relevant for the perspective taken. In addition lifetime costs for treatment and care of children affected with single gene disorders are not available in the UK, and inclusion of these costs requires several complex assumptions about whether or not an affected pregnancy is terminated, and whether or not a replacement pregnancy follows termination. The total costs of diagnosis using NIPD and invasive testing for each single gene disorder were calculated. Input parameters are listed in Table 2. Where possible local unit costs or published costs 26, 27 were used. For conditions where NIPD is not yet available in clinical practice, costs were estimated by our laboratory based on current service costs and costs of consumables, equipment and staff time derived from developing these tests in a research setting. In the analysis two assumptions were made: (1) invasive testing is not required to confirm a positive NIPD result, and (2) for sex‐linked disorders fetal sex determination using NIPD is performed as a first step and diagnosis using invasive testing or NIPD is only performed in 50% of cases (female fetus for CAH, male fetus for haemophilia and DMD). As the accuracy of NIPD for fetal sex determination is high (99.5%), possible discordance was not factored into the analysis.

### Attitudes towards non-invasive prenatal diagnosis among obstetricians in Pakistan, a developing, islamic country [^114MkSCh]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Stakeholders' views are essential for informing implementation strategies for non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). Little is known about such views in developing countries. We explored attitudes towards NIPT among obstetricians in Pakistan, a developing, Islamic country.

Methods

A 35-item questionnaire was distributed and collected at eight events (a national conference and seven workshops in five cities) for obstetric professionals on advances in fetal medicine.

Results

Responses from 113 obstetrician show positive attitudes towards implementation of NIPT: 95% agreed prevention of genetic conditions was a necessity, and 97% agreed public hospitals should provide prenatal screening tests. However, participants also agreed the availability of NIPT would increase social pressure on women to have prenatal screening tests and to terminate an affected pregnancy (53% and 63%, respectively). Most participants would not offer NIPT for sex determination (55%), although 31% would. The most valued aspects of NIPT were its safety, followed by its utility and then accuracy.

Conclusion

Participants generally supported the implementation of NIPT but raised concerns about social implications. Therefore, national policy is needed to regulate the implementation of NIPT, and pretest information and post-test genetic counselling are needed to mitigate social pressure and support parents to make informed decisions. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

### Ethical issues associated with prenatal screening using non-invasive prenatal testing for sex chromosome aneuploidy [^115j13xS]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2023). Medium credibility.

Prenatal screening for sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs) is increasingly available through expanded non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). NIPT for SCAs raises complex ethical issues for clinical providers, prospective parents and future children. This paper discusses the ethical issues that arise around NIPT for SCAs and current guidelines and protocols for management. The first section outlines current practice and the limitations of NIPT for SCAs. It then outlines key guidelines before discussing the ethical issues raised by this use of NIPT. We conclude that while screening for SCAs should be made available for people seeking to use NIPT, its implementation requires careful consideration of what, when and how information is provided to users.

In an unselected pregnant population, NIPT demonstrated a sensitivity of at least 99.2% and specificity of 100% for detection of trisomy 21 compared with traditional screening sensitivity of 78.9% and specificity of 94.6%. A systematic review reported a negative predictive value of 99–100% for chromosomal anomalies in a general/low risk population, and sex chromosomal conditions are not screened for by other traditional genetic screening tests.

Introduction

Around 6% of infants worldwide are born with a congenital anomaly, leading to hundreds of thousands of related fatalities and representing one of the leading causes of the global burden of illness. Prenatal testing allows for the early detection of congenital anomalies and has thus become an essential component of healthcare systems. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) allows for the detection of chromosomal anomalies through a maternal blood draw, posing no hazards to the pregnant woman or fetus.NIPT is typically performed between 9 and 14 weeks into the pregnancy and can screen for major chromosomal aneuploidies (ie, Patau (T13), Edwards (T18) and Down syndrome (T21)), sex chromosome aneuploidies (monosomy X, XXX, XYY and XXY), clinically significant duplications and microdeletions, and monogenic diseases. The test can also determine fetal sex early in gestation and might, in the future, even be used to sequence the fetuses' whole genome, analysing and reporting aberrations on any chromosome.NIPT is gaining global acceptance within healthcare systems due to its non-invasive nature and its ability to potentially reduce the necessity for more invasive diagnostic methods. Additionally, prenatal screening programmes are frequently justified by governments, policy bodies and health systems as necessary to enhance reproductive freedom and support informed choices relating to pregnancy. Nonetheless, in many countries, NIPT is still a user-pay screening test and is not publicly subsidised.

'Italy's healthcare system is a regionally based National Health Service (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, SSN) that provides universal coverage, largely free of charge at the point of service'. (Ferré de B, p 15) Prenatal care services are routinely provided at no cost within the Italian healthcare system. Such services include vaccinations, blood tests, ultrasounds, obstetrical and gynaecological check-ups, pre-eclampsia screening and anaesthesia evaluations. Additionally, expectant mothers have access to certain prenatal screening and diagnostic tests without charge. These include the combined test, which, since 2017, has been made available by the Italian Ministry of Health across all regions for expectant mothers who opt for it, and invasive tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling, which are performed exclusively when there is a significant risk of the unborn child having congenital disorders.

6 CURRENT EVIDENCE FOR SEX SELECTION

Access to ultrasound in regional areas in China was associated with an increase in the sex ratio at birth. 67 Approximately 40% to 50% of the increase in sex ratio at birth from the 1980s onwards can be explained by access to sex determination through ultrasound. 67 Although data for sex ratio at birth (SRB) are not available in China for non‐census years, there is an annual sample survey that provides data for the 0 to 4 age group (see Figure 1). For the census data, which does contain information about SRB, the SRB continued to slowly increase until the late 2000s. 69 This is in accordance with the annual sample survey. However, while it is unclear how accurate the national statistics are, 70 the data from the annual sample survey suggests that the SRB is now on a decline, although the most recent data reports that the SRB is still well above the natural ratio (at 114.5). This is in contrast to countries such as South Korea, which showed an increase in SRB in the early 1990s, but has since then exhibited a significant decline back to a natural ratio. 69

In India, data from the Sample Registration System indicate that the SRB was declining up until 2011‐2013. However, the SRB for 2012‐2014 and 2013‐2015 showed a marked increase in the SRB. 71 The Civil Registration System, which has recorded above 80% of births since 2011, shows an even more marked increase in the SRB, from 110 (2011) to 114 (2016) (rounded figures) (see Figure 2). 73

### The 2022 lasker awards: cell-free fetal DNA for prenatal testing… [^1159Ha46]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

The data also demonstrated a higher fractional concentration of fetal DNA in maternal plasma than in serum, thus leading to a preference of plasma as the sample type for subsequent development of noninvasive prenatal testing. Altogether, these data provided guidance for the operational parameters of NIPT in terms of the concentration ranges in which such tests could operate and the gestational ages at which such tests would be usable. These data indicated that there should be no concern about cell-free fetal DNA persisting from one pregnancy to the next and thereby adversely affecting the accuracy of NIPT performed in the subsequent pregnancy. Such rapid kinetics of circulating DNA has also been observed in other diagnostic applications of plasma DNA.

The first applications of cell-free fetal DNA for prenatal testing used genetic markers that the fetus had inherited from its father, but which were absent in the maternal genome. Examples included the Y chromosome mentioned earlier and the RHD gene. 4 Such tests were rapidly adopted by a number of laboratories, such as those in the UK and the Netherlands. Testing for fetal chromosomal aneuploidies is the most common reason pregnant women seek prenatal testing. However, owing to the relatively low positive predictive value of technologies such as nuchal translucency and maternal serum biochemical screening, most women with positive screen results who are referred for amniocentesis have euploid fetuses; therefore, it would be useful if cell-free fetal DNA could be used for developing a test with a much higher positive predictive value.

Accordingly, our research group and others demonstrated that the use of digital polymerase chain reaction was one way in which such precise measurements could be achieved. 5, 6 Because digital PCR counts only a small subset of plasma DNA molecules targeted by the PCR primers, most of the valuable information carried in the plasma DNA could be considered wasted. In an effort to overcome this shortcoming, we and others demonstrated that the use of information stored in maternal plasma could be maximized through the performance of massively parallel sequencing to sequence millions of plasma DNA molecules at random. 7, 8 We then performed the first large-scale clinical trial of this technology and achieved a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97. 9% for the prenatal detection of trisomy
21. 9 The high sensitivity and specificity of NIPT for fetal trisomy 21 detection has since been confirmed in multiple clinical studies.

### Reduction in diagnostic and therapeutic interventions by non-invasive determination of fetal sex in early pregnancy [^112fQErA]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This study reviews our clinical experience of non-invasive techniques for early sex determination. It assesses the effectiveness of these techniques at reducing invasive prenatal testing for X-linked genetic disease or for ambiguous development of the external genitalia.

Methods

A prospective cohort study of 30 pregnancies was referred to a tertiary unit for prenatal diagnosis. Fetal gender was determined using two non-invasive techniques: analysis of free fetal DNA (ffDNA) in maternal plasma and ultrasound visualisation. The results were compared to fetal gender determined by invasive testing or at birth.

Results

Fetal gender was accurately determined by analysis of ffDNA at a mean of 10 + 1 (7 + 6 to 14 + 1) weeks' gestation in all cases. Ultrasound assessment was accurate in 20 of the 23 cases where this was attempted at 12 + 0 (10 + 4 to 14 + 1) weeks' gestation, but could not be determined in the remaining 3 cases. Thirteen of 28 (46%) women chose not to have invasive testing on the basis of these findings.

Conclusions

Both the techniques appear to offer an accurate means of assessing fetal gender, giving parents the option of avoiding invasive testing in the 50% of cases where the fetus would not be affected. The molecular technique is performed at an earlier gestation, but female fetal status is predicted by a negative test result. Ultrasound cannot be applied until 11 weeks' gestation but diagnostic signs are sought in both sexes. Combining these approaches offers a highly sensitive method of non-invasive determination of gender in high-risk pregnancies. Health professionals, clinical geneticists and genetics associates, in particular, who refer women at high risk should be aware of these non-invasive options for prenatal sex determination.

### Mainstreaming genetics into Italian prenatal care: exploring the future implementation of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) in the Italian national healthcare system using stakeholder interviews [^116qdNYs]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Defining the scope of NIPT

Most interviewees agreed that NIPT should be offered for free for T13, T18 and T21 screening in the public healthcare sector as these are the most common chromosomal anomalies and allow for survival at birth. Furthermore, the use of NIPT to screen for T13, T18 and T21 has a high detection rate and is strongly supported by scientific evidence. No agreement was reached on whether fetal sex and sex chromosome aneuploidies screening should be included in the public NIPT offer. Specifically, four interviewees advised including fetal sex determination as knowing whether the fetus is male or female helps to identify a series of pathologies linked to the sex chromosomes. Contrastingly, seven interviewees suggested against the inclusion of fetal sex screening in the public offer, given the low clinical utility and the fact that the test may induce sex selection, raising significant ethical concerns. Five participants advocated for the inclusion of sex-chromosome aneuploidies screening in the public offer, given the robust validation studies supporting such NIPT use. Contrarily, five interviewees stated that the sex-chromosome aneuploidies screening lacks adequate validation studies, has a high rate of false positives and poor clinical utility, thus recommending against its inclusion in the public offer.

For sex chromosome aneuploidies, there is unfortunately also an ethical issue in the sense that they are not life-incompatible diseases, and they give a lot of false positives. Correcting individuals who only have future problems, I don't know how reliable the diagnostics are in that sense (Interviewee #4).

Nearly all interviewees disagreed with the future practice of making WGS/WES and microdeletions/microduplications screenings available through the public sector. The reasons not to include such extensions are, according to the participants, primarily due to a lack of validation studies and clinical evidence and to the poor validity and specificity surrounding such test applications, going against the goal of screening, namely that of reducing the number of women who need to undergo invasive procedures. Furthermore, two interviewees noted that such test applications might find alleles that we are not aware of and may identify a number of genome variations that we do not know how to interpret, potentially inducing selection and ' going against the genetic blueprint of human evolution ' (interviewee #5).

3 AVAILABILITY OF NIPT FOR SEX DETERMINATION

NIPT is currently being adopted in health care systems across the world. In many countries, NIPT remains a user‐pays option and is not publicly funded. However, some countries have begun to provide public funding for NIPT. In Belgium, NIPT has been available for reimbursement as a primary screening test since July 2017. 24 In the Netherlands, NIPT is being provided as a screen to all pregnant women regardless of risk as part of the TRIDENT‐2 implementation study. 25, 26 Other countries provide funding for NIPT contingent on risk for fetal anomalies, such as Switzerland, 27 Denmark, 28, 29 and Canada (only certain provinces). 30, 31 In the United Kingdom, NIPT is available in the National Health Service (NHS) across Wales as a secondary screen for high‐risk populations. 32 However, many of these systems do not fund non‐medical sex determination, instead focusing on screening for autosomal disorders. 33, 34

NIPT for non‐medical sex determination is easily accessible through the private sector in many countries, 35 but in some countries such as India, prenatal sex determination is outlawed. 36 A 2017 Nuffield Council on Bioethics report recommended that non‐medical NIPT sex determination not be offered through the UK NHS or private providers. 35 In the United Kingdom, there have also been calls by members of the Labour Party for non‐medical NIPT sex determination to be banned. 37 In response, the Nuffield Council reiterated their stance that NIPT for non‐medical sex determination should not be offered through the NHS. 38 They also recommended that private providers be prevented from providing non‐medical sex determination.

### Discordant non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT)-a systematic review [^111916Ls]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2017). Low credibility.

With a high sensitivity and specificity, non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is an incomparable screening test for fetal aneuploidy. However, the method is rather newly introduced, and experiences with discordant results are few. We did a systematic review of literature reporting details of false positive and false negative NIPT results. Discordant sex chromosome results were not included. We identified 22 studies reporting case details. In total, 206 discordant cases were included, of which 88% were false positive and 12% false negative. Details on maternal age, gestational age, platform/company, Z-score, fetal fraction, results and explanation were specified. The main reasons for discordant results were confined placental mosaicism, maternal copy number variation, vanished twin, maternal cancer and true fetal mosaicism. A very high percentage of cases (67%) were reported with no obvious biological or technical explanation for the discordant result. The included cases represent only a minor part of the true number of false positive or false negative NIPT cases identified in fetal medicine clinics around the world. To ensure knowledge exchange and transparency of NIPT between laboratories, we suggest a systematic recording of discordant NIPT results, as well as a quality assurance by external quality control and accreditation. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

### Genomics-based non-invasive prenatal testing for detection of fetal chromosomal aneuploidy in pregnant women [^111JmUgv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Common fetal aneuploidies include Down syndrome (trisomy 21 or T21), Edward syndrome (trisomy 18 or T18), Patau syndrome (trisomy 13 or T13), Turner syndrome (45, X), Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY), Triple X syndrome (47, XXX) and 47, XYY syndrome (47, XYY). Prenatal screening for fetal aneuploidies is standard care in many countries, but current biochemical and ultrasound tests have high false negative and false positive rates. The discovery of fetal circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) in maternal blood offers the potential for genomics-based non-invasive prenatal testing (gNIPT) as a more accurate screening method. Two approaches used for gNIPT are massively parallel shotgun sequencing (MPSS) and targeted massively parallel sequencing (TMPS).

Objectives

To evaluate and compare the diagnostic accuracy of MPSS and TMPS for gNIPT as a first-tier test in unselected populations of pregnant women undergoing aneuploidy screening or as a second-tier test in pregnant women considered to be high risk after first-tier screening for common fetal aneuploidies. The gNIPT results were confirmed by a reference standard such as fetal karyotype or neonatal clinical examination.

Search Methods

We searched 13 databases (including MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science) from 1 January 2007 to 12 July 2016 without any language, search filter or publication type restrictions. We also screened reference lists of relevant full-text articles, websites of private prenatal diagnosis companies and conference abstracts.

Selection Criteria

Studies could include pregnant women of any age, ethnicity and gestational age with singleton or multifetal pregnancy. The women must have had a screening test for fetal aneuploidy by MPSS or TMPS and a reference standard such as fetal karyotype or medical records from birth.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction and quality assessment (using the QUADAS-2 tool). Where possible, hierarchical models or simpler alternatives were used for meta-analysis.

Main Results

Sixty-five studies of 86,139 pregnant women (3141 aneuploids and 82,998 euploids) were included. No study was judged to be at low risk of bias across the four domains of the QUADAS-2 tool but applicability concerns were generally low. Of the 65 studies, 42 enrolled pregnant women at high risk, five recruited an unselected population and 18 recruited cohorts with a mix of prior risk of fetal aneuploidy. Among the 65 studies, 44 evaluated MPSS and 21 evaluated TMPS; of these, five studies also compared gNIPT with a traditional screening test (biochemical, ultrasound or both). Forty-six out of 65 studies (71%) reported gNIPT assay failure rate, which ranged between 0% and 25% for MPSS, and between 0.8% and 7.5% for TMPS. In the population of unselected pregnant women, MPSS was evaluated by only one study; the study assessed T21, T18 and T13. TMPS was assessed for T21 in four studies involving unselected cohorts; three of the studies also assessed T18 and 13. In pooled analyses (88 T21 cases, 22 T18 cases, eight T13 cases and 20,649 unaffected pregnancies (non T21, T18 and T13)), the clinical sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI)) of TMPS was 99.2% (78.2% to 100%), 90.9% (70.0% to 97.7%) and 65.1% (9.16% to 97.2%) for T21, T18 and T13, respectively. The corresponding clinical specificity was above 99.9% for T21, T18 and T13. In high-risk populations, MPSS was assessed for T21, T18, T13 and 45, X in 30, 28, 20 and 12 studies, respectively. In pooled analyses (1048 T21 cases, 332 T18 cases, 128 T13 cases and 15,797 unaffected pregnancies), the clinical sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI)) of MPSS was 99.7% (98.0% to 100%), 97.8% (92.5% to 99.4%), 95.8% (86.1% to 98.9%) and 91.7% (78.3% to 97.1%) for T21, T18, T13 and 45, X, respectively. The corresponding clinical specificities (95% CI) were 99.9% (99.8% to 100%), 99.9% (99.8% to 100%), 99.8% (99.8% to 99.9%) and 99.6% (98.9% to 99.8%). In this risk group, TMPS was assessed for T21, T18, T13 and 45, X in six, five, two and four studies. In pooled analyses (246 T21 cases, 112 T18 cases, 20 T13 cases and 4282 unaffected pregnancies), the clinical sensitivity (95% CI) of TMPS was 99.2% (96.8% to 99.8%), 98.2% (93.1% to 99.6%), 100% (83.9% to 100%) and 92.4% (84.1% to 96.5%) for T21, T18, T13 and 45, X respectively. The clinical specificities were above 100% for T21, T18 and T13 and 99.8% (98.3% to 100%) for 45, X. Indirect comparisons of MPSS and TMPS for T21, T18 and 45, X showed no statistical difference in clinical sensitivity, clinical specificity or both. Due to limited data, comparative meta-analysis of MPSS and TMPS was not possible for T13. We were unable to perform meta-analyses of gNIPT for 47, XXX, 47, XXY and 47, XYY because there were very few or no studies in one or more risk groups.

Authors' Conclusions

These results show that MPSS and TMPS perform similarly in terms of clinical sensitivity and specificity for the detection of fetal T31, T18, T13 and sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA). However, no study compared the two approaches head-to-head in the same cohort of patients. The accuracy of gNIPT as a prenatal screening test has been mainly evaluated as a second-tier screening test to identify pregnancies at very low risk of fetal aneuploidies (T21, T18 and T13), thus avoiding invasive procedures. Genomics-based non-invasive prenatal testing methods appear to be sensitive and highly specific for detection of fetal trisomies 21, 18 and 13 in high-risk populations. There is paucity of data on the accuracy of gNIPT as a first-tier aneuploidy screening test in a population of unselected pregnant women. With respect to the replacement of invasive tests, the performance of gNIPT observed in this review is not sufficient to replace current invasive diagnostic tests. We conclude that given the current data on the performance of gNIPT, invasive fetal karyotyping is still the required diagnostic approach to confirm the presence of a chromosomal abnormality prior to making irreversible decisions relative to the pregnancy outcome. However, most of the gNIPT studies were prone to bias, especially in terms of the selection of participants.

### Enhancing non-invasive prenatal testing: a novel approach to improve 45, X prediction accuracy [^1159Qdjk]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Traditional non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs) has a higher risk of false positives, particularly for 45, X. This study introduces an innovative NIPT analysis pipeline to minimize false positives in 45, X screening.

Methods

We included 39 cases from the NIPT records of 15,882 pregnancies, including 20 with 45, X and 19 controls, and performed standard NIPT and size-selection NIPT tests. Based on the two NIPT results, the Z s -score was used to determine aneuploidy status: > 3 indicated 45, X, and -3 to 3 suggested a negative result. We analyzed the change in the positive predictive value (PPV) of NIPT for 45, X.

Results

By integrating data from two NIPT experiments and monitoring sex chromosome variations, the Z s of the control group ranged from -3 to 3, indicating no 45, X. In the NIPT-45, X group, 9 out of 20 cases had Z s > 3, whereas the remaining 11 cases had Z s between -3 and 3. The PPV of NIPT for 45, X improved from 25.00% (5/20) to 55.56% (5/9), and 73.33% (11/15) of the initial false positives were corrected by our method.

Conclusion

Our advanced analysis process significantly improved the PPV of NIPT for 45, X and reduced the incidence of false positives.

### 'Is it better not to know certain things?': views of women who have undergone non-invasive prenatal testing on its possible future applications [^112t8QBa]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2019). Medium credibility.

Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is at the forefront of prenatal screening. Current uses for NIPT include fetal sex determination and screening for chromosomal disorders such as trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). However, NIPT may be expanded to many different future applications. There are a potential host of ethical concerns around the expanding use of NIPT, as examined by the recent Nuffield Council report on the topic. It is important to examine what NIPT might be used for before these possibilities become consumer reality. There is limited research exploring views of women on possible future uses of NIPT, particularly those of women who have undergone NIPT. In this study, we examined the views of women who undertook NIPT previously on the acceptability of and interest levels in using NIPT for a number of current and possible future applications. These included several medical conditions encompassing psychiatric, neurodevelopmental and adult-onset conditions as well as non-medical traits such as intelligence. One thousand women were invited to participate and 235 eligible surveys were received. Women generally reported an interest in using NIPT for medical conditions that severely impacted quality of life and with an onset earlier in life and stressed the importance of the accuracy of the test. Concerns were raised about the use of NIPT for non-medical traits. Respondents indicated that termination of pregnancy was not their only reason for testing, particularly in the case of sex. These results can further inform the ethical debate around the increasing integration of NIPT into healthcare systems.

### Fetal sex determination in twin pregnancies using non-invasive prenatal testing [^111hQDFX]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Four cases of discordant results occurred; one FM case was predicted to be MM, and three MM cases were predicted to be FM. A first potential reason for a wrong sex determination could be a low fetal fraction. In our dataset, the lowest fetal fraction is 5.4% in male twins and this sample is correctly classified. Thus, a low fetal fraction is not the reason for the false positive results. Nevertheless, we observe that for male twins with lower fetal fraction and mixed sex cases with higher fetal fraction, the sex determination is decreased. Hence, the fetal sex determination is not necessarily higher with increased fetal fraction. A second potential reason for discrepant results could be unequal shedding of DNA from the two placentas in the maternal blood circulation. Studies analyzing maternal plasma cfDNA in dizygotic twins have shown that the circulating fetal DNA from both placentas can vary nearly 2-fold. Accordingly, it is possible that in a dizygotic twin pregnancy the fetal fraction of one fetus may be too low for reliable cfDNA analysis. This could lead to an erroneous result for fetal sex as well as for aneuploidy determination. We thus reiterate that the performance of the test is not necessarily only linked to the overall/combined fetal fraction since different fetal cfDNA contributions in the DCDA group could impact performance in those cases. Another likely cause for discrepancies is the presence of X chromosome copy number mosaicism in the maternal blood. Several studies show that imbalances in the maternal genome impair NIPT precision. Sex chromosomal mosaicism can also interfere with fetal sex chromosome determination in singleton pregnancies. Finally, we cannot exclude the presence of fetal sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs). Interestingly, our approach in analyzing the sex in twin pregnancies shows similarities with the method described to discriminate SCAs in singleton pregnancies. Mazloom and colleagues presented an algorithm based on normalized sequence reads of sex chromosomes as well, that detected SCAs in singleton pregnancies with a combined sensitivity of 96.2% and a false positive rate of 0.3%. Unfortunately, we consider that the interpretation of SCAs in multiple pregnancies is not possible with the currently available methods.

In summary, the accurate sex prediction model demonstrated here, based on the normalized frequencies of X and Y chromosomes and fetal fraction estimation, represents a valuable approach to characterize fetal sex in twins, and can help improve overall twin pregnancies management. Nevertheless, despite the high precision of the prediction a limited level of uncertainty remains. Hence, confirmation by ultrasound is warranted.

### Sex selection and non-invasive prenatal testing: a review of current practices, evidence, and ethical issues [^113EsyiX]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) can determine the sex of the fetus very accurately and very early in gestation. There are concerns that the ease, timing, and accuracy of NIPT sex determination will facilitate sex-selective termination of pregnancy (TOP). Here, we review current practices, the evidence for a link between NIPT and sex-selective TOP, and associated ethical issues. Sex-selective TOP, usually motivated by son preference, has had serious demographic consequences in countries such as India and China. Currently, ultrasound is the primary method by which parents determine the sex of the fetus. The diffusion of ultrasound technology has had a direct impact on the rates of sex-selective TOP. Although NIPT is currently more costly, it is feasible that increased uptake of this technology could have a similar effect. Partly because NIPT is a relatively recent development in prenatal screening, there is little data on the impact of NIPT on sex selection practices. Evidence that NIPT is playing a role in sex-selective TOP remains largely anecdotal. Further research is required to assess and quantify TOP resulting from NIPT sex determination. The use of these technologies for sex selection raises a number of ethical issues, in addition to practical demographic consequences.

### Fetal sex determination in twin pregnancies using non-invasive prenatal testing [^112rT4Rg]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite NIPT being considered a feasible option for risk estimation of fetal aneuploidies in twin pregnancies, it is well-known that its accuracy depends on the proportion of fetal cfDNA circulating in the maternal plasma. Even though the circulating cfDNA has shown to be higher in twin pregnancies compared with singletons, the fetal fraction per twin can be lower. In addition, the relative proportion of fetal DNA per twin might be different, which could lead to an erroneous result in both sex or aneuploidy determination because one of the twins might contribute to an unsatisfactory fetal fraction. Notably, chorionicity may also impact NIPT results since cfDNA is placental in origin, resulting from apoptotic trophoblasts, and the representation of fetal fraction could be affected depending on whether the twins share the same placenta or not. Previous studies have indeed shown that prenatal aneuploidy screening is less robust in twin pregnancies, and regardless the high detection rate for fetal sex determination, discordant results still occur. Especially in dizygotic twins, depending on the amount of Y chromosome present in the maternal circulation it might be challenging to precisely predict mixed-sex pairs. Recently, we introduced a novel approach to map mosaicism which can accurately predict the presence of discordant autosomal constitution in twin pregnancies. Expanding on this approach, we present a new data analysis tool that allows the accurate prediction of fetal sex in twin pregnancies.

We suggest that prenatal sex determination be incorporated into all prenatal treatment research protocols; however, prenatal sex determination is illegal in some countries to prevent female feticide. By using massively parallel DNA sequencing near CYP21A2, it was possible to determine the CYP21A2 genotype in 14 of 14 at‑risk fetuses within 3 weeks of obtaining fetal DNA in maternal blood samples.

Methods

Sample collection and processing

This retrospective study was granted by the Ethical Committees of the University Hospital Leuven, and a written informed consent was obtained from all participants. NIPT sequence reads were recovered from twin pregnancies with documented sex. Fetal sex confirmation was done either by ultrasound during the 20th week of gestation or postnatally by visual inspection. Table 2 presents the characteristics of all samples included in this research. In total, 198 twin pregnancies were investigated. Chorionicity and amnionicity were determined by ultrasound in all twin pregnancies, which are classified as dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA), monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA), or monochorionic monoamniotic (MCMA), based on whether the pairs share the same placenta and amniotic sac or not. Genetic counseling is provided by the gynecologists before sampling for NIPT. The patient is informed that in case of a dizygotic twin pregnancy, the accuracy of the test for fetal sex determination and aneuploidy detection can be lower compared to a monozygotic twin pregnancy due to a possibility of a mixed-sex twin. Peripheral blood samples from pregnant women were collected from 10 weeks of gestation onwards in either cell-free DNA BCT tubes (Streck, Omaha, NE, USA) or cell-free DNA collection tubes (Roche Diagnostics, Germany). Cell-free DNA extraction, DNA library preparation, as well as whole genome sequencing were carried out as previously described.

Recommendations

NIPT offers improved accuracy when testing for common autosomal aneuploidies compared with existing tests such as cFTS. However, a positive NIPT result should not be regarded as a final diagnosis: false positives occur for a variety of reasons (including that the DNA sequenced is both maternal and fetal in origin, and that the fetal fraction derives from the placenta as well as the developing fetus). Thus women should be advised to have a positive result confirmed through diagnostic testing, preferably by amniocentesis, if they are considering a possible termination of pregnancy.
The better test performance, including lower invasive testing rate of NIPT-based screening should not lead to lower standards for pretest information and counseling. This is especially important in the light of the aim of providing pregnant women with meaningful options for reproductive choice. There should be specific attention paid to the information needs of women from other linguistic and cultural backgrounds or who are less health literate.
If NIPT is offered for a specific set of conditions (eg trisomies 21, 18 and 13), it may not be reasonably possible to avoid additional findings, such as other chromosomal anomalies or large scale insertions or deletions. As part of pretest information, women and couples should be made aware of the possibility of such additional findings and the range of their implications. There should be a clear policy for dealing with such findings, as much as possible also taking account of pregnant women's wishes with regard to receiving or not receiving specific information.
Expanding NIPT-based prenatal screening to also report on sex-chromosomal abnormalities and microdeletions not only raises ethical concerns related to information and counseling challenges but also risks reversing the important reduction in invasive testing achieved with implementation of NIPT for aneuploidy, and is therefore currently not recommended.
Emerging opportunities for combining prenatal screening for fetal abnormalities with screening aimed at prevention may undermine adequate counseling by sending mixed messages. The objective of any prenatal screening activity should be made explicit and, as far as possible, forms of prenatal screening with different aims should be presented separately. If not physically possible, this separation should at least be made conceptually when providing the relevant information.
In countries where prenatal screening for fetal abnormalities is offered as a public health programme, governments and public health authorities should adopt an active role to ensure the responsible introduction of NIPT as a second or first-tier screening test for Down syndrome and other common autosomal aneuploidies. This entails ensuring quality control also extending to the non-laboratory aspects of NIPT-based prenatal screening (information, counseling), education of professionals, systematic evaluation of all aspects of the screening programme, as well as promoting equity of access for all pregnant women within the confines of the available budget, and setting up a governance structure for responsible further innovation in prenatal screening.
Different scenarios for NIPT-based screening for common autosomal aneuploidies are possible, including NIPT as an alternative first-tier option. The inevitable trade-offs underlying those scenarios should not just be regarded as a matter of screening technology and health economics; the question is also how these trade-offs enable or impede meaningful reproductive choices and how they affect both the balance of benefits and burdens for pregnant women and their partners, and the screening goals and values acceptable to society.
In order to adequately evaluate prenatal screening practices, there is a need to further develop and validate measures of informed choice as well as interventions aimed at enabling informed choices. The transition to NIPT-based prenatal screening presents an opportunity to fill this gap in knowledge.
In the light of sequencing technologies becoming better and cheaper, there is an acute need for a proactive professional and societal debate about what the future scope of prenatal screening for fetal abnormalities should be. As argued in this document, there are strong ethical reasons for not expanding the scope of prenatal screening beyond serious congenital and childhood disorders.
The scenario in which prenatal screening would open up possibilities for fetal therapy in addition to autonomous reproductive choice raises fundamental questions about the relation between reproductive autonomy and parental responsibility that require an in depth proactive ethical analysis.

### High sensitivity and specificity in fetal gender identification in the first trimester, using ultrasound and noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS) in twin pregnancies, a prospective study [^114HwjCV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The determination of the fetal gender is often performed due to parental request and for various medical reasons such as: in families that are carriers of X-linked disorders, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and fragile X syndrome, andin cases where there is a question regarding the fetal phenotype and the development of the external genitalia.

In cases of fetuses with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), early gender assignment and antenatal treatment with corticosteroids can prevent the masculinization of the female fetus.

Specifically in twin pregnancies, the determination of fetal gender can also help in the evaluation of chorionicity and labeling of the fetuses. Ongoing technological progress, including high-resolution probes for abdominal and vaginal ultrasound scanning, contribute to routine first-trimester ultrasound examinations between 11 weeks + 0 days to 13 weeks + 6-day gestation and has long become an established part of antenatal care. This first-trimester scan is now a common practice in fetal evaluation and gender assessment during the first trimester.

Sonographic determination of the fetal gender in the first trimester is performed by mid-sagittal probe plane and assessing the angle between the genital tubercle and the body axis. Fetuses with assigned male gender display a cranially directed tubercle and a higher angle; in female fetuses, the tubercle is pointed caudally with a shallow angle.

Another method for detecting fetal gender in the first trimester is a non-invasive prenatal screen (NIPS) using circulating free fetal DNA in the maternal blood. Gender assignment by NIPS is performed using either real-time PCR or Y chromosome read counting. The NIPS test assigns fetal gender based on whether Y chromosome material is detected or not. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommends the use of NIPS as a first tire for screening for fetal aneuploidy, including sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCA). This approach is adopted in the Netherlands. Most genetic laboratories report fetal gender in a singleton pregnancy and the detection of the Y chromosome in twin pregnancies, upon parental request or medical needs.

In the current study we aimed to ultrasonographical assess the accuracy of fetal gender determination during 11–14 week's gestational age.

We further subdivided gestational age in three different cutoff of crown rump length (CRL) CRL 45–54 mm, CRL 55–67 mm and CRL 67–87 mm, and assessed the gender assignment accuracy in each group.

A secondary aim was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of Y chromosome detection using NIPS in these twin pregnancies.

### Non-invasive prenatal testing for aneuploidy and beyond: challenges of responsible innovation in prenatal screening [^115F1T5F]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

In this document, we use 'NIPT' as a general term for non-invasive prenatal testing based on quantitative or qualitative analysis of cfDNA in maternal blood, used in the context of prenatal screening. By prenatal screening we understand the routine offer of medical tests to pregnant women without a known individual higher risk of having a child with a specific disorder or a compromised outcome of the pregnancy. This is usually a two-tier procedure, consisting of a screening test stricto sensu with diagnostic follow-up testing in case of a positive result. In many Western countries, prenatal screening is offered in a public health setting. This entails a systematic approach with quality controlled uniform provision procedures, and (different levels of) public funding. In other countries or states, such as in the USA, prenatal screening is made available to (self-paying or insured) patients through individual practitioners or practices, ideally in accordance with professional guidelines. Finally, NIPT for sex selection and paternity testing is commercially offered by laboratories as direct-to-consumer (DTC) tests.

When, in this document, we refer to 'women and their partners', or 'women or couples', this is to acknowledge that decisions about prenatal screening or its outcomes will often be shared by pregnant women with their partners and that these partners (mostly the biological father-to-be) do have an interest in knowing a diagnosis in their future child. Moreover, depending on the conditions tested, some outcomes may also have implications for the father himself. However, professionals should ascertain that consent for prenatal testing and other procedures is based on a free and voluntary decision of the woman herself, as it is her body and her pregnancy. Legally, prenatal screening is offered to the woman only, with her partner having no say in the relevant decisions.

### Healthcare professionals' perspectives on and experiences with non-invasive prenatal testing: a systematic review [^114GdY2i]. Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Possible benefits of fetal sex determination were noted by a minority of HPs. These were the belief that early parental knowledge of biological sex was thought to facilitate bonding (McKinn et al.) and that sex selection could be viewed positively in specific situations within a cultural context (Alexander et al.).

Microdeletions and microduplications

Healthcare professionals' views on the use of NIPT for the detection of microdeletions and microduplications were varied (Gammon et al; Haidar et al.). In one study, 34.1% of Canadian HPs opposed this use of NIPT, while 8.9% were in favour and 57.0% were undecided (Haidar et al.). Despite this, studies in Europe, the USA, Canada and Singapore reported that most HPs offered NIPT for microdeletions and microduplications (Benachi et al; Stevens et al; Yang & Tan).

Reasons for supporting NIPT for microdeletion and microduplication detection included supporting autonomy, (Yang & Tan) that this use of the test was not associated with additional cost (Yang & Tan) and the opportunity to gain more information about the fetus (Gammon et al.). Apprehensiveness arose from uncertainty around the utility of detecting microdeletions and microduplications, (Gammon et al.) low test sensitivity,(Burgess et al.) challenges keeping up-to-date with ever-changing test panels (Gammon et al.) lack of access to validation data (Agatisa et al.) as well as the complexities explaining them to pregnant people in order to support informed decision-making (Agatisa et al; Gammon et al.).

### Fetal sex results of noninvasive prenatal testing and differences with ultrasonography [^113yBRF1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

In summary, for a prenatally reported fetal sex discrepancy, human error must be ruled out by confirming correct sample labeling. This is performed when a SNP-based NIPT method is used by repeating the sample and verifying maternal SNP concordance. All available clinical data should be reviewed. If ultrasound examination is discordant with the NIPT finding, despite performance by an experienced examiner after 16 weeks of gestation with optimal visualization, the option of invasive prenatal diagnosis by amniocentesis should be discussed. We do not encourage chorionic villus sampling, owing to the frequency of confined placental mosaicism associated with sex chromosome abnormalities. If a discrepancy persists, we suggest that a multidisciplinary team meet to review all of the available information and develop a care pathway for the family. This team is essential to guide the transition from prenatal to postnatal life for the child and family, regardless of whether the family elects to pursue prenatal diagnostic evaluation or delay until after delivery. It is critical that at least one member of this team remain involved with the child and family after delivery. Not only does this provide continuity of care for the family, but perhaps even more importantly, it ensures that all of the information obtained during the prenatal period is communicated completely and accurately to the pediatric care team.

### Fetal sex determination in twin pregnancies using cell free fetal DNA analysis [^1178QRge]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2018). Low credibility.

Objective(S)

We sought to develop an accurate sex classification method in twin pregnancies using data obtained from a standard commercial non-invasive prenatal test.

Study Design

A total of 706 twin pregnancies were included in this retrospective analytical data study. Normalized chromosome values for chromosomes X and Y were used and adapted into a sex-score to predict fetal sex in each fetus, and results were compared with the clinical outcome at birth.

Results

Outcome information at birth for sex chromosomes was available for 232 twin pregnancies. From these, a total of 173 twin pregnancies with a Y chromosome identified in non-invasive pregnancy testing were used for the development of a predictive model. Global accuracy for sex classification in the testing set with 51 samples was 0.98 (95% confidence interval [0.90,0.99]), with a specificity and sensitivity of 1 (95% confidence interval [0.82,1.00]) and 0.97 (95% confidence interval [0.84,0.99]), respectively.

Conclusion

While non-invasive prenatal testing is a screening method and confirmatory results must be obtained by ultrasound or genetic diagnosis, the sex-score determination presented herein offers an accurate and useful approach to characterizing fetus sex in twin pregnancies in a non-invasive manner early on in pregnancy.

### Views of Canadian healthcare professionals on the future uses of non-invasive prenatal testing: a mixed method study [^113sodfk]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Non-invasive prenatal testing's (NIPT) potential to screen for a wide range of conditions is receiving growing attention. This study explores Canadian healthcare professionals' perceptions towards NIPT's current and possible future uses, including paternity testing, sex determination, and fetal whole genome sequencing. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten healthcare professionals, and another 184 participated in a survey. The triangulation of our findings shows that there is considerable agreement among healthcare professionals on expanding NIPT use for medical conditions including fetal aneuploidies and monogenic diseases, but not for non-medical conditions (sex determination for non-medical reasons and paternity testing), nor for risk predisposition information (late onset diseases and Fetal Whole Genome Sequencing). Healthcare professionals raise concerns related to eugenics, the future child's privacy, and psychological and emotional burdens to prospective parents. Professional societies need to take these concerns into account when educating healthcare professionals on the uses of NIPT to ensure prospective parents' reproductive decisions are optimal for them and their families.

### Maternal source of false-positive fetal sex chromosome aneuploidy in noninvasive prenatal testing [^115LRp8M]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The intent of noninvasive prenatal testing is to screen for fetal aneuploidies. The assumption is that overrepresented and underrepresented chromosomes are of fetal origin. However, this is not always the case.

Cases

We report three cases in which maternal sex chromosome aneuploidy (confirmed by karyotype), two cases of which were previously unknown, resulted in false-positive results. In each, results were positive for fetal aneuploidy, but neonatal karyotypes confirmed normal karyotype.

Conclusion

Noninvasive prenatal testing assesses the proportion of chromosomes 21, 18, 13, and sex chromosomes in maternal circulation. Intrinsic to the analysis is that the underrepresentations and overrepresentations are of fetal origin. We present three cases in which this assumption is not valid. We suggest that maternal sex chromosome aneuploidy be considered when results suggest fetal sex chromosome aneuploidies.

### Outcome data for non-invasive prenatal testing suggestive of an atypical sex chromosome abnormality of fetal / placental origin [^116tkt6Z]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Medium credibility.

This study was designed to identify outcome data for non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) results suggestive of an atypical sex chromosome abnormality of fetal/placental origin. A single-center descriptive case series was performed between January 1, 2022 and August 1, 2024, which identified 16 cases, 11 of which completed diagnostic testing. Of those 11 cases, only 2 were found to have detectable chromosomal abnormalities of the fetus (monosomy X and mosaic monosomy X). The majority of the 9 cases without detectable fetal chromosome abnormalities cannot be assessed for the presence of confined placental mosaicism due to the lack of CVS testing; however one confirmed case was identified. While this case series is limited in size, it highlights examples that can be used by clinicians in counseling patients about possible outcomes for these atypical NIPT results. These cases also showcase the importance of pre and post-test counseling, due to the complexity of results. Larger studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these findings and to further guide patient counseling.

### Sex selection and non-invasive prenatal testing: a review of current practices, evidence, and ethical issues [^115CVk7Q]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Non‐invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) can determine the sex of the fetus very accurately and very early in gestation. There are concerns that the ease, timing, and accuracy of NIPT sex determination will facilitate sex‐selective termination of pregnancy (TOP). Here, we review current practices, the evidence for a link between NIPT and sex‐selective TOP, and associated ethical issues. Sex‐selective TOP, usually motivated by son preference, has had serious demographic consequences in countries such as India and China. Currently, ultrasound is the primary method by which parents determine the sex of the fetus. The diffusion of ultrasound technology has had a direct impact on the rates of sex‐selective TOP. Although NIPT is currently more costly, it is feasible that increased uptake of this technology could have a similar effect. Partly because NIPT is a relatively recent development in prenatal screening, there is little data on the impact of NIPT on sex selection practices. Evidence that NIPT is playing a role in sex‐selective TOP remains largely anecdotal. Further research is required to assess and quantify TOP resulting from NIPT sex determination. The use of these technologies for sex selection raises a number of ethical issues, in addition to practical demographic consequences.

### Sex selection and non-invasive prenatal testing: a review of current practices, evidence, and ethical issues [^113uK1EC]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

There is some empirical research into the views of women (including previous users of NIPT) towards the use of NIPT for non‐medical sex determination and selection. One 2014 study from Ohio, in the United States, found that 49% of respondents (pregnant women) would use NIPT for sex determination, as compared with CVS (19%). 102 A 2016 Swedish study found that 50% of respondents (pregnant women) would like to use NIPT to find out the fetal sex. 103 A more recent 2019 study from Victoria, Australia, which surveyed women who had previously undergone NIPT, found that 61% indicated an interest in using NIPT for sex determination, although a higher percentage (86%) indicated support for the general availability of NIPT for such a use. When asked about the use of that information for sex‐selective TOP, 99% of respondents indicated that they would "definitely not" consider it. 104 In comparison with these relatively supportive values for NIPT sex determination, a 2015 study from the Netherlands found that only 19% of pregnant women surveyed strongly disagreed with the assertion that NIPT "should only be possible for disorders, so not for gender" (54% neither disagreed or agreed). 105 A study of online discussions about NIPT found that some women reported using NIPT specifically for sex determination, although they did not disclose this to their health care provider as their primary motivation. 106

### Discordant fetal sex on NIPT and ultrasound [^116HT6D6]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

Prenatal diagnosis of sex discordance is a relatively new phenomenon. Prior to cell-free DNA testing, the diagnosis of a disorder of sexual differentiation was serendipitous, either through identification of ambiguous genitalia at the midtrimester morphology ultrasound or discovery of genotype-phenotype discordance in cases where preimplantation genetic diagnosis or invasive prenatal testing had occurred. The widespread integration of cfDNA testing into modern antenatal screening has made sex chromosome assessment possible from 10weeks of gestation, and discordant fetal sex is now more commonly diagnosed prenatally, with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 1500–2000 pregnancies. Early detection of phenotype-genotype sex discordance is important as it may indicate an underlying genetic, chromosomal or biochemical condition and it also allows for time-critical postnatal treatment. The aim of this article is to review cfDNA and ultrasound diagnosis of fetal sex, identify possible causes of phenotype-genotype discordance and provide a systematic approach for clinicians when counseling and managing couples in this circumstance.

### Attitudes towards non-invasive prenatal testing for aneuploidy among US adults of reproductive age [^1133Uph6]. Journal of Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine how adults in the United States view non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA testing) in order to help estimate uptake.

Study Design

A national sample of 1861 US-based adults was surveyed using a validated online survey instrument. The survey was administered by a commercial survey research company. Respondents were randomized to receive a survey about prenatal testing for trisomy 13 and 18 or trisomy 21. Participants were asked to select among testing modalities, including cffDNA testing, and rank the features of testing that they considered most important to decision making.

Result

There was substantive interest in the use of cffDNA testing rather than traditional screening mechanisms, with a minority of respondents reporting that they would support the use of both methods in combination. The lower rates of false-negative and false-positive test results and the ability to use the test earlier in the pregnancy were the most highly rated benefits of cffDNA testing. Participants expressed strong support for diagnostic confirmation via invasive testing after a positive result from either screening or cffDNA testing. However, almost one-third of participants reported that they would not endorse the use of either invasive or non-invasive prenatal testing.

Conclusion

There appears to be support for uptake of non-invasive prenatal tests. Clinical guidelines should therefore go forward in providing guidance on how to integrate non-invasive methods into the current standard of care. However, our findings indicate that even when accuracy, which is rated by patients as the most important aspect of prenatal testing, is significantly improved over existing screening methods and testing is offered non-invasively, the number of individuals who reported that they would decline any testing remained the same. Attention should therefore be directed at ensuring that the right of informed refusal of prenatal testing is not impacted by new, non-invasive methods.

### Non-invasive first trimester fetal gender assignment in pregnancies at risk for X-linked recessive diseases [^114yebdc]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

Prenatal diagnosis in families affected by X-linked recessive disorders should ideally be limited to the subjects at increased risk, i.e. male fetuses, in order to avoid the risk of fetal loss due to the invasive procedure in healthy female fetuses. The aim of the study was to assess the fetal sex within the first trimester of gestation by two non-invasive approaches, using ultrasonography and a molecular analysis of fetal DNA extracted from whole maternal blood with specific markers, in order to avoid invasive sampling in female fetuses.

Methods

A total number of 18 fetuses at risk for an X-linked recessive disease were included in the present investigation. Maternal peripheral blood was analysed between 7 and 12 weeks of gestation by nested PCR for the detection of fetal DNA and the prediction of fetal gender. In addition, when the biparietal diameter (BPD) was between 21 and 23 mm, an ultrasonographic examination was carried out to assess the fetal gender. CVS was then performed in male fetuses only.

Results

Fetal gender was correctly assigned by ultrasonography between 21 and 23 mm of BPD in all the cases studied, whereas DNA extracted from whole maternal blood accurately predicted the gender in all the female cases (10), but failed in 4 out of 8 male fetuses, erroneously assigned as females.

Conclusion

The present study shows that sonography is able to accurately predict the fetal gender within the first trimester of pregnancy, whereas the molecular analysis of DNA extracted from whole maternal blood is biased by false-Y-negative results in 50% of the cases.

### Fetal sex determination in twin pregnancies using non-invasive prenatal testing [^112cFBuu]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

A one-step regression was first applied to determine fetal sex as being female–female (FF), female–male (FM), or male–male (MM). In DCDA twin pregnancies, the pairs can be either monozygotic or dizygotic. For the latter, there are three possible sex combinations, i.e. FF, FM, or MM. In contrast, MCDA/MCMA is a subset of monozygotic twin pregnancies, and evidently can only be either FF or MM. This analysis was first performed in DCDA and MCDA/MCMA samples separately (Fig. 2). In MCDA/MCMA twins, the algorithm applied presents 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for FF and MM discrimination (95% CI [0.93–1] and 95% CI [0.90–1]) (Fig. 2a). However, in DCDA twins, sensitivity and specificity are diminished due to a possibility of a mixed-sex pair (FM) (90% sensitivity [95% CI [0.74–0.96]] and 94% specificity [95% CI [0.87–0.97]] for FF; 83% sensitivity [95% CI [0.70–0.91]] and 85% specificity [95% CI [0.74–0.92]] for FM; 81% sensitivity [95% CI [0.66–0.91]] and 96% specificity [95% CI [0.89–0.99]] for MM) (Fig. 2b).

### Fetal sex determination in twin pregnancies using non-invasive prenatal testing [^112SWbrX]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Despite the high accuracy of NIPT in singleton pregnancies, there are relatively few studies about its efficiency in multiple gestations. Moreover, the majority of those studies focus on the screening of the common aneuploidies, and little data is available about the precision of NIPT for fetal sex discrimination in twins. Here, we present an accurate sex prediction model to discriminate fetal sex both in DCDA and MCDA/MCMA twin pregnancies. All of the 86 MCDA/MCMA twin sexes were correctly classified, and 108 out of the 112 DCDA twin sexes were correctly classified. Hence, the overall sex classification accuracy is 98%, with an overall sensitivity and specificity of 100% when only female fetuses are present, and with 98% sensitivity and 95% specificity when a male is present.

In monochorionic twins, the two monozygotic (genetically identical) fetuses contribute the same alleles of cfDNA into the maternal circulation, and NIPT analysis can be carried out with the same accuracy as in singleton pregnancies. In dichorionic twins, the majority of pregnancies are dizygotic. Recently, Milan and colleagues investigated the accuracy of a sex prediction model based on the normalized chromosome value (NCV) of the sex chromosomes by linear regression. Without discriminating between mono- or dichorionic pregnancies, the authors reported a detection rate of 98% for fetuses sex classification with a sensitivity and specificity of 97% and 95%, respectively. Here, we show that a two-step linear regression with incorporation of fetal fraction in the model increases the performance for sex determination. We also demonstrate that knowledge of the chorionicity helps in the classification. Incorporating this information in the analysis, gives the optimal results. However, it is not always possible to obtain information about chorionicity of the twin pregnancies before NIPT analysis. Therefore, we also determined how the accuracy would be impacted when excluding this information from the analysis. When we analyzed all 198 samples together, the sensitivity and specificity were slightly lower compared with the analysis of DCDA pregnancies only.

### Population-based trends in the prenatal diagnosis of sex chromosome aneuploidy before and after non-invasive prenatal testing [^115qxKrk]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the impact of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) on trends in the prenatal diagnosis of sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA) in a population with > 73,000 annual births.

Method

Retrospective population-based cohort study from 1986–2016 of all women undergoing prenatal diagnosis before 25 weeks gestation in the Australian state of Victoria. Statistical significance was tested using the chi-square test for trend or proportions.

Results

There were 2,043,345 births and 842 SCA diagnoses from 1986–2016. The percentage of prenatal diagnostic tests leading to a SCA diagnosis increased significantly from 0.95% in 2010 to 2.93% in 2016 (p < 0.001) but due to a concurrent decline in testing, the annual prenatal diagnosis rate of SCA remained stable at 4.4/10,000 births. Among confirmed fetal SCAs the most common indication for testing in 1986 was advanced maternal age (63%); in 2016 it was high risk NIPT (49%).

Conclusion

SCAs now make up an increasing proportion of prenatal diagnostic results but due to the overall decline in diagnostic testing, the prenatal prevalence as a percentage of births remained steady. The ascertainment of fetal SCA has evolved from an incidental finding after testing for increased risk of trisomy 21, to a diagnosis obtained after suspected SCA on NIPT.

### Non-invasive prenatal measurement of the fetal genome [^113ZbG2N]. Nature (2012). Excellent credibility.

The vast majority of prenatal genetic testing requires invasive sampling. However, this poses a risk to the fetus, so one must make a decision that weighs the desire for genetic information against the risk of an adverse outcome due to hazards of the testing process. These issues are not required to be coupled, and it would be desirable to discover genetic information about the fetus without incurring a health risk. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to non-invasively sequence the entire prenatal genome. Our results show that molecular counting of parental haplotypes in maternal plasma by shotgun sequencing of maternal plasma DNA allows the inherited fetal genome to be deciphered non-invasively. We also applied the counting principle directly to each allele in the fetal exome by performing exome capture on maternal plasma DNA before shotgun sequencing. This approach enables non-invasive exome screening of clinically relevant and deleterious alleles that were paternally inherited or had arisen as de novo germline mutations, and complements the haplotype counting approach to provide a comprehensive view of the fetal genome. Non-invasive determination of the fetal genome may ultimately facilitate the diagnosis of all inherited and de novo genetic disease.

### The implications of non-invasive prenatal testing failures: a review of an under-discussed phenomenon [^1121zAEb]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using cell-free DNA in maternal blood is a relatively new screening modality for the common trisomies of chromosomes 21, 18 and 13 and sex chromosome aneuploidies. For some patients, however, results are not reported because of laboratory technical issues such as low fetal fraction and sequencing failures. In this review, the clinical implications of NIPT test failures are discussed.

Methods

A Medline search was performed for all studies on NIPT that include > 1000 samples. The failure rates were assessed by technology.

Results

Methods based on massive parallel sequencing have been found to have the lowest failure rate (1.58%), while tests based on single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis have the highest failure rate (6.39%).

Conclusions

Recent publications suggest that patients who receive a 'no call' result are at increased risk of aneuploidy. Some professional societies have therefore recommended that these patients undergo genetic counseling and be offered invasive diagnostic testing. NIPT technology that has a high failure rate may increase the false positive rates, decrease the positive predictive value, and increase the procedure-related pregnancy loss. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

### Offering non-invasive prenatal testing as part of routine clinical service. can high levels of informed choice be maintained? [^1142mWVN]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2017). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Non‐invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using cell‐free DNA in maternal blood is an advanced screening test, which has been shown to be highly accurate for Down syndrome with detection rates of over 99% and false positive rates less than 0.1% for singleton pregnancies. 1 The test can also be used to screen for trisomies 13 and 18 as well as sex chromosome aneuploidies; however, detection rates are slightly lower. 1, 2 The lower predictive value means that NIPT is not considered diagnostic and invasive testing is recommended to confirm positive NIPT results. 3, 4 Non‐invasive prenatal testing has become widely available in recent years through the private sector, 5 and a number of studies have been conducted to address implementation within a national prenatal care setting. 6, 7, 8 Clinical advantages include improved accuracy rates in comparison to combined screening, 9 reduction in the need for invasive tests that carry a small risk of miscarriage, 10 early information about risk status, and the opportunity for early reassurance for low risk women. 11 Nevertheless, a number of disadvantages have been identified such as the smaller diagnostic yield in comparison to invasive testing with array comparative genomic hybridisation and the potential for test failures or inconclusive results. 12, 13

Sex selection for non-medical reasons

A specific ethical issue related with NIPT is sex selection for non-medical reasons. Depending on how the test is carried out, the scenario with NIPT as a first screening test will lead to information about fetal sex being available at an early stage in all screened pregnancies. Commercial companies offering NIPT currently provide this information on an optional basis. There is a concern that some pregnant women and their partners may use this to have an abortion if the sex of the fetus does not match their preference.

The culturally and socially determined practice of selecting for males has led to a marked disturbance of the sex ratio in some Asian countries, with serious social effects. Although research has shown that people in Western countries do not generally have a strong preference for sons, there are reports suggesting sex-selective abortion for this reason is being practiced in certain cultural minorities.

The outcry about the sexist character of this practice has led to legislation forbidding sex selection for non-medical reasons, which in most countries is limited to the context of medically assisted reproduction. In 2011, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has called upon member states to also take legal measures to counteract sex selection in the context of legal abortion. The scope for this, however, is limited, as the freedom of abortion and the right of access to information about test results would be at stake. Whereas in Germany legislation forbids informing pregnant women about the sex of the fetus in the first 12 weeks, the Health Council of the Netherlands has argued that such measures are disproportionate. The best way to counteract improper use of information about fetal sex is to avoid its generation. As long as NIPT is not also directed at sex-chromosomal aneuploidies (see below), one could consider ways to filter out this information from the test result.

SCOPE OF NIPT-BASED PRENATAL SCREENING

It is expected that in the coming years, it will become possible to use NIPT to screen for the same range of conditions that are currently tested for using karyotyping or microarray technologies at the follow-up stage, including sex-chromosomal and submicroscopic abnormalities. Commercial providers have already begun expanding their tests with conditions in this range.

### Fetal DNA detection in maternal plasma throughout gestation [^1164VbJh]. Human Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

The presence of fetal DNA in maternal plasma may represent a source of genetic material which can be obtained noninvasively. We wanted to assess whether fetal DNA is detectable in all pregnant women, to define the range and distribution of fetal DNA concentration at different gestational ages, to identify the optimal period to obtain a maternal blood sample yielding an adequate amount of fetal DNA for prenatal diagnosis, and to evaluate accuracy and predictive values of this approach. This information is crucial to develop safe and reliable non-invasive genetic testing in early pregnancy and monitoring of pregnancy complications in late gestation. Fetal DNA quantification in maternal plasma was carried out by real-time PCR on the SRY gene in male-bearing pregnancies to distinguish between maternal and fetal DNA. A cohort of 1,837 pregnant women was investigated. Fetal DNA could be detected from the sixth week and could be retrieved at any gestational week. No false-positive results were obtained in 163 women with previous embryo loss or previous male babies. Fetal DNA analysis performed blindly on a subset of 464 women displayed 99.4, 97.8 and 100% accuracy in fetal gender determination during the first, second, and third trimester of pregnancy, respectively. No SRY amplification was obtained in seven out of the 246 (2.8%) male-bearing pregnancies. Fetal DNA from maternal plasma seems to be an adequate and reliable source of genetic material for a noninvasive prenatal diagnostic approach.
