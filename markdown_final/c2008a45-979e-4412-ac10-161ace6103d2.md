## Question

Patient on CRRT but bicarb still low. What to do

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage persistent low serum bicarbonate in a patient receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the acid–base problem and its severity. Then, I should verify the CRRT prescription and delivery to ensure the dose and buffers are adequate. Next, I will examine the buffer source and composition of dialysate/replacement fluids. After that, I need to check for ongoing acid generation and citrate accumulation. Then, I will consider adjunctive sodium bicarbonate therapy and its risks. Finally, I will outline monitoring, reassessment, and when to escalate or modify therapy, including special populations like liver failure or shock [^111Zbf77] [^114iWJzc].

> Let me first confirm the acid–base status and severity, because I need to ensure we are truly dealing with persistent metabolic acidosis and not a transient or measurement artifact. I should obtain an arterial blood gas to verify pH, PaCO2, and calculate base excess, and I should measure serum bicarbonate; in general, bicarbonate less than about 22 mmol/L indicates metabolic acidosis, and values below 18 mmol/L warrant treatment in CKD contexts, though thresholds in AKI are guided by clinical context and pH rather than bicarbonate alone [^111MEz24] [^1147SnGX]. Hold on, I should verify the anion gap and lactate as well, because ongoing lactic acidosis or unmeasured anions will perpetuate low bicarbonate despite CRRT and may require source control rather than simply increasing buffer delivery [^114zgDTg].

> Next, I should review the CRRT prescription and confirm whether the delivered dose matches the intended prescription. I need to check the effluent flow rate and ensure it is in the KDIGO-recommended range of 20–25 mL/kg/h, and I should double-check the actual delivered dose accounting for downtime, clotting, and interruptions, because underdelivery is common and directly impairs acid–base correction [^111Zbf77] [^116RBdrV]. Wait, let me verify the modality and pre/post-dilution setup too, since these factors influence clearance and buffer delivery efficiency and can subtly alter acid–base outcomes even when the prescribed effluent looks correct on paper [^116LW8cK].

> I will now examine the buffer source and composition of dialysate and replacement fluids, because using the wrong buffer can sabotage correction. Bicarbonate should be preferred over lactate in shock, liver failure, or lactic acidemia, and KDIGO explicitly recommends bicarbonate-based fluids in these settings; lactate-containing fluids can worsen acidosis if lactate metabolism is impaired, so I should switch to bicarbonate-based solutions if not already in use [^114iWJzc] [^111evcCH]. Hold on, I should verify the exact bicarbonate concentration in the bags; if the current bicarbonate content is low (for example, 22 mmol/L), I can increase the buffer load by selecting fluids with higher bicarbonate concentrations or by increasing dialysate/replacement flow rates within safe limits, while watching for alkalosis risk [^116LW8cK].

> But wait, what if the low bicarbonate is a marker of ongoing acid generation rather than inadequate CRRT buffers. I need to check for persistent lactic acidosis from sepsis, hypoperfusion, or tissue hypoxia, and I should look for other sources such as diabetic ketoacidosis, toxic alcohols, or gastrointestinal bicarbonate losses; in these scenarios, source control and hemodynamic optimization are essential because CRRT alone cannot keep pace with unchecked acid production [^notfound]. I should confirm that the patient is not accumulating citrate if regional citrate anticoagulation is used, because citrate accumulation paradoxically lowers ionized calcium and can worsen or mask acidosis; if the total-to-ionized calcium ratio exceeds about 2.3–2.5, I need to reduce or stop citrate and reassess acid–base status [^112LkXuh] [^115sC4Yo].

> Let me consider adjunctive sodium bicarbonate therapy if CRRT optimization is insufficient and the patient has clinically significant acidosis, especially with pH less than about 7.20 or AKI stage 2–3, where weak recommendations support bicarbonate use. I should use 4.2% sodium bicarbonate infusions and titrate to effect while monitoring pH, bicarbonate, sodium load, and ionized calcium, because bicarbonate can precipitate hypocalcemia and volume expansion; in the BICAR-ICU RCT, benefits were suggested in the AKI subgroup, but adverse effects like hypernatremia and metabolic alkalosis were more frequent, so I need to be cautious and goal-directed rather than reflexive [^115ZQ1ga] [^1137VtWp]. Hold on, I should verify contraindications such as hypochloremic alkalosis or chloride-wasting states before giving bicarbonate, and I must avoid overtreatment that drives bicarbonate above the normal range, which can be harmful in some contexts [^116y1Yuf] [^114a31TH].

> I need to ensure a robust monitoring and reassessment plan. I should check acid–base status frequently, at least every 6 hours initially, and after any CRRT prescription change, and I should track electrolytes including ionized calcium, magnesium, potassium, and phosphate given CRRT-related losses and citrate effects; if using citrate, I should monitor post-filter ionized calcium and the total-to-ionized calcium ratio to detect accumulation early [^115sC4Yo]. Let me reconsider the overall fluid balance and sodium load as well, because sodium bicarbonate adds sodium and can worsen edema or hypertension, so I may need to adjust ultrafiltration targets accordingly [^112PiJBH].

> If, after these steps, bicarbonate remains low, I should double-check for hidden problems: circuit clotting causing underdelivery, incorrect bag connections, or unrecognized pre/post-dilution errors; I should also verify that the anticoagulation strategy is appropriate and not contributing to downtime or premature termination of runs, and I should consider switching to a modality with higher small-solute clearance if acidosis remains refractory and the patient can tolerate it hemodynamically [^111Zbf77] [^116RBdrV]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost concluded that simply increasing effluent to 35 mL/kg/h would reliably fix this, but the RENAL and ATN programs showed no survival benefit from more intensive dosing, so dose escalation should be judicious and tailored to acid–base response rather than pursued reflexively [^116RBdrV].

> Special populations require extra caution. In acute or chronic liver failure, citrate metabolism is impaired, so I should avoid citrate or use it only with very close monitoring and a low threshold to stop if accumulation or worsening acidosis occurs; in these patients, bicarbonate-based fluids without citrate are preferred, and early CRRT may be indicated for hyperammonemia even without classic RRT triggers [^112LkXuh] [^115ZMKTq]. In septic shock with lactic acidosis, I should prioritize hemodynamic optimization and perfusion rather than relying on bicarbonate to improve hemodynamics, aligning with Surviving Sepsis guidance [^114V1MMK].

> Putting this together, my prioritized action plan is as follows: confirm true metabolic acidosis and severity with ABG and electrolytes; verify CRRT is actually delivering 20–25 mL/kg/h and switch to bicarbonate-based fluids if not already used; address ongoing acid generation and citrate accumulation; add goal-directed IV sodium bicarbonate only if acidosis is clinically significant and refractory, with close monitoring for sodium and calcium effects; and reassess frequently to titrate therapy and avoid overshoot alkalosis, escalating modality or addressing circuit issues if low bicarbonate persists despite these measures [^111Zbf77] [^114iWJzc] [^115ZQ1ga] [^114a31TH].

---

Persistent low bicarbonate on CRRT is most often due to **inadequate CRRT dose** (target 20–25 mL/kg/h) [^111Zbf77], **low dialysate/replacement bicarbonate** (use 32–35 mmol/L), or **ongoing acid generation** (e.g. lactic acidosis, sepsis, GI losses) [^notfound]. Confirm the delivered dose, increase dialysate/replacement bicarbonate to 32–35 mmol/L, and address the acid source; if still low, add **IV bicarbonate** (50–100 mEq bolus, then 50–100 mEq/h infusion) with close monitoring of pH, bicarbonate, sodium, and calcium [^115ZQ1ga]. Avoid overcorrection (keep bicarbonate ≤ 28 mmol/L) to prevent alkalemia, sodium overload, and hypocalcemia [^1137VtWp].

## Common causes of persistent low bicarbonate in CRRT

Persistent low bicarbonate during CRRT can result from **inadequate CRRT dose**, **low dialysate/replacement bicarbonate**, or **ongoing acid generation**.

---

### Inadequate CRRT dose

Inadequate CRRT dose is a common cause of persistent low bicarbonate. The **recommended effluent dose** is 20–25 mL/kg/h [^111Zbf77]; under-delivery due to clotting, machine alarms, or prescription errors can leave acidosis uncorrected. The **prescription gap** — prescribing a higher dose than is actually delivered — is common and requires frequent reassessment of delivered dose [^116RBdrV].

---

### Low dialysate or replacement fluid bicarbonate concentration

Low dialysate or replacement fluid bicarbonate concentration can also contribute to persistent low bicarbonate. The **standard bicarbonate concentration** in dialysate/replacement fluids is typically 22–28 mmol/L; using lower concentrations (e.g. 20–22 mmol/L) may be insufficient in severe acidosis. The **buffer selection** should favor bicarbonate over lactate, especially in liver failure or lactic acidosis [^114iWJzc].

---

### Ongoing acid generation

Ongoing acid generation may outpace CRRT correction. Lactic acidosis from sepsis, shock, or tissue hypoperfusion can generate acid faster than CRRT removes it [^1138mM8w]. Gastrointestinal bicarbonate losses from diarrhea, fistulas, or nasogastric suction also perpetuate acidosis [^116y1Yuf].

---

## Clinical assessment and monitoring

To identify the cause and guide therapy, perform a **focused assessment**:

- **Confirm acidosis**: Measure arterial blood gas (ABG) to assess pH, bicarbonate, and PaCO2 [^115sC4Yo].
- **Evaluate CRRT delivery**: Check actual delivered effluent volume and address any interruptions or clotting [^111Zbf77].
- **Assess ongoing acid production**: Measure lactate, review clinical context (sepsis, shock, GI losses) [^notfound].
- **Monitor electrolytes**: Track sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride to guide corrections and avoid complications [^1133zEgF].

---

## Management strategies

Based on the identified cause, implement **targeted interventions**:

---

### Increase CRRT dose

Increase the **effluent dose** to 20–25 mL/kg/h if below target, and promptly address circuit clotting, alarms, or access issues to ensure consistent delivery [^111Zbf77].

---

### Increase dialysate or replacement fluid bicarbonate concentration

Use **higher bicarbonate** dialysate/replacement fluids (32–35 mmol/L) when acidosis is severe or refractory, and prefer bicarbonate over lactate in patients with liver dysfunction or lactic acidosis [^114iWJzc].

---

### Address ongoing acid generation

Treat **sepsis/shock** with source control, hemodynamic optimization, and supportive care to reduce lactic acidosis [^notfound]. Correct **GI losses** by managing diarrhea, fistulas, or nasogastric suction and replacing bicarbonate as needed.

---

### Adjunctive sodium bicarbonate therapy

- **Indication**: Consider IV sodium bicarbonate if bicarbonate remains < 22 mmol/L despite optimized CRRT and correction of underlying causes.
- **Dosing**: Typical regimen is 50–100 mEq IV bolus, followed by 50–100 mEq/h infusion, titrated to maintain bicarbonate 22–28 mmol/L.
- **Monitoring**: Closely monitor pH, bicarbonate, sodium load, and ionized calcium to avoid alkalemia, hypernatremia, and hypocalcemia [^1137VtWp].

---

## Potential risks and complications of bicarbonate supplementation

While bicarbonate therapy can correct acidosis, it carries **risks**:

- **Metabolic alkalosis**: Overcorrection can cause alkalemia, impairing oxygen delivery and causing arrhythmias.
- **Sodium overload**: Hypernatremia and fluid overload, especially in heart failure or renal failure [^1137VtWp].
- **Hypocalcemia**: Alkalosis increases calcium binding, potentially causing neuromuscular irritability or cardiac effects [^1137VtWp].
- **Paradoxical intracellular acidosis**: Rapid bicarbonate administration may worsen intracellular acidosis in certain contexts.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **KDIGO**: Use bicarbonate-based buffers in CRRT, especially in liver failure or lactic acidosis [^114iWJzc].
- **Surviving Sepsis**: For severe metabolic acidemia (pH ≤ 7.2) with AKI, consider bicarbonate therapy; avoid routine use in lactic acidosis without severe acidemia [^114V1MMK].
- **KDOQI**: Maintain serum bicarbonate 24–26 mmol/L in CKD; avoid overcorrection [^112DZA78] [^114a31TH].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Increase CRRT dose | 20–25 mL/kg/h [^111Zbf77] |
| Increase dialysate bicarbonate | 32–35 mmol/L |
| Address underlying causes | Sepsis, GI losses [^notfound] |
| Adjunctive bicarbonate | 50–100 mEq bolus, then 50–100 mEq/h [^notfound] |
| Monitor for complications | Alkalemia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia [^1137VtWp] |

---

Persistent low bicarbonate on CRRT usually reflects **inadequate dose**, **low buffer concentration**, or **ongoing acid generation**. Confirm delivery, increase bicarbonate to 32–35 mmol/L, treat the cause, and add IV bicarbonate if needed, while monitoring for complications.

Level 1 recommendations endorsed — anticoagulation practices, catheter placement, and buffer selection — The KDOQI Work Group agreed with the 10 level 1 recommendations, including using anticoagulation for RRT recipients not at increased bleeding risk, using heparin for anticoagulation during intermittent hemodialysis, using ultrasound for dialysis catheter insertion with chest radiography to confirm line placement, and appropriate dosing of both intermittent and continuous RRTs. For patients with shock, the group noted the level 1 recommendation to use bicarbonate-containing dialysate and replacement fluid; bicarbonate has replaced lactate and acetate as the buffer of choice for intermittent RRT, evidence of benefit over lactate-based CRRT solutions is inconsistent, and increased availability of commercially prepared bicarbonate-based CRRT fluids in the United States supports their use as the buffer of choice.

KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury (AKI) — KDOQI US commentary conclusion states that the work group "recognizes the need for a consensus definition of AKI and commends KDIGO for harmonizing the prior definitions and staging criteria", but "do not believe that it is sufficiently validated for use in the diagnosis and clinical management of patients with AKI", and that management "should be based on assessment of overall clinical status, including specific cause of AKI, trends in kidney function over time, comorbid conditions, assessment of volume status, and concomitant acid-base and electrolyte disturbances". For prevention and nondialytic management, they "generally agreed" yet "note the paucity of high-level evidence and the absence of highly effective therapies", and "can support the use of protocol-based management of perioperative patients and patients with sepsis" while stating such protocols "need to be further developed and validated" and that they "do not believe that there are sufficient data to benchmark care". Regarding renal replacement therapy (RRT), "we are in general agreement with the KDIGO recommendations", but "Given the lack of FDA-approved citrate solutions for regional anticoagulation during CRRT, we do not believe that this approach can be currently recommended; however, we believe that this will need to be reconsidered if appropriate citrate solutions become available". They also note that KDIGO provides "little discussion of the modalities of PIRRT" and "believe that these modalities are a reasonable alternative to CRRT in hemodynamically unstable patients".

### Sodium chloride, sodium citrate (Regiocit) [^114cqZj9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

For Extracorporeal use only. Not for direct intravenous infusion. REGIOCIT solution is used as a renal replacement solution. The product has an

osmolarity of 244 mOsm/L and a pH of approximately 7.4.

Dosing Considerations

Dosing considerations of the drug:

REGIOCIT solution should not be used for direct intravenous infusion. The product must be used in pre-dilution mode only, with appropriate extracorporeal renal replacement equipment intended for CRRT, using an integrated pre-blood pump for RCA.
In addition to providing anticoagulation to the extracorporeal circuit and hemofilters, citrate also acts as a buffer source due to its metabolic conversion to bicarbonate systemically. Thus, the infusion rate of REGIOCIT solution to be administered should take into account the rate at which buffer administration occurs from other sources, e.g., dialysate and/or replacement fluid. The product must be used together with a dialysis/replacement solution at an appropriate bicarbonate concentration.
Dose reduction may be needed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In these patients, more frequent monitoring of citrate accumulation is advised. REGIOCIT solution should not be administered to patients with reduced liver and muscle perfusion, e.g., during conditions such as septic shock and lactic acidosis, or in patients with severe hepatic impairment, due to limited citrate metabolism (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
A separate systemic infusion of calcium is always required to prevent or treat hypocalcemia. Adjust calcium infusion depending on measured serum total-to-ionized calcium ratio and ionized calcium levels, to maintain values in the physiologic range. Adjust or stop calcium infusion according to the direction of the attending physician when REGIOCIT solution has been stopped.
Magnesium may need to be supplemented intravenously, based on systemic serum magnesium levels.

### Sodium chloride, sodium citrate (Regiocit) [^116ASomL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Administration Instructions

Renal Replacement Solution: Not for direct intravenous infusion.

The recommended effluent volume for patients receiving CRRT for acute kidney injury (AKI) is 20 to 25 mL/kg/h. This usually requires a higher prescription of effluent volume. The prescription of REGIOCIT solution must consider the flow rates of the effluent and other therapeutic fluids, the patient's fluid removal requirements, additional fluid inputs and outputs, and the desired acid-base and electrolyte balance.

The mode of therapy, solute formulations, flow rates and length of therapy should be selected by the physician responsible for managing treatment depending on the clinical condition of the patient as well as the patient's fluid, electrolyte, acid base and glucose balance.

Dialysate and replacement fluid formulations and flow rates are prescribed in accordance with the patient's clinical needs. The use of a calcium-containing dialysate or replacement fluid is not recommended, since the calcium provided by these solutions may counteract the anticoagulant effect of citrate in the circuit.

1.2 Suggested Dosing

The rate at which REGIOCIT solution is administered depends on the targeted citrate dose and the prescribed blood flow rate. The pre-filter infusion rate of REGIOCIT solution is indexed to the blood flow rate to achieve a target blood citrate concentration of 3 mmol/L of blood (See Table 1). Flow rate for anticoagulation of the extracorporeal circuit should be titrated to achieve a post-filter concentration of ionized calcium in the range of 0.25 to 0.35 mmol/L.

Table 1: REGIOCIT Solution Flow Rates to Achieve Citrate Dose of 3 mmol/L of Blood

Prior to initiating therapy, the patient's systemic ionized calcium concentration should be within the normal physiologic range (1.0 to 1.2 mmol/L) by adjustment of calcium supplementation. A separate infusion of calcium is always required during use of REGIOCIT, due to loss in the effluent. Calcium solution infusion is commenced at the rate of 4 mmol/h, when commencing therapy (see Table 4). Adjust or stop calcium infusion according to physician's prescription when REGIOCIT is stopped.

Citrate also acts as a buffer source (due to conversion to bicarbonate); the infusion rate of REGIOCIT solution must be considered in relation to the rate at which buffer administration occurs from other sources (e.g., dialysate and/or replacement fluid). REGIOCIT solution must be used together with a dialysis solution/replacement solution with appropriate bicarbonate concentration.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

As with the use of other replacement solutions, blood concentrations of dialyzable drugs may be reduced by CRRT due to their removal by the hemofilter or hemodiafilter. The blood concentrations of certain drugs may need to be monitored and appropriate therapy implemented to correct for removal during treatment.

7.1 Citrate

When used as an anticoagulant, citrate contributes to the overall buffer load and can reduce plasma calcium levels. Select the PRISMASOL/PHOXILLUM formulation(s) accordingly.

A.S.P.E.N. clinical guidelines — electrolyte management in renal failure recommend that electrolyte intake in patients should be adjusted by monitoring serum concentrations of potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P), and calcium (Ca) (Grade: D). In trauma patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) receiving parenteral nutrition (PN) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), profound losses of calcium and magnesium in the dialysate effluent were reported, and to maintain calcium and magnesium balance the patients need continuous infusion of calcium and magnesium during the dialysis; the incidence of hypokalemia was significantly lower in CRRT than with intermittent hemodialysis (HD). Selenium, copper, and thiamine balances were all negative in 11 patients with AKI receiving CRRT, raising the potential for deficiency states to develop over time.

### Chronic kidney disease CKD: guideline recommendations and supporting information (2020) [^116MbEx2]. AND (2020). High credibility.

CKD: Electrolytes: Calcium — In adults with CKD 5D, it is reasonable to adjust calcium intake (dietary calcium, calcium supplements or calcium-based binders) with consideration of concurrent use of vitamin D analogs and calcimimetic agents in order to avoid hypercalcemia or calcium overload (OPINION) (Rating: Consensus). There are no obvious risks or harms associated with this recommendation. According to estimates and assumptions made, extracellular fluid calcium increased with an elemental daily calcium intake > 1.5 g and was numerically more positive when patients are given active vitamin D analogs. Hypercalcemia is relatively common in patients on maintenance dialysis, and in the event of hypercalcemia the following adjustments are recommended: in patients taking calcium-based phosphate binders the dose should be reduced or therapy switched to a non-calcium phosphate binding; in patients taking active vitamin D analogs the dose should be reduced or therapy discontinued until serum concentration of calcium return to normal; if hypercalcemia persists, consider using low dialysate calcium (1.5 to 2.0 mEq/L). In KDIGO (CKD-MBD) 2009 and 2017 there is no recommendation regarding calcium intake for patients on maintenance dialysis or with kidney transplantation.

### Timing of initiation of renal-replacement therapy in acute kidney injury [^112rEipH]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

The study STARRT-AKI was published by STARRT-AKI Investigators and colleagues in 2020 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute kidney injury. In the STARRT-AKI study, the trial question was: what is the role of accelerated initiation of RRT in critically ill patients with AKI? In the STARRT-AKI study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the STARRT-AKI study, the population was: 2927 patients (937 female, 1990 male). The inclusion criteria were critically ill patients with severe AKI. The key exclusion criteria were potassium > 5.5 mmol/L; bicarbonate < 15 mmol/L; any RRT in preceding 2 months; kidney transplant within the past year; advanced CKD; kidney obstruction, glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, microangiopathy, or acute interstitial nephritis. In the STARRT-AKI study, the interventions were: n = 1465 an accelerated strategy (initiation of RRT within 12 hours of meeting full eligibility criteria) n = 1462 a standard strategy (initiation of RRT discouraged until development of conventional indications or persistent AKI for ≥ 72 hours). In the STARRT-AKI study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death from any cause at 90 days (43.9% vs. 43.7%; RR 1, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09). In the STARRT-AKI study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in renal replacement dependence among survivors at 90 days (10.4% vs. 6%; RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.43) No significant difference in death or renal replacement dependence at 90 days (50% vs. 47.3%; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.14) No significant difference in major adverse kidney events (76.7% vs. 77.1%; RR 0.99, 99% CI 0.95 to 1.04).

Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment

The rate at which REGIOCIT solution is administered depends on the targeted citrate dose and the prescribed blood flow rate (BFR). The prescription of the product must consider the flow rates of the effluent and other therapeutic fluids, the patient's fluid removal requirements, additional fluid inputs and outputs, and the desired acid-base and electrolyte balance.

REGIOCIT solution should be prescribed and its administration (dose, infusion rate, and cumulative volume) established only by critical care or nephrology physicians experienced in administration of CRRT.

The pre-filter infusion rate of REGIOCIT solution (based on its concentration) is indexed to the blood flow rate to achieve a target blood citrate concentration of 3 to 4 mmol/L in the blood. Flow rate for anticoagulation of the extracorporeal circuit should be titrated to achieve a post-filter concentration of ionized calcium in the range 0.25 to 0.35 mmol/L. The patient's systemic ionized calcium concentration should be maintained in the normal physiologic range by adjustment of calcium supplementation.

Administration

Monitoring of the post-filter blood ionized calcium (iCa), systemic blood iCa, and total blood calcium levels in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical parameters is essential to guide appropriate REGIOCIT solution dosage based on the desired level of anticoagulation (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS). Plasma levels of sodium, magnesium, potassium, and phosphate should also be monitored regularly and these electrolytes supplemented as needed.

REGIOCIT solution may be warmed to 37°C to enhance patient comfort. Warming of the product prior to use should be done with dry heat only. Solution should not be heated in water or in a microwave oven due to the potential for patient injury or discomfort.

REGIOCIT solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless the solution is clear and the seal is intact.

What are the important possible side effects for REGIOCIT? Possible side effects of REGIOCIT include:

Low levels of calcium in your blood
Low levels of magnesium, potassium, or phosphate in your blood, or changes in the glucose level in your blood
Too much acid or base in your blood (acid-base status)

What other treatment choices are there? Your healthcare provider may use a different replacement solution for CRRT or a type of "dialysis" that does not require a replacement solution.

How do I report side effects with REGIOCIT?

Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any side effects that bother you or do not go away. Report side effects to FDA MedWatch at www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1–800-FDA-1088 or contact Baxter Healthcare Corporation at 1–866–888–2472 or global_pharmacovigilance_deerfield@baxter.com.

What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?

The United States FDA has made REGIOCIT available under an emergency access mechanism called an EUA. The EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Service (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic.

REGIOCIT has not undergone the same type of review as an FDA-approved or cleared product. FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, available alternatives. In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of scientific evidence available showing that it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective in treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. All of these criteria must be met to allow for the product to be used in the treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks for such use.

The EUA for REGIOCIT is in effect for the duration of the COVID-19 declaration justifying emergency use of these products, unless terminated or revoked (after which the products may no longer be used).

KDOQI US commentary — anticoagulation for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in acute kidney injury (AKI) notes that, in the United States, given the lack of FDA-approved citrate solutions for regional anticoagulation during CRRT, this approach cannot be recommended at present, and there is also a need for development and approval of commercially available citrate solutions before this approach can be routinely recommended. For alternative anticoagulation strategies, danaparoid, fondaparinux, and hirudin are all renally excreted with extended half-lives in AKI and have no specific antidote, therefore these agents must be used with caution in patients with AKI on CRRT, danaparoid is not available in the United States, and argatroban has been used at doses ranging between 0.7 and 1.7 μg/kg/min as anticoagulation for CRRT.

KDIGO AKI anticoagulation during RRT — general decision and standard-risk patients: In a patient with acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), base the decision to use anticoagulation on assessment of the patient's potential risks and benefits (Not Graded). We recommend using anticoagulation during RRT in AKI if a patient does not have an increased bleeding risk or severe coagulopathy and is not already receiving systemic anticoagulation (1B). For patients without an increased bleeding risk or impaired coagulation and not already receiving effective systemic anticoagulation, we suggest the following: for intermittent RRT, we recommend using either unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin, rather than other anticoagulants (1C); for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), we suggest using regional citrate anticoagulation rather than heparin in patients who do not have contraindications for citrate (2B); if citrate is contraindicated during CRRT, we suggest using either unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin, rather than other anticoagulants (2C).

Implementation considerations for hypercalcemia in maintenance dialysis — hypercalcemia is relatively common, and in the event of hypercalcemia the following adjustments are recommended: in patients taking calcium-based phosphate binders, the dose should be reduced or therapy switched to a non-calcium phosphate binder; in patients taking active vitamin D analogues, the dose should be reduced or therapy discontinued until serum concentrations of calcium return to normal; if hypercalcemia persists, consider using a low dialysate calcium concentration (1.5–2.0 mg/L), with caution because observational studies have linked this approach with increased risk for arrhythmia and heart failure.

The study BICAR-ICU was published by Samir Jaber and colleagues in 2018 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Metabolic acidosis. In the BICAR-ICU study, the trial question was: what is the role of sodium bicarbonate therapy among ICU patients with severe metabolic acidemia? In the BICAR-ICU study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the BICAR-ICU study, the population was: 389 patients (151 female, 238 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients admitted to the ICU within 48 hours experiencing severe acidemia and a total SOFA score ≥ 4 or an arterial lactate concentration ≥ 2 mmol/L. The key exclusion criteria were respiratory acidosis, proven digestive or urinary tract loss of sodium bicarbonate, stage IV CKD, ketoacidosis, and sodium bicarbonate infusion within 24 h before the screening. In the BICAR-ICU study, the interventions were: n = 195 bicarbonate (4.2% of intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion) n = 194 control (no sodium bicarbonate). In the BICAR-ICU study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death from any cause by day 28 and the presence of at least one organ failure at day 7 (66% vs. 71%; ARD -5.5, 95% CI -15.2 to 4.2).

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^114H2szL]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Residual kidney function (RKF) in hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) — background and rationale: When HD therapy is first initiated, most patients have small and significant (but inadequate) levels of RKF, and many have normal or even high rates of urine output, and this level of RKF may persist for many months and years, adding continuous solute clearance and other kidney functions to the intermittent clearances provided by dialysis treatments. Earlier studies showed that RKF decreased more rapidly in patients initially treated with HD compared with continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD), but recent studies showed that RKF is preserved better in HD patients than in the past, possibly because of the use of more biocompatible membranes, discontinuation of acetate as a bicarbonate precursor, high-flux dialysis, and the earlier initiation of dialysis therapy, especially in patients with diabetes; more recent studies suggest that with the use of ultrapure water to dilute concentrated dialysate, RKF decreases at a rate indistinguishable from that in CAPD patients. More recent data show that RKF in HD patients affords many of the same benefits, including a lower dialysis dose requirement and improved patient survival, and the reduced need for dietary potassium and fluid restriction and reduced requirement for fluid removal during HD can enhance quality of life (QOL) and reduce the frequency of hospitalizations. In HD patients, the continuous nature of RKF contrasts with the intermittent schedule of dialysis, whereas for PD patients, both are nearly continuous, and evidence that includes mathematical analysis of solute kinetics and comparison of outcomes in PD versus HD patients suggests that continuous clearance is more efficient than intermittent clearance; such arguments have been used, for example, to explain the much lower weekly dialysis clearance requirement in PD compared with HD patients despite nearly equal outcomes, especially in the first year of treatment, and if this difference in efficiency is accepted, the contribution of RKF to overall kidney plus dialyzer function is greater than the simple addition of time-averaged clearances would suggest. This difference is especially striking because the number of long-term HD patients in the United States is more than 10 times as large as the number receiving PD.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) supportive care — Rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency; however, in patients with TLS at risk for end-organ injury with unknown G6PD status, the benefit of rasburicase may outweigh the risk. Rasburicase is given as a single dose of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg; the maximum dose is 6 mg and it should be repeated only if necessary based on laboratory values, and if used, blood samples for uric acid must be placed on ice to avoid spuriously low levels. Hyperkalemia management per Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) removes exogenous potassium sources, with frequent potassium checks (every 4–6 hours), continuous cardiac monitoring, and oral sodium polystyrene sulfonate recommended; glucose plus insulin or beta agonists can be temporizing measures, and calcium gluconate may be used to reduce dysrhythmia risk while awaiting hemodialysis and/or hemofiltration, which most effectively remove potassium. Hyperphosphatemia is managed with a phosphorus-restricted diet and consideration of phosphate binder such as sevelamer; do not use calcium carbonate in patients at risk for TLS, especially if the calcium phosphate product is > 60 mg²/dL². For hypocalcemia, correct hyperphosphatemia and avoid calcium supplementation unless symptomatic with tetany, muscle spasm, or Trousseau/Chvostek signs. Consider hemodialysis/continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) for worsening renal function when electrolyte abnormalities do not correct with medical management. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Hypomagnesemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no magnesium. Use of the REGIOCIT solution may result in hypomagnesemia due to CRRT effluent losses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Administration).

Hypoglycemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no dextrose. Administration of REGIOCIT solution may lead to hypoglycemia. Blood glucose levels should be monitored regularly.

Hypokalemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no potassium. The serum potassium concentration must be monitored before and during CRRT.

Metabolic Alkalosis

REGIOCIT solution contains citrate, which contributes to the overall buffer load. Additional sodium bicarbonate (or buffer source) contained in the CRRT fluids or in other fluids administered during therapy may increase the risk of metabolic alkalosis. Metabolic alkalosis may occur if the net citrate administration rate exceeds that which is necessary to maintain acid–base balance.

If metabolic alkalosis occurs, decrease the citrate dose, and/or increase the dialysate flow rate or change the composition of the CRRT solution.

Blood calcium levels, pH and bicarbonate should be monitored regularly in patients with metabolic alkalosis since this condition may potentiate hypocalcemia.

### Sodium chloride, sodium citrate (Regiocit) [^113fhywy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

2.1 Hypocalcemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no calcium, and may lead to systemic ionized hypocalcemia due to loss of calcium bound to citrate in the effluent and/or in the case of systemic citrate accumulation. Calcium

reinfusion is required during use of REGIOCIT and blood calcium concentrations (ionized and total) must be monitored.

2.3 Hypomagnesemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no magnesium. Use of the REGIOCIT solution may result in hypomagnesemia due to CRRT effluent losses. Magnesium levels must be monitored as infusion of magnesium may be necessary.

2.4 Hypoglycemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no dextrose. Administration of REGIOCIT solution may lead to hypoglycemia. Blood glucose levels must be monitored regularly.

2.5 Hypokalemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no potassium. The serum potassium concentration must be monitored before and during CRRT.

2.6 Metabolic Alkalosis

REGIOCIT solution contains citrate, which contributes to the overall buffer load. Metabolization of 1 mol of citrate generates 3 mol of bicarbonate. Additional sodium bicarbonate (or buffer source) contained in the CRRT fluids or in other fluids administered during therapy may increase the risk of metabolic alkalosis. Metabolic alkalosis may occur if the net citrate administration rate exceeds that which is necessary to maintain acid–base balance. If metabolic alkalosis occurs, decrease the citrate dose, and/or increase the dialysate/replacement flow rate (when applicable) or change the composition of the CRRT solution.

2.7 Metabolic Acidosis

Metabolic acidosis may occur if metabolic clearance of citrate by the liver or skeletal muscle is impaired. If citrate accumulation develops and/or metabolic acidosis develops or worsens during therapy with REGIOCIT solution, the infusion rate may need to be decreased or its administration stopped.

2.8 Use in Patients with Mild to Moderate Hepatic Impairment

Metabolism of citrate (to bicarbonate) may be impaired in patients with hepatic impairment, resulting in accumulation of citrate. If REGIOCIT solution is administered to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, frequent monitoring of pH, electrolytes, total-to-ionized calcium ratio, and systemic ionized calcium is important to avoid electrolyte and/or acid–base imbalance.

2.9 Hypoosmolarity/Hypotonicity

REGIOCIT solution is hypoosmolar/hypotonic relative to standard CRRT replacement fluids and should be used with caution in patients with traumatic brain injury, cerebral edema, or increased intracranial pressure.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^1147SnGX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Metabolic acidosis in CKD — practice points, treatment thresholds, and dietary guidance are as follows: Practice Point 3.10.1 states to consider use of pharmacological treatment with or without dietary intervention to prevent development of acidosis with potential clinical implications (e.g., bicarbonate < 18 mmol/l in adults). Practice Point 3.10.2 advises monitoring to ensure therapy does not result in serum bicarbonate concentrations exceeding the upper limit of normal and does not adversely affect BP control, serum potassium, or fluid status. The KDOQI Work Group agrees that acidosis in adults should only be treated with pharmacologic agents when bicarbonate < 18 mmol/l or if there is a clear indication to do so, and notes a large clinical trial of veverimer did not demonstrate a decline in a composite CKD progression outcome. Pediatric clinicians may choose to treat milder acidosis more aggressively to help optimize growth and bone health. Nutrition guidance supports prevention and treatment via increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetables, including the statement: In adults with CKD 1–4, we suggest reducing net endogenous acid production through increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetables (2C) to reduce the rate of decline of residual kidney function.

### Sodium chloride, sodium citrate (Regiocit) [^113az7NJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In an open-label randomised study, 54 patients were administered RCA with an equimolar solution of citrate, sodium and chloride, as contained in REGIOCIT solution, and 49 received systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH) while undergoing CRRT using continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. Adverse events related to metabolic disorders occurred in 26% of patients in the RCA-treated group, compared to 28% of patients in the UFH-treated group. These adverse events were generally transient and reversible. Metabolic alkalosis was seen in 6% of patients treated with RCA, compared to none treated with UFH, and metabolic acidosis was reported in 6% and 2% of patients in the RCA and UFH groups, respectively. Six patients treated with RCA experienced severe hypocalcemia, compared to one patient treated with UFH.

In a second hemodiafiltration trial which evaluated 19 patients randomised to an equimolar solution of citrate, sodium and chloride, as contained in REGIOCIT solution, and 11 patients randomised to UFH anticoagulation, Hypocalcemia requiring intervention was reported in 3 patients treated with RCA, with 2 of these patients requiring treatment interruption of RCA.

Post-Market Adverse Reactions

To date, adverse events reported in the post-marketing setting for REGIOCIT appear to be consistent with those listed above in Adverse Reaction Overview.

DRUG INTERACTIONS

Overview

The blood concentration of filterable/dialyzable drugs may be reduced during treatment due to their removal by the extracorporeal filter. Corresponding corrective therapy should be instituted if necessary to establish the desired blood concentrations for drugs removed during treatment. Patient monitoring at an appropriate frequency is required.

When prescribing REGIOCIT, the physician needs to consider the use of other anticoagulants along with other buffer-containing and electrolyte solutions (including CRRT replacement fluid and dialysate).

Drug-Drug Interactions

The drugs listed in this table are based on either drug interaction case studies or clinical trials, or potential interactions due to the expected magnitude and seriousness of the interaction (i.e., those identified as contraindicated).

1.3 Laboratory Monitoring

Monitoring of the post-filter blood ionized calcium (iCa), systemic blood iCa, and total blood calcium levels in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical parameters such as acid-base balance and serum electrolytes are essential to guide appropriate REGIOCIT solution dosage based on the desired level of anticoagulation. Levels should be taken at baseline, 1 hour after initiation (or adjustment), and every 6 hours (See Table 2). Rapidly decreasing systemic ionized calcium levels are an early indicator of citrate accumulation.

Measurement of total calcium and assessment of total-to-ionized calcium ratio is necessary. Citrate accumulation causes systemic ionized calcium levels to drop and the ratio of total-to-ionized calcium increases (total-to-ionized calcium ratio > 2.5). In the presence of impaired citrate metabolism, a progressively higher calcium infusion rate is required to maintain the systemic ionized calcium concentration within the intended target. When a total-to-ionized-calcium ratio > 2.5 is recorded, any one of the following abnormalities reported concurrently increases the likelihood of citrate accumulation:

A rapid decline in systemic iCa concentration despite adequate calcium compensation
A rapid decrease in pH or a decrease in base excess
A rapid increase in anion gap

In order to avoid metabolic alkalosis, acid-base balance and systemic ionized calcium can be measured using blood gas analysis. If metabolic alkalosis or citrate accumulation is suspected, decrease the citrate dose while tolerating a post-filter ionized calcium of < 0.5 mmol/L. This can be achieved by either decreasing the blood flow rate to decrease the overall citrate load, increasing the dialysate/replacement flow rate (when applicable) to increase the citrate removal, or decreasing the citrate flow to decrease the citrate dose. Dialysate solutions contain bicarbonate below or above physiological range of 22 to 26 mmol/L, and increasing or decreasing the flow rates of the dialysate solutions can impact the acid-base status of the patient.

In sepsis, "continuous or extended infusions with loading doses, as opposed to intermittent dosing, may lead to improved outcomes in patients treated with beta-lactam antibiotics", and for vancomycin "continuous vancomycin infusions may be considered to achieve optimal concentrations in some patients". Drug-level guidance includes that "within 60 minutes before or after administration of aminoglycosides" measuring concentrations "to estimate the Cmin and Cmax… together with the MIC… can help to guide appropriate antimicrobial dosing". Dose optimization for concentration-dependent with time-dependent agents "involves adjusting the dosing interval rather than administered dose". The text highlights altered clearance with extracorporeal supports — "CRRT and ECMO both lead to profound alteration of antimicrobial clearance" — and that "Therapeutic drug monitoring, where available, can permit individualized antimicrobial dosing to achieve maximal effect while minimizing toxicity".

### Sodium chloride, sodium citrate (Regiocit) [^117W6tjo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

REGIOCIT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or in circulatory shock with muscle hypoperfusion (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Excessive infusion of citrate can lead to acute hypocalcemia and metabolic alkalosis, with neurologic and cardiac complications. Treatment consists of discontinuation of the citrate infusion and infusion of calcium.

Endocrine and Metabolism

Hypocalcemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no calcium, and may lead to systemic ionized hypocalcemia, due to loss of calcium bound to citrate in the effluent and/or in the case of systemic citrate accumulation (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Administration).

Electrolyte and Acid–Base Balance

REGIOCIT solution contains citrate, which can influence the patient's electrolyte and acid–base balance. Plasma electrolyte and acid–base parameters should be closely monitored during CRRT. Closely monitor sodium, magnesium, potassium, phosphate, and calcium. Infusion of electrolytes may be needed to supplement any loss.

Hypercalcemia

Medicinal products containing calcium used for maintenance of calcium homeostasis in CRRT patients can increase the risk of hypercalcemia, and can result in a reduced anticoagulation effect. Care should be taken to avoid excessive titration in administering calcium as this can lead to hypercalcemia. Frequent monitoring of pH, electrolytes, total-to-ionized calcium ratio, and systemic ionized calcium is important to avoid electrolyte and/or acid-base imbalance.

### Sodium chloride, sodium citrate (Regiocit) [^115FPWnY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

If citrate accumulation develops and/or metabolic acidosis develops or worsens during therapy with REGIOCIT, the infusion rate may need to be decreased or its administration stopped.

Hypo-osmolarity/Hypotonicity

REGIOCIT solution is hypo-osmolar/hypotonic relative to standard CRRT replacement fluids and should be used with caution in patients with traumatic brain injury, cerebral edema, or increased intracranial pressure.

Instructions for use of REGIOCIT must be strictly followed. Incorrect use of the access ports or other restrictions to fluid flow may lead to incorrect patient weight loss and may result in machine alarms being set off. Continuing treatment without resolving the originating cause may lead to patient injury or death.

Careful ongoing assessment is required of all solutions infused during REGIOCIT administration, whether related to CRRT dialysis fluids or to other solutions infused systemically.

REGIOCIT has a physiological sodium level of 140 mmol/L. However, sodium losses occurring during CRRT must be balanced as part of overall fluid and electrolyte management to avoid a drop in blood sodium level leading to systemic hyponatremia.

Hematologic

Hemodynamic Status and Fluid Balance

The patient's hematocrit, hemodynamic status and fluid balance should be monitored throughout the procedure.

- In case of hypervolemia, the net ultrafiltration rate prescribed for the CRRT device can be increased, and/or the rate of administration of solutions other than replacement fluid and/or dialysate can be reduced.
- In case of hypovolemia, the net ultrafiltration rate prescribed for the CRRT device can be reduced, and/or the rate of administration of solutions other than replacement fluid and/or dialysate can be increased.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) dosing and monitoring — For patients receiving CRRT at conventional, KDIGO-recommended effluent rates of 20 to 25 mL/kg/h, loading doses of 20 to 25 mg/kg by actual body weight should be used (B-III), and initial maintenance dosing for CRRT with effluent rates of 20 to 25 mL/kg/h should be 7.5 to 10 mg/kg every 12 hours (B-II). Maintenance dose and dosing interval should be based on serum concentration monitoring, which should be conducted within the first 24 hours to ensure AUC/MIC targets are met; in fluid overloaded patients, doses may be reduced as patients become euvolemic and Vd decreases, and the use of CI of vancomycin in patients receiving CRRT could be used in place of intermittent dosing especially when high CRRT ultrafiltrate/dialysate flow rates are employed (B-II).

2.1 Administration Instructions

Visually inspect PRISMASOL and PHOXILLUM for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.

Administration should only be under the direction of a physician competent in intensive care treatment including CRRT. Use only with extracorporeal dialysis equipment appropriate for CRRT.

The prepared solution is for single patient use only.

Aseptic technique should be used throughout administration to the patient.

Discard any unused solution.

2.2 Dosing Considerations

PRISMASOL replacement solutions contain 4 different combinations of active ingredients (7 different products with varying ingredient amounts). PHOXILLUM replacement solutions contain 2 different combinations of active ingredients (2 different products with varying ingredient amounts). PRISMASOL and PHOXILLUM are supplied in a two-compartment bag that must be mixed immediately prior to use [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]:

Small compartment A (250 mL) containing an electrolyte solution, and
Large compartment B (4750 mL) containing the buffer solution.

See Table 1 for the concentrations of the active ingredients (after mixing) in these 9 different replacement solutions (total volume is 5 Liters).

The mode of therapy, solute formulation, flow rates, and length of PRISMASOL and PHOXILLUM replacement therapy in CRRT should be established by a physician based on the patient's clinical condition, blood concentration of phosphate and other electrolytes, acid-base and glucose balance. Administer either PRISMASOL or PHOXILLUM into the extracorporeal circuit:

Before (pre-dilution) the hemofilter or hemodiafilter,
After (post-dilution) the hemofilter or hemodiafilter, or
Before and after the hemofilter or hemodiafilter.

### Sodium chloride, sodium citrate (Regiocit) [^115TwNKB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatic/Biliary/Pancreatic

Use in Patients with Mild to Moderate Hepatic Impairment

Systemic metabolism of citrate to bicarbonate may be impaired in patients with hepatic impairment, resulting in accumulation of citrate. If REGIOCIT solution is administered to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, frequent monitoring of pH, electrolytes, total-to-ionized calcium ratio, and systemic ionized calcium is important to avoid electrolyte and/or acid–base imbalance (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Monitoring and Laboratory Tests

Plasma electrolyte and acid–base parameters should be closely monitored during CRRT. Closely monitor sodium, magnesium, potassium, phosphate, calcium, blood glucose levels, hematocrit, hemodynamic status and fluid balance, pH, bicarbonate, total-to-ionized calcium ratio, and systemic ionized calcium. Infusion of electrolytes may be needed to supplement any loss.

Special Populations

Pregnant Women

There are no adequate data from the use of REGIOCIT solution in pregnant women.

Physicians should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits for each specific patient before administering REGIOCIT solution.

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) dose in AKI — trial regimens and dosing targets — The RENAL study randomly assigned 1,508 patients to continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) at effluent flows of either 40 or 25 mL/kg/h, and the ATN study randomly assigned 1,124 patients to more intensive therapy (CVVHDF at 35 mL/kg/h or intermittent hemodialysis or sustained low-efficiency dialysis on a 6-day-per-week schedule) versus less intensive therapy (CVVHDF at 20 mL/kg/h or intermittent hemodialysis or sustained low-efficiency dialysis on a 3-day-per-week schedule); in both studies there was no added benefit for survival or recovery with more intensive therapy. The KDIGO recommended weekly delivered Kt/V of 3.9 is based on the arithmetic mean of individual treatment doses, while recent modeling suggests a higher weekly Kt/V of 7 to 9 may be more appropriate; delivery of RRT often falls short of the prescribed dose, supporting frequent assessment of actual delivered dose.

Residual kidney function in dialysis — background and rationale: Recent data support the notion that RKF is an important predictor of survival and delivered Kt/Vurea can be adjusted to reflect the presence of renal function; RKF is an important contributor to dialysis adequacy, and adequacy was shown to impact on morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5, and in contrast to HD, RKF provides continuous clearance of both small and large solutes and helps attenuate the large fluctuations in fluid balance and blood pressure that are more pronounced in anuric patients.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^112VGHtN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Limitations of the guidelines — clinical outcomes are optimized when the patient is treated with the delivered dose of dialysis recommended, but because dose as small‑solute clearance is a composite measure, an occasional patient may generate toxins at a rate well above average and therefore require more dialysis than recommended. Clinicians should be alert to subtle symptoms and signs of kidney failure that may indicate a need for more dialysis or a different dialysis modality. After the immediate life‑threatening effects of uremia have been controlled by standard hemodialysis, the patient is often left with symptoms and objective disorders termed a "residual syndrome", whose combined effect may account for the relatively high yearly mortality rate observed in the dialysis population; in many cases, relief from specific aspects of the syndrome requires additional treatments that may not yet be available to clinicians.

What is an EUA?

The United States FDA has made REGIOCIT available to treat patients in an ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic under an emergency access mechanism called an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). The EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Service (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic.

REGIOCIT made available under an EUA have not undergone the same type of review as an FDA-approved product. FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, available alternatives. In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of scientific evidence available showing that it is reasonable to believe that REGIOCIT may be effective for use as a replacement solution in adult patients treated with Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) and requiring regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) of the extracorporeal circuit in an ICU setting during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and that the known and potential benefits of REGIOCIT for such use outweigh the known and potential risks of REGIOCIT.

This EUA for REGIOCIT is in effect for the duration of the COVID-19 declaration justifying emergency use of the products, unless terminated or revoked (after which the products may no longer be needed). The EUA will end when the declaration is terminated or revoked or when there is a change in the approval status of the product such that an EUA is no longer needed.

KDIGO AKI anticoagulation during CRRT — high bleeding risk and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): For patients with increased bleeding risk who are not receiving anticoagulation, we suggest the following for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT): use regional citrate anticoagulation, rather than no anticoagulation, in a patient without contraindications for citrate (2C), and avoid regional heparinization during CRRT in a patient with increased risk of bleeding (2C). In a patient with HIT, all heparin must be stopped and we recommend using direct thrombin inhibitors (such as argatroban) or Factor Xa inhibitors (such as danaparoid or fondaparinux) rather than other or no anticoagulation during RRT (1A); in a patient with HIT who does not have severe liver failure, we suggest using argatroban rather than other thrombin inhibitors or Factor Xa inhibitors (2C).

American Society of Hematology 2021 guidelines — Patients with COVID-19–related critical illness: The panel suggests using prophylactic-intensity rather than intermediate- or therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation for those without suspected or confirmed venous thromboembolism, a conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence; this does not apply to patients on extracorporeal circuits such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). An individualized assessment of thrombosis and bleeding risk is important when deciding anticoagulation intensity, and risk-assessment models available for hospitalized patients have not been validated for COVID-19. At present, there is no direct high-certainty evidence comparing different anticoagulant types; selection of low-molecular-weight heparin, unfractionated heparin, or other agents may be based on availability, resources required, familiarity, minimizing PPE use or exposure, and patient-specific factors including renal function, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and gastrointestinal absorption concerns.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

PRISMASOL and PHOXILLUM are pharmacologically inactive solutions. While there are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women, appropriate administration of PRISMASOL and PHOXILLUM solutions with monitoring of fluid, electrolyte, acid-base and glucose balance, is not expected to cause fetal harm. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with PRISMASOL and PHOXILLUM solutions.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Maintenance of normal acid-base balance is important for fetal well-being.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

The components of PRISMASOL and PHOXILLUM solutions are excreted in human milk. Appropriate administration of PRISMASOL and PHOXILLUM solutions with monitoring of fluid, electrolyte, acid-base and glucose balance, is not expected to harm a nursing infant.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness have been established based on published clinical data of CRRT replacement solutions with compositions similar to PRISMASOL and PHOXILLUM used in adults and two hemofiltration studies in pediatric patients, including a study of newborns to 17 years old.

8.5 Geriatric Use

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^115sKws8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Dialysate sodium concentration (CPG 5.3) — High concentrations of sodium in dialysate reduce sodium removal during dialysis and ultrafiltration; historically, treatments lasting 6 hours used 135 mmol/L, but with shorter schedules (3 times per week for ≤ 4 hours per treatment) dialysate sodium was increased to the region of ≥ 140 mmol/L, which can aggravate thirst, fluid gain, and hypertension. Sodium profiling increases dialysate sodium early (eg, 145 to 155 mmol/L) with a progressive decrease to 135 to 140 mmol/L at the end of dialysis; reviews show sodium profiling is of uncertain benefit. The patient's postdialysis serum sodium concentration is a function of the time-averaged dialysate level, not the terminal level of sodium in dialysate. Some investigators had satisfactory experiences with a dialysate sodium concentration of 138 mmol/L, and during these studies the dosage of antihypertensive medications often had to be decreased or discontinued.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

There have been reports of system failure due to apparent operator error during administration of CRRT with REGIOCIT solution, leading to serious adverse events, including life-threatening hypocalcemia. Plasma electrolyte and acid-base parameters should be closely monitored during CRRT, and appropriate action taken if imbalances of electrolytes or acid-base balance are detected. Instructions for use of REGIOCIT and CRRT must be strictly followed.

Cautionary statements are provided in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Endocrine and Metabolism, Hematologic, Hepatic / Biliary / Pancreatic, and Monitoring and Laboratory Tests, and in DRUG INTERACTIONS to avoid the following when performing the CRRT procedure:

- Hypercalcemia
- Hyponatremia
- Fluid retention, dehydration
- Nausea, vomiting
- Muscle spasms

Citrate Accumulation

Special attention is required in patients with liver failure, including hepatic cirrhosis or acute hepatic failure, or in shock, since metabolism of citrate may be markedly reduced and patients may be thus exposed to citrate accumulation. In these circumstances, more frequent monitoring of citrate accumulation should be undertaken. With systemic citrate accumulation, metabolic acidosis and ionized hypocalcemia may ensue, and the ratio of total to ionized calcium in the blood rises. If total/ionized calcium ratio rises above 2.3, REGIOCIT infusion should be reduced or stopped. CRRT may then be continued without anticoagulation, or by using other means of anticoagulation.

### Chronic kidney disease CKD: guideline recommendations and supporting information (2020) [^116LPZ8G]. AND (2020). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) metabolic acidosis — In dialysis, the oral bicarbonate group had higher overall SGA scores starting at 24 weeks (p-value < 0.0003). In CKD 4–5 pre-dialysis, the oral sodium bicarbonate group had significant lower nPNA (nPCR) at 12 and 24 months (p < 0.05) and significant higher serum albumin at 12 and 24 months (p < 0.05). In a group of CKD 5 hemodialysis patients, there was no significant difference in serum albumin among time points (p > 0.05), whereas in CKD 5 hemodialysis, oral sodium bicarbonate increased serum albumin level (p = 0.01). It should also be noted that high dialysate bicarbonate concentrations are associated with increased mortality in observational studies. Among CKD 4–5 pre-dialysis, oral sodium bicarbonate increased both serum albumin and prealbumin levels between before and after intervention (p < 0.05). Among CKD 1–2 compared to control and HCO3, the fruit and vegetable group had significantly greater decrease in body weight at the end of the intervention for both individuals with CKD 1–2 (p < 0.05 for both), with no difference between HCO3 and control. Thus there does not appear to be a significant effect of reduction in NEAP on nutritional status in patients with CKD 1–2. In CKD 4 compared to CKD 3, the FV group had lower weight at 1-year follow up (p < 0.01), and baseline weight did not differ between the two groups (p = 0.24). In CKD 3, fruits and vegetables had greater net body weight loss than both HCO3 and control (p < 0.05), and the control group had greater net body weight loss than the HCO3 group (p < 0.05). The evidence supporting the recommendations on dietary management of NEAP with fruits and vegetables and bicarbonate supplementation is based on Grade III /Grade C evidence, and the recommendation regarding bicarbonate maintenance based on Consensus/expert opinion.

Among MHD cohorts, one study reported "no significant difference in serum albumin levels among time points (P > 0.05)", while another found "oral sodium bicarbonate increased serum albumin levels (P = 0.01)". Additional data show that in CKD stage 4, "the fruits and vegetables group had lower weight at the 1-year follow up (P < 0.01)… baseline weight did not differ… (P = 0.24)", and in CKD stage 3, fruits and vegetables led to "greater net body weight loss than both bicarbonate and control (P < 0.05)" with control also greater than bicarbonate (P < 0.05). The guideline notes, "There does not appear to be a significant effect of reduction in NEAP on nutritional status in patients with CKD 1–2".

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for nutrition in CKD: 2020 update [^115K3Mw2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Guideline 6: Electrolytes — monitoring and evaluation for acid-base interventions in CKD reports that trials show expected acid-base changes with serum bicarbonate monitoring, beneficial biomarker effects from fruits and vegetables at doses that reduce dietary acid by 50%, and generally favorable effects of oral bicarbonate on biomarkers; hyperkalemia was not observed in one fruit-and-vegetable intervention series. The guideline states, "Clinical trials have demonstrated adherence with expected changes in acid-base status as evaluated by measurement of serum bicarbonate". It notes, "Consuming fruits and vegetables in the amount that could reduce dietary acid by 50% generally had positive effects on acid-base biomarkers", with fruits and vegetables that "increased plasma total CO2 (though not significant in 1 study) and decreased potential renal acid load and 8-hour net acid excretion". It further indicates, "Except for Goraya et al214* (0.5 mEq/kg per day), oral bicarbonate supplements also had positive effects on acid-base biomarkers by increasing plasma total CO2 or bicarbonate levels and decreasing potential renal acid load and 8-hour net acid excretion". Finally, it reports, "No hyperkalemia events were noted in the studies of Goraya et al,212, who provided a diet rich in fruits and vegetables to patients with advanced CKD".

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^112s2YH9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute liver failure (ALF) — central nervous system management emphasizes ICU monitoring and airway protection by encephalopathy grade, structured ICP therapies, and careful sodium management. Patients with ALF with grade 2 or higher encephalopathy should be monitored in an ICU setting, and those with advanced grade 3–4 hepatic encephalopathy should undergo endotracheal intubation for airway protection; lactulose should be discontinued in this setting. First-line treatment of increased intracranial pressure includes hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol, hypertonic saline), hyperventilation, and continuous renal replacement therapy, and hyponatremia should be avoided; it is a common practice to target serum sodium 145–150 mmol/L without supporting literature, and where correction is undertaken, it should be accomplished at a slow rate, not exceeding 6–8 mmol/L in 24 hours. General recommendations are for 3% saline as a 250–500 mL bolus or continuous infusion to maintain serum sodium levels below 160 mmol/L. Continuous renal replacement therapy has been shown to effectively lower ammonia levels in ALF, and reduced ammonia has been associated with reduced mortality and increased transplant-free survival at 21 days. Routine ICP monitor placement lacks conclusive evidence and may be considered only in centers with expertise and in highly selected patients; there is no conclusive evidence to recommend routine use of hypothermia to control ICP, and a review concluded it did not improve overall patient survival despite efficacy and a low risk of bleeding. There is also no conclusive evidence to recommend for or against lactulose or rifaximin for encephalopathy treatment in ALF.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^115A8nky]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis adequacy — timing of therapy (CPG 1.3): When patients reach stage 5 CKD (estimated GFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2), nephrologists should evaluate the benefits, risks, and disadvantages of beginning kidney replacement therapy, and particular clinical considerations and characteristic complications of kidney failure may prompt initiation of therapy before stage 5 (B).
