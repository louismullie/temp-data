## Question

How can jock itch be differentiated from other skin conditions that affect the groin area?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to differentiate jock itch (tinea cruris) from other skin conditions that affect the groin area. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical features that anchor tinea cruris. Then, I should compare these features with key mimics such as candidiasis, inverse psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, scabies, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, erythrasma, and hidradenitis suppurativa. Next, I will outline a practical diagnostic algorithm including bedside tests and when to escalate to KOH, culture, biopsy, or dermoscopy. Finally, I should consider special populations and red flags that warrant urgent action or alternative diagnoses, and close with a concise synthesis that ties morphology, distribution, and response to therapy together.

> Let me first confirm the core phenotype of tinea cruris so I don't jump to conclusions. Classically, tinea cruris presents with pruritic, annular or arciform, sharply marginated plaques with an active scaly border and central clearing, often involving the inguinal folds and proximal inner thighs, and it typically spares the scrotum unless mixed with candidiasis. Maceration can occur in moist folds, and lesions may be red to brown depending on skin tone, which aligns with pediatric infectious disease and public health summaries of ringworm presentations [^1127t7PB] [^1151Uv1D].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — candidiasis can look deceptively similar. Candida intertrigo tends to be bright beefy-red, macerated, and often shows satellite papules or pustules at the periphery; it frequently involves the scrotum and may coexist with tinea cruris, which explains why mixed infections are not rare in the groin; importantly, KOH reveals budding yeast and pseudohyphae, and culture can confirm Candida species, whereas tinea shows branching hyphae on KOH and dermatophyte growth on culture [^1127t7PB] [^112KrRYk].

> I will now examine inverse psoriasis, which is a common mimic in intertriginous zones. Inverse psoriasis presents as well-demarcated, smooth, shiny, erythematous plaques without the prominent peripheral scaling seen in tinea; KOH is negative, and lesions often persist or recur despite empiric antifungals, prompting consideration of biopsy or a therapeutic trial of topical calcineurin inhibitors or low-potency steroids in the right clinical context [^111B4YDM].

> Let me consider seborrheic dermatitis next. Seborrhea favors sebaceous areas and can involve the groin with greasy, yellowish scale and ill-defined margins; it lacks the annular configuration and active scaly border of tinea, and KOH is negative unless there is a secondary yeast overgrowth; distribution beyond the groin to scalp, beard, eyebrows, and central chest supports this diagnosis [^117T8Nmw].

> Wait, I should verify scabies because nocturnal itch and burrows can mislead. Scabies produces intensely pruritic, often nocturnal lesions with burrows in web spaces, papules on the genitalia, and sometimes nodules on the scrotum or penis; dermoscopy or burrow ink test can reveal the delta-wing jet sign, and a positive contact history in household members strengthens suspicion; unlike tinea, scabies lacks annular plaques and shows no fungal elements on KOH [^1169a3p7] [^114Q88Ae].

> I need to check atopic dermatitis carefully. AD in the groin is uncommon but possible. It shows poorly demarcated, eczematous, excoriated plaques with a background of xerosis and flexural involvement elsewhere, and it often spares the groin in classic phenotypes. A personal or family history of atopy and chronic relapsing course support AD, and KOH is negative [^112SfK1i] [^111iTfLx].

> Let me review contact dermatitis, both irritant and allergic. Contact dermatitis tends to have sharp demarcation matching exposure to irritants or allergens such as fragrances, wipes, or topical agents; it may burn more than itch initially, and distribution is often asymmetric or localized to the exposure site; patch testing is indicated when allergic contact dermatitis is suspected, and KOH is negative [^111L8kB2].

> I should double-check erythrasma, a bacterial mimic that is frequently overlooked. Erythrasma presents as brown, scaly, often asymptomatic or mildly pruritic patches in intertriginous areas, including the groin; Wood's lamp shows coral-red fluorescence due to coproporphyrin, and KOH is negative; lack of response to antifungals and this distinctive fluorescence help distinguish it from tinea [^112tv9eB].

> But wait, what if the patient has painful nodules rather than pruritic plaques. Hidradenitis suppurativa causes recurrent, painful, deep nodules and sinus tracts in axillae and groin, often with scarring and double comedones; it is not pruritic like tinea and requires a different management pathway, so recognizing pain and nodulocystic morphology avoids mislabeling as a fungal infection [^1116x5P1].

> Next, I should review a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm. Start with a focused history of onset, seasonality, sports, shared towels, sexual exposures, diabetes, immunosuppression, and household itch. On exam, map morphology, borders, scale, maceration, satellite lesions, and scrotal involvement. Perform KOH on any scaly border or atypical plaque, and consider Wood's lamp for erythrasma. If KOH is negative and the diagnosis remains uncertain, obtain fungal culture or perform a biopsy, reserving dermoscopy for suspected scabies burrows. In refractory or recurrent cases, consider antifungal resistance patterns, including Trichophyton indotineae, which may require oral therapy and culture-guided management [^112KrRYk] [^117KeEEW].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and red flags. In children, tinea cruris is uncommon and should be distinguished from candidal diaper dermatitis and scabies; in immunocompromised patients, atypical or extensive disease is more likely and may involve non-dermatophyte yeasts; in men who have sex with men, sexually transmitted dermatophytosis such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes genotype VII can present with groin involvement and may require oral antifungals; persistent, nonhealing, or violaceous plaques should prompt biopsy to exclude inflammatory mimics or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [^1127t7PB] [^1176gW4N] [^111T7j1U].

> Let me reconsider the synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Tinea cruris is best identified by its annular, scaly, sharply marginated plaques with central clearing, sparing the scrotum unless mixed with candidiasis, and by positive KOH for branching hyphae; mimics deviate by lacking the active scaly border, by showing satellite papules, by being smooth and shiny, by having burrows or nocturnal itch, by burning from contactants, by coral-red fluorescence, or by painful nodulocystic disease; anchoring on morphology, distribution, bedside tests, and response to appropriate therapy minimizes misdiagnosis and directs timely treatment [^1127t7PB] [^1151Uv1D] [^112KrRYk].

Jock itch (tinea cruris) is best differentiated from other groin dermatoses by its **annular, scaly, sharply demarcated plaques with central clearing** and **active, raised borders** [^1127t7PB] [^1151Uv1D]. Key distinguishing features include: **satellite papules** (candidiasis), **silvery scale and extensor involvement** (psoriasis), **burrows and nocturnal itch** (scabies) [^114Q88Ae], **greasy yellow scale in sebaceous areas** (seborrheic dermatitis) [^117T8Nmw], and **coral-red fluorescence** (erythrasma) [^112tv9eB]. Diagnosis is clinical; confirm with **KOH prep** for hyphae, and use Wood's lamp or culture when uncertain [^112KrRYk]. Treatment response to topical antifungals supports the diagnosis [^112KrRYk].

- **Clinical examination**: Detailed history and exam are essential [^112ad1GH].
- **KOH preparation**: Rapid bedside test for hyphae; high sensitivity/specificity [^notfound].
- **Wood's lamp**: Coral-red fluorescence suggests erythrasma [^notfound].
- **Fungal culture**: Confirms dermatophyte; useful for atypical or refractory cases [^112KrRYk].
- **Dermoscopy**: Helps identify burrows in scabies [^notfound].

## Treatment and management

- **Topical antifungals**: First-line; azoles, allylamines, or benzylamines for 1–2 weeks [^112KrRYk] [^115seaoX].
- **Hygiene**: Keep area dry, use loose clothing, avoid sharing towels [^115dNzcg].
- **Refractory cases**: Consider oral antifungals (e.g. terbinafine, itraconazole) [^1176gW4N].
- **Adjunctive therapy**: Topical corticosteroids for inflammation if needed [^notfound].

## Conclusion

Jock itch is identified by its **annular, scaly plaques with central clearing** and active borders [^1127t7PB]. Differentiate from candidiasis, psoriasis, scabies, seborrheic dermatitis, erythrasma, contact dermatitis, and hidradenitis by morphology, distribution, and specific signs. Confirm with KOH, Wood's lamp, or culture when needed, and treat with topical antifungals and hygiene measures [^112KrRYk].

Diagnosis

Diagnostic Methods and Tools

LSC is a clinical diagnosis based on physical exam findings of characteristic solitary lichenified plaques with enhanced markings owing to chronic rubbing and scratching. Collecting a complete medical history is crucial as it provides insights into potential underlying conditions, triggers, and the origin of the itch, whether psychological, environmental, or secondary to other dermatoses. The VAS, developed by Reich et al. may aid in assessing lesion and pruritus severity. A biopsy may be helpful when the diagnosis is uncertain, or lesions fail to respond to standard therapy.

Differential Diagnoses

Conditions that may mimic LSC include hypertrophic lichen planus (LP), lichenified psoriasis, psoriasiform dermatitis, contact dermatitis, and mycosis fungoides. In genital areas, lichen sclerosus and LP should be considered as well as vulvar neoplasia. Lichen amyloidosis is another important consideration; it is a localized pruritic dermatosis and a form of primary cutaneous amyloidosis, more commonly seen in Hispanic and Asian populations. It closely resembles LSC both clinically and histologically, except for the presence of amyloid deposits, and is often considered a variant of LSC.

Although AD can present with lichenification, it tends to have a more widespread distribution and is often associated with elevated serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E and a personal or family history of atopy. Contact dermatitis, both allergic and irritant, may present similarly, and patch testing is essential for identifying allergens. Mycosis fungoides should be considered in treatment-refractory cases and can be distinguished histologically by atypical lymphocytes and epidermotropism. In rare cases, squamous cell carcinoma may present as a chronic, nonhealing plaque, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis, particularly in lesions with atypical features or in patients with risk factors for skin cancer.

Histopathology

LSC exhibits pronounced epidermal hyperplasia with hyperkeratosis, alongside a thickened granular layer and acanthosis. The rete ridges are typically elongated, and a stratum lucidum may be seen, a feature usually limited to acral sites. Mild spongiosis can be present, particularly in vulvar biopsies where LSC is often superimposed on chronic spongiotic dermatitis. In the superficial dermis, vertical streaks of thickened collagen are commonly noted, accompanied by perivascular and interstitial inflammation. The inflammatory infiltrate is composed predominantly of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and eosinophils.

Question 2: Which of the following characteristic CANNOT be used to distinguish early/indolent FMF from advanced/aggressive FMF?
A. Clinical distribution
B. Pruritus
C. Eosinophils
D. Depth of infiltrates & density of perifollicular infiltrate
E. Degree of folliculotropism

Answer:
A. Clinical distribution — Incorrect. Advanced FMF characteristically involves the head and neck, while early-stage lesions present mainly on the trunk and limbs, although about one-third of the patients have concurrent head/neck lesions.
B. Pruritus — Incorrect. Pruritus is more common in advanced-stage than in early-stage FMF. Patients with keratosis pilaris–like lesions type of FMF or juvenile patients with early-stage FMF only feel minor itching.
C. Eosinophils — Incorrect. Consistent with classic mycosis fungoides (MF), the number of eosinophils in advanced-stage FMF is almost 6 times higher than those in the early-stage subgroup.
D. Depth of infiltrates & density of perifollicular infiltrate — Incorrect. In advanced-stage FMF, infiltrates are significantly deeper and perifollicular infiltrates are more obvious than early-stage lesions. Early-stage lesions show infiltration limited to the adventitial perifollicular dermis, whereas the infiltration of advanced lesions has a nodular to diffuse pattern extending to the reticular dermis.
E. Degree of folliculotropism — Correct. Unlike classic tumor-stage MF, there was no difference in the degree of folliculotropism between early-stage and advanced-stage FMF.

### It looks like childhood eczema but is it? [^113is5MC]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

In childhood, the most common type of eczema/dermatitis is atopic dermatitis, which occurs in up to 25% of children world-wide. However, the diagnosis may sometimes be challenging and atopic dermatitis may resemble other types of dermatitis as well as other skin diseases such as psoriasis, infections, infestations and malignancies as well as metabolic, genetic and autoimmune disorders. This review will focus on how to recognize the most common types of dermatitis in children and adolescents and how to separate them from the most common differential diagnoses clinically and histologically.

Clinical Presentation, Sex, and Age at Diagnosis

Clinical Presentation

The clinical picture of DH consists of an itchy rash occurring in the favored sites of the elbows, the extensor surfaces of the forearms, the knees, and the buttocks, including the sacral area (Fig. 1). The rash is polymorphic, consisting of small blisters, papules, and erythema; however, because of the intense itch and associated scratching, erosions, crusts, and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation often dominate the clinical picture. The localization of the rash is so typical for DH that the itchy rash in the predominant skin sites usually raises suspicion of DH. However, the severity of the rash varies between individuals, and a more intense rash may also affect other sites, such as the scalp, face, and upper back. The clinical picture and severity of the DH rash seem to have remained unchanged over recent decades without becoming milder or otherwise nonclassical as seen in celiac disease. The itch in DH is very prominent; in half of the patients, it is a constant finding and correlates with common sleep disturbances. Triggering factors such as taking indomethacin and inadvertent dietary iodide ingestion are known to exacerbate the rash and itching. A few cases of localized DH on the face or elsewhere on the body have been described. Acral purpura is a rare finding in DH and may be seen either with the typical rash or as the only symptom of the disease, especially in children with DH.

The differential diagnosis of DH includes various itchy, excoriated, and blistering skin diseases. Linear IgA disease and sometimes bullous pemphigoid may clinically resemble DH, but immunofluorescence examination easily differentiates these disorders. Other itchy skin diseases, such as scabies, atopic and nummular dermatitis, lichen planus, and urticaria may also resemble DH, but the most obvious difference is the symmetrical distribution of the rash on the favored sites in DH.

### Disseminated superficial porokeratosis involving the groin and genitalia in a 72-year-old immunocompetent man [^116fBfPe]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Our patient represents a rare presentation of porokeratosis. DSP most commonly presents between the ages of 5 and 10 years, but may develop later in life in the setting of immunocompromise. However, our patient had DSP in his sixth decade of life and has no immunocompromising conditions. Our clinical photographs capture a rare presentation involving the genitalia, including the penile shaft.

Although the specific etiology is unknown, the porokeratoses are thought to originate from clonal proliferation of abnormal keratinocytes. Risk factors for porokeratosis include family history, light-colored skin, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation exposure, internal malignancies, and immunosuppression. The porokeratoses are typically asymptomatic but some patients may experience pain, pruritus, or cosmetic concerns, which are among the most common indications for treatment. Several topical, systemic, and surgical treatment modalities have been described; however, treatment is challenging, as the lesions are often refractory to therapeutic intervention. Recently, diclofenac sodium 3% gel was found to be successful in stabilizing the lesions of DSAP and genital porokeratosis and providing symptomatic relief. Unfortunately, spontaneous regression is rare, and the lesions typically persist indefinitely without treatment. The most important indication for treatment is transformation into squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma. All of the clinical variants of porokeratosis have the potential for malignant transformation with an overall incidence of 7.5% to 11%.

We report this case to show that porokeratosis can affect the buttocks, groin, and genitalia. Because of the atypical location, it may be initially misdiagnosed, and a correct diagnosis is important to treat appropriately and monitor for the risk of malignant transformation.

### Eruption on the vulva and groin [^116meLdP]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Transient acantholytic dermatosis (Grover disease) – Incorrect. Grover disease is a self-limited pruritic papulovesicular condition with predilection for the trunk, neck, and proximal extremities, sparing the genitocrural region. Histology may resemble pemphigus, Darier disease, or Hailey-Hailey disease or be spongiotic.
B. Segmental follicular dyskeratosis (Darier disease) – Incorrect. Darier disease presents in adolescence as greasy, scaly brown papules that may form large verrucous plaques. Histology displays acantholysis with hyperkeratosis and dyskeratotic cells; verrucous epidermal hyperplasia and prominent folliculocentricity are typical. Seborrheic regions are affected with distribution on the trunk, scalp, face and neck in addition to the groin. Nail abnormalities are common. A segmental distribution indicates this form of Darier follows the lines of Blaschko, which is inconsistent with the genitocrural distribution found in this patient.
C. Segmental Hailey-Hailey disease – Incorrect. Histopathology shows dyskeratosis and suprabasilar acantholysis with loss of intercellular bridges, classically described as a dilapidated brick wall. The clinical morphology is dissimilar, with painful flaccid vesicles and crusted erosions on intertriginous skin such as the neck, axilla, and groin in a blaschkoid distribution.
D. PAD (of the genitocrural folds) – Correct. Discrete white to skin-colored smooth or verrucous papules that coalesce into plaques on the vulva and perineum reflect the morphology of PAD. PAD is a rare chronic acantholytic dermatosis that presents in young women with asymptomatic but persistent lesions limited to the genital, inguinal, and perineal skin. PAD occurs less frequently in men and can involve the penis, scrotum, perineum, or thighs. Histology shows overlapping features of Hailey-Hailey and Darier disease, including suprabasilar acantholysis, parakeratosis, and dyskeratosis. Verrucous epidermal hyperplasia is also typical.
E. Familial dyskeratotic comedones – Incorrect. Although the clinical morphology includes discrete asymptomatic hyperkeratotic papules, comedones are the principal lesions. The trunk, extremities, face, and groin are involved. Histology shows dilated infundibula filled with keratin and dyskeratosis; acantholysis is occasionally observed.

### Psychogenic itch [^1128vmH2]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Psychogenic itch can be defined as "an itch disorder where itch is at the center of the symptomatology and where psychological factors play an evident role in the triggering, intensity, aggravation, or persistence of the pruritus". The disorder is poorly known by both psychiatrists and dermatologists and this review summarizes data on psychogenic itch. Because differential diagnosis is difficult, the frequency is poorly known. The burden is huge for people suffering from this disorder but a management associating psychological and pharmacological approach could be very helpful. Classification, psychopathology, and physiopathology are still debating. New data from brain imaging could be very helpful. Psychological factors are known to modulate itch in all patients, but there is a specific diagnosis of psychogenic itch that must be proposed cautiously. Neurophysiological and psychological theories are not mutually exclusive and can be used to better understand this disorder. Itch can be mentally induced. Opioids and other neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine and dopamine, are probably involved in this phenomenon.

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^113nrW4c]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Topical anesthetics such as lidocaine and pramoxine and ketamine−amitriptyline−lidocaine (KAL) also relieve itching and discomfort and can be especially useful for neuropathic vulvar itch. Cooling agents such as menthol may help decrease itch by inhibiting the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8 (TRPM8), reducing nerve excitability and providing a soothing effect.

Topical tofacitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, has shown promise in treating inflammatory skin conditions such as vulvovaginal lichen planus, lichen simplex chronicus (LSC), and psoriatic lesions by targeting inflammatory cytokine signaling pathways involved in these diseases. Clinical studies suggest that tofacitinib can reduce inflammatory markers and improve symptoms in resistant or severe cases, offering a valuable alternative to traditional corticosteroid therapies for managing these vulvar conditions. Additionally, topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, both calcineurin inhibitors, are effective alternatives to corticosteroids for managing pruritus in conditions such as lichen sclerosus and LSC. These agents work by selectively inhibiting T-cell activation, which helps alleviate symptoms in patients unresponsive to first-line corticosteroids. Studies have shown significant improvement in symptom relief and skin appearance, with these treatments proving particularly beneficial for sensitive areas such as the vulva, where corticosteroids may pose risks of skin thinning with prolonged use.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^112ad1GH]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Is it necessary to perform extensive diagnostic studies by complementary testing in all patients with CSU?

The indiscriminate search for underlying causes that may include an extensive battery of tests is discouraged – due to low cost-effectiveness. A careful and detailed medical history and physical examination are essential. Patient-oriented questions are helpful to establish the type of chronic urticaria and to define baseline laboratory studies and/or other complementary tests tailored to the individual patient (Table 2). In most cases, there is no need to order an extensive work-up unless data from the clinical history suggest an underlying disease. Table 3 lists the essential tests that should be performed.

Table 2
Recommended data to obtain from the patient's medical history

Table 3
Minimal work-up studies on chronic spontaneous urticaria *

Key point: Unless suggested by the clinical history, there is no need to perform extensive tests when examining a CSU patient.

What is the differential diagnosis to be established for a patient with CSU?

Apart from urticaria vasculitis for which diagnosis is made through biopsy, It can be difficult to differentiate hives from other dermatoses (Table 4). However, the natural course differs in these pathologies. Erythema multiform clears on its own within a maximum of 3 weeks; it is included in the differential diagnosis because of its severity and should always be ruled out at the onset of symptoms, when it can resemble chronic urticaria. Autoinflammatory syndromes have symptoms that may be confused with chronic urticaria, but they are rare, and although skin rashes are always associated with systemic symptoms, itching is not as striking a feature as it is in the case of chronic urticaria. Certain systemic diseases are associated with urticaria-like lesions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Schnitzler syndrome (IgM monoclonal gammopathy, urticaria, fever, lymphadenopathy and weight loss), mastocytosis and hypereosinophilic syndromes.

Differential diagnosis of chronic urticaria

Key point: Chronic urticaria differs from other dermatosis on its duration, the evanescence of lesions and intense itching.

### Common skin rashes in children [^115Ko85Q]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Because childhood rashes may be difficult to differentiate by appearance alone, it is important to consider the entire clinical presentation to help make the appropriate diagnosis. Considerations include the appearance and location of the rash; the clinical course; and associated symptoms, such as pruritus or fever. A fever is likely to occur with roseola, erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), and scarlet fever. Pruritus sometimes occurs with atopic dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, erythema infectiosum, molluscum contagiosum, and tinea infection. The key feature of roseola is a rash presenting after resolution of a high fever, whereas the distinguishing features in pityriasis rosea are a herald patch and a bilateral and symmetric rash in a Christmas tree pattern. The rash associated with scarlet fever usually develops on the upper trunk, then spreads throughout the body, sparing the palms and soles. Impetigo is a superficial bacterial infection that most commonly affects the face and extremities of children. Erythema infectiosum is characterized by a viral prodrome followed by the "slapped cheek" facial rash. Flesh-colored or pearly white papules with central umbilication occur with molluscum contagiosum, a highly contagious viral infection that usually resolves without intervention. Tinea is a common fungal skin infection in children that affects the scalp, body, groin, feet, hands, or nails. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin condition that may present with a variety of skin changes.

6 CUTANEOUS PRURITUS: ITCH WITH NO PRIMARY PRURITIC DERMATOSIS

Itch typically arises from inflamed skin, which may be the result of allergic inflammation or infectious skin (e.g. fungal, parasitic, and viral infections). On the other hand, a certain population of patients with itch present with uninflamed or normal‐appearing skin. These skin conditions may or may not result in secondary skin changes due to scratching. This itch condition is coined "cutaneous pruritus" in the Japanese Dermatological Association's guideline", pruritus with no underlying dermatosis", or "generalized pruritus without rash" if itch is generalized, in the British Association of Dermatologists' guidelines for the investigation and management of generalized pruritus in adults without an underlying dermatosis, 2018, and "pruritus on non‐diseased skin" in a position paper of the International Forum for the Study of Itch. The Japanese guideline further categorizes cutaneous pruritus into two phenotypes: generalized cutaneous pruritus and localized cutaneous pruritus. Generalized pruritus refers to presence of itch on a wide area of the body, while localized pruritus is defined as itch fixed and localized to a specific part of the body.

Hereinafter, the term cutaneous pruritus is used to describe itch without primary pruritic dermatosis and observable primary rash.

Few sources of information exist regarding cutaneous innervation and how to apply this basic neurologic science to the clinical treatment of itch, as often performed on a daily basis by dermatologists. We address the types of nerve fibers that innervate the skin and their different components and discuss the similarities and differences between itch and pain. We hope that increased knowledge of this topic will improve the recognition and treatment of neuropathic itch.

Introduction

Definition of Neuropathic Itch from Spinal Impingement

Neuropathic itch from spinal impingement is itch without a primary rash caused by spinal impingement, as in brachioradial pruritus (BRP), notalgia paresthetica (NP), and anogenital itch, which are forms of neuropathic itch — defined as the sensation of pruritus that is caused by neural dysfunction at any point along the afferent pathway. This non-dermatological itch is typically chronic in nature and may be accompanied by other abnormal sensory symptoms in a dermatomal distribution, such as paresthesia, hyperesthesia, or hypoesthesia. This sensory combination may lead to feelings more characteristic of pain, such as burning, stinging, or tingling. Another distinguishing feature of neuropathic itch is the potential presence of other forms of neural damage, including motor or autonomic damage. The pruritus may be localized due to compression of a single nerve fiber or generalized due to broader nerve degeneration. Of note, neuropathic pruritus tends to be moderate to severe, with an average itch severity of 6.5–7.8 on a mean numeric rating scale (NRS). This likely contributes to a host of comorbid features that negatively impact quality of life in patients with chronic pruritus, especially depressed mood, disrupted sleep, and strained social relationships.

Epidemiology

Neuropathic itch is a common origin of chronic pruritus, accounting for an estimated 8% of cases in the general population, according to a German database. Epidemiological studies exploring the prevalence and incidence of neuropathic itch are notably lacking in the existing literature. The most common forms of neuropathic itch are BRP, NP, and anogenital itch, albeit there are no detailed epidemiologic data.

Identifying the cause of neuropathic itch can be a convoluted process, and recognizing key epidemiological factors may be a helpful tool in narrowing the potential contributing mechanisms. BRP, for instance, is 2–3 times more commonly seen in white women in the fifth to sixth decades of life. The prevalence of BRP in the general population is unknown, although it is considered to be rare. BRP also appears to be more common in the tropics or subtropics compared with moderate climates or may present with disease flares during the warmer months with remission during cooler periods. The increased prevalence of BRP in regions with high ultraviolet (UV) exposure may relate to sun damage of itch -inhibitory nerve fibers in skin.

### Kodamaea ohmeri infection can be the causative agent of secondary infections of intertrigo: a case study [^117EsjAi]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Kodamaea ohmeri infection is a relatively rare condition, primarily affecting immunocompromised individuals or those with a history of invasive procedures. The diagnosis of this infection is challenging because of its diverse and complex atypical clinical presentations. In this study, we describe a case of cutaneous infection with Kodamaea ohmeri presenting as erythematous and scaly lesions on both armpits and groin with itching in an 82-year-old man, mimicking intertrigo, and review the relevant literature. The diagnosis was confirmed through fungal microscopy, fungal culture, and mass spectrometry. Antifungal therapy proved to be effective in managing the infection. This case suggests that K. ohmeri, similar to Candida, is a potential pathogen in secondary infection associated with intertrigo. The findings highlight that early identification and diagnosis are crucial for managing K. ohmeri infections effectively.

### Differentiated exophytic vulvar intraepithelial lesions: case reports and review of literature [^111mMEUo]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aims of this article were to describe 2 patients with a pathological diagnosis of differentiated exophytic vulvar intraepithelial lesion and to summarize the literature regarding this relatively new diagnosis.

Materials and Methods

The existing literature was searched on December 1, 2021, using the MEDLINE database (1966–2021), and all combinations of the following search terms were used: "differentiated exophytic vulvar intraepithelial lesion" and "differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia".

Results

Patients were postmenopausal and reported persistent vulvar itch associated with white hypertrophic plaques. Initial biopsies did not identify differentiated exophytic vulvar intraepithelial lesion. Invasive squamous cell carcinoma was found in both cases after surgical excision.

Conclusions

Differentiated vulvar intraepithelial lesions and invasive squamous cell carcinoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of vulvar itch associated with hypertrophic plaques in postmenopausal women. Excision of suspicious plaques is recommended for definitive diagnosis.

### Sensitive skin syndrome: an Update [^115KD21K]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Sensitive skin syndrome is a widely reported complaint but a diagnostic challenge because of its subjective symptoms and lack of clearly visible manifestations. Epidemiological studies have shown the prevalence of sensitive skin to be as high as 60–70% among women and 50–60% among men. Patients with this syndrome usually have unpleasant sensations when exposed to physical, thermal, or chemical stimuli that normally cause no provocation on healthy skin. Recent studies and newly accepted position papers have provided a more in-depth understanding and consensus of its underlying pathophysiology, associations, diagnosis, and treatment. Since no clinical studies have been conducted about specific treatment protocols, patients with this condition should be provided with personalized skin management. Given this updated knowledge, our review offers an approach to sensitive skin syndrome, with differential diagnoses, and interventions targeting its pathophysiology.

### Atypical features and systemic associations in extensive cases of grover disease: a systematic review [^113d2TnC]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Grover disease is an acantholytic disorder that typically occurs on the trunk of older individuals, primarily white men, in association with heat and xerosis. Cases with extensive and/or atypical distributions have been reported.

Objective

To review the literature characterizing the population, morphology, associations, and disease course of extensive or atypical eruptions of Grover disease.

Methods

A systematic literature review identified 50 articles with 69 cases.

Results

Patient age ranged from 14 to 83 years (mean age, 56 ± 15), with 71% of patients being male and 29% female. Areas of involvement included the trunk (90%), upper and lower extremities (63% and 61%, respectively), face/scalp (28%), neck (21%), groin (11%), buttocks (8%), and axillae (6%). The most common associations included a history of malignancy (61%), recent chemotherapy (38%), and recent transplant (20%).

Limitations

Extensive cases with typical clinical morphology may not have been examined by biopsy or reported; thus, this review may have publication bias toward more severe or atypical presentations.

Conclusions

Greater variability exists among patients affected by extensive or atypical Grover disease than among those with typical disease. Malignancy is a common association, and there may be a role for immunosuppression in the pathogenesis of extensive or atypical Grover disease.

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^1165215y]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Genetic Factors

Genodermatoses, or genetic disorders that directly affect the skin, may affect the vulvovaginal region. Darier disease is a genodermatosis caused by mutation of the ATPA2 gene on chromosome 12, responsible for a calcium pump protein. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, but a recognized diagnosis in an immediate family member is seen in less than half of cases. The condition causes itchy, hyperkeratotic papules that may affect mucosal surfaces and in rare cases may affect the vulva. The lesions may appear wart-like or be mistaken for acneiform conditions. Most patients experience itching during lesion outbreaks, which is exacerbated by heat, sweat, and sometimes the menstrual cycle.

Another dyskeratosis caused by a genetic mutation is Hailey–Hailey disease. A heterozygous mutation of the ATP2C1 gene causes failure of normal junction between keratinocytes, resulting in flares of vesico-bullous lesions and, over time, acanthosis. These lesions often cause burning and itching and often affect flexural parts of the body and intertriginous zones. While the condition is rare, vulvar involvement is common in affected women. Anal involvement is less common and may be mistaken for condylomatous disease. Involvement of the vaginal mucosal is not usually seen.

There may be genetic predispositions for certain conditions that cause vaginal itching, although research in this area is still developing. For example, individuals with a family history of atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, LS, or other inflammatory skin conditions may be more prone to experiencing vaginal itching due to similar immune response mechanisms. Personal history of recurrent VVC, defined as four or more episodes in a year, may also be linked to genetic predisposition. Table 1 describes the main characteristics of vulvovaginal itch by etiology.

### From compression to itch: exploring the link between nerve compression and neuropathic pruritus [^113UHB89]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Anogenital Neuropathic Pruritus

Anogenital pruritus is characterized by persistent itching in the anal and genital areas. Patients often delay consulting a physician for anogenital itch, leading to later presentations with atypical symptoms or skin changes such as depigmentation, erythema, lichenification, and secondary skin infections due to persistent scratching. Symptoms can be exacerbated by factors such as moisture, sweating, and friction. In some cases, patients might also report a burning or stinging sensation. Given the sensitive nature of the affected region, anogenital pruritus can significantly impact quality of life and result in psychological distress, necessitating a thorough evaluation to identify underlying causes and appropriate treatments.

Furthermore, dermatologic conditions such as psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus, and lichen sclerosus should be ruled out before attributing the itch to lumbar spinal radiculopathy. In a study involving 20 patients with anogenital pruritus, lumbosacral radiculopathy was detected in 16 patients (80%), highlighting the role of lumbosacral compression in pruritus generation. The primary cause of neuropathic itch in the genital area often stems from compression of the lumbar and sacral spinal cord dorsal rami, involving nerve roots L1–L5 and S1–S5.

### Assessment of pruritus characteristics and impact on burn survivors [^112KspoS]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

The goal of this cross-sectional study was to characterize and describe persistent postburn pruritus. Cause and treatment of postburn itch is elusive. It has been suggested that burn survivors with persistent pruritus should be divided into acute itch (≤ 6 months postinjury) and chronic itch (> 6 months postinjury) because the cause of itch may be different. Cross-sectional data of itch characteristics reported here are from the baseline data of a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled pilot study of 23 subjects with frequent and bothersome postburn pruritus. Subjects self-completed validated scales for variables of itch sensation, affect of itch, and severity. Variables of quality of life, frequency, pain and itch intensity, skin condition, scar, and medication were also recorded. Itch frequency revealed that 87% of subjects experienced itching daily, 96% experienced three or more episodes a day, and 52% had episode durations lasting 5 to 30 minutes per incidence. Itch was reported as unbearable by 94% of subjects with chronic itch and by 86% of subjects with acute itch, whereas bothersome was 88 and 100%, respectively. Itch sensation dimension of stinging was 74% in both acute and chronic itch subjects. Crawling and burning sensations were often severe. Potential itch triggers and relief activities were identified. Differences in sensory and affective itch components were detected between acute and chronic itch subjects. Combinations of itch mechanisms probably contribute to the development of and changes in pruritus. Characterizing the sensation and affective itch dimensions in conjunction with inflammation, burn injury, recovery, scar maturation, medication, and psychological status should better elucidate postburn itch.

### Psychogenic itch [^115PYBPn]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Management

Announcement of diagnosis

The announcement of a diagnosis of psychogenic pruritus to a patient is not easy or anecdotal and should be made cautiously. First, a diagnosis that has been supported by diagnostic criteria (Table 1) to avoid misdiagnosis is essential. There is a need to propose the diagnosis as the more probable hypothesis and to be cautious. Some patients could feel guilty about their itch if they are told that it is simply psychological. To prevent this, it is necessary to talk about this possible diagnosis at the first consultation for a pruritus without dermatological disease and to explain that itch can originate in organs other than the skin, including the brain. After clinical, biological, and radiological exams and conversations to become better acquainted with the patients, this diagnosis will be naturally inferred or confirmed, like any other diagnosis. It is important to explain to the patient that he or she is not responsible for the initiation of the itch and to approach a patient with psychogenic pruritus with the same objectively derived list of differential diagnoses and the same comprehensive treatment plan that would be given any other patient. Patients need to be told and to feel that their suffering is genuinely understood.

Pharmacological treatment

There has been no clinical trial of treatments for psychogenic itch, and the course of the disease is poorly known. The following psychopharmacologic drugs might be useful and have an acceptable risk of adverse events: hydroxyzine, tricyclic antidepressants (mainly doxepin), and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram, fluvoxamine, and escitalopram). Antipsychotics (such as pimozide or risperidone and olanzapine) and antiepileptics (such as topiramate, gabapentin, and pregabaline) can also be used in some cases (7, 52). The choice among these drugs may be discussed according to the general psychiatric context and the eventually associated psychiatric symptoms.

5 CONCLUSION

To conclude, our data emphasizes the importance of differentiating between studies assessing the HE prevalence based on self‐reported HE versus self‐reported signs. For a specific set of diagnostic criteria for HE, we consider two signs or more combined with itch as a promising first step. Future steps should include expert panel discussions and a clinical diagnostic accuracy study with dermatologist‐diagnosed HE followed by external validation for determination of a final set of standardized diagnostic criteria for HE.

### Children atopic dermatitis: diagnosis, mimics, overlaps, and therapeutic implication [^113vjBfY]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

4.2.6 Candidiasis

In nappy eczema, the diagnosis may include AD, ACD but also Candida, which often also acts as a cofactor. Of note is congenital candida, which has burn‐like manifestations, with desquamation, which can make diagnosis difficult.

4.2.7 Tinea corporis and capitis

Although the classic appearance of tinea corporis is an erythematous ring‐shaped plaque with central resolution, atypical morphology is not uncommon and may lead to suspicion of AD, ND or pityriasis rosea. Tinea capitis, on the other hand, when presenting with fine non‐inflamed plaques, may resemble ISD or AD. However, the presence of alopecia, pustules, lymphadenopathy, and broken hair may help the diagnosis. Microscopic examination is a useful tool, but the presence of hyphae does not necessarily exclude AD.,

4.2.8 Scabies

Because of the severe itching and eczematous dermatitis involved, scabies is among the differential diagnoses of AD. However, scabies itching is localized mainly to the armpits and groin in children, as well as to the interdigital spaces, which are not typical sites for eczema. A positive history of itching, especially nocturnal itching, in other family members helps the diagnosis. The dermoscopic examination looking for the mite and the burrow confirms the diagnosis.

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^111T7j1U]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

A physical examination should include an inspection of the vulvovaginal area to identify any visible signs such as lesions, excoriations, skin or tissue changes, or abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, or consistency. Identified lesions should be well examined, and the patient should be asked whether they are the perceived source of itch, are painful, or are tender to touch. If vaginal itching is present, a wet mount preparation with microscopy of vaginal discharge, STI testing, and pH testing are often the first line, with DNA probe testing having higher accuracy. A speculum exam may not be needed, as specimens may be collected using a swab that can be inserted into the vagina without a speculum. However, a speculum exam is helpful with visualizing vaginal lesions, such as herpetic lesions or condylomas in the vaginal canal or with cervical visualization. If a provider is unable to perform a speculum exam or if there are upper vaginal or cervical symptoms or lesions that cannot be assessed, a referral to gynecology may be necessary. Additionally, concerning symptoms such as ulcerated, eroded, or discolored vulvar lesions, pelvic pain, sexual dysfunction, or abnormal vaginal bleeding may also warrant a referral. Vulvoscopy is used for magnified visualization of external vulvar lesions. For uncertain or persistent lesions that do not respond to treatment, punch biopsy may be necessary, and microbiological tests may help confirm diagnoses in cases of refractory infections. The goal is to create diagnostic algorithms based on symptoms, signs, and morphological features.

Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating vulvovaginal pruritus, it is essential to consider a broad differential diagnosis, encompassing infectious, inflammatory, hormonal, neoplastic, neuropathic, systemic, and psychogenic causes. Given the overlapping presentations of these conditions, a systematic approach is necessary to narrow down the most likely etiology. Of note, if hormonal causes are suspected, referral to a gynecologist is warranted for further workup. If a psychogenic cause is suspected or a psychiatric condition is suspected to be an aggravating factor, psychiatric evaluation is warranted. A detailed discussion on these topics is beyond the scope of this review.

Formation of a differential is led by the timing, absence or presence of lesions, location, absence or presence of abnormal discharge, age, and other risk factors. Medical history, contacts, and other elements of history may increase clinical suspicion for causes of vaginal itch originating from certain domains.

### Burden of itch in epidermolysis bullosa [^115ZUxMx]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Itch is an unpleasant feeling that leads to scratching. It is a common, but understudied, problem in patients with epidermolysis bullosa (EB).

Objectives

We measured the prevalence and characteristics of itch in the three major forms of EB: generalized EB simplex (EBS), junctional EB (JEB) and dystrophic EB (DEB).

Methods

Forty patients with EB were recruited from two tertiary care centres and one patient organization. The sample included 19 patients with EBS, seven with JEB and 14 with DEB. Patients completed the Leuven Itch Scale (LIS), a multidimensional self-report instrument that quantifies the frequency, duration, severity, distress, consequences and surface area of itch. This instrument has good clinimetric properties.

Results

Itch occurred in 85% of the patients, with substantial differences across the subtypes (EBS 74%, JEB 100%, DEB 93%). Itch, in all its dimensions, was most pronounced in patients with JEB and DEB, and less prominent in patients with EBS. The scores were significantly different for itch frequency, severity, distress and surface area, and the overall itch scores were comparable with those of atopic dermatitis. Itch mainly occurred in a hot environment (65%) and when sweating (62%). The most prevalent consequences were difficulty in falling asleep (88%) and lesions from scratching (85%). Differences between the three major subtypes were also observed in terms of circumstances, consequences and sensory characteristics.

Conclusions

As expected, itch is common among patients with EB. All aspects of itch measured by the LIS were more severe in JEB and DEB than in EBS.

### Itch characteristics in atopic dermatitis: results of a web-based questionnaire [^117UseRw]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Itch significantly impairs the quality of life of patients with atopic dermatitis. However, only a few previous studies have examined the specific characteristics of itch in atopic dermatitis.

Objective

To examine the frequency, intensity and perceived characteristics of pruritus among individuals with atopic dermatitis.

Methods

Questionnaire reliability and validity were established in pilot testing. Survey participants completed the comprehensive, web-based 'Characteristics of itch' questionnaire. Participants provided anonymous demographic information and answered questions regarding itch intensity, frequency, timing, duration, location, associated symptoms and itch descriptors.

Results

A total of 304 individuals with atopic dermatitis completed the web-based questionnaire. Itch occurred at least once daily in 91% of the individuals surveyed. Of the 32 itch descriptors rated by survey participants, 31 demonstrated a statistically significant positive correlation with the participants' ratings of itch intensity (P < 0.001). More than half the survey participants reported pain (59%) and heat sensation (53%) associated with itch.

Conclusion

The questionnaire was found to be a useful tool in characterization of itch. Pain appears to be an important component of atopic dermatitis. The strong correlation between itch descriptors and itch intensity suggests that such descriptors serve as strong indicators of the symptomatology in atopic dermatitis.

### Red scrotum syndrome: an update on clinicopathologic features, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^115uN4mf]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The genital skin may be affected by a variety of dermatoses, be it inflammatory, infectious, malignant, idiopathic, or others. The red scrotum syndrome is characterized by persistent erythema of the scrotum associated with a burning sensation, hyperalgesia, and itching. Its cause is unknown, but proposed mechanisms include rebound vasodilation after prolonged topical corticosteroid use and localized erythromelalgia. The condition is chronic, and treatment is often difficult. Here we review the etiology, the physical and histopathologic findings, and the management of this condition. We also describe related conditions such as red scalp syndrome, red ear syndrome, and red vulva syndrome. Finally, we summarize the different cases reported in the literature and discuss the features that help in the differentiation of red scrotum syndrome from its mimickers.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis are two common chronic inflammatory skin diseases that have a negative impact on the quality of life of patients. Affecting both children and adults, AD is characterized by red, inflamed, eczematous lesions and pruritus, with up to 90% of patients presenting with mild-to-moderate disease. In infants and young children, the face, neck, and extensor skin areas are frequently involved, while older children and adults often present with flexural fold involvement of the extremities (i.e. antecubital and popliteal fossae). In addition to disease involvement in sensitive skin areas, patients with AD have higher skin sensitivity (e.g. stinging, burning, itching, pain) to cosmetics and environmental factors. Psoriasis can occur at any stage of an individual's life, and is often characterized by red plaques of thickened skin covered in silver or white scales that may affect any area of the body, with the knees, elbows, lower back, and scalp being the most common sites. While plaque psoriasis (also known as psoriasis vulgaris) is the most common type of psoriasis (approximately 90% of all cases), other site-specific variants also exist, such as inverse psoriasis, which is often smooth, red, and shiny in appearance, affecting sensitive skin fold areas (e.g. groin, gluteal cleft, axillae, and genitals).

Although chronic inflammatory skin diseases such as AD and psoriasis can be effectively treated with topical treatments, a number of safety concerns warrant special consideration. In psoriasis, cutaneous irritation may develop following treatment with topical retinoids and vitamin D analogs. Topical corticosteroids (TCSs) and topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) are effective treatment options for AD, but use of TCS on thin-skinned areas such as the face, intertriginous areas, and genitals are limited by potential adverse effects. TCIs are associated with application-site reactions (e.g. burning or stinging sensations), particularly in sensitive skin areas, and contain a boxed warning citing cases of malignancy. Additionally, the American Academy of Dermatology and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology has issued guidelines recommending that the application of TCSs on the face, eyelids, genitalia, and intertriginous areas be avoided or administered with caution to avoid increased risk of systemic absorption and subsequent systemic adverse effects.

### Lichen simplex chronicus: clinical perspectives and emerging therapeutic strategies [^1115oKDf]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Description of Symptoms

The primary symptom of LSC is intense, chronic itch, often described as paroxysmal as it is marked by sudden urges to scratch followed by refractory relief periods of 1–5 hours. Scratching tends to worsen at nighttime and is not only habitual but often experienced as highly pleasurable, contributing to the chronicity of the itch-scratch cycle. In a cross-sectional study examining patients with chronic pruritus, those with LSC rated their scratching pleasure among the highest across pruritic dermatoses (mean score 3.4 ± 2.3 in a linear scale ranging from − 5 (not pleasurable at all) to + 5 (extremely pleasurable)), reinforcing the notion that scratching in this condition is rewarding. However, when LSC involves the genital area, this transient relief is often overshadowed by the condition's significant physical, sexual, and psychological toll, patients commonly report embarrassment, disrupted intimacy, and diminished quality of life. Psychological stress can exacerbate symptoms, and episodes of scratching often occur during periods of emotional distress. While there has historically been stigma surrounding psychogenic contributions to pruritus, growing research in psychodermatology has since underscored the complex neuroimmune interplay in conditions such as LSC. It is important to emphasize that while stress plays a role in the pathophysiology and exacerbation of LSC, the condition itself is a disorder with an established biological basis.

Commonly Affected Areas of the Body

LSC is typically localized to one or a few sites, distinguishing it from conditions such PN or other eczematous dermatoses that present with more generalized involvement. Commonly affected regions are both easily accessible for scratching and some are highly innervated, including the nape of the neck, ankles, scalp, vulva, scrotum, and extensor forearms. Further psychophysical research has shown that scratching is particularly pleasurable on the ankles and back, areas frequently involved in LSC, suggesting a topographical link between itch intensity and reward processing.

LSC lesions may demonstrate a three-zone architecture: a central area of flat lichenification, a middle ring of lichenoid papules, and a peripheral zone of mild thickening and hyperpigmentation. Scratching during the refractory period in the context of psychological stress, may result in clear skin sores. Plaques can range in color varying in terms of skin tone, from pink to dark brown, and may evolve into hypopigmented patches with darker borders over time.

- scabies

- arthropod bite reactions (papular urticaria, strophulus).

### Beyond the herald patch: exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^112sJrgp]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

An atypical herald patch may be absent in up to 20% of cases or may appear at unusual sites such as the face, scalp, or genitalia. Inverse PR primarily affects acral and flexural areas, including the axilla, groin, and face. Acral PR features lesions on the palms and soles, necessitating differentiation from conditions like erythema multiforme, syphilis, necrolytic acral erythema, and drug eruptions. Unilateral PR is an extremely rare form in which lesions appear only on one side of the body, observed in both children and adults. Blaschkoid PR follows the lines of Blaschko, which are thought to trace the path of embryonic ectodermal cell migration running along but not crossing the anterior truncal midline. Limb-girdle PR, also known as PR of Vidal, is confined to the shoulders or pelvic girdle, typically affecting the axilla and groins with larger, more annular lesions. Mucosal involvement in PR occurs in about 16% of patients, affecting the oral mucosa with punctate, erosive, bullous, or hemorrhagic lesions, often without symptoms. Localized PR presents with eruptions confined to a specific area of the body.

In individuals with darker skin tones, PR may present differently, more frequently involving the face and manifesting with papular lesions. Additionally, oral ulcers have been reported to occur more often in skin of color patients. These cases tend to be more pruritic, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation is a common outcome.

Despite these variations, typical clinical features, such as a preceding prodrome, a primary lesion followed by secondary lesions, and coexistent classical lesions, are still beneficial in diagnosing most PR cases. Figure 2 shows atypical lesions of pityriasis rosea on the hand, an uncommon site for this condition as the rash typically spares the distal extremities.

2. Male genital lesions

Discrete papules or larger nodules found on the penis (shaft, corona, glans, prepuce) and/or scrotum are highly specific for scabies. 34 Their surface may be smooth or rough depending on how vigorously the patient has been scratching, but are not scaly. Typically, several lesions are present at one time in an affected individual (Figure 3 g). 74, 75 These lesions are often very itchy, but in some individuals they may not be itchy at all. Genital lesions are reported to occur in up to 10–30% of male patients with scabies, but they may be more frequent in adult male individuals in temperate climates. 58, 76

3. Typical lesions

The clinical signs of common scabies vary widely in terms of the appearance of individual lesions; appearance of grouped or clustered lesions; and severity and degree of secondary changes such as excoriation, impetiginization, eczematization and lichenification (thickening of skin due to scratching and rubbing). In the absence of the highly specific signs of burrows or male genital lesions, the decision whether or not other observed skin lesions are typical for scabies is a critical determination in diagnosing clinical scabies or suspected scabies. For lesions to be considered typical, examiners must consider both morphology and number.

In morphology, typical scabies lesions are small, elevated and easily palpated. The most common lesions are solid and 2–3 mm in diameter (papules). 77 Larger, nodular lesions, usually 5–10 mm and occasionally > 10 mm, are more likely to be seen in certain body areas (groin and genitalia, buttocks, axillae, breasts of women and torsos of infants) 78, 79 and may persist for several months, even after mites are successfully eradicated. The colour is usually erythematous (pink to red) but may be hyperpigmented in darker‐skinned individuals.

### Atopic and contact dermatitis of the vulva [^11394hj9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Pruritus, or itch, is a common vulvar complaint that is often treated empirically as a yeast infection; however, yeast infections are just one of the many conditions that can cause vulvar itch. Ignoring other conditions can prolong pruritus unnecessarily. Atopic dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis, and allergic contact dermatitis are extremely common noninfectious causes of vulvar itch that are often underdiagnosed by nondermatologists. Identifying these conditions and treating them appropriately can significantly improve a patient's quality of life and appropriately decrease health care expenditures by preventing unnecessary additional referrals or follow-up visits and decreasing pharmaceutical costs.

### Malignant intertrigo: a subset of toxic erythema of chemotherapy requiring recognition [^114koAoa]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

The presumed pathophysiology of TEC is excretion of cytotoxic agents into eccrine sweat ducts, yielding localized toxic effects. Areas with high concentrations of eccrine ducts and those vulnerable to sweat trapping are at increased risk. Numerous nucleoside metabolic inhibitors and cytotoxic agents have been implicated in TEC, and this trapping of chemotherapeutic agents results in eccrine squamous syringometaplasia and epidermal dysmaturation.TEC is most commonly associated with anthracyclines, cytarabine, and other antimetabolites. Interestingly, however, similar eruptions may also occur with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, despite their lack of cytotoxicity. The cohort in this case series is too small and their treatments too varied to determine additional correlations among types of chemotherapy or malignancy and the subsequent rash.

Although biopsy supports the diagnosis, certain clinical findings help raise suspicion for MI when diagnosing a flexural eruption. In particular, MI should be distinguished from mechanical or infectious intertrigo (including candidiasis) and from drug exanthemata, cellulitis, and graft-versus-host disease. Marked pain and tenderness are among the more prominent clinical features that can help identify MI from among other intertriginous rashes, and the absence of a history of organ or marrow transplant will rule-out cutaneous graft-versus-host disease. MI does not display the satellite lesions commonly seen in candidal intertrigo, and neither potassium hydroxide cytology nor bacterial cultures will be positive, unless superimposed infection arises from the associated skin breakdown. Symmetric drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE), with its characteristic erythema on the gluteal or inguinal areas, may also be in the differential diagnosis, requiring distinction from MI. SDRIFE, however, is most commonly associated with systemic antibiotics rather than chemotherapeutics and is presumed to be a delayed T-cell–mediated reaction rather than an accumulation of locally cytotoxic chemicals. As a type IV hypersensitivity reaction, SDRIFE presents just hours to days after the offending drug administration, whereas MI presents days to weeks after drug exposure. Therefore, the onset of symptoms can help distinguish SDRIFE from MI.

Case 2: A 50-year-old gentleman presented with a one-year history of a purplish nodular plaque on his right upper thigh, which had gradually increased in size over this period. An incisional biopsy revealed multiple non-necrotising granulomata, characterized by prominent and confluent multinucleate foreign body-type giant cells, with only sparsely admixed small lymphocytes. There was no epidermotropism or significant cytological atypia; an initial diagnosis of atypical sarcoidosis was suggested. He continued to develop more plaques in the groin, lower abdomen, and buttocks (Figs. 6 A, B). Over the next 2 years, he developed a large area of cutaneous laxity in the right groin. The excess skin was surgically excised and again the histology was felt to be in keeping with cutaneous sarcoidosis albeit atypical. The patient continued to develop new areas of slack skin that commenced as thickened, violaceous, and minimally scaly plaques limited to his groins, lower abdomen, and buttocks, which evolved into pendulous folds of skin. He had normal chest radiographs, pulmonary function tests and full blood count, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme, and calcium levels throughout the course of his disease. Subsequently, a further biopsy was taken and revealed multiple non-necrotizing epithelioid granulomata with strikingly prominent giant cells and a sparse population of small lymphocytes (Figs. 6 C, D). No foreign material was identified. Ziehl-Neelsen and fungal stains were negative. Elastic van Gieson histochemistry confirmed widespread loss of elastin. PCR performed on a fresh skin biopsy demonstrated a clonal population of T cells. A diagnosis of GSS was made.

### A double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of naftifine 2% cream in tinea cruris [^116g7MCy]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Naftifine HCl 2% cream (NAFT-2%) is a topical allylamine antifungal preparation under development in the U.S. The objective of this randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a two-week course of once-daily NAFT-2% vs. vehicle in the treatment of Tinea cruris ("jock itch").

Methods

A total of 334 subjects with T. cruris were enrolled and randomly assigned to NAFT-2% (n = 166) or vehicle (n = 168), which was applied once daily for 14 days. Efficacy and safety were evaluated at week 2 (end of treatment) and week 4. Efficacy measures included complete cure, treatment effectiveness, mycological cure, clinical cure, and clinical success and were analyzed only in subjects with a positive potassium hydroxide (KOH) and dermatophyte culture at baseline (n = 75, naftifine; n = 71, vehicle). Safety was assessed by adverse events and changes from baseline in clinical status and laboratory studies.

Results

At week 4, 25 percent of naftifine-treated subjects achieved complete cure vs. three percent of vehicle subjects and 72 percent achieved mycological cure vs. 16 percent of vehicle treated subjects (one-sided, P < 0.001). Treatment effectiveness was achieved in 60 percent of NAFT-2% subjects vs. 10 percent of vehicle subjects (one-sided, P < 0.001). Clinical cure rate and clinical success rate were 33 percent and 84 percent in NAFT-2% subjects, respectively vs. 10 percent and 46 percent in vehicle subjects (both P is less than 0.001, 2-sided). Week 2 efficacy response rates in NAFT-2% subjects were all lower than at week 4 but were significantly higher than week 2 vehicle-treated counterparts (P < 0.025). Treatment-related AE occurred in 11 subjects (7 NAFT-2%, 4 vehicle) during the study. The most common AE in both groups were contact dermatitis (2 NAFT-2%), pruritus (2 vehicle), and application site reaction (1 per group).

Conclusion

NAFT-2% applied once daily for two weeks (one-half the treatment duration for naftifine 1% cream) is efficacious and safe for the treatment of T. cruris.

### New definitions and subtypes of chronic prurigo [^1134UUR6]. Clinics in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

During the past few years, chronic prurigo, including prurigo nodularis, has become a focal point of considerable research attention, resulting in enhanced insights into this condition. For over two centuries, the term "prurigo" has been used in dermatology, often applied loosely to describe a range of pruritic, papulous conditions lacking clear diagnostic criteria. In 2017, the term "chronic prurigo" was introduced, delineating chronic prurigo, including prurigo nodularis, as a distinct disease entity characterized by chronic pruritus, a characteristic clinical history, and physical signs such as excoriations and the presence of pruriginous lesions. Pruriginous lesions exhibit diverse morphologies, encompassing papules (diameter < 1 cm), nodules (diameter > 1 cm), plaques, and umbilicated or linear lesions. The co-occurrence of multiple lesion types in an individual is frequently observed. The subtype and severity of chronic prurigo can be categorized on the basis of the type or number of pruriginous lesions.

### Topical antifungal treatments for tinea cruris and tinea corporis [^112KrRYk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Tinea infections are fungal infections of the skin caused by dermatophytes. It is estimated that 10% to 20% of the world population is affected by fungal skin infections. Sites of infection vary according to geographical location, the organism involved, and environmental and cultural differences. Both tinea corporis, also referred to as 'ringworm' and tinea cruris or 'jock itch' are conditions frequently seen by primary care doctors and dermatologists. The diagnosis can be made on clinical appearance and can be confirmed by microscopy or culture. A wide range of topical antifungal drugs are used to treat these superficial dermatomycoses, but it is unclear which are the most effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical antifungal treatments in tinea cruris and tinea corporis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 13th August 2013: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials. We handsearched the journal Mycoses from 1957 to 1990.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in people with proven dermatophyte infection of the body (tinea corporis) or groin (tinea cruris).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, and analyses.

Main Results

Of the 364 records identified, 129 studies with 18,086 participants met the inclusion criteria. Half of the studies were judged at high risk of bias with the remainder judged at unclear risk. A wide range of different comparisons were evaluated across the 129 studies, 92 in total, with azoles accounting for the majority of the interventions. Treatment duration varied from one week to two months, but in most studies this was two to four weeks. The length of follow-up varied from one week to six months. Sixty-three studies contained no usable or retrievable data mainly due to the lack of separate data for different tinea infections. Mycological and clinical cure were assessed in the majority of studies, along with adverse effects. Less than half of the studies assessed disease relapse, and hardly any of them assessed duration until clinical cure, or participant-judged cure. The quality of the body of evidence was rated as low to very low for the different outcomes. Data for several outcomes for two individual treatments were pooled. Across five studies, significantly higher clinical cure rates were seen in participants treated with terbinafine compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 4.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.10 to 6.56, number needed to treat (NNT) 3, 95% CI 2 to 4). The quality of evidence for this outcome was rated as low. Data for mycological cure for terbinafine could not be pooled due to substantial heterogeneity. Mycological cure rates favoured naftifine 1% compared to placebo across three studies (RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.14, NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 4) with the quality of evidence rated as low. In one study, naftifine 1% was more effective than placebo in achieving clinical cure (RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.41 to 4.16, NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 5) with the quality of evidence rated as low. Across two studies, mycological cure rates favoured clotrimazole 1% compared to placebo (RR 2.87, 95% CI 2.28 to 3.62, NNT 2, 95% CI 2 to 3). Data for several outcomes were pooled for three comparisons between different classes of treatment. There was no difference in mycological cure between azoles and benzylamines (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07). The quality of the evidence was rated as low for this comparison. Substantial heterogeneity precluded the pooling of data for mycological and clinical cure when comparing azoles and allylamines. Azoles were slightly less effective in achieving clinical cure compared to azole and steroid combination creams immediately at the end of treatment (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.84, NNT 6, 95% CI 5 to 13), but there was no difference in mycological cure rate (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.05). The quality of evidence for these two outcomes was rated as low for mycological cure and very low for clinical cure. All of the treatments that were examined appeared to be effective, but most comparisons were evaluated in single studies. There was no evidence for a difference in cure rates between tinea cruris and tinea corporis. Adverse effects were minimal - mainly irritation and burning; results were generally imprecise between active interventions and placebo, and between different classes of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

The pooled data suggest that the individual treatments terbinafine and naftifine are effective. Adverse effects were generally mild and reported infrequently. A substantial number of the studies were more than 20 years old and of unclear or high risk of bias; there is however, some evidence that other topical antifungal treatments also provide similar clinical and mycological cure rates, particularly azoles although most were evaluated in single studies. There is insufficient evidence to determine if Whitfield's ointment, a widely used agent is effective. Although combinations of topical steroids and antifungals are not currently recommended in any clinical guidelines, relevant studies included in this review reported higher clinical cure rates with similar mycological cure rates at the end of treatment, but the quality of evidence for these outcomes was rated very low due to imprecision, indirectness and risk of bias. There was insufficient evidence to confidently assess relapse rates in the individual or combination treatments. Although there was little difference between different classes of treatment in achieving cure, some interventions may be more appealing as they require fewer applications and a shorter duration of treatment. Further, high quality, adequately powered trials focusing on patient-centred outcomes, such as patient satisfaction with treatment should be considered.

### Diagnosis and management of tinea infections… [^113ztYje]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

|Uncommon fungal skin infections that involve other organs | The most common infections in prepubertal children are tinea corporis and tinea capitis, whereas adolescents and adults are more likely to develop tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and tinea unguium. Tinea infections can be difficult to diagnose and treat. In one survey, tinea was the skin condition most likely to be misdiagnosed by primary care physicians. Tinea Capitis In the United States, tinea capitis most commonly affects children of African heritage between three and nine years of age. 4 There are three types of tinea capitis: gray patch, black dot, and favus. Black dot, caused by Trichophyton tonsurans, is most common in the United States. Early disease can be limited to itching and scaling, but the more classic presentation involves one or more scaly patches of alopecia with hairs broken at the skin line and crusting.

Tinea capitis may progress to kerion, which is characterized by boggy tender plaques and pustules. The child with tinea capitis will generally have cervical and suboccipital lymphadenopathy, and the physician may need to broaden the differential diagnosis if lymphadenopathy is absent. 7 However, lymphadenopathy can also occur in nonfungal scalp disease, and the absence of lymphadenopathy in an otherwise typical presentation should not delay aggressive treatment for tinea capitis.
9. Tinea Unguium Onychomycosis is a common consideration in adolescents and adults with dystrophic toenails. In addition to the common distal subungual form, which is characterized by thickened, brittle, discolored nails, onychomycosis may present with an uncommon proximal subungual form, which should raise suspicion of immunocompromise, and a white superficial form, which is more common in children than adults 24.

The most common onychomycosis mimics include chronic trauma and psoriasis. 25 Adolescents and young adults can develop dystrophic toenails from repeated sudden-stop trauma associated with basketball, soccer, and tennis. 26 The great toes are most often involved in onychomycosis and trauma-related dystrophy, but exclusive little toe involvement is likely related to trauma.

### Characteristics and impacts of itch in children with inflammatory skin disorders [^116AeaM9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Itch is a cardinal feature of paediatric disorders and can impair quality of life. However, few studies have addressed symptoms and impacts of itch in paediatric patients.

Objectives

We focused on understanding the child's experience of itch and the impact of itch specifically on affected children, including comparison with the adult experience.

Methods

Semistructured interviews (nine parents, 15 children with itch) explored concerns related to paediatric itch experiences and effects. Themes were compared with those of previous adult interviews. Literature was reviewed to identify the need for a more comprehensive measure of paediatric itch.

Results

Itch quality, intensity, duration and environmental triggers (sweating, climate change, stress and certain fabrics) are important aspects of the child's itch experience. Skin disruption, physical function, concentration, emotional reactions, stigma and relationships/social effects are itch impact themes that emerged. No paediatric-specific scale comprehensively captures the paediatric patient itch experience. However, differences between child and adult reports of itch-related pain, functional limitations, fatigue and restlessness, emotional reactions to itch, and treatment effects emphasize the need for a paediatric-specific measurement tool.

Conclusions

Children and parents endorse the importance of capturing the paediatric-focused characteristics and impacts of itch in measuring disease severity and response to intervention.

### Treatment and diagnostic challenges associated with the novel and rapidly emerging antifungal-resistant dermatophyte [^117KeEEW]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

T. indotineae dermatophytosis can be severe, covering large areas of the body, and challenging to treat. They can present as extensive, pruritic plaques, minimally inflammatory, primarily affecting the trunk, extremities, and groin, causing tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea faciei, and tinea genitalis. Central clearing is often absent, and plaques may resemble eczema, and post-cure pruritus has frequently been reported. Dark-skinned individuals can present with prominent pigmentation. Lesions may present in various atypical morphologies, including erythematous, scaly concentric plaques with a "pseudoimbricata" appearance, papulosquamous, pustular, or steroid-modified tinea forms. Patients often report a history of ineffective treatment with topical or oral antifungals, including TRB, and some may have recently traveled to or been in contact with individuals from countries where T. indotineae infections are prevalent. However, domestic cases in patients without travel history are increasingly being documented. The use of topical corticosteroid products often for severe pruritus can exacerbate the condition by masking symptoms and altering lesion morphology, complicating diagnosis and treatment. T. indotineae has rarely been implicated in nail or hair infections. To date, only two cases of onychomycosis have been reported — one from Italy in a patient who immigrated from India and the other in a French man — both involving toenails and associated with extensive tinea corporis, presenting with proximal erosion of the nail plate. The reasons for the limited involvement of T. indotineae in hair and nail infections as compared to other Trichophyton species remain unknown. Pavlovic et al. have suggested that poor keratolytic activity of T. indotineae may be the reason for rare nail infections. Some other possibilities may include its lack of lipolytic activity or it may have just been underreported.

### From compression to itch: exploring the link between nerve compression and neuropathic pruritus [^112ByL4h]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Notalgia Paresthetica

NP is characterized by chronic itching and dysesthesia localized to the upper back, specifically the lower scapular region. The pruritus is often persistent and can be accompanied by pain, burning, or tingling sensations. This condition primarily affects middle-aged individuals and is usually unilateral, though bilateral cases can occur. The skin in the affected area may appear hyperpigmented due to chronic scratching, leading to secondary changes such as lichenification, excoriations, and rarely prurigo nodules. Despite the noticeable itching and post-inflammatory pigmentary changes, primary skin lesions are absent, distinguishing NP from other dermatologic conditions. The underlying cause is thought to be related to nerve entrapment or irritation, leading to sensory changes in the affected dermatome.

The etiology of NP is primarily linked to nerve impingement or damage to the nerves innervating the skin overlying the upper back. This condition often arises from degenerative changes or trauma to the spine, such as osteoarthritis, scoliosis, motor vehicle accidents, or spinal stenosis. Factors contributing to nerve compression include age-related or occupational-related spinal degeneration, poor posture, and repetitive mechanical stress on the spine. Although less common, NP has been suggested to be associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Additionally, some cases have been linked to herpes zoster and other viral infections that affect the nerves. Interestingly, however, in NP there are no reports of generalization of itch.

A recent large comparative analysis of clinical characteristics in BRP and NP patients revealed that BRP patients experience longer daily itch durations and more generalized itching than NP patients. Although itch intensity was similar for both conditions, scratching was more pleasurable and provided more relief for NP patients. BRP patients, however, showed a higher prevalence of scratch lesions, itching worsened by scratching, and scratching without itch. Additionally, BRP had a more significant impact on sleep overall, with more severe impacts stratified by severity. These findings elucidate distinct clinical profiles for BRP and NP and suggest that BRP can be a more challenging condition to manage.

Another comparative retrospective study by Pereira et al. showed that BRP patients more frequently report multiple paraesthetic symptoms and exhibit decreased intraepidermal nerve fiber density in lesional skin, which is not observed in NP patients. Furthermore, BRP patients tend to have a higher prevalence of scratch lesions and report more significant impacts on sleep and quality of life compared with NP patients, corroborating the results of Lipman et al.

### Questionnaire-based epidemiological study of hidradenitis suppurativa in Japan revealing characteristics different from those in Western countries [^1162t6XA]. The Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 4
Association between PGA score and disease duration

Affected anatomical locations in Japanese HS patients are summarized in Table 5. Buttocks, axillae and groin were affected in 54.0%, 26.6% and 14.3%, respectively. The incidences of the lesions on the axillae, groin and buttock were 49 (22.4%), 19 (8.7%) and 162 (66.2%) of the 219 male patients, respectively, and 31 (38.3%), 24 (29.6%) and 17 (21.0%) of the 81 female patients, respectively. Interestingly, the presence or absence of lesions on the axillae, groin or buttocks was associated with sex (P < 0.001, respectively; Table 5). The number of affected anatomical sites in each patient was also investigated based on the presence or absence of the lesion(s) on three anatomical sites: axillae, buttocks and groin (Table 6). The majority of the patients (188/300; 62.7%) had only one affected anatomical site. Patients suffering from lesions in two and three anatomical sites were 29 (9.7%) and 12 (4.0%) of the 300 patients, respectively. There was no relationship between the number of affected sites and sex (χ² = 2.367, P = 0.102). Then, we examined whether there were any associations between the disease severity and affected region(s). Patients with lesion(s) in the axilla(e) had higher PGA scores (χ² = 8.6378, P = 0.03452; Table 7). There were no significant differences for lesions on the buttocks (χ² = 2.9012, P = 0.4071; data not shown) and groin (χ² = 0.60793, P = 0.8946; data not shown).

### Peripheral and central mechanisms of itch [^113pyyNn]. Neuron (2018). Low credibility.

Itch is a unique sensory experience that is encoded by genetically distinguishable neurons both in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) to elicit a characteristic behavioral response (scratching). Itch interacts with the other sensory modalities at multiple locations, from its initiation in a particular dermatome to its transmission to the brain where it is finally perceived. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the molecular and neural mechanisms of itch by starting in the periphery, where itch is initiated, and discussing the circuits involved in itch processing in the CNS.

### Interferon β-1b (Betaseron) [^115KPgu3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Step 4: Choosing an Injection Site

BETASERON (interferon beta-1b) is injected under the skin and into the fat layer between the skin and the muscles (subcutaneous tissue). The best areas for injection are where the skin is loose and soft and away from the joints, nerves, and bones. Do not use the area near your navel or waistline. If you are very thin, use only the thigh or outer surface of the arm for injection.
Choose a different site each time you give yourself an injection. Figure J shows different areas for giving injections. Do not inject in the same area for 2 injections in a row. Keep a record of your injections to help make sure you change (rotate) your injection sites. You should decide where you will inject BETASERON before you prepare your medicine for injection. If there are any sites that are difficult for you to reach, you can ask someone who has been trained to give the injection to help you.

Do not inject BETASERON in a site where the skin is red, bruised, infected, or scabbed, has broken open, or has lumps, bumps, or pain. Tell your healthcare provider if you find skin conditions like the ones mentioned here or any other unusual-looking areas where you have been given injections.

### Prurigo chronica multiformis: expert consensus of the Japanese Dermatological Association [^112JMRYh]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Prurigo chronica multiformis is a commonly used diagnostic designation for a peculiar subtype of prurigo in Japan, although the disease entity might not be well-recognized in other countries. Experts approved by the Japanese Dermatological Association attempted to build a common consensus on prurigo chronica multiformis, agreeing that it is a unique and important disease entity in elderly patients. Skin lesions are characterized by intensely pruritic, edematous, urticarial papules, or small macules, which gradually become solid papules/small nodules. The papules tend to aggregate and occasionally coalesce into polygonal lichenified plaques. The most commonly affected sites are the lower abdomen and lower back, although the chest, thighs, and upper back might also be involved. Common histopathological features of prurigo chronica multiformis include infiltration of lymphocytes and eosinophils in the upper dermis, with minimal epidermal changes. Basophil infiltration is also observed. The epidemiological incidence, differences in clinical manifestations by geographical location, and disease placement among other forms of prurigo and/or related skin diseases need to be further elucidated. Dermatologists should be aware of the clinical characteristics of prurigo chronica multiformis.

### Clinical and pathological spectrum of prurigo pigmentosa in central European individuals [^114YJp9u]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Based on early studies, prurigo pigmentosa (PP) was considered a rare inflammatory dermatosis affecting primarily Asian individuals. However, several case reports subsequently showed that the disease is not restricted to those of Asian origin. Large studies on PP in central European individuals, on the other hand, are missing.

Objective

To increase awareness of PP by describing the clinical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical features in central European individuals.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This observational, retrospective case series analyzed clinicopathological features of 20 central European patients diagnosed with PP. Data collection was performed by means of archive material, including physician's letters, clinical photographs, and histopathological records, at the Department of Dermatology at the Medical University of Graz in Austria from January 1998 to January 2022.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Demographic, clinical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical characteristics for patients diagnosed with PP were recorded.

Results

Of the 20 patients included, 15 (75%) were female, and the mean (range) age was 24.1 (15–51) years. The study cohort consisted entirely of European patients. The most common site of involvement of PP was the breast, followed by the neck and back. Other involved clinical sites were the abdomen, shoulders, face, head, axillae, arms, and genital region and groin. Clinically, lesions were characterized by a symmetric pattern in 90% (n = 18) of all cases. Marked hyperpigmentation was observed only in 25% (n = 5) of patients. In some cases, triggers such as malnutrition, long-term pressure, and friction were noted. Histologic findings revealed presence of neutrophils in all cases and necrotic keratinocytes in 67% (n = 16) of cases. Immunohistochemistry results showed predominance of CD8+ lymphocytes in the epidermis, as well as the presence of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen-positive neutrophil precursors.

Conclusions and Relevance

This case series found that most clinical features observed in Asian patients were also observed in central European patients, but hyperpigmentation was primarily mild to moderate. Histopathological features were similar to those reported in the literature with the additional presence of myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen-positive precursor neutrophils. These results expand previous knowledge about PP in central European individuals.

### The rash that presents as a vesiculobullous eruption [^114qTLAM]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Various infections and autoimmune and reactive skin conditions can present with blisters of varying sizes. Some of these disorders are seen in everyday practice, whereas others are rarely encountered. In many cases, the clinical picture is so typical that the diagnosis is easy and obvious; nevertheless, the significant clinical overlap between many of these diseases can cause frustration in both unexperienced and expert clinicians. We present the most typical clinical clues and offer simplified algorithms to the clinical diagnosis of skin conditions with vesicles and bullae. We focus on several aspects, when assessing a patient with blisters on the skin: age of onset, a history of comorbidities and medications intake, the general condition of the patient, and most importantly, the distribution, number, size, morphology, and evolution of the blisters, the characteristics of the peribullous skin, and the presence of mucosal involvement. Emphasis is put on differentiating between potentially life-threatening blistering eruptions and more benign self-limiting conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

### Female genital itch [^117Rd2Fe]. Dermatologic Clinics (2018). Low credibility.

Vulvar pruritus is a common complaint among young girls and women presenting to primary care physicians, gynecologists, and dermatologists. Female genital itch is especially disruptive because of its interference with sexual function and intimacy. Causes of vulvar itch are vast and may be inflammatory, environmental, neoplastic, or infectious, often with several causes coexisting simultaneously. Diagnosis may be difficult because of the unique anatomy and inherent properties of genital and perianal skin. Treatment is aimed at eliminating outside irritants, restoring epidermal barrier function, and suppressing inflammation.

### Classic findings, mimickers, and distinguishing features in primary blistering skin disease [^114KBQib]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Context —

Blistering diseases comprise a large group of clinically polymorphic and sometimes devastating diseases. During the past few decades, we have developed an elegant understanding of the broad variety of blistering diseases and the specific histopathologic mechanism of each.

Objective —

To review examples of the classic findings of specific blistering diseases and emphasize the importance of considering unrelated conditions that can mimic the classic finding.

Data Sources —

This article combines data from expert review, the medical literature, and dermatology and pathology texts.

Conclusions —

We have chosen several common examples of classic blistering diseases that are mimicked by other cutaneous conditions to highlight the basic findings in blistering conditions and the importance of clinician-to-pathologist communication.

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^1133uHFx]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Infectious Causes

Vulvovaginal itching of acute onset is frequently attributed to infection with fungal, bacterial, or parasitic species. VVC results from an overgrowth of Candida species, predominantly Candida albicans, due to disruptions in the normal vaginal flora. The release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines stimulate nerve endings in the vaginal area, resulting in pruritus, edema, and erythema of the region. VVC is not typically acquired through contagion but rather from alterations in the environment that are favorable for fungal species, such as obliteration of the healthy vaginal microbiome defenses, moisture trapping in the inguinal region, and elevated skin surface pH, and states with lower immunological defenses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or higher glucose availability seen in pregnancy and diabetes. Yosipovitch et al. found that the skin surface pH in intertriginous areas, such as the inguinal region, is significantly higher in diabetic patients compared with healthy individuals, which may promote susceptibility to candidal infections. This elevated pH can create an environment conducive to Candida overgrowth and infection. Tinea cruris affects the inguinal creases and labia majora, presenting with a visible rash, unlike the discharge characteristic of candidiasis.

In bacterial vaginosis (BV), an imbalance in the vaginal microbiota, results in the elevated pH that is more favorable for pathogenic, anaerobic bacteria such as Gardnerella vaginalis, than protective bacteria, such as Lactobacilli. While BV does not typically cause inflammation, it can lead to discomfort and itching if it progresses to anaerobic vaginitis. The imbalance in the vaginal microbiome of patients with BV increases susceptibility to opportunistic or sexually transmitted infections. It can also contribute to itch by activating keratinocytes and peripheral nerve fibers, thus stimulating the release of alarmins and histamine. However, itch is not a sensitive or specific sign of bacterial vaginosis.

Group A β-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) infections, more common in prepubertal females, and other bacterial infections such as those caused by Staphylococcus aureus can also cause vulvovaginal symptoms, but often affect the vulvar skin. Parasitic infections such as trichomoniasis, pediculosis pubis (pubic lice), Enterobius vermicularis (pinworms), and scabies can cause genital itching. Viral infections such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), human papillomavirus (HPV), and molluscum contagiosum may also present with vaginal itch.

### Contact dermatitis: a practice parameter-update 2015 [^111L8kB2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) — distinguishing features are outlined across common conditions: Irritant contact dermatitis shows that healing begins promptly on withdrawal of the offending agent and patch testing negative. Atopic dermatitis features a personal or family history of atopy with flexural areas in adolescence and adults. Seborrheic dermatitis involves distribution in areas with sebaceous glands and a distinctive morphology of dull, yellowish-red, sharply demarcated lesions covered with greasy-looking scales. Dyshidrotic eczema presents with small (1–2 mm) vesicles on a nonerythematous base affecting palms/soles/fingers, and it persists for 2–3 weeks before resolving. These differentiating findings help separate these entities from ACD.

### Granular parakeratosis: four paediatric cases [^114YvdcL]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Axillary granular parakeratosis (GP) was first described in 1991 as a peculiar eruption presenting with erythematous hyperpigmented and hyperkeratotic papules and plaques of the cutaneous folds frequently associated with pruritus. Histopathology shows a characteristic picture with a conspicuous granular appearance of the parakeratotic horny layer. Until now, only 24 adults, mainly women aged over 40 years, have been reported with GP. We demonstrate that this condition can also occur in young children. Four children aged between 10 and 24 months had asymptomatic hyperpigmented scaling papules 2–3 mm in diameter located on the groin, lower back, buttocks and flanks. In all cases the mothers reported the habit of frequent washing followed by application of many topical products. Biopsy revealed the same features in all four patients: the epidermis showed a thickened horny layer with a unique compact parakeratosis with maintenance of the stratum granulosum and marked retention of keratohyaline granules throughout the stratum corneum.

### Psychogenic itch [^114cqAwM]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis

In some patients, authentic somatic pruritus can be associated with psychogenic pruritus or can be aggravated by psychological factors that cannot be identified upon initial visit. All causes of pruritusare differential diagnoses; this is especially true of non-dermatological itches because in many cases, there are no visible lesions other than those caused by scratching. The aggravation of unpleasant sensations in the evening and the night is common to all etiologies of itch and could be confused with psychogenic itch. Atypical manifestations of itch, especially associations with other symptoms, such as pain, allodynia, paresthesias, hyperesthesia, or hypoesthesia, and/or electric shock sensations, are too often mistaken for manifestations of psychogenic itch, whereas they are actually indicative of neuropathic itch. This is especially true of recently described and poorly known diseases, such as small-fiber neuropathies. In any case, an examination to identify a somatic cause of pruritus is compulsory. Other differential diagnoses of psychogenic pruritus are psychogenic urticaria and psychogenic dermographism, but visible urticarial lesions are observed in patients with those diagnoses.

The main differential diagnosis is discussed in patients who scratch themselves in the absence of itch, those for whom itch is not the main cause of the scratching, and those whose scratching is disproportionate to the intensity of the itch. In these cases, the central symptom is not itch but scratching, and we are in the field of self-inflicted skin lesions (SISL). It is of particular interest to separate psychogenic excoriations, dermatitis artefacta, and all other SISLsfrom psychogenic pruritus. SISLs are related to impulsive, compulsive, or other psychopathological mechanisms. In contrast, psychogenic pruritus is related to an illusion of pruritus, but this pruritus is felt by the patient and is the main complaint. Skin excoriations can be performed by other people, especially the parents in cases of children; we must keep in mind that skin excoriations are sometimes not self-inflicted and can be abusive, such as in Silvermann or Munchausen by proxy syndromes.

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^117RdwSi]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1.3 Anogenital pruritus

Anogenital pruritus is defined as itch localized to the anal, perianal, or genital skin. This type of itch is four times more prevalent in middle‐aged men than women. The underlying causes for anogenital pruritus remain largely unclear; however, degenerative changes to the lower spine (between L4 and S2) resulting in compression of a nerve or nerve root may contribute to its development. Additionally, postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy have been identified as potential causative factors for anogenital pruritus.

7.1.4 Scalp pruritus

Scalp pruritus is thought to primarily arise from aberrant function of the trigeminal nerves. There is evidence to suggest that the skin microbiome play a role in exacerbating itch. A similar condition is also referred to as scalp dysesthesia (burning scalp syndrome), which presents burning and tingling and sometimes an itching sensation. The question of whether scalp pruritus and scalp dysesthesia are on the same spectrum remains unanswered.

7.1.5 Postherpetic pruritus

Postherpetic pruritus (postherpetic itch) is a neuropathic itch localized on the area(s) previously affected by herpes zoster. The itch is more prevalent on the head, neck, and face (regions innervated by the trigeminal nerve), followed by the trunk. The causes include a reduction in intraepidermal nerve fiber densities representing small fiber neuropathy. Of note, postherpetic pruritus not only causes itch itself but also itch sensitization phenomena (increased sensitivity to touch‐evoked itch [punctate hyperknesis]). This itch and punctate hyperkenesis improved, accompanied by restored intraepidermal nerve fiber densities in the affected area.

### Psychogenic itch [^113VhtHB]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Psychogenic itch can be defined as "an itch disorder where itch is at the center of the symptomatology and where psychological factors play an evident role in the triggering, intensity, aggravation, or persistence of the pruritus". The disorder is poorly known by both psychiatrists and dermatologists and this review summarizes data on psychogenic itch. Because differential diagnosis is difficult, the frequency is poorly known. The burden is huge for people suffering from this disorder but a management associating psychological and pharmacological approach could be very helpful. Classification, psychopathology, and physiopathology are still debating. New data from brain imaging could be very helpful. Psychological factors are known to modulate itch in all patients, but there is a specific diagnosis of psychogenic itch that must be proposed cautiously. Neurophysiological and psychological theories are not mutually exclusive and can be used to better understand this disorder. Itch can be mentally induced. Opioids and other neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine and dopamine, are probably involved in this phenomenon.

Itch and pruritus are two terms for the same thing. In this essay I will argue that casting about for a distinction between them creates only confusion. Once that matter is settled, it is still necessary to come up with a clinical classification for itches of different types.

### Localized genital blisters in an elderly male [^115Y2pbv]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Bullous impetigo – Incorrect. Classic honey-golden crusted lesions with systemic symptoms like fever and lethargy expected in bullous impetigo were not observed here, making this less likely. Furthermore, little relief with amoxicillin was noted.
B. Bullous pemphigoid (BP) – Correct. Localized genital bullous pemphigoid is a rare clinical variant of BP. It tends to affect children or females with only a handful of reports in elderly males. Clinically, vesicles and bulla with superficial erosions are such characteristics. Typical urticated plaques and erythema were less evident in this case since they appeared on thickened and hyperpigmented scrotal skin.
C. Bullous tinea cruris – Incorrect. The lack of an annular erythematous plaque with an inflammatory border and the sparing of skin folds makes fungal infection less likely. Fungal smears returned negative in this case.
D. Dermatitis herpetiformis – Incorrect. Typically appearing as symmetrical vesicles and blisters on the elbows, sacrum and buttocks, dermatitis herpetiformis is a subepidermal immunobullous disorder that can be associated with underlying celiac disease. While sacral lesions are typical, the presence of scrotal blisters, advanced age at diagnosis, male gender and the lack of reported gastrointestinal sensitivity to gluten makes this diagnosis less likely.
E. Varicella zoster infection – Incorrect. While crops of vesicles may mimic localized genital bullous pemphigoid, multidermatomal varicella zoster virus crossing the midline and localized to the groin in this pattern is highly unusual. Neuropathic symptoms like tingling or pain (not observed in our patient) would also feature prominently. Varicella zoster virus and herpes simplex DNA polymerase chain reaction returned negative in this case.

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^116AdepM]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute pruritus frequently arises from infectious causes, which should be strongly considered in the initial differential diagnosis. Common infectious causes that do not cause lesions and can be evaluated quickly are vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), bacterial vaginosis (BV), trichomoniasis (TV), chlamydia, and gonorrhea. Parasitic infestations such as public lice and pinworms should also be readily considered in patients with excoriations but no other visual lesions, particularly in children and sexually active individuals, especially those with risk factors such as contact with infected individuals or children with frequent exposure to other children. If there is suspicion for STI, HIV status should be evaluated, as affected individuals are prone to more severe or recurrent infection. If lesions are present, their appearance and associated symptoms should guide the differential diagnosis. Herpetic lesions, condylomas, molluscum contagiosum, scabies, and syphilis primary lesions all have distinctive appearances and can be confirmed with laboratory testing or biopsies.

Inflammatory dermatological conditions such as psoriasis, AD, lichen planus (LP), and contact dermatitis, frequently cause vaginal pruritus and should be on the differential for acute and chronic vulvovaginal itching due to their intermittent and relapsing and remitting nature. Psoriasis is a chronic cause of itch accompanying well-demarcated, erythematous red plaques limited to the labia majora often misdiagnosed as candida. In AD, the presence of poorly defined erythematous plaques, excoriations, and a history of itching and scratching are key diagnostic clues. LP results in erosive lesions and scarring of the vulva, and there is often extragenital involvement. Irritant contact dermatitis causes rapid onset burning sensations with localized vesicular plaques or scaly patches. For allergic contact dermatitis, intermittent symptoms and a lack of response to standard treatments may raise suspicion for an underlying allergen, warranting further evaluation such as a patch test.

### A new era for understanding and managing common pruritic skin conditions: how to define, diagnose, and treat? [^1142Jb3s]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The treatment of inflammatory skin diseases is entering a new era. The advent of biologics and small‐molecule agents has facilitated the therapy of some of the previously difficult‐to‐treat skin conditions. However, there are still several pruritic skin conditions that many dermatologists find difficult to manage. Understanding the precise clinical features and actual pathological mechanisms of these diseases is essential for the development and appropriate use of new therapies. This special issue of the Journal of Dermatology focuses on three common pruritic skin diseases.

Eczema is the most common and well‐known pruritic disease in dermatology. However, how many dermatologists fully understand the exact nature of eczema and its characteristics? In this special issue, Tokura et al. discuss the nature of eczema. They explain the etymology and classic concept of eczema, including the 'eczema triangle'. They also discuss the pathological mechanisms of eczema based on the current understanding of cutaneous immunology.

While we have recently gained powerful therapeutic tools for treating chronic inflammatory skin conditions, such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, erythroderma in the elderly remains difficult to treat. In general, the diagnosis of erythroderma is relatively straightforward. Nevertheless, despite careful examinations, it is often difficult to determine the actual cause of the disease. Yamamoto explains the concept, clinical characteristics, and pathogenesis of erythroderma in the elderly, and the difference between elderly erythroderma and elderly atopic dermatitis.

Research into itching has lagged far behind that into pain, and, for a long time, antihistamines have dominated the treatment of itching associated with skin diseases. However, recent advances in the study of itch have provided us with a wealth of knowledge about nonhistaminergic itch. In this issue, Hashimoto et al. describe the latest findings on the pathophysiology of itch. They also explain the mechanisms of generalized and localized pruritus without rash and how we can manage these conditions.

The review articles in this issue will undoubtfully help dermatologists to better understand, diagnose, and manage these common pruritic skin conditions.

### Notes from the field: trichophyton mentagrophytes genotype VII-new york city, April-July 2024 [^1176gW4N]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Trichophyton mentagrophytes genotype VII (TMVII) is an emerging dermatophyte fungus, causing tinea that can be spread through sexual contact. TMVII can cause pruritic, annular, scaly lesions on the trunk, groin, genitals, or face; might be mistaken for eczema, psoriasis, or other dermatologic conditions; and frequently requires oral antifungal therapy. † Some patients experience inflamed, painful, and persistent lesions that can lead to scarring or secondary bacterial infection. TMVII infections have been reported among men who have sex with men in France since March 2021 and previously in men who traveled to Southeast Asia for sex tourism. In June 2024, a TMVII case in the United States was reported in a man who developed genital lesions after traveling to several countries in Europe and to California and who had sexual contact with multiple men while traveling. Clinicians subsequently alerted public health officials of additional patients in the United States who had laboratory-confirmed TMVII infection.

### Pityriasis rosea and pityriasis rosea-like eruptions: how to distinguish them? [^113dD2RZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

To the Editor: We appreciate the article from Bitar et alon ibrutinib-associated pityriasis rosea (PR)-like rash that allows us to share our experience and make some observations. Recently, we proposed criteria to distinguish PR from PR-like eruptions (Table I). In fact, distinguishing them is of paramount importance, as a typical PR may develop during but independently from a therapy. During PR, a self-limiting exanthematous disease associated with the endogenous systemic reactivation of human herpes virus (HHV)-6 and/or HHV-7, the drug (if indispensable for the health of the patient and except for immunosuppressive therapies that can favor viral reactivation) may be cautiously continued. When the skin rash is diagnosed as a drug reaction with morphological features similar to genuine PR (a PR-like eruption), it is preferable to stop the drug immediately to prevent more dangerous drug reactions. Indeed, the interesting case described by Bitar et alhas some of the characteristics of PR-like eruptions such as the presence of itch on the lesions, the dusky-red color of the lesions, and the superficial and perivascular eosinophil infiltration in the dermis. However, it is uncommon after several months to have resolution of the eruption without interruption of the drug. In fact, this course of the disease is more typical for PR. Unfortunately, the authors have not investigated potential signs of HHV-6 and HHV-7 reactivation such as detection of HHV 6/7 DNA in plasma and detection of positive IgM antibodies against HHV-6/7 in serum. In addition, they did not refer to peripheral eosinophilia that may be a marker for adverse cutaneous drug reactions. These data would have been useful to better define the diagnosis: in presence of HHV-6 or HHV-7 reactivation addressing toward PR and, conversely, in presence of peripheral blood eosinophilia toward PR-like eruption caused by ibrutinib.

Differential diagnoses

The diagnosis of clinical or suspected scabies (levels B or C) requires that conditions other than scabies are considered less likely. Given the nonspecific nature of itch and the morphologically varied lesions of scabies, there are numerous differential diagnoses. A comprehensive list, including common and rare conditions, is shown in Table 4, and further detail is given in Appendix S7 (see Supporting Information). The ability to recognize these conditions will depend on the expertise of the examiner. Dermoscopy may also be useful for differentiating causes.

### Psychogenic itch [^117LnLkn]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Psychogenic itch is a diagnosis that is (too) frequently proposed by physicians, but patients diagnosed with psychogenic itch are (too) rarely referred to psychiatrists. Only 62 references containing the key word "psychogenic itch" could be obtained from PubMed in July 2017. Psychogenic itch is also known as psychogenic pruritus, somatoform pruritus, functional itch disorder, or functional pruritus, but "psychogenic itch" is the most commonly used denomination.

In this review, data on itch will be first provided. Then epidemiology and definition, as well as differential diagnosis and inclusion in classifications will be discussed. Physiopathological and psychopathological points of view will be debated. Finally, the consequences of psychogenic itch and its management will be exposed.

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^114ve1P5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory Causes

Vaginal itching can often arise from inflammatory dermatological conditions, with atopic dermatitis (AD) and irritant and allergic contact dermatitis among the most common causes of vulvar itch. AD affecting the vulva, also known as vulvar eczema, is a genetic disorder that compromises the skin barrier and causes itching with resulting rash formation. Contact dermatitis results from external irritants or allergens. Common irritants and allergens include feminine hygiene products, a warm and moist environment, fragrances, preservatives, and topical treatments that trigger allergic reactions.

Other inflammatory causes include genital psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus (LSC), lichen sclerosus (LS), and lichen planus (LP). In genital psoriasis, immune-mediated inflammation leads to the overproduction of skin cells, causing scaling, redness, and itching. LSC is an eczematic disorder where an underlying skin condition or systemic disease leads to an intense, prolonged itch–scratch cycle and ultimate thickening of the skin. The typical LS lesions are hypopigmented, pruritic areas surrounding the vaginal introitus and anus. LP is a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the skin and mucosal surfaces and can lead to itching, scarring, and atrophy of the vulvar skin. Though less common, seborrheic dermatitis, plasma cell vulvitis, and Fox–Fordyce disease can also cause vulvar itching. Seborrheic dermatitis affects sebum-rich areas and can cause erythematous plaques on the vulva with severe pruritus. Plasma cell vulvitis is a rare condition associated with plasma cell plaques primarily within the vulvar vestibule. Fox–Fordyce disease involves blocked apocrine sweat ducts and consequent inflammation of glands that can affect the vulvar skin.

H2. Contact history

Scabies is transmitted by skin‐to‐skin contact. 20 Transmission via fomites such as clothing or bedding is rare for common scabies, but may occur with crusted scabies. 62 The risk of transmission for common scabies is related to the frequency, duration and surface area of skin contact, 63 and therefore is highest among people sharing the same bed and between young children and those who carry them. The minimum duration of skin contact required to transmit mites has been estimated to be 20 min, 64, 65 but it remains largely unknown. In practice, a positive contact history may be defined as per the definitions in Table 3. 28, 66 Gathering a history of scabies in an individual's contacts may be aided by showing photos of typical scabies lesions (Figure 3).

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^117T8Nmw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Diagnosis

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a mainly clinical diagnosis that is made on the basis of occurrence of characteristic rashes in areas rich in sebaceous glands. In adolescents and adults, it commonly presents as a scaling rash of the scalp (Schwartz). The rash appears as areas of redness covered with greasy white or yellowish scales (Burton). "The scaling is often concurrent with an oily complexion" (Schwartz).

On the scalp, the rash spans the spectrum from mild dandruff to a more grievous oozy rash. On the face, it affects the eyebrows, the creases of the nose and the adjacent cheek, and occasionally the eyelids. Rashes are increasingly apparent when men grow moustaches or beards, and tend to disappear when facial hair is removed (Johnson). Rashes may occur behind the ears, in the cup of the ears and within the ear canal, and can occur as red patches on the front of the chest or between the shoulder blades (Johnson). In persons of colour, the rash sometimes appears as white, minimally scaly patches on the face, particularly around the eyebrows (Scheinfeld). Flexure areas such as between the breasts and in the armpits, groin, abdominal folds and nappy area in infants can also be affected. The rashes are often non-itching in infants (Schwartz) and tend to disappear spontaneously (Foley; Naldi).

Biopsies of affected skin may effectively distinguish seborrhoeic dermatitis from similar disorders. White blood cells (neutrophils) are characteristically found within the scale crusts (Schwartz).

Ringworm

Background

Ringworm or "tinea" is a type of skin infection caused by several different species of fungus. A ringworm infection can occur on the scalp (tinea capitis), the body (tinea corporis), the hands (tinea manuum), the feet (tinea pedis or "athlete's foot"), the nails (tinea unguium), the groin or inner thighs (tinea cruris of "jock itch"), and the beard area (tinea barbae). Typical symptoms include red, itchy skin, a ring-shaped rash, and hair loss.

Ringworm spreads by contact with personal items from someone whohas a ringworm infection, such as towels, clothing, or hair care items, or surfaces that are contaminated with the fungus. It also can spread by contact with an infected dog or cat.

Treatment for ringworm depends on where the infection is on the body. Over-the-counter topical medication can treat infections on the skin, but a prescription medication taken by mouth is used to treat infections on the scalp. There are rare reports of infections that are resistant to antifungal medicines.

Recommendations

Allow entry of individuals who have ringworm infection once they have begun treatment for the infection. A rash should not be not used as a reason for excluding someone who has begun treatment, as a ringworm rash may persist for several weeks.
Refer guests who develop a rash while staying at the facility for medical evaluation by their primary care physician or licensed clinician.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^112SfK1i]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) diagnosis — essential features must be present and include pruritus; eczema (acute, subacute, chronic) with typical morphology and age-specific patterns; and chronic or relapsing history, with patterns including facial, neck, and extensor involvement in infants and children, current or previous flexural lesions in any age group, and sparing of the groin and axillary regions. Important features seen in most cases, adding support to the diagnosis, include early age of onset, atopy with personal and/or family history or immunoglobulin E reactivity, and xerosis. Associated features help to suggest the diagnosis but are too nonspecific to be used for defining or detecting AD for research and epidemiologic studies, and include atypical vascular responses (facial pallor, white dermographism, delayed blanch response), keratosis pilaris/pityriasis alba/hyperlinear palms/ichthyosis, ocular/periorbital changes, other regional findings (perioral changes/periauricular lesions), and perifollicular accentuation/lichenification/prurigo lesions. Exclusionary conditions note that a diagnosis of AD depends on excluding scabies, seborrheic dermatitis, contact dermatitis (irritant or allergic), ichthyoses, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, psoriasis, photosensitivity dermatoses, immune deficiency diseases, and erythroderma of other causes.

TABLE 1
Demographic and behavioral characteristics.

Medical history, symptoms, and signs of the patients were shown in Table 2. Only 17 (9.6%) patients reported a history of smallpox vaccination, whereas no difference was observed between smallpox vaccination and clinical outcomes. Hundred and seven patients had at least one co‐morbid other sexually transmitted infection, the most common being syphilis, followed by gonorrhea. Fourteen patients had a self‐reported history of allergy, nine of whom were drug allergies. Skin rash was the most common symptom or sign (Figure 1A). There were 278 patients (97.2%) with a typical rash, and no significant difference was found between HIV‐negative and HIV‐positive patients. The most common sites of rash were groin/perineum/perianal, limbs, trunk, head/face/neck, palms, and soles in order, and the most common types of rash were vesicles or pustules, maculopapular rash, and ulcers in order. The majority of patients (45.0%) had < 5 lesions. In addition to the rash, the remaining commonly observed symptoms or signs were fever (70.0%), lymphadenopathy (45.4%), anal and perianal pain (17.8%), fatigue (17.3%), myalgia (15.6%), headache (13.6%), skin pruritus (11.3%), genital swelling/pain (9.7%), sore throat (9.1%), diarrhea (7.1%), nausea and vomiting (3.5%), cough (2.6%), night sweats (2.3%), mouth ulcers (1.9%), conjunctivitis (0.8%). The proportion of anal and perianal pain was significantly higher in HIV‐positive patients than in HIV‐negative patients (23.4% vs. 11.2%; OR = 2.42, 95% CI 1.21–4.85, χ² = 6.44, p = 0.011). Other symptoms or signs did not differ significantly. In addition, 53 (21.3%) patients reported complications, including anal and perianal lesions, perineal and genital infections, cellulitis, gastrointestinal obstruction, and esophagitis (Figure 1B). Skin sequelae occurred in only 2 (2.0%) patients.

### Widespread hyperpigmented rash present for 1 year [^112tv9eB]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 59-year-old woman with type II diabetes mellitus and obesity presented to the clinic for evaluation of a hyperpigmented rash located in her axillae, groin, buttock, umbilicus, and inframammary region (Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 3, Fig 4, Fig 5, Fig 6) of 1 years' duration. She reported pruritus and occasional fissuring after scratching. She was treated previously with nystatin powder, clotrimazole cream, and oral fluconazole for 4 weeks with minimal improvement.

Question 1: What is the diagnosis?
A. Mycosis fungoides
B. Inverse psoriasis
C. Dermatophytosis
D. Erythrasma
E. Candidiasis

Answers:
A. Mycosis fungoides – Incorrect. Mycosis fungoides classically appears as patches. It takes years to develop and most cases occur in whites (70%; Hispanics, 9%).
B. Inverse psoriasis – Incorrect. Inverse psoriasis presents with erythematous, shiny, moist plaques in intertriginous areas but with no scale.
C. Dermatophytosis – Incorrect. Dermatophytosis often occurs with onychomycosis; lack of response to antifungals makes this diagnosis less likely.
D. Erythrasma – Correct. Erythrasma presents with erythematous to tan, asymptomatic or pruritic scaly plaques in intertriginous areas and is caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum. Risk factors include obesity, poor hygiene, warm climate, and diabetes mellitus.
E. Candidiasis – Incorrect. Candidiasis has satellite papules and would have improved with antifungals.

### Symptoms of ringworm and fungal nail infections… [^1151Uv1D]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Ringworm can affect skin, hair, and nails.
- Skin infections cause itchy, ring-shaped rashes.
- Ringworm of the hair can cause hair loss.
- Nail infections can cause the nail to be thick, cracked, and discolored. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of ringworm can be a little different depending on the part of the body that is infected. Symptoms typically appear between 4 and 14 days after the skin comes in contact with the fungi that cause ringworm. Skin on most parts of the body Symptoms include a red, itchy ring-shaped rash that can:

- Have a clear or scaly area inside the ring.
- Have scattered bumps inside the ring that
- appear red on white skin.
- appear red-purple, brown, gray, or black on brown skin.
- appear red on white skin.
- Be slightly raised.
- Have overlapping rings.

Feet Symptoms include red, swollen, peeling, itchy skin between the toes that:

- Is most common in the pinky toe and the one next to it
- Can affect the sole and heel of the foot.
- Can cause blisters in severe cases. Groin Ringworm on the groin causes itchy, scaly, red spots. It is usually on the inner sides of the skin folds of the thigh. Scalp Ringworm on the scalp causes a scaly, itchy, circular, red bald spot. Without treatment the spot can grow larger and more can appear. Ringworm of the scalp is more common in children than it is in adults. Beard Symptoms of ringworm on the beard include:

- Scaly, itchy, red spots on the cheeks, chin, and upper neck
- Spots might become crusted over or filled with pus. Nail infections Nails: May affect up to 14% of the population. Finger and toe nails can be affected but toe nail infections are much more common.

People with toenail infections often have infections in the skin of their foot too. Nails can become:

- Discolored, thick, fragile, or cracked.
- Separated from the nail bed.

### The 2020 international alliance for the control of scabies consensus criteria for the diagnosis of scabies [^114BgHEt]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Levels B and C: clinical and suspected scabies

The diagnosis of clinical scabies (level B) or suspected scabies (level C) is reliant on clinical assessment, including features of the patient's history and skin examination. Where these features meet the criteria considered to be adequately specific for scabies, a diagnosis of clinical scabies can be made. Where these features are less specific, a diagnosis of suspected scabies can be made.

Patients should be examined with adequate lighting. Ideally, as much of the individual's body surface as possible should be examined. In infants, the entire body surface, including the head, may be involved. In immunocompetent adults, it is advisable to examine the scalp in those reporting scalp itch, even though scalp involvement is uncommon. In some circumstances it may not be appropriate to examine sensitive areas such as external genitalia and breasts due to issues of personal and cultural modesty. Where full examination is not feasible, for instance in field surveys, examination of all four limbs may suffice as a minimal level of exposure. 48 Arms should be examined from at least the mid‐upper arm to the fingertips, and legs should be examined from at least the mid‐thigh to toes. In such cases, the diagnostic assessment would not include subcategory B2 (male genital lesions). It would be expected that the vast majority of cases diagnosed by clinical assessment, especially in field survey settings, would be classified as subcategories B3 or C1 (typical features), with far fewer classified as B1 (burrows) or C2 (atypical features).

### A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of luliconazole cream 1% once daily for 7 days in patients aged ≥ 12 years with tinea cruris [^115seaoX]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Tinea cruris, a pruritic superficial fungal infection of the groin, is the second most common clinical presentation for dermatophytosis.

Objective

This phase 3 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of topical luliconazole cream 1% in patients with tinea cruris.

Methods

483 patients were enrolled and 256 male and female patients aged ≥ 12 years with clinically evident tinea cruris and eligible for modified intent-to-treat analysis were randomized 2:1 to receive luliconazole cream 1% (n = 165) or vehicle (n = 91) once daily for 7 days. Efficacy was evaluated at baseline and at days 7, 14, 21, and 28 based on mycology (potassium hydroxide, fungal culture) and clinical signs (erythema, scaling, pruritus). The primary outcome was complete clearance at day 28 (21 days posttreatment). Safety evaluations included adverse events and laboratory assessments.

Results

Complete clearance was obtained in 21.2% (35/165) of patients treated with luliconazole cream 1% compared with 4.4% (4/91) treated with vehicle (P < 0.001). The safety profile of luliconazole cream 1% was similar to vehicle.

Limitations

The study was conducted under controlled conditions in a relatively small population.

Conclusion

Luliconazole cream 1% applied once daily for 7 days is more effective than vehicle and well tolerated in patients with tinea cruris.

### Diaper dermatitis that does not quit [^117F8u9C]. Dermatologic Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis is one of the most common skin disorders in infants. The humid, moist environment under the diaper makes the skin more susceptible to injury from exposure to irritants particularly related to urine and feces. A gentle cleansing routine, frequent diaper changes, and a thick barrier cream help control this condition. Irritant diaper dermatitis should be distinguished from other skin conditions that may develop in this sensitive area.

### Interventions for hidradenitis suppurativa [^1116x5P1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterised by recurrent painful boils in flexural sites, such as the axillae and groin, that affects about 1% of the population, with onset in early adulthood.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for HS in people of all ages.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 13 August 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library (Issue 7, 2015), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched five trials registers and handsearched the conference proceedings of eight dermatology meetings. We checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of all interventions for hidradenitis suppurativa.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and methodological quality and performed data extraction. Our primary outcomes were quality of life, measured by a validated dermatology-specific scale, and adverse effects of the interventions.

Main Results

Twelve trials, with 615 participants, met our inclusion criteria. The median number of participants in each trial was 27, and median trial duration was 16 weeks. The included studies were conducted over a 32-year time period, from 1983 to 2015. A single RCT that was underpowered to detect clinically meaningful differences investigated most interventions. There were four trials of anti-TNF-α (tumour necrosis factor-alpha) therapies, which included etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab. Adalimumab 40 mg weekly improved the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score in participants with moderate to severe HS by 4.0 points relative to placebo (95% confidence interval (CI) -6.5 to -1.5 points), an effect size approximately equal to the DLQI minimal clinically important difference. We reduced the evidence quality to 'moderate' because the effect size was based on the results of only one study. In a meta-analysis of two studies with 124 participants, standard dose adalimumab 40 mg every other week was ineffective compared with placebo (moderate quality evidence). In a smaller study of 38 participants, of whom only 33 provided efficacy data, infliximab 5 mg/kg treatment improved DLQI by 8.4 DLQI points after eight weeks. Etanercept 50 mg twice weekly was well tolerated but ineffective. In a RCT of 200 participants, no difference was found in surgical complications (week one: risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.05, moderate quality evidence) or risk of recurrence (after three months: RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.34, moderate quality evidence) in those randomised to receive a gentamicin-collagen sponge prior to primary closure compared with primary closure alone.RCTs of other interventions, including topical clindamycin 1% solution; oral tetracycline; oral ethinylestradiol 50 mcg with either cyproterone acetate 50 mg or norgestrel 500 mcg; intense pulsed light; neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser; methylene blue gel photodynamic therapy; and staphage lysate, were relatively small studies, preventing firm conclusions due to imprecision.

Authors' Conclusions

Many knowledge gaps exist in RCT evidence for HS. Moderate quality evidence exists for adalimumab, which improves DLQI score when 40 mg is given weekly, twice the standard psoriasis dose. However, the 95% confidence interval includes an effect size of only 1.5 DLQI points, which may not be clinically relevant, and the safety profile of weekly dosing has not been fully established. Infliximab also improves quality of life, based on moderate quality evidence. More RCTs are needed in most areas of HS care, particularly oral treatments and the type and timing of surgical procedures. Outcomes should be validated, ideally, including a minimal clinically important difference for HS.

2.6 Alloknesis and hyperknesis

Patients with chronic itch often show sensitivity to itch stimuli. This itch sensitivity phenomenon can be classified into two categories: alloknesis and hyperknesis. Alloknesis is defined as considerable itch evoked by normal or nonpruritic stimuli, such as clothing. Hyperknesis is increased itch perceived in response to normal itch‐evoking stimuli.

### Stasis dermatitis: an overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^112UBeah]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Presentation

SD, as a cutaneous manifestation of chronic venous insufficiency caused by retrograde venous blood flow, is classified as C4 (changes in skin and subcutaneous tissue secondary to chronic venous disease) on the Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification of venous disorders. This is an internationally accepted standard for describing patients with chronic venous disorders based on the clinical manifestations, the current understanding of disease etiology, the involved anatomy, and the underlying venous pathology. The typical clinical presentation involves poorly demarcated erythematous and eczematous patches and plaques of the lower extremities, with the medial malleolus region being the most frequently and severely involved. The eczematous nature of SD is represented by scaling, erythema, and xerosis of the skin. These skin changes may extend to the foot as well as to the knee. Characteristic symptoms include pruritus (itch) on the medial ankle (which can extend to the shin), pain, lesional inflammation, scaling, and skin color changes and thickening. Itch is the most troublesome symptom, impacting patient quality of life (QOL) and leading to scratching that can aggravate wounds and increase risk of skin infection. Chronic scratching due to itching can also result in skin thickening and lichenification. Brown speckles (hyperpigmentation), the result of hemosiderin deposition, which is the byproduct of hemoglobin from extravasated erythrocytes, also represents a classic chronic sign (Fig. 1). SD may be associated with other typical presentations of chronic venous disease, including cramps, leg aching/pain, itching, swelling, and lipodermatosclerosis. Due to the disruption of the epidermal barrier, secondary infections may also occur, leading to superficial infections such as impetiginization, cellulitis, and erysipelas. Both cellulitis and erysipelas are skin infections caused by bacteria with the main difference being the depth of infection — erysipelas are more superficial, markedly affecting the face and lower limbs, while cellulitis reaches the deeper dermis and subcutaneous fat layers, markedly affecting the palm of the hands and the lower limbs. Importantly, if the underlying venous alterations remain untreated, the venous disease patient may develop chronic venous ulcerations along with oozing and erythema (Fig. 2). Patients with SD may also develop acroangiodermatitis (pseudo–Kaposi sarcoma), and a biopsy may be required to differentiate it from Kaposi sarcoma.

### The generalized rash: part II. diagnostic approach [^113F39rh]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Although it is important to begin the evaluation of generalized rash with an inclusive differential diagnosis, the possibilities must be narrowed down by taking a focused history and looking for key clinical features of the rash. Part I of this two-part article lists the common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rashes. In part II, the clinical features that help distinguish these rashes are described. These features include key elements of the history (e.g., travel, environmental exposures, personal or family history of atopy); characteristics of individual lesions, such as color, size, shape, and scale; areas of involvement and sparing, with particular attention to palms, soles, face, nails, sun-exposed areas, and extensor and flexor surfaces of extremities; pruritic or painful lesions; systemic symptoms, especially fever; and dermatologic signs, such as blanching, and the Koebner phenomenon.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^1136S5Qb]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis differential diagnosis and reassessment — AD should be differentiated from other red, scaly skin conditions, and it is often difficult to separate AD from seborrheic dermatitis in infancy, with overlap possible in this age group. AD usually spares the groin and axillary regions, while seborrheic dermatitis affects these areas and tends not to be pruritic. Particularly if not responding to therapy, the diagnosis of AD should be re-reviewed and other disorders considered, including more serious nutritional, metabolic, and immunologic conditions in children and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in adults. The original UK criteria cannot be applied to very young children, although revisions to include infants have since been proposed, and allergic contact dermatitis may be both an alternative diagnosis to AD and/or an exacerbator of AD in some individuals.
