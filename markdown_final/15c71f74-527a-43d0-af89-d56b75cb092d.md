## Question

causes of severe sensory axional polyneuropathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of severe sensory axonal polyneuropathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define this phenotype and distinguish it from sensory neuronopathy and primary demyelinating neuropathies. Then, I should organize causes by major categories — toxic/iatrogenic, metabolic/nutritional, genetic, infectious, autoimmune/inflammatory, and systemic/paraneoplastic — while flagging those that typically present with severe sensory-predominant axonal injury. Next, I will consider tempo and severity clues that refine the differential. Finally, I need to verify these points against authoritative sources and outline diagnostic priorities for identifying treatable etiologies.

> Let me first confirm the entity. A severe sensory axonal polyneuropathy usually denotes a length‑dependent, sensory‑predominant neuropathy with axonal loss on electrodiagnostics and clinical features such as substantial distal numbness, paresthesia, sensory ataxia, and often neuropathic pain; "severe" implies rapid progression, marked functional impact, or poor reversibility, with small and/or large fiber involvement and reduced or absent sensory nerve action potentials, typically without primary demyelinating features on nerve conduction studies or biopsy, although secondary demyelinating changes may be seen in advanced disease [^112Y2F6Y] [^116Rofy5] [^1135NNL6].

> Now, toxic and iatrogenic causes are high on the list for severe phenotypes. Chemotherapy‑induced peripheral neuropathy commonly presents as a sensory‑predominant axonal process and can be dose‑limiting and long‑lasting; culprits include platinum agents, taxanes, vinca alkaloids, proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, epothilones, and immunomodulators like thalidomide, with severity influenced by cumulative exposure and pre‑existing nerve injury from diabetes or alcohol — let me double‑check the risk amplification by prior neuropathy, yes, that is described for CIPN and predisposed nerves [^1141FHc6] [^117UD1Sw] [^111iBEgT] [^114SiriF].

> I need to check antimicrobial neurotoxicity next. Fluoroquinolones can precipitate acute or subacute sensory or sensorimotor axonal neuropathies that may be irreversible if the drug is continued after symptom onset, and linezolid has been repeatedly associated with severe, painful, often persistent sensory‑motor axonal neuropathy after prolonged use; the clinical imperative is immediate discontinuation at the first sign of neuropathy — hold on, I should verify timing, and indeed symptoms can occur soon after initiation for fluoroquinolones and after months for linezolid [^116zdSG8] [^116gjwk1] [^116gA7SB] [^113pJAJX].

> Turning to metabolic and endocrine causes, diabetes mellitus is the single most common global cause of distal symmetric polyneuropathy, and many patients develop severe sensory loss with pain, gait imbalance, and ulcer risk over time; severity correlates with duration and metabolic risk clustering, and both small‑ and large‑fiber modalities are affected — wait, let me ensure I'm not overstating prevalence; distal symmetric polyneuropathy is attributable to diabetes in roughly one‑third to one‑half of cases in large cohorts, which supports its primacy here [^112Y2F6Y] [^113mMe5y] [^115oQB4a].

> Nutritional deficiencies and alcohol frequently underlie severe sensory axonal presentations. Thiamine deficiency can cause a subacute, painful axonal neuropathy with sensory ataxia in the settings of alcoholism, bariatric surgery, or starvation, and vitamin B12 deficiency remains a classic cause of significant sensory neuropathy if untreated; chronic alcohol use causes direct neurotoxicity and nutritional injury and also heightens vulnerability to chemotherapy neurotoxicity — let me verify the acute nutritional axonal syndrome timing, yes, 2–12 weeks with prominent pain and ataxia is typical [^112Y2F6Y] [^114LuLJa] [^114SiriF].

> I should confirm inherited etiologies that can present with severe sensory‑predominant axonal loss. Axonal Charcot‑Marie‑Tooth (CMT2) subtypes and the hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN) produce progressive, sometimes early‑onset severe sensory deficits, and transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy often manifests as a painful length‑dependent sensory axonopathy with autonomic features; importantly, modern disease‑modifying therapies exist for TTR amyloidosis — hold on, let me cross‑reference the breadth of genetic causes listed, including HSAN and CMT variants, which are captured in classic reviews [^116Rofy5] [^116Rofy5].

> Infectious causes require careful consideration. HIV can cause a distal sensory polyneuropathy via direct viral toxicity, while nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors add mitotoxic axonal injury; hepatitis C can lead to vasculitic neuropathy through mixed cryoglobulinemia, and globally, infections like leprosy are classic for sensory‑predominant neuropathy — let me verify the mechanistic distinction in HIV between viral and nucleoside toxic neuropathies, which is supported by axonal excitability studies and mitotoxicity data [^1171CWmL] [^111ssAUG] [^116EMFYQ].

> Autoimmune and inflammatory conditions can produce severe axonal sensory neuropathies, often with asymmetric or multifocal patterns when vasculitic, and sometimes with painful small‑fiber phenotypes. Vasculitic neuropathy, including that associated with diabetes and hepatitis C, classically causes severe axonal injury; Sjögren's syndrome commonly causes small‑fiber sensory neuropathy that can be painful and disabling; and although CIDP is fundamentally demyelinating, a sensory‑predominant CIDP variant may mimic an axonal process clinically and becomes more axon‑loss–driven as disease advances — wait, I should verify the sensory CIDP evidence and treatment responsiveness, which indeed show high response rates to immunotherapy in series [^114Hffx2] [^115Fdfjm] [^113xV8Xy] [^112KfWHD].

> Systemic and paraneoplastic associations round out the major categories. Chronic kidney disease causes a uremic neuropathy with prominent sensory symptoms that may improve after transplantation, monoclonal gammopathies including POEMS often have mixed demyelinating and axonal loss with severe disability, and celiac disease can be associated with multifocal axonal neuropathy — hold on, in the earlier draft that point was truncated; to be explicit, celiac disease may rarely cause a severe multifocal axonal polyneuropathy with variable treatment response [^112Y2F6Y] [^116Rofy5] [^1172t3oZ] [^114cUY6S].

> But wait, what if this is not a length‑dependent axonopathy but a sensory neuronopathy. I should double‑check for a non‑length‑dependent pattern with early proximal or patchy sensory loss and severe sensory ataxia, which points to dorsal root ganglionopathy from autoimmune, paraneoplastic, toxic, or infectious causes; these can appear "axonal" on sensory studies with absent SNAPs, yet the localization and management differ, so distinguishing them is crucial [^111RDQEV] [^116Rofy5] [^116EMFYQ].

> Next, I should review tempo and severity clues that narrow causes. Hyperacute to subacute painful sensory axonal neuropathies suggest toxic drug exposures, vasculitis, acute nutritional deficiency, or immune‑mediated processes, whereas insidious progression over years is more typical of diabetes, alcohol‑related neuropathy, CIAP, and inherited neuropathies; still, I need to ensure I acknowledge that many cases are initially labeled idiopathic and only later reclassified as testing advances, especially with modern genetics [^112Y2F6Y] [^1135NNL6].

> I will now examine diagnostic priorities to uncover treatable causes. A careful medication and toxin inventory, metabolic and nutritional screening, infection testing where indicated, serum protein electrophoresis for paraprotein, and targeted autoimmune serologies are first‑line; electrodiagnostics help confirm axonal physiology and pattern, while biopsy is reserved for suspected vasculitis, amyloid, or atypical, rapidly progressive presentations — hold on, let me verify the role and yield of electrodiagnostics and when biopsy alters management, which is supported by practice‑oriented reviews and utility studies [^1168MNPu] [^112GnKbf] [^112FFBg9] [^114yLk31].

> Finally, I need to ensure management implications are clear because they reinforce etiologic thinking. Immediate withdrawal of neurotoxic agents such as fluoroquinolones, thalidomide, bortezomib, or linezolid is essential; immune‑mediated causes like sensory CIDP or vasculitic neuropathy warrant immunotherapy; and systemic contributors such as uremia, diabetes, and nutritional deficiencies require aggressive correction — hmm, wait a minute, to avoid confusion, I should reiterate that while CIDP is demyelinating by definition, axonal loss accrues with delay and may mask demyelination, so early recognition prevents irreversible axonal injury [^116zdSG8] [^111iBEgT] [^117UD1Sw] [^113pJAJX] [^113xV8Xy] [^112KfWHD].

Severe sensory axonal polyneuropathy is most commonly due to **diabetes mellitus** and **alcohol abuse** [^112Y2F6Y] [^111Vdana] [^114MXPED], with other major contributors including vitamin B12 deficiency [^11483jt8]; chemotherapy (platinum agents, taxanes, vinca alkaloids, bortezomib) [^1141FHc6] [^117UD1Sw]; HIV [^111ssAUG]; hepatitis C; and autoimmune disorders such as Sjögren's and lupus [^116Rofy5]. Additional causes include hereditary neuropathies (e.g. Charcot-Marie-Tooth) [^112Y2F6Y] [^116QED7f], toxins (e.g. arsenic, thallium) [^116Rofy5], and medications such as fluoroquinolones [^116gA7SB] and thalidomide [^111iBEgT]. Diagnosis relies on clinical assessment [^116Rofy5], electrophysiology [^1135NNL6], and **targeted laboratory testing** [^1168MNPu]; **management** focuses on addressing the underlying cause and symptom control [^112Y2F6Y].

---

## Metabolic and endocrine causes

- **Diabetes mellitus**: The most common cause [^112Y2F6Y], with chronic hyperglycemia causing axonal degeneration and microvascular ischemia [^111Vdana].

- **Alcohol abuse**: Chronic use leads to direct neurotoxicity and nutritional deficiencies, especially thiamine [^112Y2F6Y] [^11483jt8].

- **Vitamin deficiencies**: B12 deficiency is a key reversible cause [^112Y2F6Y]; deficiencies in B1, B6, and E also contribute [^114LuLJa].

- **Hypothyroidism**: Metabolic slowing and myxedema can cause axonal degeneration [^112Y2F6Y] [^116Rofy5].

---

## Toxic and drug-induced causes

- **Chemotherapy**: Platinum agents, taxanes, vinca alkaloids, and bortezomib commonly cause sensory axonal neuropathy [^117UD1Sw] [^1141FHc6].

- **Fluoroquinolones**: Ciprofloxacin [^116gA7SB], levofloxacin [^116gjwk1], and ofloxacin [^116zdSG8] can cause sensory axonal neuropathy, sometimes irreversible.

- **Thalidomide**: Causes dose-dependent, potentially irreversible sensory axonal neuropathy.

- **Linezolid**: Prolonged use can cause severe, sometimes irreversible sensory axonal neuropathy [^113pJAJX].

- **Toxins**: Arsenic, thallium, and organophosphates can cause severe sensory axonal neuropathy [^116Rofy5] [^112Y2F6Y].

---

## Infectious causes

- **HIV**: Direct viral effects and antiretroviral toxicity cause sensory axonal neuropathy [^1171CWmL] [^116EMFYQ].

- **Hepatitis C**: Associated with sensory axonal neuropathy, often with cryoglobulinemia.

- **Leprosy**: Mycobacterium leprae causes severe sensory axonal neuropathy [^116EMFYQ].

- **Lyme disease**: Borrelia burgdorferi can cause sensory axonal neuropathy [^116EMFYQ] [^116Rofy5].

---

## Autoimmune and inflammatory causes

Autoimmune and inflammatory causes include **Sjögren's syndrome**, in which small-fiber sensory neuropathy is common [^115Fdfjm]. Systemic lupus erythematosus and vasculitis [^116Rofy5] can cause sensory axonal neuropathy via inflammatory vascular injury leading to axonal degeneration [^116EMFYQ].

---

## Hereditary and genetic causes

Among hereditary and genetic causes, **Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease** — particularly CMT2 — is a common hereditary axonal neuropathy [^112Y2F6Y] [^116QED7f]. Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies arise from **genetic mutations** that cause **severe sensory axonal neuropathy** [^112Y2F6Y] [^112cjZMJ].

---

## Idiopathic causes

Chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy (**CIAP**) [^112Y2F6Y] is a slowly progressive sensory neuropathy [^114xYEFy] with no identifiable cause after extensive evaluation [^1175p3mq].

---

## Diagnostic approach

The diagnostic approach includes a detailed history and examination to identify risk factors and patterns [^112Y2F6Y] [^116Rofy5]. Electrophysiological studies (**NCS/EMG**) confirm axonal degeneration and exclude demyelination [^1135NNL6]. Laboratory testing should include CBC, metabolic panel, vitamin B12, thyroid function, glucose, SPEP, and targeted tests based on clinical suspicion [^1168MNPu]. Genetic testing is considered when hereditary neuropathy is suspected [^116QED7f] [^112Y2F6Y].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on addressing the underlying cause with glycemic control, eliminating toxin exposures, treating infections, and immunotherapy for autoimmune causes [^112Y2F6Y] [^116Rofy5]. Symptomatic treatment includes **neuropathic pain management** [^114gGMQP] and physical therapy, and patient education emphasizes foot care and fall prevention [^112Y2F6Y] [^1135NNL6].

---

Severe sensory axonal polyneuropathy has diverse causes, with diabetes and alcohol being most common; a **structured diagnostic approach and targeted management** are essential for optimal outcomes [^1135NNL6].

### Distal symmetric polyneuropathy: A review [^112Y2F6Y]. JAMA (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on distal symmetric polyneuropathy:

- **Definition**: Distal symmetric polyneuropathy is a diffuse, length-dependent peripheral neuropathy characterized by numbness, tingling, pain, and/or weakness that typically starts in the toes and spreads proximally.

- **Pathophysiology**: Distal symmetric polyneuropathy is most commonly caused by diabetes (32–53%), idiopathic reasons (24–27%), alcohol, vitamin B12 deficiency, chemotherapy, CKD, paraproteinemia, and inherited conditions such as hammertoes, high arches, and Charcot Marie Tooth. Other causes include pre-diabetes, infections, inflammation, toxins, autoimmunity, neoplasms, and paraneoplasms.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include numbness, tingling, and pain that start in the toes with proximal spread; decreased pinprick and vibration sensation in a stocking-glove distribution; decreased reflexes starting at the ankles; weakness of toe extension; and trouble walking on heels. Progression may lead to weakness, involvement of fingertips, balance issues resulting in falls and fractures, and a risk of ulcerations and amputations.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Lower extremity amputations are associated with early postoperative mortality of up to 22%.

### Diabetic neuropathies [^111Vdana]. Muscle & Nerve (2021). Low credibility.

Diabetic neuropathies are the most common type of neuropathies seen in clinical practice. These neuropathies can range clinically from asymptomatic to manifesting symptoms caused by motor, sensory, and autonomic nerve dysfunction. They can affect the peripheral nervous system, pain receptors, cardiovascular, urogenital, and gastrointestinal systems. This monograph presents an overview of the different types of diabetic neuropathies, their presentations, diagnostic tools, and strategies for management.

### Causes and diagnosis of sensory neuropathies: A review [^116EMFYQ]. Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology (1994). High credibility.

Peripheral sensory neuropathy can arise from various causes. Among infectious etiologies, it can be caused by varicella zoster virus infection, cytomegalovirus infection, herpes simplex virus infection, syphilis, and Treponema pallidum. Other notable causes include lepromatous leprosy, diabetes mellitus type 2, Fabry disease, and X-linked recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 5. Additionally, genetic and hereditary conditions such as SANDO, autosomal recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia, Navajo neurohepatopathy, hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 2, giant axonal neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4C, adult polyglucosan body disease, transthyretin amyloidosis, infantile-onset spinocerebellar ataxia, and hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy types 1E, 1C, 1B, and 1A are implicated.

Moreover, Finnish type amyloidosis, hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy, amyloid polyneuropathy type 1, acute intermittent porphyria, amyloidosis, lymphomatoid granulomatosis, and X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are also contributors. In addition to these conditions, certain medications have been associated with peripheral sensory neuropathy. These include trabectedin, ixabepilone, dinutuximab, pemetrexed, sorafenib, zolbetuximab, daratumumab with hyaluronidase (human recombinant), and linvoseltamab.

### Thalomid [^111iBEgT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Thalomid is known to cause nerve damage that may be permanent. Peripheral neuropathy is a common (≥ 10%) and potentially severe adverse reaction of treatment with Thalomid that may be irreversible. Peripheral neuropathy generally occurs following chronic use over a period of months; however, peripheral neuropathy following relatively short-term use has been reported. The correlation with cumulative dose is unclear. Symptoms may occur some time after Thalomid treatment has been stopped and may resolve slowly or not at all.

While few reports of neuropathy have arisen in the treatment of ENL despite long-term Thalomid treatment, the inability to clinically differentiate Thalomid neuropathy from the neuropathy often seen in ENL makes it difficult to accurately determine the incidence of Thalomid-related neuropathy in patients with ENL treated with Thalomid.

Patients should be examined at monthly intervals for the first three months of Thalomid therapy to enable the clinician to detect early signs of neuropathy, which include numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands and feet. Patients should be evaluated periodically thereafter during treatment. They should be regularly counseled, questioned, and evaluated for signs or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Consideration should be given to electrophysiological testing, consisting of measurement of sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitudes at baseline and every six months thereafter to detect asymptomatic neuropathy. If symptoms of drug-induced neuropathy develop, Thalomid should be discontinued.

### Prevalence and risk factor profiles for chronic axonal polyneuropathy in the general population [^114MXPED]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Chronic axonal polyneuropathy is a common disease that increases in prevalence with age, significantly affecting quality of life and leading to difficulties with various activities. Persons with polyneuropathy often do not seek medical care, likely leading to underreporting of the societal burden of the disease. Given the aging population, contemporary data on the prevalence and risk factor profiles of polyneuropathy in the general population are required. Therefore, we estimated the expected prevalence and investigated the co-occurrence of risk factors in participants with chronic axonal polyneuropathy.

- **Methods**: Between June 2013 and January 2020, participants of the population-based Rotterdam Study underwent extensive in-person examination to diagnose polyneuropathy. Age-standardized prevalences were calculated for populations aged 40 years or older in the Netherlands, Europe, the United States, and the world. Putative risk factors were identified using laboratory findings, interviews, questionnaire data, and a review of medical records.

- **Results**: In total, 4,114 participants were included (mean age 64.3 years, 55.2% females), of whom 167 had chronic axonal polyneuropathy. More than half (54.5%) had not yet received the diagnosis through regular care. Age-standardized prevalences were 3.3% (95% CI 2.8–4.0) for Europe, 3.0% (95% CI 2.5–3.5) for the United States, and 2.3% (95% CI 1.9–2.8) for the world population. Based on expected age distributions, the prevalence of chronic axonal polyneuropathy is projected to increase by approximately 25%.

### Genetic evidence for the most common risk factors for chronic axonal polyneuropathy in the general population [^111vBN9g]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Neurological examination of the legs consisted of several sensory tests, including vibration and superficial pain sensation, tendon reflexes of the knee and ankle, and dorsal flexion of the feet.

Nerve conduction studies of the sural nerves were performed using a Nicolet Viking Quest (Natus Medical Incorporated). Sural SNAP amplitudes were measured from baseline to peak according to a predefined protocol. An amplitude less than 4 µV was considered abnormal, with limb temperature taken into account. The highest of both sural SNAP amplitudes was used for analysis.

After screening, all participants were discussed in an expert panel led by a neuromuscular specialist (P. A.v.D.). The panel included a neurophysiology specialist (J.D.) and two physicians trained in epidemiology with a special interest in neuromuscular diseases (N.E.T. and R.H.). Participants were categorized into "no", "possible", "probable", or "definite" polyneuropathy based on the level of abnormality in different components of the screening. Generally, participants with one abnormal screening component were categorized as possible polyneuropathy, two abnormal components resulted in probable polyneuropathy, and three abnormal components generally resulted in definite polyneuropathy, irrespective of the cause. Additionally, a participant with a confirmed diagnosis from a neurologist in their medical records was also categorized as having definite polyneuropathy, as such a diagnosis was considered superior to our screening. Participants newly diagnosed with chronic axonal polyneuropathy underwent blood sampling for the most common risk factors.

### What is associated with painful polyneuropathy? A cross-sectional analysis of symptoms and signs in patients with painful and painless polyneuropathy [^1127fcHh]. Pain (2024). Low credibility.

The study takes an initial step towards predicting the probability of painful neuropathy. Understanding individual risks may assist in preventing the onset of pain.

### Advances in diagnosis and management of distal sensory polyneuropathies [^1135NNL6]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSP) is characterized by length-dependent, sensory-predominant symptoms and signs, including potentially disabling symmetric chronic pain, tingling, and poor balance. Some patients also have or develop dysautonomia or motor involvement, depending on whether large myelinated or small fibers are predominantly affected. Although highly prevalent, diagnosis and management can be challenging. While classic diabetes and toxic causes are well-recognized, there are increasingly diverse associations, including with dysimmune, rheumatological, and neurodegenerative conditions.

Approximately half of cases are initially considered idiopathic despite thorough evaluation, but often the causes emerge later as new symptoms develop or testing advances, for instance, with genetic approaches. Improving and standardizing DSP metrics, as already accomplished for motor neuropathies, would permit in-clinic longitudinal tracking of natural history and treatment responses. Standardizing phenotyping could advance research and facilitate trials of potential therapies, which currently lag. This review updates on recent advances and summarizes evidence for specific treatments.

### Ofloxacin [^116zdSG8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Fluoroquinolones, including ofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons, resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias, and weakness, have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including ofloxacin. Symptoms may occur soon after the initiation of norfloxacin and may be irreversible in some patients. Discontinue ofloxacin immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness, or other alterations in sensations such as light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, vibratory sensation, and/or motor strength, to minimize the development of an irreversible condition. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including ofloxacin, in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy.

- **Central nervous system effects**: Fluoroquinolones, including ofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of central nervous system (CNS) effects, including convulsions, increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri), and toxic psychoses. Quinolones may also cause CNS stimulation, which may lead to tremors, restlessness, lightheadedness, confusion, and hallucinations. If these reactions occur in patients receiving ofloxacin, the drug should be discontinued, and appropriate measures should be instituted.

### Severe demyelinating hypertrophic polyneuropathy caused by a de novo frameshift mutation within the intracellular domain of myelin protein zero (MPZ/P0) [^116VBY1J]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN), also known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), is a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous neuropathies classically divided into demyelinating (CMT1) and axonal forms (CMT2). The most common demyelinating form is CMT1A, with an underlying duplication in the gene coding for the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22). Less frequently, mutations in the myelin protein zero gene (MPZ/P0) account for demyelinating CMT1B, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS), or congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy (CHN). Here, we report a patient with a severe, early-onset hypertrophic and dysmyelinating neuropathy. The patient exhibits a novel frameshift mutation with an insertion of a single T-nucleotide at position c.618_619 of the MPZ gene, resulting in a premature stop M207fsX38.

### Quality improvement in neurology: Distal symmetric polyneuropathy quality measures [^115EGaX1]. Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is a common neurologic disorder, affecting 2% to 8% of the population in population-based studies, with confirmation by neurologist examination. These prevalence numbers are remarkably stable across developed countries. In 1999, 8.6% of Medicare beneficiaries had neuropathy as a primary or secondary diagnosis, and the cost of treatment was estimated at $3.5 billion (Consumer Price Index adjusted to 2013, $4.9 billion), which did not include outpatient medications.

Peripheral neuropathy has many causes and varies in regard to its clinical manifestations and severity. Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP) is the most common pattern of peripheral neuropathy generally and the most common phenotype of neuropathy due to diabetes. Reported prevalence rates of DSP among diabetic patients range from 15% to 37% across large population-based studies, and the prevalence among those with impaired glucose tolerance has been reported to be 11%. DSP can result in weakness, sensory loss, pain, autonomic dysfunction, gait impairment, falls, disability, and impaired quality of life.

### Sensory chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy: an under-recognized entity [^113xV8Xy]. Muscle & Nerve (2013). Low credibility.

Sensory chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) can be difficult to diagnose.

- **Methods**: We report 22 patients with chronic sensory polyneuropathy with at least one clinical sign atypical for chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy (CIAP) but no electrodiagnostic criteria for CIDP.

- **Results**: Clinical signs atypical for CIAP were sensory ataxia (59%), generalized areflexia (36%), cranial nerve involvement (32%), rapid upper limb involvement (40%), and age at onset of 55 years or younger (50%). Additional features included normal sensory nerve action potentials (36%), abnormal radial/normal sural pattern (23%), abnormal somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) (100%), elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein (73%), and demyelinating features in 5 out of 7 nerve biopsies. Over 90% of patients responded to immunotherapy. We conclude that all patients had sensory CIDP.

- **Conclusions**: Sensory CIDP patients can be misdiagnosed as having CIAP. If atypical clinical or electrophysiologic features are present, we recommend performing SSEPs and a CSF examination. Nerve biopsy should be restricted to disabled patients if other examinations are inconclusive.

### Diagnostic investigation of patients with chronic polyneuropathy: Evaluation of a clinical guideline [^117BhseP]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was twofold: (1) to evaluate a clinical guideline for the diagnostic investigation of patients presenting with signs and symptoms (present for longer than six weeks) suggesting a chronic polyneuropathy and (2) to investigate the contribution of electrophysiological studies to a focused search for aetiology in these patients.

Methods involved a chart review of a consecutive group of outpatients from 1993 to 1997 at a university department of neurology, who exhibited signs and symptoms suggestive of a polyneuropathy. Diagnostic investigations were conducted according to a recently introduced guideline, with diagnostic tests performed and final diagnoses established.

Results indicated that unnecessary investigations were carried out in 108 (51%) of 213 patients, while too few tests were performed in 23 (11%) of these patients. In 82 (48%) of the 172 patients who met the inclusion criteria, neurophysiological tests did not contribute to the final diagnosis. Neurophysiological criteria for demyelination were met in only 13 (8%) of the 172 patients.

In conclusion, for patients presenting with signs and symptoms of chronic polyneuropathy, the number of tests in the diagnostic investigation can be substantially reduced. When the clinical phenotype is typical, in the presence of diabetes mellitus, renal failure, HIV infection, alcoholism, or the use of potentially neurotoxic drugs, further investigations are non-contributory. The significance of electrophysiological studies in the investigation of patients with polyneuropathy primarily lies in distinguishing sensorimotor profiles.

### Levofloxacin [^116gjwk1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin in 5% Dextrose Injection, have been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons, resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias, and weakness, have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin in 5% Dextrose Injection. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of Levofloxacin in 5% Dextrose Injection and may be irreversible in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

Discontinue Levofloxacin in 5% Dextrose Injection immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of neuropathy, including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness or other alterations of sensation including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, and vibratory sensation. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin in 5% Dextrose Injection, in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy [see Adverse Reactions (6), Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### Chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy is associated with the metabolic syndrome [^111T3Npa]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Polyneuropathy has an estimated prevalence of 75–125 per 100,000 people. Despite extensive evaluation, no cause can be established in 5–30% of patients with chronic polyneuropathy. Most of these patients present in the sixth decade of life with a predominantly sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy, a so-called chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy (CIAP). CIAP progresses very slowly. More than 10 years after disease onset, the extent of disability is not severe, and there is no loss of ambulation.

Diabetes mellitus is a common established cause of chronic axonal polyneuropathy, but whether prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose [IFG] or impaired glucose tolerance) is an etiological factor remains a matter of debate. Sural nerve biopsy studies showed similarly increased basal lamina thickness of endoneurial vessels in patients with CIAP or diabetic neuropathy when compared with controls, suggesting a similar pathophysiological mechanism. The observed endoneurial vessel changes may result in axonal injury from chronic ischemia and could be etiologically associated with conditions that predispose individuals to microvascular disease, such as (pre)diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors.

Various cardiovascular risk factors and their association with polyneuropathy have been investigated. Only a limited number of studies considered chronic idiopathic polyneuropathy, but diagnostic criteria are quite variable or insufficiently descriptive. Consequently, the associations (or lack thereof) in these studies cannot be readily extrapolated to CIAP. The metabolic syndrome remains an essential consideration in understanding these associations.

### Underdiagnosis and diagnostic delay in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [^114qBhag]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a progressive motor and/or sensory neurological condition affecting peripheral nerves. The prevalence of CIDP ranges between 1.6 and 7 per 100,000 people and may vary based on the diagnostic criteria used. CIDP can have multiple relapses, causing significant disability in the affected population if left untreated. Hence, timely and correct diagnosis and treatment are of paramount importance.

The issue of overdiagnosis of CIDP — that is, patients receiving an erroneous diagnosis of CIDP and being treated as such — has been the focus of attention in recent years. Potential causes of overdiagnosis, with a wide range of alternative diagnoses, have been studied by a North American group. The delay in diagnosis of CIDP has been reported to range from 2 to 64 months. A more recent Dutch study showed a diagnostic delay of more than 12 months in 26% of cases. However, the precise frequency and the factors leading to underdiagnosis (i.e. patients receiving an initial erroneous non-CIDP diagnosis and treated as such and later having a final diagnosis of CIDP) of treatment-responsive CIDP is unknown, which in turn may have major consequences for offering immunomodulatory therapy to potentially eligible patients at an early stage when it is most likely to be effective.

We aim to ascertain the frequency and electroclinical features leading to underdiagnosis of CIDP prior to attending a tertiary specialist neuropathy clinic, i.e. pre-referral underdiagnosis, and the duration of resulting diagnostic and treatment delay in patients with treatment-responsive CIDP.

### Axonal excitability does not differ between painful and painless diabetic or chemotherapy-induced distal symmetrical polyneuropathy in a multicenter observational study [^112ieoTC]. Annals of Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Distal symmetrical polyneuropathy is characterized by the following criteria:

- **Possible distal symmetrical polyneuropathy**: Defined as the presence of either sensory symptoms (e.g. numbness, paresthesias, burning in the toes, feet, or legs) or sensory signs (e.g. symmetric decrease of distal sensation or unequivocally decreased or absent ankle reflexes).

- **Probable distal symmetrical polyneuropathy**: Includes any two or more of the following: sensory symptoms, decreased distal sensation, or unequivocally decreased or absent ankle reflexes.

- **Definite distal symmetrical polyneuropathy**: Defined as the presence of sensory symptoms or signs of neuropathy with an abnormality on a confirmatory test, which includes either nerve conduction studies or a validated measure of small fiber neuropathy (e.g. abnormal thermal thresholds on quantitative sensory testing or reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density).

Only participants who satisfied the criteria for probable or definite distal symmetrical polyneuropathy underwent neuropathic pain grading.

Neuropathic pain was graded using the criteria set by the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group of the International Association for the Study of Pain:

- **Possible neuropathic pain**: Fulfils criteria 1 and 2.
- **Probable neuropathic pain**: Fulfils criteria 1, 2, and 3.
- **Definite neuropathic pain**: Fulfils all 4 criteria:
	- Pain with a distinct neuroanatomically plausible distribution — pain symmetrically distributed in the extremities.
	- A history suggestive of a relevant lesion or disease affecting the peripheral or central somatosensory system — diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or history of chem

### Axonal excitability in viral polyneuropathy and nucleoside neuropathy in HIV patients [^1171CWmL]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

HIV infection is associated with several forms of peripheral neuropathy, the most common being a distal symmetrical polyneuropathy due to HIV infection ('DSP'). Direct viral effects are an important cause (hereafter termed viral neuropathy, VN), but sometimes, it is due to nucleoside antiretroviral drug therapy (nucleoside neuropathy, NN). Mechanisms of disease are incompletely understood, with some evidence implicating HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 mediated neuronal apoptosis for the former and mitochondrial toxicity ± DNA polymerase γ involvement in the latter.

The authors studied 16 HIV-positive patients, 14 of whom had neuropathy (10 VN, 4 NN), using clinical evaluation, conventional nerve-conduction studies (NCS), and measurements of the excitability of motor and sensory axons in the median nerve. Clinically neuropathic patients were all symptomatic, and 12 had abnormalities in NCS. There were no changes in the excitability of sensory or motor axons in VN, but there were in the NN group. These were consistent with depolarization of the internodal membrane ("fanned in" threshold electrotonus, increased resting current-voltage slope, reduced superexcitability) but with sparing of nodal properties (absolute threshold, strength-duration properties, refractoriness). Membrane abnormalities in VN are not diffuse and are likely to result from a more focal process, presumably proximal, while those in NN most likely relate to mitochondrial dysfunction. Confirmation of these findings may allow neurophysiological distinction between these entities.

### Peripheral neuropathy: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^1168MNPu]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy, a common neurologic problem encountered by family physicians, can be classified clinically by the anatomic pattern of presenting symptoms and, if indicated, by results of electrodiagnostic studies for axonal and demyelinating disease. The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in the general population ranges from 1% to 7%, with higher rates among those older than 50 years.

Common identifiable causes include diabetes mellitus, nerve compression or injury, alcohol use, toxin exposure, hereditary diseases, and nutritional deficiencies. Peripheral neuropathy is idiopathic in 25% to 46% of cases. Diagnosis requires a comprehensive history, physical examination, and judicious laboratory testing.

Early peripheral neuropathy may present as sensory alterations, including sensory loss, numbness, pain, or burning sensations in a "stocking and glove" distribution of the extremities. Later stages may involve proximal numbness, distal weakness, or atrophy. Physical examination should include a comprehensive neurologic and musculoskeletal evaluation.

If the peripheral nervous system is identified as the likely source of the patient's symptoms, evaluation for potential underlying etiologies should initially focus on treatable causes. Initial laboratory evaluation includes a complete blood count; a comprehensive metabolic profile; fasting blood glucose, vitamin B12, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels; and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation. If the initial evaluation is inconclusive, referral to a neurologist for additional testing is recommended.

### Peripheral neuropathy in complex inherited diseases: an approach to diagnosis [^112nHukG]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is a common finding in patients with complex inherited neurological diseases and may be subclinical or a major component of the phenotype. This review aims to provide a clinical approach to the diagnosis of this complex group of patients by addressing key questions, including the predominant neurological syndrome associated with the neuropathy, for example, spasticity; the type of neuropathy; and the other neurological and non-neurological features of the syndrome. Priority is given to the diagnosis of treatable conditions.

Using this approach, we associated neuropathy with one of three major syndromic categories:

- **Ataxia**: This category includes syndromes where ataxia is predominant.
- **Spasticity**: Syndromes under this category have spasticity as a primary feature.
- **Global neurodevelopmental impairment**: Here, syndromes show global neurodevelopmental challenges as a primary feature.

Syndromes that do not easily fit into one of these categories can be grouped according to the predominant system involved, in addition to the neuropathy, for example, cardiomyopathy and neuropathy. We also include a separate category of complex inherited relapsing neuropathy syndromes, some of which may mimic Guillain-Barré syndrome, as many will have a metabolic etiology and be potentially treatable.

### Axon transport and neuropathy: Relevant perspectives on the etiopathogenesis of familial dysautonomia [^112cjZMJ]. The American Journal of Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathies are highly prevalent and are most often associated with chronic disease, side effects from chemotherapy, or toxic-metabolic abnormalities. Neuropathies are less commonly caused by genetic mutations, but studies of the normal function of mutated proteins have identified particular vulnerabilities that often implicate mitochondrial dynamics and axon transport mechanisms. Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies are a group of phenotypically related diseases caused by monogenic mutations that primarily affect sympathetic and sensory neurons. Here, I review evidence to indicate that many genetic neuropathies are caused by abnormalities in axon transport. Moreover, in hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies, there may be specific convergence on gene mutations that disrupt nerve growth factor signaling, upon which sympathetic and sensory neurons critically depend.

### Fibromyalgia syndrome and small fiber, early or mild sensory polyneuropathy [^1147UKEA]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a well-recognized and common disorder of chronic widespread pain, characterized by specific criteria set out by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). In 2010, these criteria were revised to remove the need for tender points on exam, leaving certain clinical features that are vital to the diagnosis: (i) widespread pain (widespread pain index of ≥ 7 regions); (ii) at least moderate severity (symptom severity score ≥ 5) of pain, fatigue, sleep disruption, and cognitive symptoms; (iii) duration of symptoms ≥ 3 months; and (iv) absence of a disorder that would otherwise explain the condition. Criteria are also satisfied if only 3–6 regions are affected by pain but symptoms are more severe (severity score ≥ 9); therefore, patient-reported metrics are central to the diagnosis.

The term "myalgia" suggests the disorder may partly derive from muscle. However, the coexistence of neuropathic features of pain and a growing body of literature implicating small fiber axonal loss in fibromyalgia (FM) has raised the question of whether the pain in FMS is actually a neuropathic phenomenon.

- **Small fiber polyneuropathy (SFPN)**: This condition refers to the selective loss of unmyelinated C and thinly myelinated Aδ fibers that mediate pain, heat, and cold sensation, respectively. As these fibers are not detected on nerve conduction studies (NCS) and physical exam findings may often be minimal or normal, the diagnosis relies heavily on the demonstration of reduced epidermal nerve fiber (ENF) density (ENFD) on skin biopsy.

### Acquired neuropathies [^111cs4Vv]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Acquired neuropathies represent most of the neuropathies encountered in clinical practice. Hundreds of causes have been identified even though up to 41% of patients are still classified as idiopathic. Routine evaluation relies on comprehensive medical history taking, clinical examination, nerve conduction studies, and laboratory tests. Other investigations, such as nerve biopsy or nerve or muscle imaging, are performed in specific settings. This review focuses on recent advances in acquired neuropathies.

### Sensory loss, pains, motor deficit and axonal regeneration in length-dependent diabetic polyneuropathy [^112acKJK]. Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

In order to learn more about the occurrence of pains and motor deficit in severe diabetic polyneuropathy, we reviewed the data of a series of 30 diabetic patients with an uncommonly severe length-dependent diabetic polyneuropathy (LDDP). Extensive sensory loss, which predominated with pains and temperature sensations, affected all four limb extremities and the anterior trunk in all patients, plus the top of the scalp in 9 patients and the cauda equina territory in 2.

Twenty patients experienced neuropathic pains. Symptomatic autonomic dysfunction was present in 28 out of 30 patients, with mild distal motor deficit in 12 patients and severe motor deficit in only one. Vibratory sensation was impaired in the lower limbs in 18 patients and position sense in 8. In the 10 nerve biopsy specimens, the density of myelinated axons was reduced to 23% and that of unmyelinated axons to 8.5% of control values. Regenerating axons accounted for 32.4% ± 19.8% of the myelinated fibers. On teased fiber preparations, 13.9% of fibers were undergoing axonal degeneration, while 29.4% of fibers showed focal abnormalities of the myelin sheath.

We conclude that distal motor deficit occurs only following a major loss of sensory fibers in LDDP; the unmyelinated axons are predominantly affected. The absence of clinical improvement contrasts with the high proportion of regenerating axons. Detection of alteration of pain and temperature sensation in the feet seems to be the best method for neuropathy screening in diabetic patients.

### Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy [^114SiriF]. Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

The induction of peripheral neuropathy is a common factor in limiting therapy with chemotherapeutic drugs. Little is known about the mechanisms responsible for the development of neuropathy. Depending on the substance used, patients may experience either a pure sensory and painful neuropathy, as seen with cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and carboplatin, or a mixed sensorimotor neuropathy with or without involvement of the autonomic nervous system, as seen with vincristine, taxol, and suramin. Neurotoxicity depends on the total cumulative dose and the type of drug used. In individual cases, neuropathy can evolve even following a single drug application.

There is a general predisposition for developing chemotherapy-induced neuropathy in nerves previously damaged by conditions such as diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, or inherited neuropathy. The recovery from symptoms is often incomplete, and a long period of regeneration is required to restore function. Up to now, no drug is available to reliably prevent or cure chemotherapy-induced neuropathy.

### Multifocal axonal polyneuropathy in celiac disease [^114cUY6S]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The authors report six patients with multifocal axonal polyneuropathy and a subsequent diagnosis of celiac disease (CD). Five patients did not improve or experienced only modest improvement following dietary intervention or immune therapies. However, one patient, who presented with marked weakness and mild electrodiagnostic findings, experienced complete resolution of the neuropathy following immunomodulatory therapy. CD may be a cause of multifocal axonal polyneuropathy.

### Acute nutritional axonal neuropathy [^114LuLJa]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

This study describes clinical, laboratory, and electrodiagnostic features of a severe acute axonal polyneuropathy common to patients with acute nutritional deficiency in the setting of alcoholism, bariatric surgery (BS), or anorexia.

- **Methods**: Retrospective analysis of clinical, electrodiagnostic, and laboratory data of patients with acute axonal neuropathy.

- **Results**: Thirteen patients were identified with a severe, painful, sensory, or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy that developed over 2–12 weeks, with sensory ataxia, areflexia, variable muscle weakness, poor nutritional status, and weight loss, often with prolonged vomiting and normal cerebrospinal fluid protein. Vitamin B6 was low in half of the patients, and thiamine was low in all patients when obtained before supplementation. Patients improved with weight gain and vitamin supplementation, with motor recovery greater than sensory recovery.

- **Discussion**: We suggest that acute or subacute axonal neuropathy in patients with weight loss or vomiting associated with alcohol abuse, BS, or dietary deficiency is one syndrome caused by micronutrient deficiencies. Muscle Nerve 57: 33–39, 2018.

### Cardiovascular health and chronic axonal polyneuropathy: A population-based study [^115oQB4a]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

How cardiovascular risk factors precisely relate to chronic axonal polyneuropathy is not yet fully understood. It seems likely that chronic axonal polyneuropathy is a multifactorial disease, and several pathways causing nerve ischaemia followed by axonal degeneration have been proposed [25, 26, 27, 28]. Several factors, such as chronic inflammation due to oxidative stress causing microvascular damage of the neural vasculature or structural changes of the blood vessel endothelium due to hypertension, could possibly contribute to the development of chronic axonal polyneuropathy [25, 26, 27, 28]. Considering this possible relation, we expected the cardiovascular health score to be associated with polyneuropathy. Interestingly, the results were not merely driven by diabetes mellitus or alcohol intake, which are known risk factors for polyneuropathy.

We found that both cardiovascular health score and health behavior score were associated with polyneuropathy. This is of interest, as our previous work did not show a significant association between diet, a component of the health behavior score, and polyneuropathy in this population [7]. As health behaviors are modifiable, changing lifestyle may be used for possible prevention, delay in progression, or even treatment of chronic axonal polyneuropathy. Although optimal cardiovascular health was most beneficial, even small improvements, such as improving only one of the seven components of the score, was already significantly associated with the prevalence of polyneuropathy. Improving cardiovascular health by only one point, not necessarily

### Poems syndrome: Clinical update [^1172t3oZ]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with POEMS syndrome typically present with a subacute, distal, symmetrical sensorimotor neuropathy, which is frequently painful and associated with allodynia and hyperpathia. Neuropathy is a common initial clinical feature and may be the only feature at the first presentation. The lower limbs are affected earlier and more severely than the upper limbs. Sensory symptoms usually precede motor symptoms. Many patients quickly become wheelchair- or bed-bound due to weakness or pain. Clinical examination may reveal distal wasting, weakness, and sensory loss affecting both large and small fiber sensory modalities.

- **Neurophysiology**: Electrodiagnostic studies demonstrate a length-dependent sensorimotor neuropathy that is typically demyelinating, but also exhibits axonal degeneration. Conduction block is not usually present. In motor studies, a reduction in motor conduction velocity (MCV) is an early sign, however, patients often already have significant axonal loss at presentation. Sensory studies show a reduction of, or often absent, sensory nerve action potentials.

POEMS syndrome is distinguishable from other polyneuropathies through electrodiagnostic studies, albeit with some overlap. In a study of 51 patients with POEMS syndrome, 70% met the European Federation of Neurological Societies and Peripheral Nerve Society criteria for definite chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). Reduction in MCV is typically seen in similar proportions of patients with POEMS syndrome, CIDP, and CMT1a. However, while distal motor latencies tend to be prolonged in POEMS syndrome, they are [Text appears cut off].

### Assessing decreased sensation and increased sensory phenomena in diabetic polyneuropathies [^1169eHn3]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Loss of sensation and increased sensory phenomena are major expressions of varieties of diabetic polyneuropathies needing improved assessments for clinical and research purposes. We provide a neurobiological explanation for the apparent paradox between decreased sensation and increased sensory phenomena. Strongly endorsed is the use of the 10-g monofilaments for screening of feet to detect sensation loss, with the goal of improving diabetic management and preventing foot ulcers and neurogenic arthropathy. We describe improved methods to assess the kind, severity, and distribution of both large- and small-fiber sensory loss, and which approaches and techniques may be useful for conducting therapeutic trials.

The abnormality of nerve conduction attributes may be used to validate the dysfunction of large sensory fibers. The abnormality of epidermal nerve fibers per millimeter may be used as a surrogate measure of small-fiber sensory loss, but it appears not to correlate closely with the severity of pain. Increased sensory phenomena are recognized by the characteristic words patients use to describe them and by the severity and persistence of these symptoms. Tests of tactile and thermal hyperalgesia are additional markers of neural hyperactivity that are useful for diagnosis and disease management.

### Diabetes mellitus and the peripheral nervous system: manifestations and mechanisms [^1158mkWx]. Muscle & Nerve (2007). Low credibility.

Diabetes targets the peripheral nervous system with several different patterns of damage and several mechanisms of disease. Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) is a common disorder involving a large proportion of diabetic patients, yet its pathophysiology is controversial. Mechanisms considered have included polyol flux, microangiopathy, oxidative stress, abnormal signaling from advanced glycation end-products, and growth factor deficiency. Although some clinical trials have demonstrated modest benefits in disease stabilization or pain therapy in DPN, robust therapy capable of reversing the disease is unavailable.

This review examines general aspects of DPN and other diabetic neuropathies, including a summary of recent therapeutic trials. Particular emphasis is placed on the evidence that the neurobiology of DPN reflects a unique yet common and disabling neurodegenerative disorder.

### Axonal loss at time of diagnosis as biomarker for long-term disability in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [^111QracY]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). Low credibility.

- **Introduction**: The study explores the potential of axonal loss as a biomarker for predicting long-term disability in patients diagnosed with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.

- **Methodology**: Patients were monitored over a significant period to assess the correlation between initial axonal loss and subsequent disability progression.

- **Findings**: Results indicate that patients with greater axonal loss at diagnosis tend to experience higher levels of disability over time. This suggests that early assessment of axonal loss could be instrumental in predicting patient outcomes.

- **Conclusion**: Axonal loss is a promising biomarker for forecasting long-term disability in affected individuals, potentially aiding in tailored treatment plans and improved patient management strategies.

### The pattern and diagnostic criteria of sensory neuronopathy: A case-control study [^111RDQEV]. Brain (2009). Low credibility.

The following data were recorded and analyzed for the study: sex and age; clinical information including the modality of onset (acute ≤ 1 month; subacute > 1 month and ≤ 6 months; progressive > 6 months), presence of paresthesia/dysesthesia, ataxia, pain, and whether the first involvement was in the lower, upper, or all four limbs. At the maximum development of the neuropathy, the analysis included:

- **Topography of sensory loss**: In the four limbs (proximal or distal), face, or trunk.
- **Presence of symptoms**: Pain, dysesthesia/paresthesia, and ataxia in the upper or lower limbs.
- **Fibre involvement**: Small (thermal and pinprick sensation) or large (vibration and joint position sense).
- **Number of elicited tendon reflexes**
- **Symmetry of sensory loss**
- **Modified Rankin score**
- **Autonomic system abnormalities**: Including orthostatic hypotension, constipation or diarrhea, sexual impotence, bladder disturbances, abnormal sweating, and pupil abnormalities.

The distribution of sensory involvement was classified as consistent or not with a length-dependent pattern. Limbs were segmented into six sections from distal to proximal, and the trunk into two vertical anterior and posterior sections. Criteria for a length-dependent distribution were as previously reported by Thomas and Ochoa. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis abnormalities included protein concentration > 0.5 g/L, white cell count > 1/mm³, or an oligoclonal pattern.

### Is electrodiagnostic testing for polyneuropathy overutilized [^114yLk31]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP) is one of the most common problems seen in clinical practice and is a frequent reason for electrodiagnostic (EDx) testing. Most studies support the use of EDx testing for patients with suspected DSP. Some recent articles assert that EDx testing has a low yield in suspected DSP and is only needed for atypical presentations, which constitute a minority. However, many peer-reviewed articles indicate that EDx frequently changes diagnosis and management and leads to a better understanding of the underlying pathology, severity, and prognosis. Overall, EDx is appropriate for most patients with new signs and symptoms of DSP.

### Clinical utility of electrodiagnostic consultation in suspected polyneuropathy [^112GnKbf]. Muscle & Nerve (2004). Low credibility.

Although paresthesias of the distal lower limbs are characteristic features of polyneuropathy, they may also herald the presence of a focal neuropathy, polyradiculopathy, or myelopathy. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies (EMG/NCS) are widely used in the evaluation of such symptoms, but their utility has not been subjected to vigorous scrutiny. We investigated the clinical impact of the electrodiagnostic consultation in assessing suspected polyneuropathy.

When compared with the clinical impression, the result of the electrodiagnostic consultation was confirmatory in only 39% of all patients and changed the diagnosis or uncovered an additional diagnosis in 43%. An alternative diagnosis was likely when either weakness was present (75%) or the Achilles stretch reflex was preserved (48%). These data support the use of EMG/NCS in the diagnostic evaluation of patients presenting with distal paresthesias, especially in those with preserved Achilles reflexes or motor deficits.

### Long-term efficacy of immunoglobulins in small fiber neuropathy related to Sjögren's syndrome [^115Fdfjm]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The most common peripheral nervous system manifestations in Sjögren's syndrome are small fiber sensory neuropathies (SFPN) and axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathies. Currently, treatment in small fiber neuropathy is mainly symptomatic and based on anti-depressants and anti-epileptics. The benefit of treatment with polyvalent immunoglobulins for SFPN has been reported in small series of patients, although it is transient in several cases. The medium-to-long-term effects of polyvalent immunoglobulins (Ig) in SFPN in patients with Sjögren's syndrome who are refractory to conventional treatments remain an unmet medical need. We present our experience related to the persistent improvement observed with Ig in a case series of SFPN in Sjögren's syndrome, in conjunction with relevant data in the literature regarding the benefits of immunoglobulins for this indication.

### Diabetic neuropathies: Clinical manifestations and current treatment options [^113mMe5y]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Diabetic neuropathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders that include a wide range of abnormalities. They can be focal or diffuse, proximal or distal, affecting both peripheral and autonomic nervous systems, causing morbidity with significant impact on the quality of life of the person with diabetes, and can result in early death.

Distal symmetric polyneuropathy, the most common form of diabetic neuropathy, usually involves small and large nerve fibers. Small-nerve-fiber neuropathy often presents with pain but without objective signs or electrophysiologic evidence of nerve damage, and is recognized as a component of the impaired glucose tolerance and metabolic syndromes. The greatest risk resulting from small-fiber neuropathy is foot ulceration and subsequent gangrene and amputation. Large-nerve-fiber neuropathies produce numbness, ataxia, and uncoordination, impairing activities of daily living and causing falls and fractures.

A careful history and detailed physical examination are essential for the diagnosis. Symptomatic therapy has become available and newer and better treatment modalities, based on etiologic factors, are being explored with potential for significant impact on morbidity and mortality. Preventive strategies and patient education still remain key factors in reducing complication rates and mortality.

### Diabetic polyneuropathies: Update on research definition, diagnostic criteria and estimation of severity [^111DywaQ]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Prior to a joint meeting of the Neurodiab Association and International Symposium on Diabetic Neuropathy held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, from October 13 to 18, 2009, Solomon Tesfaye convened a panel of neuromuscular experts to provide an update on polyneuropathies associated with diabetes (Toronto Consensus Panels on DPNs, 2009). This document offers definitions of typical and atypical diabetic polyneuropathies (DPNs), the diagnostic criteria, and approaches to diagnose sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as to estimate its severity.

Diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN), or typical DPN, usually develops from long-standing hyperglycemia, consequent metabolic derangements, and microvessel alterations. It is frequently associated with microvessel retinal and kidney disease, but other causes must be excluded. By contrast, atypical DPNs include painful and autonomic small-fibre polyneuropathies.

Recognizing the need to detect and estimate the severity of DSPN validly and reproducibly, subclinical DSPN is defined using nerve conduction criteria. Possible, probable, and confirmed clinical levels of DSPN are established. For conducting epidemiologic surveys and randomized controlled trials, it is necessary to pre-specify which attributes of nerve conduction are to be used, the criteria for diagnosis, reference values, correction for applicable variables, and the specific criteria for DSPN.

Performance characteristics of several criteria for the diagnosis of sensorimotor polyneuropathy in healthy and diabetic subject cohorts are provided.

### Drug therapy for chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy [^1175p3mq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy (CIAP) is an insidiously progressive sensory or sensorimotor polyneuropathy that affects elderly people. Although severe disability or handicap does not occur, CIAP reduces quality of life. It is diagnosed in 10% to 25% of people referred for evaluation of polyneuropathy. There is a need to gather and review emerging evidence on treatments, as the number of people affected is likely to increase in aging populations. This is an update of a review first published in 2004 and previously updated in 2006, 2008, 2011, and 2013.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of drug therapy for chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy for reducing disability and ameliorating neurological symptoms and associated impairments, and to assess any adverse effects of treatment.

- **Search methods**: In July 2016, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Web of Science. We searched two trials registries for ongoing trials. We also hand-searched the reference lists of relevant articles, reviews, and textbooks identified electronically. We would have contacted authors and other experts in the field to identify additional studies if this seemed useful.

- **Selection criteria**: We sought all randomized or quasi-randomized (alternate or other systematic treatment allocation) trials that examined the effects of any drug therapy in people with CIAP at least one year after the onset of treatment. People with CIAP had to fulfill specific criteria.

### Removing the idiopathic from the chronic sensory neuropathies [^114xYEFy]. Brain (2021). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathies are common, estimated to affect around 2.4% of the general population and rising to 8% in those over the age of 55. Neuropathies can cause significant morbidity and can sometimes be fatal. Peripheral nerves consist of motor nerves that convey motor signals from the spinal cord to the peripheries, sensory nerves that convey sensory signals from the peripheries to the CNS, along with sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibers that together make up the autonomic nervous system.

Neuropathies can be classified into acute and chronic forms and may present symmetrically or asymmetrically. Using neurophysiological and pathological criteria, neuropathies are often classified as demyelinating or axonal forms, reflecting the principal site of pathology as the myelin-forming Schwann cell or the axon, respectively. Furthermore, neuropathies can be classified into those that are inherited, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth and related disorders, and those believed to be acquired.

Of the acquired forms, the most common risk factor associated with peripheral neuropathy in European populations is diabetes mellitus, while infectious and toxic causes remain prevalent worldwide. Despite careful and thorough investigation, it is estimated that between 20% and 40% of neuropathies that present to the clinic have no identifiable cause. Hence, the longstanding and common use of terms like 'idiopathic' or 'cryptogenic' are used, now grouped together under the diagnostic label of 'chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy' (CIAP).

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2011 [^114gGMQP]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

All patients should be screened for distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DPN) at diagnosis and at least annually thereafter, using simple clinical tests (B). Electrophysiological testing is rarely needed, except in situations where the clinical features are atypical (E). Screening for signs and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy should be instituted at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Special testing is rarely needed and may not affect management or outcomes (E). Medications for the relief of specific symptoms related to DPN and autonomic neuropathy are recommended, as they improve the quality of life of the patient (E).

The diabetic neuropathies are heterogeneous with diverse clinical manifestations. They may be focal or diffuse. Most common among the neuropathies are chronic sensorimotor DPN and autonomic neuropathy. Although DPN is a diagnosis of exclusion, complex investigations to exclude other conditions are rarely needed.

The early recognition and appropriate management of neuropathy in the patient with diabetes is important for a number of reasons:

1. Nondiabetic neuropathies may be present in patients with diabetes and may be treatable.
2. A number of treatment options exist for symptomatic diabetic neuropathy.
3. Up to 50% of DPN may be asymptomatic, and patients are at risk of insensate injury to their feet.

### Inflammatory vasculopathy in multifocal diabetic neuropathy [^114Hffx2]. Brain (2003). Low credibility.

Besides the common distal symmetrical sensory-motor polyneuropathy (DSP) that is often associated with autonomic dysfunction, diabetic patients may develop multifocal sensory-motor deficits (MDN) secondary to roots, plexus, and nerve trunk involvement. Nerve ischaemia has been suggested as a common mechanism for the different patterns of diabetic neuropathies; yet the important clinical differences that exist between DSP and MDN suggest contributing factors.

In order to learn more on the subject, we prospectively studied 22 consecutive diabetic patients with MDN, for which other causes of neuropathy were excluded by appropriate investigations, including biopsy of a recently affected sensory nerve. Three patients had a relapsing course, and the others had an unremitting subacute-progressive course. Painful MDN progressed over 2–12 months.

The neurological deficit predominated in distal lower limbs which were involved in all patients, unilaterally in seven, bilaterally in the others, with an asynchronous onset in most cases. In addition, a proximal deficit of the lower limbs was present on one side in seven patients, and on both sides in six.

- **Thoracic radiculoneuropathy**: Present bilaterally in two patients and unilaterally in one.
- **Ulnar nerve involvement**: Observed in one patient.
- **Radial nerve involvement**: Noted in two patients.

The CSF protein ranged from 0.40 to 3.55 g/l, with a mean of 0.87 g/l. Electrophysiological testing showed severe, multifocal, axonal nerve lesions in all cases. Asymmetrical axonal lesions were found in all nerve specimens. The mean density of myelinated axons was reduced to 1340 ± 107.

### Diagnosis of motor neuropathy [^116mNfKi]. European Journal of Neurology (2001). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, peripheral motor neuropathy can be caused by:

- **Inflammatory conditions**: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multifocal motor neuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome
- **Infectious and hereditary diseases**: Diphtheria, X-linked recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease/type 5, Navajo neurohepatopathy
- **Metabolic and degenerative disorders**: Mitochondrial protein-associated neurodegeneration, giant axonal neuropathy
- **Ataxia and related disorders**: Ataxia-oculomotor apraxia type 2, ataxia-oculomotor apraxia type 1
- **Amyloidosis and similar conditions**: Transthyretin amyloidosis, amyloid polyneuropathy type 1
- **Hereditary neuropathies**: Hereditary sensorimotor neuropathy type 1, hereditary liability to pressure palsies, hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy
- **Porphyrias and related disorders**: Chester porphyria, acute intermittent porphyria, erythropoietic protoporphyria
- **Other inherited conditions**: X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease

In addition, peripheral motor neuropathy can be caused by medications such as cladribine, dinutuximab, and ixabepilone.

### Cipro [^116gA7SB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO, have been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons, resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias, and weakness, have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO. Symptoms may occur soon after the initiation of CIPRO and may be irreversible in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

Discontinue CIPRO immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness, or other alterations in sensations such as light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, vibratory sensation, and/or motor strength to minimize the development of an irreversible condition. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO, in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

### Axonal polyneuropathy in obstructive sleep apnoea [^114Zfr2v]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Chronic hypoxaemia in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a well-known risk factor for polyneuropathy, but the impact of intermittent hypoxaemia on peripheral nerve function has not been established so far. A case-control study was performed to evaluate the prevalence of polyneuropathy in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Out of 24 patients with OSA, 17 (71%) had clinical signs of polyneuropathy versus seven (33%) out of 21 matched controls. The mean amplitude of the sural sensory nerve action potential was smaller in the OSA group than in the control group, indicating axonal nerve damage. The differences were significant and could not be attributed to other known risk factors for polyneuropathy. The severity of axonal damage in patients with OSA correlated with the percentage of nighttime with an O₂ saturation below 90%. It is assumed that intermittent hypoxaemia in OSA is an independent risk factor for axonal damage of peripheral nerves.

### Peripheral neuropathy evaluations of patients with prolonged long COVID [^111afXqp]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Recovery from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection appears exponential, leaving a tail of patients reporting various long COVID symptoms, including unexplained fatigue/exertional intolerance and dysautonomic and sensory concerns. Indirect evidence links long COVID to incident polyneuropathy affecting the small-fiber (sensory/autonomic) axons.

- **Methods**: We analyzed cross-sectional and longitudinal data from patients with World Health Organization (WHO)-defined long COVID without prior neuropathy history or risks who were referred for peripheral neuropathy evaluations. We captured standardized symptoms, examinations, objective neurodiagnostic test results, and outcomes, tracking participants for an average of 1.4 years.

- **Results**: Among 17 patients (mean age 43.3 years, 69% female, 94% Caucasian, and 19% Latino), 59% had at least one test interpretation confirming neuropathy. These included 63% (10/16) of skin biopsies, 17% (2/12) of electrodiagnostic tests, and 50% (4/8) of autonomic function tests. One patient was diagnosed with critical illness axonal neuropathy and another with multifocal demyelinating neuropathy 3 weeks after mild COVID, and over 10 received small-fiber neuropathy diagnoses. Longitudinal improvement averaged 52%, although none reported complete resolution. For treatment, 65% (11/17) received immunotherapies, such as corticosteroids and/or IV immunoglobulins.

- **Discussion**: Among evaluated patients with long COVID, prolonged, often disabling, small-fiber neuropathy was most common after mild SARS-CoV-2, beginning within 1 month.

### Novel insights on diagnosis, cause and treatment of diabetic neuropathy: Focus on painful diabetic neuropathy [^114GWyPv]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetic neuropathy is common, often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, and causes substantial morbidity along with increased mortality. Defining and developing sensitive diagnostic tests for diabetic neuropathy is crucial not only for implementing earlier interventions but also for ensuring that the most appropriate endpoints are employed in clinical intervention trials. This is essential, as many potentially effective therapies may not progress to clinical use, not due to a lack of therapeutic effect, but because the endpoints were not sufficiently sensitive or robust to identify their benefit.

Apart from improving glycemic control, there is no licensed treatment for diabetic neuropathy; however, several pathogenetic pathways are under active study. Painful diabetic neuropathy is a significant cause of morbidity. While many pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions are currently used, only two are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

The text addresses the important issue of the 'placebo effect' and considers potential new pharmacological therapies as well as nonpharmacological interventions in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy.

### Chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy is associated with the metabolic syndrome [^111VtqGQ]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy (CIAP) was defined according to the following criteria. The presence of symmetrical distal sensory or sensorimotor symptoms such as numbness, pins and needles, tightness, coldness, unsteadiness, muscle cramps, and weakness with onset in the lower limbs should be compatible with polyneuropathy. Additionally, there should be symmetrical distal sensory or sensorimotor signs with evidence of large nerve fiber involvement, such as decreased sense of touch, vibration, and proprioception, usually in conjunction with decreased pin prick/temperature sense, decreased/absent tendon reflexes, or slight muscle weakness on neurologic examination, all compatible with polyneuropathy.

The onset should be insidious and show slow or no progression of the polyneuropathy over at least 6 months. There should be no identifiable cause for the polyneuropathy after thorough history-taking, clinical examination, and extensive laboratory testing. Furthermore, there should be no suggestion of a hereditary polyneuropathy based on detailed kinship history, neurologic examination, or confirmation by genetic analysis. Nerve conduction studies should exclude a demyelinating polyneuropathy and confirm large nerve fiber involvement if findings on neurologic examination were equivocal considering the patient's age.

Electrophysiological criteria for demyelination provided that distal compound motor action potential (CMAP) baseline to negative peak amplitude is greater than 1 mV were: reduction of motor nerve conduction velocity to 80% of the lower limit of normal (LLN), or to less than 70% of…

### The diagnostic challenge of small fibre neuropathy: Clinical presentations, evaluations, and causes [^114CYPRL]. The Lancet Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Small fibre neuropathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders affecting thinly myelinated Aδ-fibres and unmyelinated C-fibres. Although multiple causes of small nerve fibre degeneration have been reported, including genetic mutations, the cause of small fibre neuropathy remains unknown in up to 50% of cases. The typical clinical presentation of small fibre neuropathy is that of a symmetrical, length-dependent polyneuropathy associated with sensory or autonomic symptoms. More rarely, the clinical presentation is characterised by non-length-dependent, focal, or multifocal symptoms.

The diagnostic tests to identify small fibre neuropathy include skin biopsy, quantitative sensory, and autonomic testing. Additional tests, such as those measuring small fibre-related evoked potentials and corneal confocal microscopy, might contribute to a better understanding of these neuropathies. Biochemical markers can also help in screening patients for the presence of small fibre neuropathy and to assess disease progression.

### Acute axonal polyneuropathy following honey-bee sting: A case report [^112pSdsR]. Journal of Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Hymenoptera stings lead to a myriad of neurologic manifestations by the mechanism of immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reactions. The more common form of polyneuropathy associated with these stings is the acute inflammatory demyelinating type. We describe a 6-year-old girl who developed progressive, symmetrical, ascending weakness within three days following a bee sting. Serial nerve conduction studies confirmed acute, motor-predominant axonal polyneuropathy. The use of intravenous immunoglobulin induced a halt in progression, prompt stabilization, and gradual recovery. This case highlights that even a single honey-bee sting can result in an acute-onset axonal variety of polyneuropathy in children.

### Velcade [^117UD1Sw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Velcade treatment causes a peripheral neuropathy that is predominantly sensory; however, cases of severe sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy have been reported. Patients with pre-existing symptoms, such as numbness, pain, or a burning feeling in the feet or hands, and/or signs of peripheral neuropathy may experience worsening peripheral neuropathy (including ≥ Grade 3) during treatment with Velcade. Patients should be monitored for symptoms of neuropathy, such as a burning sensation, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, neuropathic pain, or weakness. In the Phase 3 relapsed multiple myeloma trial comparing Velcade subcutaneous versus intravenous administration, the incidence of Grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy was 24% for subcutaneous and 39% for intravenous. Grade ≥ 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 6% of patients in the subcutaneous treatment group, compared with 15% in the intravenous treatment group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Starting Velcade subcutaneously may be considered for patients with pre-existing or high risk of peripheral neuropathy.

Patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy during Velcade therapy may require a decrease in the dose and/or a less dose-intensive schedule [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. In the Velcade versus dexamethasone Phase 3 relapsed multiple myeloma study, improvement in or resolution of peripheral neuropathy was reported in 48% of patients with ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy following dose adjustment or interruption. Improvement in or resolution of peripheral neuropathy was reported in 73% of patients.

### Diagnosis and management of sensory polyneuropathy [^116Rofy5]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Sensory polyneuropathies, which result from dysfunction of peripheral sensory nerve fibers, represent a heterogeneous group of disorders ranging from the common diabetic neuropathy to rare sensory neuronopathies. The presenting symptoms, acuity, time course, severity, and subsequent morbidity vary and depend on the type of fiber affected and the underlying cause. Damage to small, thinly myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers causes neuropathic pain, while damage to large myelinated sensory afferents leads to proprioceptive deficits and ataxia.

These disorders have diverse causes, including metabolic, toxic, infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune, and genetic conditions. Idiopathic sensory polyneuropathies are common but should be considered diagnoses of exclusion. The diagnostic evaluation involves electrophysiologic testing, such as nerve conduction studies, histopathologic analysis of nerve tissue, serum studies, and sometimes autonomic testing and cerebrospinal fluid analysis.

Treatment depends on the underlying cause and may include immunotherapy, mitigation of risk factors, symptomatic treatment, and gene therapy — such as recently developed RNA interference and antisense oligonucleotide therapies for transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy. Many of these disorders lack directed treatment, necessitating symptomatic and supportive management. More research is needed to understand the underlying pathophysiology of nerve damage in these polyneuropathies to inform future treatment advances.

### What every neuropathologist needs to know: Peripheral nerve biopsy [^112FFBg9]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is a common disorder with many possible etiologies, including metabolic diseases, inflammatory conditions, infections, malignancy, inherited diseases, drugs, and toxins. In most instances, diagnosis and treatment plans can be established based on clinical presentation, family history, laboratory results, genetic testing, and electrophysiological studies. However, in some situations, a peripheral nerve biopsy remains a valuable tool. This is especially true in patients with rapidly progressive disease, atypical presentation, or for whom other approaches fail to yield a definitive diagnosis.

The pathologic examination starts with basic decisions about specimen triage. A few fundamental questions help to provide an initial framework for the assessment of a nerve biopsy: Is the specimen adequate; are there inflammatory changes; are there vascular changes; is there amyloid; are there changes to axonal density and the Schwann cell-myelin-axon unit? In the appropriate context and with such an approach, peripheral nerve biopsies can still represent a clinically helpful test.

### Inherited neuropathies: Clinical overview and update [^116QED7f]. Muscle & Nerve (2013). Low credibility.

Inherited neuropathy is a group of common neurologic disorders with heterogeneous clinical presentations and genetic causes. Detailed neuromuscular evaluations, including nerve conduction studies, laboratory testing, and histopathologic examination, can assist in identifying the inherited component beyond family history. Genetic testing increasingly enables the definitive diagnosis of specific inherited neuropathies. Diagnosis, however, is often complex, and neurologic disability may have both genetic and acquired components in individual patients. The decision regarding which genetic test to order or whether to order genetic tests is often complicated, and strategies to maximize the value of testing are evolving. Apart from rare inherited metabolic neuropathies, treatment approaches remain largely supportive. A clinical update is provided on the various types of inherited neuropathies, their differential diagnoses, and distinguishing clinical features where available. Additionally, a framework is provided for clinical evaluations, including the inheritance assessment, electrophysiologic examinations, and specific genetic tests.

### Assessing decreased sensation and increased sensory phenomena in diabetic polyneuropathies [^116ZyrUM]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

NCs: surrogate measure of sensation loss.

NC studies (NCS) and needle electromyography are sensitive, objective, and quantitative indicators useful for the diagnosis and characterization of various types of polyneuropathy, such as those associated with diabetes. They are among the most objective and quantitative early indicators of typical DSPN and, therefore, useful as diagnostic tools of DSPN. Among the attributes of NCs, peroneal conduction velocity and sural sensory nerve action potential amplitude, expressed as percentiles and corrected for applicable age and anthropomorphic variables, are especially sensitive indicators of DSPN.

In contrast to their qualities for detecting DSPN, attributes of NC are only weak measures of neuropathy severity. Thus, they provide only limited information about the kind, severity, and distribution of muscle weakness, and the kind and distribution of sensory loss and autonomic deficits. Additionally, sural sensory nerve action potentials have a strong floor effect, which is a serious deficit for conducting therapeutic trials.

Epidermal nerve fibers: a surrogate measure of sensation loss.

Counts of nerve endings and fibers.

Sensory impairment in DSPN is characterized by dysfunction of small (Aδ and C) and larger-diameter (Aαβ) nerve fibers. Large myelinated sensory fibers, excluding their cutaneous receptors, can be evaluated by NCs. QSTs measure both large- and small-fiber sensory function but do not localize dysfunction to either the central or peripheral sensory nervous system. The advent of punch skin biopsy analysis has further expanded the ability to evaluate nerve fibers comprehensively.

### Pathology explains various mechanisms of auto-immune inflammatory peripheral neuropathies [^112KfWHD]. Brain Pathology (2024). Low credibility.

Over time, axon loss becomes more severe, making demyelinating lesions difficult to identify either electrophysiologically or pathologically. Consequently, such patients are sometimes wrongly considered as having an axonal polyneuropathy and are not treated correctly. For these reasons, it might be more appropriate to reuse the original term "CIP" rather than "CIDP".

### Genetic evidence for the most common risk factors for chronic axonal polyneuropathy in the general population [^11483jt8]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Chronic axonal polyneuropathy is a common disease, but the etiology remains only partially understood. Previous etiologic studies have identified clinical risk factors, but genetic evidence supporting causality between these factors and polyneuropathy is largely lacking. In this study, we investigate whether there is a genetic association of clinically established important risk factors, such as diabetes, body mass index (BMI), vitamin B12 levels, and alcohol intake, with chronic axonal polyneuropathy.

This study was performed within the population-based Rotterdam Study and included 1565 participants (median age = 73.6 years, interquartile range = 64.6–78.8, 53.5% female), of whom 215 participants (13.7%) had polyneuropathy. Polygenic scores (PGSs) for diabetes, BMI, vitamin B12 levels, and alcohol intake were calculated at multiple significance thresholds based on published genome-wide association studies.

Higher PGSs of diabetes, BMI, and alcohol intake were associated with a higher prevalence of chronic axonal polyneuropathy, whereas a higher PGS of vitamin B12 levels was associated with a lower prevalence of polyneuropathy. These effects were most pronounced for PGSs with lenient significance thresholds for diabetes and BMI (odds ratio [OR] diabetes, p < 1.0 = 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05–1.39 and OR BMI, p < 1.0 = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.04–1.41) and for the strictest significance thresholds for vitamin B12 level and alcohol intake (OR vitamin B12, p < 5e-6 = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.68–0.92 and OR alcohol, p < 5e-8 = 1.17, 95%).

### Diabetic neuropathies [^113YQmwP]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Diabetic neuropathy is a frequent complication of diabetes, presenting with a wide range of symptoms, including symmetric distal motor dysfunction, sensory abnormalities (positive and negative sensory symptoms), radiculoplexus neuropathies, mononeuropathies, and autonomic dysfunction. The condition can manifest in various forms, each with distinct characteristics. There is now a better understanding regarding the pathophysiology of diabetic neuropathies, specifically concerning what makes sensory neurons more susceptible to injury and bioenergetic failure in peripheral nervous system neurons. This monograph provides an overview of the different types of diabetic neuropathy, addresses the management of more common forms associated with diabetes, and highlights recent updates in the field, including nutraceuticals.

### Mitotoxicity in distal symmetrical sensory peripheral neuropathies [^111ssAUG]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic distal symmetrical sensory peripheral neuropathy is a common neurological complication of cancer chemotherapy, HIV treatment, and diabetes. Although etiology-specific differences in presentation are evident, the clinical signs and symptoms of these neuropathies are clearly similar. Data from animal models of neuropathic pain suggest that these similarities have a common cause: mitochondrial dysfunction in primary afferent sensory neurons. Mitochondrial dysfunction is caused by the mitotoxic effects of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs of several chemical classes, HIV-associated viral proteins, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor treatment, as well as the possibly both direct and indirect effects of excess glucose.

The mitochondrial injury results in a chronic neuronal energy deficit, which gives rise to spontaneous nerve impulses and a compartmental neuronal degeneration that is first apparent in the terminal receptor arbor, that is, intraepidermal nerve fibers of cutaneous afferent neurons. Preliminary data suggest that drugs that prevent mitochondrial injury or improve mitochondrial function could be useful in the treatment of these conditions.

### Peripheral neuropathy associated with prolonged use of linezolid [^113pJAJX]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

We present a case of a woman who developed severe, painful peripheral neuropathy while receiving linezolid therapy for 6 months. Nerve conduction studies indicated a sensory-motor axonal neuropathy. Extensive assessment did not show alternative explanations for her neuropathy. At the time of death, 1 month after discontinuing linezolid, the neuropathy had not resolved. A review of published material shows a growing body of evidence that long-term use of linezolid may be associated with severe peripheral and optic neuropathy. Twenty-one cases have been reported. In most cases, optic neuropathies resolved after stopping linezolid, but peripheral neuropathies did not. The duration of therapy, rather than indication for treatment, seems to be the most important factor. The mechanism of toxicity is unknown, but certain pharmacological properties of linezolid that may play a part are proposed. This report highlights the importance of post-approval surveillance and reporting of serious adverse drug effects, and the potential consequences of off-label use of pharmaceuticals. It further demonstrates the critical role clinicians have in communicating awareness of emerging drug toxicities.
