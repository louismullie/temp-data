## Question

Could xanthomas indicate a serious underlying health condition?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether xanthomas can indicate a serious underlying health condition. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what xanthomas are and their pathophysiology. Then, I should categorize the major etiologies, distinguishing hyperlipidemic from normolipemic causes. Next, I will examine specific serious conditions signaled by xanthomas, including high cardiovascular risk in familial hypercholesterolemia, rare genetic disorders like cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and sitosterolemia, hematologic malignancies associated with normolipemic plane xanthomas, endocrine/metabolic emergencies like severe hypertriglyceridemia with pancreatitis, and cholestatic liver disease with lipoprotein X. After that, I need to outline a pragmatic diagnostic approach and confirm prognostic and management implications. Finally, I will synthesize red flags that should prompt urgent evaluation, verifying each point against the literature as I go [^117GjkYn] [^111mwmAv].

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathobiology. Xanthomas are benign-appearing cutaneous or tendinous lesions composed of lipid-laden foamy macrophages in the dermis or tendons, typically reflecting systemic disturbances in lipoprotein metabolism rather than a purely local process, and can occur in both hyperlipidemic and, less commonly, normolipemic states, so I need to ensure I do not dismiss them as merely cosmetic when they may be sentinels of systemic disease [^117GjkYn] [^1155Pniz].

> Next, I should review the broad etiologic categories. Hold on, I should verify the split between primary and secondary dyslipidemias before moving on: primary causes include familial hypercholesterolemia and familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, whereas secondary causes include uncontrolled diabetes, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, and cholestasis, as well as several drugs; normolipemic xanthomas may point toward monoclonal gammopathy or rare immunologic or histiocytic disorders, so I need to keep both lipid and non-lipid pathways in mind during evaluation [^111mwmAv] [^1129c4Vz] [^113wFqc1] [^114KgoKi].

> I will now examine cardiovascular disease risk, particularly in familial hypercholesterolemia, because this is where xanthomas often herald serious morbidity. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of risk: in genetically confirmed heterozygous FH, the presence of tendon xanthomas confers approximately a 3.2-fold higher risk of cardiovascular disease versus FH patients without xanthomas, indicating that xanthomas are a phenotypic marker of heightened atherogenic burden and not merely a skin finding; clinical guidelines emphasize that tendon xanthomas and very high LDL-C in patients or relatives should prompt FH assessment and cascade screening, underscoring their prognostic importance [^116a4Jrk] [^114GY9Hx] [^111Y6gye].

> Let me consider life-threatening genetic disorders next, and I should confirm two that are classically xanthoma-associated. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is an autosomal recessive bile acid synthesis defect that presents with childhood cataracts, adolescent tendon xanthomas, and progressive neurologic dysfunction; early treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid can prevent irreversible neurologic decline, so recognizing tendon xanthomas in this context can be life-changing; sitosterolemia, another autosomal recessive condition, features markedly elevated plant sterols, early-onset tuberous/intertriginous xanthomas, and premature atherosclerosis, warranting specific diagnostic testing and dietary/pharmacologic sterol-lowering strategies; I should confirm both when tendon or intertriginous xanthomas appear discordant with routine lipid profiles [^116yWeFN] [^116Jq614] [^1156fKcC] [^112jSsdU] [^11346nMi].

> But wait, what if the lipid panel is normal and the xanthomas are diffuse and plane. In that case, I should double-check for monoclonal gammopathy, because normolipemic diffuse plane xanthoma can precede or accompany MGUS, multiple myeloma, or lymphoma, with immune complex-mediated lipid deposition in macrophages as a plausible mechanism; importantly, the cutaneous eruption may precede the hematologic diagnosis by months to years, so serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation are warranted even when lipids are normal [^113wFqc1] [^114KgoKi] [^113xawxg].

> I need to check endocrine and metabolic emergencies next. Eruptive xanthomas — crops of yellow-orange papules on extensor surfaces and buttocks — often signal severe hypertriglyceridemia in the setting of uncontrolled diabetes, and can precede or accompany acute pancreatitis, which is life-threatening; recognizing this pattern should trigger urgent triglyceride-lowering and glycemic control to mitigate pancreatitis risk; severe hypothyroidism can also produce dramatic hyperlipidemia with disseminated xanthomas that resolve only with thyroid hormone replacement, reminding me to include TSH and free T4 in the initial workup [^11345Vy9] [^115ynsnV] [^1116nJoZ] [^117L53Mx] [^11688xTb].

> Hold on, I should verify hepatobiliary causes, especially cholestasis with lipoprotein X, because this mechanism often produces plane or diffuse xanthomas refractory to standard lipid-lowering. In primary biliary cholangitis and other cholestatic diseases, accumulation of lipoprotein X leads to striking hypercholesterolemia and multiple xanthoma morphologies; importantly, these lesions typically improve only when the cholestasis is reversed, with liver transplantation sometimes required for durable resolution, and temporizing measures like plasmapheresis or destructive cosmetic procedures offer limited benefit if the underlying cholestasis persists [^114dQXtw] [^111X1x9X] [^111Y9MZP].

> Next, I should review a practical diagnostic approach, and I need to ensure I link morphology and distribution to testing. For any new xanthomas, I should obtain a fasting lipid profile with LDL-C and triglycerides, glucose or HbA1c, TSH and free T4, liver enzymes and cholestasis markers, renal function with urinalysis for proteinuria, and a careful medication review for secondary causes; if plane or diffuse xanthomas occur with normal lipids, I should order serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation to assess for monoclonal gammopathy; if intertriginous or tendon xanthomas develop in a child or young adult with atypical lipid patterns, I should consider plant sterol testing for sitosterolemia; if tendon xanthomas occur with neurologic or ophthalmic clues, I should confirm CTX with plasma cholestanol and bile alcohols and consider imaging; in suspected FH, I should confirm persistently elevated LDL-C, assess family history, and pursue cascade screening and genetic testing when available [^111mwmAv] [^113wFqc1] [^112jSsdU] [^111rZL3X] [^114GY9Hx] [^111Y6gye] [^117REBWk].

> I should now confirm prognostic and management implications because missing these signals carries real risk. In FH, tendon xanthomas correlate with higher cardiovascular risk and justify aggressive LDL-C lowering to guideline targets, with every 1 mmol/L LDL-C reduction conferring substantial relative risk reduction in major vascular events; in CTX, early chenodeoxycholic acid prevents neurologic progression; in eruptive xanthomas with severe hypertriglyceridemia, urgent triglyceride reduction and glycemic control prevent pancreatitis; in cholestatic lipoprotein X dyslipidemia, durable improvement requires correcting cholestasis, sometimes via liver transplant; and in monoclonal gammopathy–associated xanthomas, treatment of the underlying clone can lead to regression of cutaneous disease, so I need to align dermatologic management with systemic therapy and risk modification [^116a4Jrk] [^111mwmAv] [^1156fKcC] [^111Y9MZP] [^113wFqc1].

> Finally, to answer the question directly — and I should be explicit here — yes, xanthomas can indicate serious underlying health conditions, and several red flags warrant expedited evaluation: tendon xanthomas, especially in youth or with very high LDL-C suggesting familial hypercholesterolemia; diffuse plane xanthomas with normal lipids suggesting monoclonal gammopathy; eruptive papules signaling severe hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis risk in uncontrolled diabetes; palmar-crease or intertriginous involvement suggesting dysbetalipoproteinemia or sitosterolemia; and generalized plane xanthomas with pruritus suggesting cholestatic liver disease with lipoprotein X, so I should not wait to investigate when these patterns appear [^114GY9Hx] [^113wFqc1] [^11345Vy9] [^112jSsdU] [^114dQXtw].

Yes, xanthomas can indicate **serious underlying conditions**, most often **familial hypercholesterolemia** [^1129c4Vz] and other genetic dyslipidemias that markedly increase cardiovascular risk [^116a4Jrk]. They also signal **severe hypertriglyceridemia** with risk of acute pancreatitis [^11345Vy9] and may be the first clue to secondary causes such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, cholestatic liver disease, or nephrotic syndrome [^111mwmAv]. Plane or diffuse xanthomas, especially with normal lipids, may precede **hematologic malignancies** or monoclonal gammopathies [^114KgoKi] [^113wFqc1]. Early recognition should prompt **urgent evaluation and treatment** to prevent cardiovascular events, pancreatitis, or progression of systemic disease [^114GY9Hx].

---

## Clinical significance of xanthomas

Xanthomas are **strongly associated with disorders of lipid metabolism**, including [^117GjkYn]:

- **Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)**: A genetic disorder characterized by elevated LDL cholesterol levels, leading to premature cardiovascular disease [^114GY9Hx]. Tendon xanthomas are a hallmark of FH and indicate a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular events [^1129c4Vz].

- **Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (type III hyperlipoproteinemia)**: Characterized by elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels, associated with tuberous and palmar xanthomas, and increased risk of atherosclerosis [^111ks4yp].

- **Familial hypertriglyceridemia**: Associated with eruptive xanthomas and increased risk of acute pancreatitis [^117L53Mx].

- **Sitosterolemia**: A rare genetic disorder characterized by elevated plant sterol levels, xanthomas, and premature cardiovascular disease [^112jSsdU].

---

## Xanthomas and cardiovascular risk

The presence of xanthomas — particularly tendon xanthomas — is strongly associated with **increased cardiovascular risk** [^114a9HkH]. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have tendon xanthomas have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease than those without xanthomas [^116a4Jrk]. Xanthomas share pathophysiological mechanisms with atherosclerosis — lipid accumulation and inflammation — underscoring their significance as cardiovascular risk markers [^113GdY1e].

---

## Xanthomas and pancreatitis risk

Eruptive xanthomas are often associated with severe hypertriglyceridemia, which markedly increases the risk of **acute pancreatitis** [^117L53Mx]. Hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis can cause substantial morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognized and treated [^11345Vy9].

---

## Xanthomas and systemic diseases

Xanthomas can also be **associated with systemic diseases** beyond lipid disorders, including [^111mwmAv]:

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Associated with eruptive xanthomas due to severe hypertriglyceridemia [^11345Vy9].

- **Hypothyroidism**: Can cause secondary hyperlipidemia and xanthoma formation [^111mwmAv].

- **Cholestatic liver disease**: Associated with plane xanthomas due to abnormal lipid metabolism [^111mwmAv] [^114dQXtw].

- **Nephrotic syndrome**: Can cause secondary hyperlipidemia and xanthoma formation [^111mwmAv].

- **Monoclonal gammopathies and hematologic malignancies**: Diffuse plane xanthomas can be associated with monoclonal gammopathies, multiple myeloma, and other hematologic malignancies [^114KgoKi] [^113wFqc1].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation of xanthomas

The presence of xanthomas should **prompt thorough diagnostic evaluation** to identify underlying lipid or systemic diseases [^111mwmAv]. Recommended tests include:

- **Lipid profile**: Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides [^114GY9Hx].

- **Liver function tests**: To assess for cholestatic liver disease [^114dQXtw].

- **Thyroid function tests**: To evaluate for hypothyroidism [^11688xTb].

- **Blood glucose levels**: To assess for diabetes mellitus [^115ynsnV].

- **Genetic testing**: For familial hypercholesterolemia or other genetic lipid disorders [^111Y6gye].

- **Hematologic evaluation**: For monoclonal gammopathies or hematologic malignancies in cases of diffuse plane xanthomas [^113wFqc1].

---

## Management and treatment

Management of xanthomas involves **addressing the underlying lipid disorder or systemic disease** with lipid-lowering therapy (statins, fibrates, niacin, omega-3 fatty acids, and PCSK9 inhibitors) to reduce cholesterol and triglyceride levels [^114GY9Hx]; dietary modification with a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet [^114nqQXj]; and treatment of diabetes, hypothyroidism, or liver disease [^111mwmAv]. Surgical or laser removal may be considered for cosmetic reasons or symptomatic relief in selected cases [^111Y9MZP].

---

Xanthomas are **important clinical markers** of serious underlying conditions — particularly disorders of lipid metabolism — and signal risk for cardiovascular disease, pancreatitis, and other systemic diseases. Early recognition and appropriate diagnostic evaluation are crucial to identify and manage the cause, thereby reducing the risk of serious complications [^117GjkYn].

### Familial hypercholesterolaemia [^1129c4Vz]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). High credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia is a disease that can be associated with various conditions, including planar xanthomas, tendon xanthomas, and aortic stenosis. Other related conditions are cerebrovascular disease, xanthelasma palpebrarum, and ankle pain, along with elevated serum cholesterol, ischemic heart disease, and corneal arcus. Patients may also experience peripheral vascular disease, hypercholesterolemia, arthralgia, tuberous xanthomas, and elevated serum LDL.

### Cutaneous manifestations of monoclonal gammopathy [^114KgoKi]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Diffuse normolipemic plane xanthoma associated with monoclonal gammopathy is characterized by xanthelasma (periorbital plane xanthoma) and diffuse plane xanthoma of the head, neck, trunk, shoulders, or extremities. Xanthomas normally occur in hyperlipidemic patients; however, in rare cases, they can occur in patients with normal lipid profiles. Normolipemic plane xanthoma can be associated with MGUS, multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, lymphoma, and Castleman disease. The skin lesions are described as yellowish-orange plaques. The pathogenesis is unknown, but immune complex formation between antibodies and lipoproteins seems to cause the accumulation of lipids in macrophages.

Plane xanthoma should be differentiated from necrobiotic xanthogranuloma by their diffuse and plane patches. Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma are more polymorphic and tend to be described as red-brown, violaceous, or yellowish cutaneous plaques, papules, or nodules. In patients with limited lesions, surgical resection or ablative laser therapy can be performed. Otherwise, systemic treatment with bortezomib, melphalan, and/or high-dose corticosteroids can be used to achieve hematologic and cutaneous remission.

Scleromyxedema, a primary dermal diffuse mucinosis, was first described by Dubruilh and Reitmann as a skin disease similar to scleroderma. Mucinoses are characterized by mucin deposits in connective tissue. The skin demonstrates dense, firm, waxy, reddish or skin-colored, dome-shaped or flat-topped papules of 2–3 mm in size. It typically involves the hands, head, and upper trunk.

### Acute pancreatitis with eruptive xanthoma [^11345Vy9]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Eruptive xanthomas are benign skin lesions caused by localized deposition of lipids in the dermis. Xanthomas can present as early manifestations of systemic disorders, which are typically caused by elevated levels of serum triglycerides and uncontrolled diabetes. Early recognition and treatment of the underlying condition decrease morbidity and mortality. After treatment of the underlying metabolic disorders, lesions mostly disappear without leaving scars. We present a case with multiple yellowish, erythematous papules on the extremities suggestive of eruptive xanthomas, admitted to our hospital with acute pancreatitis.

### Differences in characteristics and risk of cardiovascular disease in familial hypercholesterolemia patients with and without tendon xanthomas: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116a4Jrk]. Atherosclerosis (2009). Low credibility.

Tendon xanthomas are characteristic of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). It is not clear whether FH patients with xanthomas have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than those without xanthomas. The clinical diagnosis of FH in patients without xanthomas requires the presence of CVD in the patient or a first-degree relative. This requirement may have masked the association between xanthomas and CVD in several studies. A diagnosis of FH based on the presence of a mutation in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene is free from this selection on CVD. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we compared the risk of CVD between patients heterozygous for the LDLR mutation, with and without xanthomas.

- **Methods and results**: We conducted a literature search using PubMed and the Web of Science up to January 14, 2009. We selected all articles examining more than 25 human heterozygous FH patients that provided information about xanthomas. Articles had to be written in a Western European language. A total of 22 articles were suitable for analysis. A genetic confirmation of FH was compulsory to correctly assess the risk of CVD with the presence of xanthomas. Age, male gender, LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride level were associated with the presence of xanthomas (p < 0.05 for all). In patients with genetically confirmed FH, xanthomas were associated with a 3.20-fold higher risk of CVD (95% CI 2.12–4.82, p < 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: Xanthomas are associated with a threefold higher risk of CVD among FH patients, suggesting that xanthomas and CVD may share etiology.

### Dietary treatment for familial hypercholesterolaemia [^114nqQXj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia is an inherited disorder characterized by elevated blood cholesterol levels, the presence of xanthomatosis, and premature ischemic heart disease. The primary aim of treatment is the reduction of blood LDL cholesterol concentrations to lower the risk of ischemic heart disease. Treatment typically involves a cholesterol-lowering diet, either alone or combined with drug therapy. However, many of the drugs effective in treating adult patients are not licensed for use in children. Consequently, diet becomes the main treatment for children with familial hypercholesterolaemia. Besides the cholesterol-lowering diet, several other dietary interventions are suggested; however, there is no consensus yet on the most appropriate dietary treatment for both children and adults with this condition.

- **Objectives**: To examine the evidence that, in children and adults with familial hypercholesterolaemia, a cholesterol-lowering diet is more effective at lowering cholesterol and reducing the incidence of ischemic heart disease than no intervention or other dietary interventions.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Trials Register, a specialist trials register that comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals, and handsearching abstract books of conference proceedings. Additional studies were identified from handsearching the Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (from its inception in 1978 to 2000) and from reference lists.

### The triad of pruritus, xanthomas, and cholestasis: Two cases and a brief review of the literature [^113h3pYJ]. Pediatric Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

When encountered in children, xanthomas are most commonly associated with a group of disorders known as familial hyperlipidemias. Aside from cosmetic concerns, these xanthomas are typically asymptomatic; however, when generalized pruritus is a prominent associated symptom, clinicians should consider a different set of diagnoses that includes cholestasis of the liver. In this article, we present two illustrative cases of children with cholestatic disease, pruritus, and xanthomas and discuss other disorders that may include this triad.

### Omega-3-induced xanthoma in a child: A case report [^111FoVou]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

A skin biopsy image revealed dense foamy histiocytes throughout the dermis. The fasting lipid profile indicated the patient was diagnosed with tuberoeruptive xanthomas on the elbows and knees, as well as plane xanthomas on the popliteal fossae and palms. These conditions were caused by severe hypercholesterolemia, which was secondary to excessive omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. The primary differential diagnoses included familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), type 3 hyperlipoproteinemia, and drug-induced hypercholesterolemia.

Although genetic testing for FH or type 3 hyperlipoproteinemia was not conducted, the normalization of lipid levels following the cessation of omega-3 supplementation provided strong support for the diagnosis of drug-induced hypercholesterolemia.

The patient was referred to the pediatric endocrinology department for further management. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation was discontinued, and plasmapheresis was recommended to rapidly reduce cholesterol levels. However, the parents declined the plasmapheresis.

During follow-up, the patient's total cholesterol and LDL levels returned to normal, and the skin lesions resolved, leaving postinflammatory hyperpigmentation within one year.

Due to the rarity of lipodystrophy syndromes, many clinicians are unfamiliar with their diagnosis and management. In December 2015, an expert panel, including representatives from endocrine societies around the world, convened to generate this practice guideline. Evidence was rated using the system of the American Heart Association. Details of the literature review, consensus, and endorsement process are provided in the guideline.

### Familial hypercholesterolaemia is underdiagnosed and undertreated in the general population: Guidance for clinicians to prevent coronary heart disease: consensus statement of the European Atherosclerosis Society [^111Y6gye]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Probands (index cases) should be identified based on specific criteria: plasma total cholesterol ≥ 8 mmol/L (≥ 310 mg/dL) in an adult or adult family member(s) (or > 95th percentile by age and gender for the country), premature coronary heart disease (CHD) in the subject or family member(s), tendon xanthomas in the subject or family member(s), and sudden premature cardiac death in a family member.

For child probands, criteria remain the same as for adults, except that plasma total cholesterol should be ≥ 6 mmol/L (≥ 230 mg/dL) in a child or child family member(s) (or > 95th percentile by age and gender for the country). The highest likelihood of detecting familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is among those with very high LDL cholesterol levels, tendon xanthomas, and/or premature CHD in a family member.

Drawing a family pedigree is essential to evaluate the likelihood of FH. In cases of probable or definite FH, cascade screening using LDL cholesterol measurement in the family should be conducted. The subject should be referred for genetic testing if available, followed by cascade testing in the family if a causative mutation is found. Initial family members to be tested include biological first-degree relatives, such as parents, siblings, and children. Biological second-degree relatives, including grandparents, grandchildren, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, and half-siblings, should also be considered. 'Premature CHD' signifies CHD before age 55 in males and before age 60 in female first-degree relatives, while in second-degree relatives, the corresponding ages differ slightly.

### Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis associated with immune thrombocytopenia [^111rycqq]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a lipid storage disease inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. CTX is characterized by childhood-onset cataracts, adolescent to young adult-onset tendon xanthomas, and adult-onset progressive neurological dysfunction, which includes dementia, psychiatric disturbances, pyramidal, and/or cerebellar signs, and seizures. Xanthomas typically appear in the second or third decade of life and are found on the Achilles tendon, the extensor tendons of the elbow and hand, the patellar tendon, and the neck tendons.

The biochemical abnormalities distinguishing CTX from other conditions with xanthomas include high plasma and tissue cholestanol concentration, normal-to-low plasma cholesterol concentration, and decreased chenodeoxycholic acid. Long-term treatment of individuals with CTX using chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) normalizes bile acid synthesis, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of cholestanol, and improves neurophysiological findings. Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy 3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase, either alone or in combination with CDCA, are also effective in decreasing cholestanol concentration and improving clinical signs; however, they may induce muscle symptoms.

### Xanthoma of rib: a case report and review of the literature [^115xWoSt]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Xanthomas are well-circumscribed benign proliferative lesions seen mainly in soft tissues. They are usually found in conditions such as hyperlipidemia and familial hyperlipoproteinemia. Histologically, xanthomas are characterized by macrophage-like mononuclear cells, multinucleated giant cells, and abundant foam cells. Bone involvement is generally rare, and rib localization is extremely rare.

- **Case presentation**: A 55-year-old man underwent a chest X-ray, followed by a computed tomography scan, revealing a rib lesion that was surgically removed. The diagnosis confirmed it as a rib xanthoma. The patient also had an unknown condition of hyperlipidemia.

- **Conclusion**: Rib xanthoma can be discovered accidentally and may be helpful in identifying an unrecognized condition of hyperlipidemia.

### Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: A complex interplay between a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition [^116yWeFN]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive lipid storage disease characterized by abnormal bile acid synthesis. It often presents with systemic and neurological manifestations; however, atypical presentations can lead to significant diagnostic challenges. This case report highlights the diagnostic complexities and management considerations in a patient with an uncommon presentation of CTX.

We present a patient with a 25‐year history of spastic paraparesis, initially suggestive of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), who was ultimately diagnosed with CTX associated with a novel CYP27A1 variant of uncertain significance (VUS).

A 53‐year‐old Greek woman presented with a 25‐year history of slowly progressive spastic paraparesis. Initial investigations were largely unremarkable, leading to a presumptive diagnosis of a hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP)-like syndrome. After five years of slow disease progression, the patient developed right ankle swelling. MRI revealed significant enlargement of the Achilles tendon, suggestive of xanthoma infiltration. Subsequent genetic testing identified a homozygous variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in the CYP27A1 gene. Biochemical analyses revealed elevated cholestanol levels and cholestanepentol glucuronide in urine, confirming the diagnosis of CTX. Treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid stabilized her condition over three years, but advanced disease limited efficacy in improving disability.

This case highlights the diagnostic challenges associated with CTX.

### Diffuse normolipemic plane xanthoma in a child with common variable immunodeficiency [^111zeGzC]. Pediatric Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Diffuse plane xanthoma is extremely rare in children. Although it may be associated with systemic disorders, its etiology remains obscure in a number of patients. The case of a boy with common variable immunodeficiency and normal serum lipid levels, who developed diffuse plane xanthoma during treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins, is reported.

### Diffuse xanthomas in a patient with primary biliary cholangitis and lipoprotein X [^114dQXtw]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Cutaneous xanthomas are common cutaneous lesions that arise from localized deposits of lipid in the dermis. Their presence often represents an underlying disorder of lipid metabolism. The morphology of cutaneous xanthomas can suggest a particular lipid disorder. For example, the presence of tuberous, tendinous, and plane xanthomas can be associated with primary type II and III hyperlipidemia.

Less commonly, xanthomas occur in the setting of secondary dyslipidemia, such as cholestasis in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). PBC is an autoimmune disease of the biliary tree, which causes progressive destruction of the small intrahepatic bile ducts, resulting in cirrhosis. Dyslipidemia is seen in 75% of patients with PBC and arises in part due to the accumulation of an abnormal lipoprotein called lipoprotein X, which carries large quantities of cholesterol in the blood. As a result, patients may present with similar patterns of xanthomas as those seen in type II or III hyperlipidemia. Herein, we present a case of diffuse and multiple types of xanthomas arising in association with lipoprotein X in PBC. Our case demonstrates a constellation of xanthomas that can be seen in cases of lipoprotein X-associated dyslipidemia and reminds us to consider this unique pathophysiology in our workup for xanthomas.

### Inflammasome activation aggravates cutaneous xanthomatosis and atherosclerosis in ACAT1 (Acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase 1) deficiency in bone marrow [^115JhFbf]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2018). Low credibility.

ACAT1 (Acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase 1) esterifies cellular free cholesterol, converting macrophages into cholesteryl ester-laden foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions and cutaneous xanthoma. Paradoxically, however, loss of ACAT1 in bone marrow causes the aggravation of atherosclerosis and the development of severe cutaneous xanthoma in hyperlipidemic mice. It has been reported that cholesterol crystals activate NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR [leucine-rich repeats], and PYD [pyrin domain] domain-containing protein 3) inflammasomes, contributing to the development of atherosclerosis. This study aimed to clarify the role of NLRP3 inflammasomes in the worsening of atherosclerosis and cutaneous xanthoma induced by ACAT1 deficiency.

- **Approach and results**: Ldlr-null mice were transplanted with bone marrow from WT (wild type) mice and mice lacking ACAT1, NLRP3, or both. After the four types of mice were fed high-cholesterol diets, their atherosclerosis and skin lesions were compared. Mice transplanted with Acat1-null bone marrow developed severe cutaneous xanthoma, characterized by numerous macrophages, cholesterol clefts, and markedly increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, along with increased atherosclerosis. Loss of NLRP3 completely reversed the cutaneous xanthoma, whereas it improved the atherosclerosis only partially. Acat1-null peritoneal macrophages showed enhanced expression of CHOP (C/EBP [CCAAT/enhancer binding protein] homologous protein) and TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α) but no evidence of inflammasome activation.

### Diffuse normolipemic plane xanthoma in a 9-year-old boy [^113xawxg]. Pediatric Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Normolipemic plane xanthoma typically occurs in adults. We report the atypical instance of a 9-year-old boy who developed disseminated, flat, yellow-brown plaques measuring up to 2 to 3 cm without any complaints. The histology showed the hallmarks of xanthoma, including the presence of CD68+ foam cells and Touton giant cells. There was no evidence of systemic involvement or lipid disorders. Regular follow-up of these patients is important because normolipemic plane xanthoma often precedes myeloproliferative disorders such as leukemia, paraproteinemia, or lymphoma.

### Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: Clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, pathogenesis, and therapy [^114uAxL3]. Journal of Child Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

In this report, we review the clinical, biochemical, pathophysiologic, and therapeutic aspects of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. We stress the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. In addition, we describe our experience in treating patients with chenodeoxycholic acid, an essential drug for this disorder that is no longer available.

### Tuberous xanthomas in sitosterolemia [^112jSsdU]. Pediatric Dermatology (2000). Low credibility.

Sitosterolemia is an autosomal recessive lipid disorder characterized by extremely elevated plasma plant sterol levels, with cholesterol levels often elevated but sometimes normal. Clinically, sitosterolemia manifests as xanthomas, premature vascular disease, and arthritis. Adolescent boys and girls with sitosterolemia are at risk of fatal cardiac events. Dermatologists may play a crucial role in diagnosing this rare but serious condition, as early detection and treatment are vital in preventing associated atherosclerotic heart disease. We present a case of a 7-year-old girl with sitosterolemia and tuberous xanthomas.

### Diffuse xanthomas in a patient with lipoprotein X hyperlipidemia [^113CFGDq]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: We report a rare case of diffuse xanthomas presenting in a patient with LpX-mediated hyperlipidemia. LpX as a cause of cutaneous xanthomas has been rarely reported. Both LpX-induced hypercholesteremia and isolated LpX increase lipid accumulation in human monocyte and human monocyte-derived macrophage experiments, respectively. LpX hyperlipidemia, secondary to PSC, was likely the cause of our patient's diffuse xanthomas.

Limited descriptions of cutaneous xanthomas in the setting of LpX exist in the literature. Generally, the xanthomas reported have had similar morphologies to those of our patient but have been distributed less diffusely. Three of the six reported patients with cutaneous xanthomas and LpX hyperlipidemia had primary biliary cholangitis, whereas two had PSC. All six reported cases were women, with ages ranging from 28 to 51 years. In the only other well-documented case of diffuse xanthomas secondary to LpX we have identified, the patient experienced resolution of pruritus and notable improvement of xanthomas five months after liver transplant. Of the three patients treated with plasmapheresis to manage their LpX-related lipid abnormalities, all three experienced improvement or complete regression of their xanthomas.

Although cases of xanthomas secondary to LpX hyperlipidemia are rare in general, we identified only one other case reporting such diffuse distribution. Moreover, the present case is highly distinct in the involvement of additional factors.

### Diagnosis and treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [^117REBWk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is clinically diagnosed based on a weighted combination of physical findings, personal or family history of hypercholesterolemia, early-onset atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and the concentration of circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Extensor tendon xanthomas, particularly in the Achilles, subpatellar, and hand extensor tendons, with extremely elevated LDL-C levels, are considered specific for FH. Severe extensor tendon xanthomas have histological features that resemble foam cell formation and lipid accumulation in atherosclerotic plaques. Consequently, there is a modest correlation between the extent of tendon xanthomas and the extent of coronary atherosclerosis. However, as previously noted, in children and young adults, a family history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and elevated LDL-C levels are often the only findings.

The fasting LDL-C concentration is included in all diagnostic criteria and serves as the foundation for FH diagnosis; however, nonfasting lipid testing may be used for initial screening. Blood sampling for the diagnosis of FH should preferably be avoided during acute illnesses or while taking medications known to increase LDL-C, such as cyclosporine, amiodarone, hydrochlorothiazide, and chlorthalidone. Chronic illnesses that elevate LDL-C, such as hypothyroidism and liver or renal impairment, should be ruled out.

Although the diagnosis of FH can be made on the basis of clinical features, genetic testing may provide additional insight regarding cardiac risk and diagnosis. Recent data from case studies suggest the importance of genetic testing in understanding the condition fully.

### Diffuse xanthomas in a patient with primary biliary cholangitis and lipoprotein X [^111X1x9X]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Lipoprotein X is an atypical lipoprotein detected at increased levels in the serum of patients with severe cholestatic disease. The accumulation of lipoprotein X was previously considered to be due to the reflux of biliary lipoproteins into the systemic circulation. However, recent evidence suggests that lipoprotein X is generated in hepatocytes and secreted directly into the blood. Lipoprotein X has a unique composition of apoproteins, including ApoA1, ApoE, and ApoC, which allows it to carry large quantities of phospholipids and free cholesterol in almost equal parts. As a result, lipid profiles in patients with advanced cholestasis show striking elevations in the total cholesterol, high triglycerides, and low high-density lipoprotein levels. The patients are, therefore, susceptible to developing diffuse xanthomas. Indeed, an in vitro study in which lipoprotein X was incubated with human monocyte-derived macrophages demonstrated that lipoprotein X is directly responsible for foam-cell formation.

As was seen in our patient, the clinical presentation of xanthomas is similar to what would be expected in type II and type III hyperlipidemia, with xanthelasma, tendinous xanthomas, xanthomas in the intertriginous areas, and xanthoma striatum palmare. Though limited case reports have described similar patterns of cutaneous xanthomas in patients with lipoprotein X, none have reported a patient with such diffuse and simultaneous involvement of multiple xanthoma subtypes yet.

Overall, the pathogenesis of lipoprotein X-mediated dyslipidemia and xanthoma formation requires further investigation.

### Xanthomas heralding pediatric coronary artery disease [^116xwxRY]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia is a form of genetic or primary dyslipidemia, affecting 0.2% of the population. Children with familial hypercholesterolemia are subject to early atherosclerosis, leading to a greater risk of coronary events. The presence of xanthomas should thus prompt a thorough evaluation for an underlying lipid abnormality because early detection and aggressive treatment are key. We report a case of a pediatric patient with xanthomas misdiagnosed as keloids who presented with premature coronary artery disease.

### Eruptive xanthomas masquerading as molluscum contagiosum [^115ynsnV]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Eruptive xanthomas are cutaneous manifestations of hyperlipidemias in which lipids accumulate in large foam cells within the skin. They classically present as crops of 1- to 4-mm yellow-orange papules and are often associated with extreme hypertriglyceridemia. We describe a 12-year-old boy with autism who was thought to have widespread molluscum contagiosum for a year before dermatologic consultation was obtained. Recognition of eruptive xanthomas led to the discovery of massive hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglycerides 6853 mg/dL) and diabetes mellitus. Through medical intervention, including insulin and fenofibrate therapy, and dietary modification with weight loss, the xanthomas cleared during the subsequent months, and his serum triglyceride levels nearly normalized.

### Diffuse xanthomas in a patient with lipoprotein X hyperlipidemia [^112b6kMi]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

A 30-year-old woman with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), Crohn's disease, and lipoprotein X (LpX) hyperlipidemia presented for evaluation of new-onset pruritic skin lesions on her shoulders and arms. She reported that her rash started three weeks before her clinic visit. Attempts to treat the lesions with topical steroids were unsuccessful. She had a medical history of biopsy-confirmed reactive perforating collagenosis and granuloma annulare on the trunk and extremities for which she was previously monitored.

On examination, yellowish to hypopigmented coalescing papules and small plaques were present on the bilateral neck, extending onto the shoulders and upper portion of the arms. She also had diffuse follicular hyperpigmented papules over the bilateral lower and upper portions of the legs, back, and bilateral arms, which were consistent with her prior reactive perforating collagenosis diagnosis. A punch biopsy from the right side of her neck showed a brisk proliferation of xanthomatized histiocytes in the papillary, mid, and reticular dermis, with foci of necrobiosis and mucin deposition. Mucin deposition was attributed to concomitant granuloma annulare. There was also extracellular deposition of lipid.

The biopsy from the right side of the neck (Fig 1) showed the following findings:

- **Hematoxylin and eosin stain**: (A, B, and C) showing a brisk proliferation of xanthomatized histiocytes and reactive granulomas in the dermis.
- **Alcian Blue stain**: (D) highlighting increased mucin deposition. (A, B, and C, Hematoxylin-eosin stain; original magnifications: A, 4×; B, 10×; C, 40×).

### Type iii hyperlipoproteinemia with xanthomas and multiple myeloma [^117314n5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Type III hyperlipoproteinemia usually results from an inherited defect in the composition of apolipoprotein E and is associated with atherosclerosis. An acquired form of the type III phenotype may rarely be associated with myeloma and immunoglobulin-lipoprotein complexes.

- **Observation**: We present the case of a 72-year-old man with a history of well-controlled, unclassified hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, without evidence of atherosclerotic disease. He subsequently developed refractory dyslipidemia, palmar crease, and tuberous xanthomas. Type III hyperlipoproteinemia was confirmed, and nonclassic defective apolipoprotein E. Common secondary causes of hyperlipidemia were ruled out. A workup for malignancy revealed monoclonal IgA gammopathy. Immunostaining confirmed IgA antibodies complexed to the patient's very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) fraction, causing gross impairment of VLDL metabolism. Conventional therapy for type III hyperlipoproteinemia was attempted but ineffective. Thus, chemotherapy was initiated for his myeloma, with subsequent lowering of his IgA, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, and improvement of his xanthomas.

- **Conclusion**: There are several unusual features to this case. Planar xanthomas can be associated with myelomas, but usually in the setting of normal lipids. Type III hyperlipoproteinemias are not usually refractory to standard therapy and are only rarely associated with IgA myeloma. IgA antibodies complexed to the patient's VLDL caused gross impairment of VLDL metabolism.

### Plane xanthoma [^112Tr9dt]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

- **Figure captions**: Fig 1 shows yellow plaques on the face. Fig 2 presents yellow plaques on the chest. Fig 3 details histopathology images: A displays pale cells throughout the dermis (H&E 40×), while B illustrates a diffuse collection of pale cells throughout the dermis with many lipid-laden foamy histiocytes (H&E 200×). H&E stands for hematoxylin and eosin.

- **Question**: What is the most likely etiology for this patient's plane xanthomas?
	- A. AIH and PBC overlap syndrome
	- B. Familial hypercholesteremia
	- C. Familial hypertriglyceridemia
	- D. Multiple myeloma
	- E. Systemic lupus erythematosus

- **Answer discussion**: The correct answer is (A) AIH and PBC overlap syndrome. The formation of xanthomas due to secondary hyperlipidemia in conditions such as PBC has been extensively described, with xanthomas reported to occur in almost 6% of patients with PBC. Plane xanthomas in association with PBC often begin on the hands and feet and can become generalized. It is hypothesized that the formation of plane xanthomas of cholestasis is due to the accumulation of unesterified cholesterol, specifically lipoprotein X, leading to significant dyslipidemia and skin findings. Resolution of plane xanthomas typically requires treatment of the underlying cholestasis. Medical management of dyslipidemia is first-line but rarely resolves xanthomas; thus, liver transplantation may be necessary for restoring biliary drainage, lipid-level stability, and subsequent xanthoma improvement. In addition to surgical excision, cosmetic therapies such as chemical peels or lasers are temporizing measures. They do not address the underlying cholestasis, and the lesions may return if the root cause is untreated.

### Xanthoma of rib: A case report and review of the literature [^112Vy8qh]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Xanthomas are well-circumscribed benign proliferative lesions primarily observed in soft tissues. They are usually associated with hyperlipidemia and familial hyperlipoproteinemia. Histologically, these lesions are characterized by macrophage-like mononuclear cells, multinucleated giant cells, and abundant foam cells. However, bone involvement is notoriously rare, with rib localization being extremely rare.

- **Case presentation**: A 55-year-old man underwent a chest X-ray and a subsequent chest computed tomography scan, which revealed a rib lesion. This lesion was surgically removed, and a diagnosis of rib xanthoma was made. The patient was found to have an unknown condition of hyperlipidemia.

- **Conclusion**: Rib xanthoma can be discovered incidentally and may aid in identifying an unrecognized condition of hyperlipidemia.

### Xanthoderma: a clinical review [^113PznnE]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007).

"Xanthoderma" is a term that describes a yellow to orange macular discoloration of the skin. The cause of this finding ranges from benign to potentially life-threatening disease. At the time of writing, the literature fails to comprehensively review the various causes and workup of this clinical manifestation. This article discusses the etiopathogenesis of xanthoderma and suggests a novel diagnostic algorithm for clinicians to use in the initial evaluation of this condition.

### Diffuse xanthomas in a patient with lipoprotein X hyperlipidemia [^113ZxE5W]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Cutaneous xanthomas are characterized by benign lipid deposits in the dermis. Clinical variants include eruptive xanthomas, tendinous xanthomas, tuberous xanthomas, plane xanthomas, and verruciform xanthomas. Xanthomas can be idiopathic but typically occur in association with inherited or acquired dyslipidemias. Although cutaneous xanthomas, particularly xanthelasma, are common lesions seen by dermatologists, patients rarely present with diffuse xanthomas.

Lipoprotein X (LpX) is an abnormal, structurally distinct lipoprotein indicative of cholestasis and is seen in liver diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). LpX formation is a nonfamilial cause of hyperlipidemia. While the pathophysiology and epidemiology of LpX-induced hyperlipidemia have not been fully elucidated, therapy relies on the treatment of the underlying cholestatic disease. Here, we report a case of diffuse xanthomas presenting in a patient with LpX hyperlipidemia.

### Xanthoma disseminatum with extensive koebnerization associated with familial hypertriglyceridemia [^117KvWKW]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

The main differential diagnosis in our patient included eruptive xanthomas and other non-LCH disorders. Eruptive xanthomas are small yellowish papules with an erythematous halo distributed over the buttocks, shoulder, and extensor aspects of the limbs. They commonly appear in crops and resolve spontaneously within a few weeks, although lesions may wax and wane with plasma triglyceride levels. In eruptive xanthomas, triglyceride levels are usually greater than 1000 mg/dL, and mucosae are uninvolved. Tuberous and tendon xanthomas are associated with raised total cholesterol and LDL levels.

Other non-LCH disorders, such as generalized eruptive histiocytosis, progressive nodular histiocytosis, multicentric reticulohistiocytosis, and Erdheim-Chester disease, can be differentiated from XD mainly based on the distribution of lesions. Mucosal involvement and a predilection for the flexural and intertriginous areas would favor a diagnosis of XD. Erdheim-Chester disease is a multisystemic non-LCH characterized by involvement of bones, visceral organs, central nervous system, and skin xanthomas. In Erdheim-Chester disease, skeletal radiographs would show the characteristic features of symmetric sclerosis involving the distal portions of long bones.

Recently, molecular genetic clonal markers have been identified in histiocytic disorders, such as generalized eruptive histiocytosis and Erdheim-Chester disease. Such markers would make the distinction among histiocytic disorders more accurate because the phenotypic markers (F13+/fascin/S100-) are less so.

### Eruptive xanthomas: Importance of recognition to reduce delay of effective triglyceride reduction [^117L53Mx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Eruptive xanthomas are localized lipid deposits in the dermis and serve as an important early clue to severe hypertriglyceridemia. These small erythematous or yellow papules localize to the extensor surfaces of extremities, buttocks, and the back and are often overlooked during routine visits due to poor familiarity and limited skin examinations. We present three cases of patients with eruptive xanthomas and severe hypertriglyceridemia who underwent skin biopsy and waited weeks to years before receiving effective treatment.

- **Recommendations to minimize delay**: First, perform a comprehensive skin examination. Second, be mindful of the association between metabolic syndrome or diabetes with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Third, evaluate the Four D's of secondary hypertriglyceridemia: diet/lifestyle, drugs/medications, and diseases/disorders of metabolism. Finally, initiate effective treatment promptly after recognition. This includes beginning with a minimal-fat diet and appropriate pharmacological intervention to control triglycerides as outlined in recent guidelines.

### Serum lipids and risk of atherosclerosis in xanthelasma palpebrarum: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114zospc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

The association between dyslipidemia and xanthelasma palpebrarum (XP) remains controversial, and no definite evidence has indicated atherosclerosis risk in patients with XP.

- **Objective**: The present study was a systematic review and meta-analysis to elucidate the association of serum lipid profiles and risk of atherosclerotic diseases with XP.

- **Methods**: We systematically searched for the eligible comparative studies published before April 15, 2019, in the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library. A random-effects model was used to calculate the standard mean difference with a 95% confidence interval for each pooled estimate.

- **Results**: The qualitative analyses included 15 case-control studies with 854 patients with XP. Compared with the controls, the patients with XP had significantly higher serum levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins, significantly higher apolipoprotein B levels, relatively lower apolipoprotein A1 levels, and the carotid intima-media thickness was significantly higher.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with XP had significantly higher serum levels of atherogenic low-density lipoproteins and bore significantly higher risk of atherosclerosis than the controls. Careful monitoring and targeted intervention for prevention of cardiovascular diseases is essential for these patients.

### Unmasking of childhood hypothyroidism by disseminated xanthomas [^11688xTb]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Secondary hyperlipidemia is a common laboratory finding in children with nephrotic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. However, clinical signs of hyperlipidemia are extremely rare in childhood. We report on an 11-year-old girl who presented with a disseminated yellow papulomatous rash on the lower limbs and yellow skin creases on the palms of her hands. Blood tests yielded an opaque serum with a triglyceride concentration of 820 mg/dL and cholesterol of 1050 mg/dL. A skin biopsy of one of the papules confirmed the diagnosis of xanthomas. Additional examinations revealed clinical signs such as weight gain and a diminished growth rate, as well as biochemical primary hypothyroidism (free T4: 0.4 ng/L [normal 8–22 ng/L]; thyroid-stimulating hormone: > 200 mU/L). This was a consequence of Hashimoto thyroiditis (thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin: 4400 U/mL and > 2000 U/mL, respectively; normal < 60 U/mL). The patient was started on L-thyroxine, which led to a gradual decline of cholesterol and triglycerides to normal concentrations and a complete remission from the xanthomatous rash. For the first time, this case depicts disseminated xanthomas of the skin as the presenting complaint of severe hypothyroidism.

Papular xanthoma is a rare normolipemic xanthomatous skin disease primarily occurring in adults. Although this uncommon disorder has been documented in children, nearly all reported cases in the literature had a normal lipid profile.

### Nodular excision for painful localized Achilles tendon xanthomas in type II hyperlipoproteinemia: A case report [^112Q4Weq]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Achilles tendon xanthomas are often associated with type II hyperlipoproteinemia, in which low-density lipoprotein derived from the circulation accumulates in the tendons. Sometimes, coronary artery disease can jeopardize the life of the patient if the condition is neglected. We describe the case of bilateral painful Achilles tendon xanthomas in a heterozygous type II hyperlipoproteinemia family. Her symptoms were not alleviated despite anti-inflammatory medication and eccentric exercise for six months. She was treated with nodular excision of the xanthomas bilaterally and then with postoperative statins to avoid recurrence.

### Extensive papulonodular xanthoma: A diagnostic clue to homozygous familial hyperlipidaemia [^115o6HcM]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A man in his early 30s presented with multiple soft tissue swellings over the buttocks, around the knees, ankles, and dorsum of both hands since childhood. His father and paternal uncle had similar lesions, and his father had coronary artery disease. One of his sisters had a history of sudden death due to an unknown cause at 14 years. The patient and his parents had very high serum levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein, leading to a clinical diagnosis of familial hyperlipidaemia type II. Larger lesions were excised in stages, and histopathological evaluation revealed the lesions to be eruptive xanthoma. A cardiac assessment revealed no significant abnormality. Lipid-lowering agents and low-dose aspirin were started, and the patient was advised to have regular cardiology and endocrine evaluations. This case emphasizes its rare presentation and the importance of early diagnosis and management to prevent any untoward future incidence.

### Numerous intertriginous xanthomas in infant: A diagnostic clue for sitosterolemia [^11346nMi]. The Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Sitosterolemia is a very rare autosomal recessive lipoprotein metabolic disorder caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in one of the two adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter genes, ABCG5 and ABCG8. It is clinically characterized by xanthomas and atherosclerosis, arthritis, fever, hemolysis, and macrothrombocytopenia, even in early childhood.

We described a 16-month-old girl who had numerous yellowish-brown intertriginous xanthomas along the skin creases on the extremities, with severe hypercholesterolemia and elevated plant sterol levels. Histopathologically, the xanthoma showed aggregation of foam cells in the dermis with a zone of mucin deposits in the dermal papilla. Electron microscopy revealed numerous membrane-bound lipid droplets and multivesicular lipid bodies in the foam cells, a round cell containing lipid droplets in the basal cell layer, and abundant mucin deposits just beneath the basal lamina. Diagnosis of sitosterolemia was confirmed by DNA sequencing, showing compound heterozygosity for previously reported missense mutations in exon 9 of ABCG5.

Infants presenting with multiple xanthomas should be investigated for sitosterolemia if there is no family history of dyslipidemia.

### Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis — the spectrum of imaging findings [^1133PTcQ]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), also known as Van Bogaert-Scherer-Epstein disease, is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder of lipid metabolism. At the time of writing, there are fewer than 300 cases reported worldwide. We present a case of a 30-year-old male who presented with mental retardation and swelling of the ankles, exhibiting a spectrum of CTX imaging findings. Imaging studies performed included plain X-ray, ultrasound (US), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of both the brain and ankles. These indicated the diagnosis of CTX with the entire spectrum of findings, which was confirmed with biopsy and laboratory findings. CTX is a potentially treatable condition with replacement therapy, and hence, early diagnosis before neurological deterioration is crucial. Imaging findings are conclusive for the diagnosis of CTX.

### Xanthoma of rib: a case report and review of the literature [^117GNGC7]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Based on the mode of onset and the contextual state of hyperlipidemia, it is possible to classify bone xanthoma as reported in previous studies: xanthomatous variant xanthomatous changes in advanced stages of skeletal benign or malignant pre-existing lesions; secondary xanthoma forms in the skeletal system of type 2 and 3 hyperlipidemic patients; and primary xanthoma with normal lipid metabolism. This classification may be helpful to allow diagnosis and treatment.

Xanthoma of the rib is an exceptional localization and has been previously described in nine other cases as a condition frequently associated with thoracic trauma. Bertoni et al. identified 21 cases of bone xanthoma between 1919 and 1988. Three cases of xanthoma of the rib were present, associated with soft tissue xanthomas and pain in the rib cage. Lee et al. reported the case of a 64-year-old man without a history of chest trauma and hypercholesterolemia but with chest pain.

Another three cases were reported by McDermott et al. Blanco et al. reported the case of a rib xanthoma secondary to thoracic trauma, in which the remodeling fibrous component prevailed over the lipid component. Recently, Chon et al. reported the case of a patient with rib xanthoma presenting with chest pain and mucocutaneous lesions without hyperlipidemia. This lesion was subjected to thoracoscopic rib resection due to the strong primary suspicion of an osteochondroma.

### Epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) [^1156fKcC]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of bile acid synthesis caused by mutations in the cytochrome P450 CYP27A1 gene that result in the production of a defective sterol 27-hydroxylase enzyme. CTX is associated with abnormally high levels of cholestanol in the blood and the accumulation of cholestanol and cholesterol in the brain, tendon xanthomas, and bile. Hallmark clinical manifestations of CTX include chronic diarrhea, bilateral cataracts, tendon xanthomas, and neurologic dysfunction.

Although CTX is a rare disorder, it is thought to be underdiagnosed because the presenting signs and symptoms may be nonspecific and overlap significantly with other more common conditions. There is marked variability in signs and symptoms, severity, and age of onset between patients. The disease course is progressive and potentially debilitating or fatal, particularly concerning neurologic presentations that can include intellectual disability, autism, behavioral and psychiatric problems, and dementia, among others.

Treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA; chenodiol) is the standard of care. CDCA can help restore normal sterol, bile acid, bile alcohol, and cholestanol levels. CDCA also appears to be generally effective in preventing adverse clinical manifestations of the disease from occurring or progressing if administered early enough. Improved screening and awareness of the condition may help facilitate early diagnosis and treatment.

### Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: new insights and guidance for clinicians to improve detection and clinical management. A position paper from the Consensus Panel on Familial Hypercholesterolaemia of the European Atherosclerosis Society [^115URxwg]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Although not exclusively associated with HoFH, the presence of cutaneous or tuberous xanthomas in children is highly suggestive of diagnosis. Evidence of arcus corneae reinforces the clinical diagnosis. As observed for LDL-C levels, variability in the age of appearance and the extent of xanthomas can be partly explained by the underlying mutations, with earlier appearance of xanthomas associated with receptor-negative versus receptor-defective status. Cholesterol deposits in the tendons and joints may lead to tendinitis and joint pain, impairing the quality of life for patients; these may require surgical removal. In rare cases, patients may present with giant ectopic cholesterol xanthomas in the brain, mediastinum, and muscles of the buttock. As referral following the appearance of xanthomas in young children is frequently the key driver of HoFH diagnosis, prompt recognition is crucial to early diagnosis. The presence of markedly elevated LDL-C levels and the absence of neurological, cognitive, and ophthalmic symptoms in patients with HoFH distinguish them from patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.

- **Family history**: A careful family history is essential for comprehensive assessment of possible FH.

### Psychiatric signs and symptoms in treatable inborn errors of metabolism [^116ecsw5]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a lipid storage disease characterized by infantile-onset diarrhea, childhood-onset cataract, adolescent-to-young adult-onset tendon xanthomas, and adult-onset progressive neurological dysfunction and psychiatric disturbances.

- **Genetics and pathogenesis**: CTX is caused by a deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase, leading to the accumulation of cholestanol and cholesterol in nearly every tissue. Mutations in CYP27A1 are the only known genetic cause of CTX. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

- **Clinical features**:
	- **Neuropsychiatric signs**: Intellectual disabilities occur in the early twenties in more than 50% of individuals. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as behavioral changes, hallucinations, agitation, aggression, depression, and suicidal attempts, may be prominent. Behavioral/personality disorder is the most frequent psychiatric manifestation across all age groups, especially in patients younger than 26 years, followed by mood/affective disorders. In patients older than 26 years, psychiatric pathology becomes more complex, with a richer semeiology often occurring in the context of pre-dementia/dementia.
	- **Neurological signs**: Pyramidal and/or cerebellar signs become evident at 20–30 years of age.
	- **Gastrointestinal signs**: Chronic diarrhea from infancy may be the earliest clinical manifestation.
	- **Eye signs**: In approximately 75% of affected individuals, cataracts are the first finding, usually in the first decade of life.
	- **Skin signs**: Xanthomas associated with the condition can appear, although the text was cut off here.

### Coronary heart disease in a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis [^111mx4tV]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Coronary heart disease is a prevalent condition and a leading cause of death in developed countries. Most cases are due to the cluster of classical risk factors, such as smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, and dyslipidemia. However, a few patients develop severe and premature arteriosclerosis despite the absence of common risk factors. Here, we present the clinical, analytical, and molecular features of a 36-year-old man who died from advanced ischemic heart disease as a result of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), a rare condition characterized by elevation in plasma and most tissues of cholestanol, where neurological impairment is the hallmark of this disease. We discuss the relevance of heart disease and the mechanism leading to accelerated arteriosclerosis in CTX.

### Xanthoma of rib: A case report and review of the literature [^113ZzbJ9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Xanthomatous lesions of the skin, blood vessels, abdominal viscera, and reticuloendothelial organs commonly occur as a complication of hyperlipidemic states. Primarily, they appear in male and obese patients, where lipids form deposits in soft tissue. These lesions are usually found in hyperlipidemia and familial hyperlipoproteinemia, though only a few cases have been observed without these conditions.

Bone involvement is notoriously rare. The most frequent localizations are the diaphysis of long bones, especially the tibia. The skull may also be involved, including mastoid air cells, mandibular bone, and temporal or frontal bone, which can cause cerebellar compression. The axial skeleton is not spared, with cases of xanthoma in the sacrum and calcaneus documented in the literature.

### Xanthoma striatum palmare and biliary tract atresia: An unusual association [^112BxixU]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Cutaneous xanthomas develop as a result of lipid deposition in the dermis and may be a manifestation of various systemic diseases. The morphology and anatomic location of xanthomas often provide clues to the underlying cause. Xanthoma striatum palmare (XSP) is classically associated with dysbetalipoproteinemia and is rarely observed in hepatic disorders. We present a case of a 2-year-old child diagnosed with XSP and biliary tract atresia.

### Impact of clinical signs and genetic diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia on the prevalence of coronary artery disease in patients with severe hypercholesterolaemia [^114a9HkH]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

- **Aims**: The impact of positive clinical signs, such as xanthoma and/or family history, and positive familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) mutation status on the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), in addition to that predicted by low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level alone, has not been fully determined. We assessed whether positive clinical signs and genetic FH diagnosis affected CAD risk among subjects with significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels (≥ 180 mg/dL, or ≥ 140 mg/dL in subjects with certain characteristics). It was found that individuals with both positive clinical signs and positive FH mutation diagnosis had 11-fold higher odds of developing CAD (OR, 11.6; 95% CI, 4.4–30.2; P = 1.1×10^-5) after adjusting for known risk factors, including LDL cholesterol.

- **Conclusion**: Our findings revealed an additive effect of positive clinical signs of FH and positive FH mutation status on CAD risk among patients with significantly elevated LDL cholesterol.

### Two siblings with tuberous xanthomas: Case report [^115ANNuz]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Tuberous xanthomas, a variety of the broad category of xanthomas, result from abnormalities in the lipoprotein metabolism, often familial in nature. These nodular swellings typically arise over the extensor aspect of the body, such as the elbows and knees. A worrisome entity associated with them is uncontrolled hyperlipidemia, especially in young individuals. Here, we present two young brothers with such rare clinical signs and other manifestations of hyperlipidemia, highlighting that a thorough head-to-toe examination with the right set of investigations can aid in diagnosis and management.

### Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: A complex interplay between a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition [^116Jq614]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

This case highlights the diagnostic challenges associated with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), stemming from its relative rarity and significant clinical heterogeneity. The patient's 25-year course illustrates the propensity of CTX to mimic other neurodegenerative disorders like hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and primary lateral sclerosis (PLS). The absence of classic features at presentation, including cataracts, tendon xanthomas, chronic diarrhea, and ataxia, often delays diagnosis and the commencement of disease-modifying agents. The initial negative gene panel testing, which did not include CYP27A1, further contributed to the diagnostic delay in this case. This emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive differential diagnosis and stepwise exclusion of treatable metabolic conditions like CTX with biomarker testing in the absence of targeted gene panels or exome sequencing.

This case also illustrates the challenges in interpreting variants of uncertain significance (VUS), which are common in rare diseases like CTX, where limited genotype–phenotype correlations can lead to ambiguity in predicting pathogenicity. The laboratory classification of the CYP27A1 variant as a VUS, in the absence of further supporting evidence, highlights this complexity. Resolving VUS relies on reconciling clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings, and applying standardized variant classification criteria like the ACMG guidelines. The emergence of xanthomatosis proved pivotal in prompting re-evaluation of the diagnosis and the classification of the CYP27A1 VUS as pathogenic, when combined with disease-specific biochemical findings, including substantially elevated serum.

### Xanthoma of bone: First sign of hyperlipidemia type IIB: A case report [^114AsKAe]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2003). Low credibility.

A xanthoma, located in the ulna, was not accompanied by the traditional cutaneous and tendinous manifestations (xanthoma and xanthelasma) and displayed a late onset of alterations in lipid values. It was diagnosed in a 56-year-old man. The lesion had slow but constant growth, leading to internal calcifications. Hyperlipidemia Type IIB occurred 15 years after the xanthoma was first detected by radiographs. In this patient, the xanthoma of bone was the first sign of dyslipidemia.

### Eruptive xanthoma in the setting of hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis [^1116nJoZ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Undifferentiated dermatologic complaints are often encountered in the emergency department. While a patient's exposures, risk factors, and comorbidities may help guide emergency department evaluation, the accurate diagnosis of dermatologic findings is critical to allowing rapid identification and treatment of disease.

- **Case**: In this vignette, we discuss a case of eruptive xanthoma in a 33-year-old male with diabetic ketoacidosis and pancreatitis.

- **Discussion**: Dermatologic complaints pose a unique challenge to the emergency physician. Many dermatologic findings are benign; however, some may represent underlying serious disease even in young, otherwise healthy-appearing patients. Eruptive xanthomas are cutaneous lesions often indicating severe hypertriglyceridemia and uncontrolled diabetes. Likely presentations and risk factors for eruptive xanthomas will be discussed, as well as emergency department evaluation and management.

### Comparison of the risk of fatal coronary heart disease in treated xanthomatous and non-xanthomatous heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: a prospective registry study [^115JCh3T]. Atherosclerosis (2003). Low credibility.

A clinical diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is often made in the absence of tendon xanthomata (TX), which are not usually present before the fourth decade of life. The prognosis of treated non-xanthomatous (TX-) FH is uncertain. The objective of this study was to compare mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients with treated TX+ (definite) and TX- (possible) heterozygous FH.

- **Methods**: A diagnosis of definite or possible FH was based on raised cholesterol levels (> 7.5 mmol/l) and a family history of premature CHD or hypercholesterolaemia. Patients were recruited from 21 outpatient lipid clinics in the UK from 1980 to 1998. The cohort of 1,569 patients with TX+ FH were followed for 12,754 person-years and the cohort of 1,302 patients with TX- FH for 10,238 person-years. The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated from the ratio of the number of deaths observed to the number expected in the general population of England as well as Wales (SMR = 100 for reference population).

- **Findings and discussion**: CHD accounted for 64 (63%) of the 102 deaths in the TX+ cohort and 38 (57%) of the 67 deaths in the TX- cohort, with the SMR for a fatal coronary event being, respectively, 294 (95% confidence interval 228, 380, P < 0.00001) and 205 (95% CI 145, 282, P = 0.0001). The similarly elevated CHD mortality risk suggests that, in adulthood, both groups of patients should be treated equally aggressively with HMG Co A reductase inhibitors (statins).

### Normolipemic papuloeruptive xanthomatosis in a child [^115PMtZn]. Pediatric Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Normolipemic papuloeruptive xanthomatosis is a very rare skin disorder. We report a case of a child with yellowish papular eruptions on the face that rapidly merged into confluent plaques. Serum lipid profiles showed normolipemia, and a diagnosis of normolipemic papuloeruptive xanthomatosis with no associated systemic disorders was made. The skin lesions involuted spontaneously during follow-up.

### Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: A report of 3 cases [^111DAwHF]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare, autosomal recessive metabolic disease affecting bile acid synthesis. Mutations in the CYP27A1 gene result in a faulty sterol 27-hydroxylase, leading to derangements in lipid metabolism, with the accumulation of cholestanol and cholesterol in the form of xanthomas throughout the central nervous system, eyes, and tendons. The incidence is as high as 5 per 100,000 individuals of European ancestry, with approximately 300 reported cases worldwide. While individuals often develop signs and symptoms early in life, most are diagnosed during the fourth decade, when their disease has progressed to an advanced state. We report 3 cases of CTX with similar clinical symptoms to emphasize the importance of early detection.

### Pathogenesis and treatment of xanthomatosis associated with monoclonal gammopathy [^113wFqc1]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Xanthomas are a common manifestation of lipid metabolism disorders. They include hyperlipemic xanthoma, normolipemic xanthoma, and a related condition, necrobiotic xanthogranuloma (NXG). All three forms can be associated with monoclonal immunoglobulin (MIg). To enhance diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of this association, we retrospectively analyzed a personal series of 24 patients (2 with hyperlipemic xanthoma, 11 with normolipemic xanthoma, and 11 with NXG) and 230 well-documented reports from the literature.

With the exception of the nodules and plaques featured in NXG, the clinical presentation of xanthomatous lesions usually resembled those seen in common hyperlipidemic forms and could not be used to suspect MIg-associated xanthomas. Extracutaneous sites were not rare. The MIg was an IgG in 80% of cases. Myeloma was diagnosed in 35% of patients. Hypocomplementemia with low C4 fraction was present in 80% of studied patients. Low C1 inhibitor serum levels were found in 53%. Cryoglobulinemia was detected in 27%. These abnormalities suggest immune complex formation due to interactions between the MIg and lipoproteins and argue in favor of a causal link between MIg and xanthomas. Monoclonal gammopathy therapy could thus be an option. Indeed, among the patients who received chemotherapy, hematologic remission was accompanied by improvement in xanthoma lesions in several cases.

### An atypical presentation of a rare disease [^115camYD]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Answers:

- **Xanthelasma**: Incorrect. Xanthelasmas are noninflammatory soft yellow-orange cholesterol-containing lesions usually present on the eyelids. Histologically, xanthelasmas contain foam cells in the papillary dermis.

- **NXG**: Correct. NXG usually presents with multiple asymptomatic lesions. Lesions of NXG typically first appear on the trunk or extremities in 60% to 70% of patients, then eventually progress to characteristic periorbital involvement in 80% to 85% of cases. Patients commonly present with an indurated papule, nodule, or plaque with a yellowish hue, sometimes with telangiectasias, atrophy, or ulceration. Histologically, palisading granulomas are usually seen in the dermis. The granulomas often contain lipidized histiocytes (foam cells), giant cells, plasma cells, and cholesterol clefts.

- **NL**: Incorrect. NL presents as an evolving lesion beginning with red to brown papules or plaques progressing into an atrophic, telangiectatic, yellow lesion. NL and NXG share similar features microscopically, including hyalinized collagen within the necrobiotic area. However, NXG often displays Touton cells and atypical giant cells and may be distinguished histologically by cholesterol clefts within the granuloma. NL displays lipids altering with collagen bundles, causing a layering of hyalinized collagen described as a wedding cake appearance.

- **Sarcoidosis**: Incorrect. Cutaneous sarcoid often presents with bilaterally symmetrical red-brown-colored lesions. The hallmark on pathology is the presence of naked tubercles, meaning the presence of epithelioid cell granulomas.

### Multifocal xanthoma of bone [^117Jh4zq]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

We report a case of a 40-year-old woman with hyperlipidemia and associated multifocal xanthoma of bone requiring prophylactic fixation of her bilateral femurs. Although xanthomas of bone are themselves a benign process, their presence may indicate that the patient has poorly controlled lipids and is at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Lytic lesions may require prophylactic fixation to prevent pathologic fracture.

### First and only symptom of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus: Eruptive xanthoma [^113Q3Fsm]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Eruptive xanthoma (EX) is a very rare dermatosis that mostly occurs due to high levels of serum triglycerides or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. When EX is encountered, it is important to recognize that it could be a sign of severe underlying metabolic derangements. Early recognition can help avoid serious complications such as pancreatitis. After treatment of the underlying metabolic disorders, lesions mostly disappear without leaving scars. We present a case of a 55-year-old woman who presented solely with EX lesions and was eventually diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and severe hypertriglyceridemia.

### Diffuse xanthomas in a patient with primary biliary cholangitis and lipoprotein X [^111Y9MZP]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

The management of xanthomas in patients with lipoprotein X involves addressing the underlying cause of cholestasis. Lipid-lowering agents can be used, but they often achieve limited success. Therapeutic plasma exchange is the treatment of choice for patients who develop complications of hyperviscosity syndrome; however, it leads only to partial xanthoma regression. For xanthelasma, destructive methods such as 70% trichloroacetic acid chemical peels and carbon dioxide laser therapy have been described. The effects are temporary as long as dyslipidemia persists. As seen in our patient, a liver transplant is often the only means to restore biliary drainage and lipid homeostasis, thereby improving the xanthomas.

In summary, we present a rare case of cutaneous xanthomas arising secondary to lipoprotein X in a patient with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Our case demonstrates the diverse morphologies of xanthomas that can be observed in patients with lipoprotein X and highlights an underappreciated pathway, which should be considered in our approach to treating cutaneous xanthomas. Indeed, in our patient, the presence of the xanthomas initially prompted diagnostic testing and led to her diagnosis of PBC. Considering this pathophysiology enhances our understanding of the assessment of the cutaneous manifestations of this systemic disease.

### Omega-3-induced xanthoma in a child: A case report [^116ffHT6]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: Xanthomas predominantly consist of foam cells, which are macrophages engorged with oxidized LDL particles extravasated from blood vessels. The patient's total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were significantly high, and the xanthomas were consistent with lipid-laden macrophage infiltration, presenting as nodular and plaque-like skin lesions on the elbows, knees, popliteal fossae, and palms.

Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, are known for their triglyceride-lowering effects and cardiovascular benefits. However, DHA can paradoxically raise LDL-C levels, with studies showing a significant increase of 7.23 mg/dL, while EPA has a milder effect. In this case, excessive omega-3 intake likely overwhelmed the child's ability to maintain lipid balance, leading to elevated serum LDL-C and xanthoma formation. According to guidelines, for children aged 4–8 years, the recommended daily intake of omega-3 fatty acids is 900 mg/day, focusing on DHA and EPA. The dosage increases to 1200 mg/day in boys aged 9–13 years. In this case, the child had been consuming 3 or more capsules daily, amounting to 3000–4000 mg, which far exceeded the recommended pediatric dosage.

The primary differential diagnoses for xanthomas in this child included familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), type 3 hyperlipoproteinemia, and drug-induced hypercholesterolemia. FH, a genetic disorder, presents with elevated LDL-C and early-onset xanthomas. However, the normalization of lipid levels after stopping omega-3 supplementation strongly ruled out FH and type 3 hyperlipoproteinemia.

### Practical approach to the diagnosis of adult-onset leukodystrophies: an updated guide in the genomic era [^111rZL3X]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is an autosomal recessive disorder of bile acid synthesis caused by mutation of the cytochrome P450 gene CYP27A1, resulting in the production of defective sterol 27-hydroxylase. Consequently, CTX is associated with high levels of cholestanol in plasma and its accumulation in tissue. This gives rise to hallmark clinical manifestations of chronic diarrhoea, bilateral cataracts, tendon xanthomas or tendon thickening, and neurological dysfunction.

Typical neurological manifestations can include intellectual disability, autism, behavioural and psychiatric problems, dementia, ataxia, and epilepsy. MRI studies show cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, extensive white mater lesions of the spinal cord, and bilateral T2/FLAIR hyperintensity of the dentate nuclei and surrounding white matter.

Cholestanol concentrations are increased in plasma, brain, xanthomas, and bile. Increased quantities of bile alcohols are useful as a secondary diagnostic test. CSF levels of cholestanol, cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein A1, and albumin are increased.

Treatment is with chenodeoxycholic acid (a cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase enzyme inhibitor), which is effective in improving biochemical findings, and in those without advanced disease, may improve or stabilize neurological features.

- **MTHFR deficiency**: Autosomal recessive mutations in the MTHFR gene cause a spectrum of symptoms, with onset ranging from childhood to adulthood. Biochemically, there are elevated plasma homocysteine, homocystinuria, and low methionine levels. Patients may develop seizures and cognitive issues.

### Papular xanthomas and erosive arthritis in a 3 year old girl, is this a new MRH variant [^112XzPgt]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of xanthomas and arthritis is short but includes familial hypercholesterolemia type II and sitosterolemia. Familial hypercholesterolemia type II is a common, autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the LDL receptor gene that may present with xanthomatous lesions and oligoarthritis. Sitosterolemia is a rare, autosomal recessive lipid disorder characterized by extremely elevated plasma plant sterol levels. It is clinically characterized by tuberous skin and tendon xanthomatous lesions, arthritis, and premature vascular disease. Our patient had normal lipid levels and sterol screening, which ruled out these diagnoses.

Other disorders like Von Gierke glycogen storage disease and Farber's disease can present with xanthomas and joint complaints. The lack of systemic involvement and progressive course did not support these diagnoses in our patient. The lack of osteochondrodystrophy, ocular findings, and family history in our patient excluded familial histiocytic dermatoarthritis and dermochondrocorneal dystrophy as possible diagnoses. Xanthoma disseminatum, also part of the non-Langerhans histiocytic disorder spectrum, typically occurs in teenagers and young adults. The skin lesions are described as yellow to brown growths forming plaques and nodules that can present anywhere on the skin but most commonly in flexural areas of the extremities, the eyelids, and mucosae; visceral involvement has been described. Case reports of skeletal involvement presenting with limb pain caused by bone infiltration of xanthomas exist, but no cases of joint involvement have been reported in children.

### The risk of tendon xanthomas in familial hypercholesterolaemia is influenced by variation in genes of the reverse cholesterol transport pathway and the low-density lipoprotein oxidation pathway [^113GdY1e]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The presence of tendon xanthomas is a marker of high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). Therefore, xanthomas and atherosclerosis may result from the same pathophysiological mechanisms. Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation are pathophysiological pathways of atherosclerosis, and it is well established that genetic variation in these pathways influences CVD risk. We therefore determined whether genetic variation in these pathways is also associated with the occurrence of tendon xanthomas in FH patients.

- **Methods and results**: Four genetic variants in each pathway were genotyped in 1208 FH patients. We constructed a gene-load score for both pathways. The odds of xanthomas increased with the number of the risk alleles in the RCT pathway (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.08–1.36, P(trend) = 0.0014). Similarly, higher numbers of risk alleles in the LDL oxidation pathway were associated with the presence of xanthomas (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.08–1.41, P(trend) = 0.0015).

- **Conclusion**: The presence of tendon xanthomas in FH patients is associated with genetic variation in the RCT and LDL oxidation pathways. These results support the hypothesis that xanthomas and atherosclerosis share pathophysiological mechanisms.
