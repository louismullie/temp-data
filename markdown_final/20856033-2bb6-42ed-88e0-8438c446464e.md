## Question

what is the problem with taking qsymia and vyvanse

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the problem is with taking Qsymia (phentermine/topiramate) and Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) together, what the risks are, and what the recommendation should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and overlapping mechanisms. Then, I should analyze cardiovascular risks. Next, I will assess CNS and psychiatric risks, followed by metabolic and other adverse effects. I should confirm abuse and dependence concerns, review contraindications and drug–drug interactions, and check whether any evidence supports this combination. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and special population considerations, verifying each claim against labeling and high-quality sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the drug classes and mechanisms to ensure I am not missing a key overlap. Qsymia combines phentermine, a sympathomimetic amine anorectic, with topiramate, which has GABAergic modulation, carbonic anhydrase inhibition, and glutamatergic effects; its weight loss mechanism is multifactorial and not fully defined [^111Lj1KD] [^111E7p3o]. Vyvanse is lisdexamfetamine, a prodrug of d-amphetamine, producing CNS stimulant effects via increased synaptic catecholamines, particularly dopamine and norepinephrine, with once-daily pharmacokinetics designed to limit rapid peaks but still clearly sympathomimetic [^112VXyai]. The key pharmacodynamic overlap is dual catecholaminergic stimulation from phentermine and d-amphetamine, which I need to treat as potentially additive for heart rate, blood pressure, and CNS activation unless proven otherwise [^111Lj1KD] [^11721Qv8].

> I will now examine cardiovascular risk, because that is the most immediate safety concern with stacking sympathomimetics. Vyvanse labeling warns of increased blood pressure and heart rate and advises against use in patients with serious cardiac disease, structural abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious arrhythmia, or coronary artery disease, and it carries explicit MAOI-related hypertensive crisis risk [^11721Qv8] [^117VtbgR]. Qsymia labeling states its effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been established and highlights that safety and effectiveness in combination with other weight-loss products have not been established, which pushes me to be conservative when adding another stimulant [^117Eanwh]. Phentermine labeling and short-term phentermine products (e.g. Lomaira) warn about primary pulmonary hypertension and valvular disease historically observed with fenfluramine–phentermine; while most valvulopathy cases involved fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine, rare PPH has been reported with phentermine alone, so I should not dismiss this signal outright when adding another sympathomimetic [^112qumo3] [^116NbKho]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: some observational and trial analyses of phentermine/topiramate show BP reductions and no large signal for increased MACE over short exposures, likely mediated by weight loss, but these data do not include coadministration with amphetamine stimulants and have wide confidence intervals, so they cannot reassure me here [^11517Pbd] [^115dmwQC].

> Next, I should review CNS and psychiatric risks to avoid underestimating additive effects. Vyvanse can exacerbate psychosis, precipitate mania, and cause new psychotic or manic symptoms even at recommended doses; insomnia, irritability, and anxiety are common stimulant effects, so dual agents could intensify them [^113PXM9e] [^116WFQKA]. Qsymia's topiramate component can cause cognitive impairment, including attention, memory, and word-finding difficulties, which could interplay unpredictably with stimulant effects on attention and arousal; if topiramate is stopped abruptly, seizures can occur even in patients without epilepsy, which complicates any rapid medication changes if adverse effects emerge [^115oNUbk] [^114itd6u]. Wait, let me verify the net direction of these CNS effects: while stimulants may transiently counteract some topiramate-related cognitive slowing, the labels emphasize risk, not synergy, and the combination increases the overall likelihood of insomnia, agitation, and mood destabilization, which I cannot ignore clinically [^113PXM9e] [^115oNUbk].

> I need to check metabolic and other overlapping adverse events because topiramate adds unique risks. Topiramate is associated with metabolic acidosis and nephrolithiasis, and when combined with a stimulant that suppresses appetite and may reduce oral intake, dehydration risk and acidosis could worsen, especially during rapid weight loss or intercurrent illness [^112ujaK5]. Ophthalmologic events with topiramate, including acute myopia and secondary angle-closure glaucoma, require vigilance if patients report visual changes, and the presence of another activating drug could delay recognition of prodromal symptoms like headache or agitation [^1156EK7u]. I should also confirm indication boundaries: Vyvanse is not indicated or recommended for weight loss, and using it to augment Qsymia's appetite suppression would be off-label and specifically discouraged by labeling given serious cardiovascular events associated with other sympathomimetics used for weight loss [^1143UD34]. In pediatrics, both agents can affect growth parameters, so any combined use would need careful height and weight velocity monitoring, although the combination itself has not been evaluated in this population [^113PXM9e] [^115oNUbk].

> I should confirm abuse, misuse, and dependence risks because stacking a Schedule II stimulant with a Schedule IV sympathomimetic changes the risk calculus. Vyvanse is a Schedule II controlled substance with high abuse and misuse potential, capable of producing euphoria, psychosis, and potentially fatal overdose, and can lead to substance use disorder and physical dependence, with characteristic withdrawal on discontinuation [^112VXyai] [^111aC35Q]. Qsymia contains phentermine, a Schedule IV controlled substance with known abuse potential and physiologic dependence, and abrupt cessation of topiramate risks seizures, further complicating any attempt to promptly stop therapy if misuse emerges [^111aC35Q]. Hold on, I should verify whether abuse liability is mitigated by lisdexamfetamine's prodrug design; while oral abuse liability may be somewhat attenuated compared with immediate-release d-amphetamine, substantial abuse, misuse, and diversion risks remain and are emphasized in labeling, so stacking with phentermine still increases overall abuse liability and monitoring needs [^114itd6u] [^112VXyai].

> Next, I should review formal contraindications, warnings, and drug interactions to ensure I am not missing a labeled prohibition. Both products are contraindicated with MAOIs within 14 days due to hypertensive crisis risk, and Qsymia is contraindicated in pregnancy, glaucoma, and hyperthyroidism, any of which would preclude combined use outright [^112oiK97] [^117VtbgR]. Let me consider pharmacokinetic interactions: Vyvanse has few CYP-mediated interactions, but urinary pH can alter amphetamine exposure substantially, which could be relevant if topiramate or diet changes alter acid–base balance; mechanistically, the primary concern here remains pharmacodynamic, not CYP-based [^117Q6iJT]. I should double-check labeling on combination use: Qsymia's label states the safety and effectiveness of Qsymia in combination with other products intended for weight loss has not been established, and short-term phentermine labeling explicitly does not recommend coadministration with other weight-loss drugs, which reinforces avoiding a second appetite-suppressing sympathomimetic for weight loss augmentation [^117Eanwh] [^112qumo3].

> I will now examine whether any clinical evidence supports or refutes coadministration with stimulants. I need to check for randomized or observational studies of Qsymia plus Vyvanse; I do not find trials or labeling data evaluating this combination, and no cardiovascular outcomes data exist for the pair, so safety is essentially uncharacterized beyond mechanistic reasoning and label warnings [^117Eanwh] [^11721Qv8]. But wait, what if topiramate with amphetamine salts has been studied elsewhere; the ASAM/AAAP guideline suggests topiramate with extended-release mixed amphetamine salts for cocaine use disorder, implying some clinical experience with co-prescribing a stimulant and topiramate, but that context, dosing, and patient population differ markedly from obesity plus ADHD, and do not address adding phentermine or weight-loss outcomes, so it cannot be extrapolated to support Qsymia plus Vyvanse for weight control or ADHD management without dedicated data [^114d5sy8]. Real-world analyses of phentermine/topiramate have not shown large increases in MACE during relatively short-term use, but again, these datasets do not include concurrent amphetamine stimulants, leaving a significant evidence gap for the exact combination in question [^115dmwQC].

> Synthesizing this, my initial instinct is to say this combination is contraindicated due to additive sympathomimetic effects and unestablished safety. Wait, I should verify the precise regulatory language before I overstate it: it is not a labeled, absolute contraindication to coadminister Qsymia and Vyvanse, but it is off-label, not recommended for weight loss augmentation, and carries materially increased risks of hypertension, tachycardia, psychiatric destabilization, misuse, and complex discontinuation, with no supporting efficacy or safety data, so my clinical recommendation is to avoid coadministration in routine practice and pursue alternatives that do not stack sympathomimetics [^117Eanwh] [^1143UD34] [^11721Qv8]. If a patient with compelling indications for each agent is already on both under specialist oversight, I need to ensure strict monitoring: baseline and periodic blood pressure and heart rate, cardiac history and exam with low threshold for ECG in patients with risk factors, psychiatric screening for psychosis or mania, visual symptom monitoring, counseling on abuse/misuse and secure storage, and a clear plan for slow tapering if discontinuation is needed to avoid topiramate-withdrawal seizures and stimulant withdrawal symptoms, while avoiding any MAOI exposure and promptly addressing any signs of cardiopulmonary symptoms that could herald PPH or ischemia [^11721Qv8] [^115oNUbk] [^111aC35Q] [^116NbKho].

> Finally, I need to ensure special population and pregnancy considerations are front and center. Qsymia is contraindicated in pregnancy due to teratogenicity from topiramate, and Vyvanse should be avoided in pregnancy because amphetamines cross the placenta and have been associated with fetal harm; therefore, combined use in pregnancy is unacceptable, and effective contraception with regular pregnancy testing is required when Qsymia is prescribed to individuals who could become pregnant [^112oiK97] [^113qxoBw] [^11735mvy]. In renal impairment, exposures to both phentermine and topiramate rise as creatinine clearance declines, which could magnify cardiovascular and CNS risks if a stimulant is also on board, so I should dose-adjust Qsymia per label and reconsider any stimulant coadministration in moderate to severe CKD, favoring avoidance when possible and intensifying monitoring if use is unavoidable [^115FhU5x]. Given these layers of risk and the absence of supportive evidence, avoiding the combination is the most defensible, reference-aligned course for most patients, reserving any exceptions for carefully selected cases with explicit, shared decision-making and meticulous monitoring plans in place [^117Eanwh] [^11721Qv8].

---

The main problem with taking Qsymia and Vyvanse together is the **additive stimulant effects** from phentermine and lisdexamfetamine, which can cause **increased cardiovascular risk** (hypertension, tachycardia, arrhythmias) [^11721Qv8] [^117VtbgR] and **heightened psychiatric risk** (anxiety, insomnia, psychosis, mania) [^113Qc1jr] [^113PXM9e]. Both drugs are **controlled substances with abuse potential** [^112VXyai] [^114itd6u], and combining them increases the risk of dependence and withdrawal symptoms [^111aC35Q]. There is no established safety or efficacy for this combination, and **coadministration is not recommended**.

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms and interactions

Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine that increases norepinephrine release, which suppresses appetite and increases energy expenditure [^111Lj1KD]. Topiramate is an anticonvulsant that enhances GABA activity and inhibits glutamate receptors and carbonic anhydrase, contributing to appetite suppression and weight loss [^111Lj1KD]. Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine that increases norepinephrine and dopamine release [^112kexNQ] and is indicated for ADHD and binge eating disorder [^1143UD34]. Combining Qsymia and Vyvanse produces **additive stimulant effects** via overlapping mechanisms that increase norepinephrine and dopamine activity, leading to significant cardiovascular and psychiatric adverse effects [^113geqG7] [^11721Qv8].

---

## Cardiovascular risks

Both Qsymia and Vyvanse independently increase heart rate and blood pressure; combined use **significantly elevates cardiovascular risk**, including:

- **Hypertension and tachycardia**: Additive sympathomimetic effects can cause severe hypertension and tachycardia [^11721Qv8].

- **Arrhythmias**: Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias due to heightened sympathetic stimulation [^117VtbgR].

- **Cardiovascular events**: Elevated risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and other serious cardiovascular events, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions [^1143UD34].

---

## Psychiatric and neurological risks

Combined use of Qsymia and Vyvanse **significantly increases the risk** for psychiatric and neurological adverse effects, including [^113Qc1jr]:

- **Anxiety and insomnia**: Additive stimulant effects can exacerbate anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia [^116WFQKA].

- **Psychosis and mania**: Increased risk of psychotic or manic symptoms, particularly in patients with a history of psychiatric disorders [^113PXM9e].

- **Cognitive impairment**: Topiramate-associated cognitive dysfunction (memory, attention, language difficulties) may be exacerbated by stimulant-induced anxiety and insomnia [^115oNUbk] [^115GH7Qh].

---

## Abuse and dependence potential

Both Qsymia (via its phentermine component) and Vyvanse are controlled substances with known abuse and dependence potential. Combined use **increases the risk** of **abuse/misuse and addiction** due to additive stimulant effects [^112VXyai] [^114itd6u], and heightens the risk of **dependence and withdrawal** upon discontinuation [^111aC35Q].

---

## Contraindications and warnings

The combination of Qsymia and Vyvanse is **contraindicated or warrants strong caution** in patients with:

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Coronary artery disease, serious cardiac arrhythmias, structural cardiac abnormalities [^11721Qv8], or uncontrolled hypertension.

- **Psychiatric disorders**: History of psychosis, mania, or severe anxiety disorders [^113PXM9e].

- **Glaucoma**: Both medications are contraindicated in patients with glaucoma.

- **Pregnancy**: Both medications are contraindicated during pregnancy due to potential fetal harm.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and FDA labeling state that the safety and efficacy of Qsymia in combination with other weight-loss medications or stimulants have not been established, and such combinations are not recommended. Healthcare providers should **avoid coadministration** of Qsymia and Vyvanse due to the significant risks outlined above.

### Lomaira [^112qumo3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Lomaira™ tablets are indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss, including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine with these drug products is not recommended.

- **Primary pulmonary hypertension**: A rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs known as primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) has been reported in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope, or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope, or lower extremity edema, and these patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension.

- **Valvular heart disease**: Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic, and tricuspid valves, has been

### Qsymia [^117Eanwh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Qsymia is indicated in combination with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in:

- **Adults and pediatric patients**: Aged 12 years and older with obesity.
- **Adults with overweight**: In the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition.

Qsymia is a combination of phentermine, a sympathomimetic amine anorectic, and topiramate. It is indicated in combination with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term.

- **Limitations of use**:
	- The effect of QSYMIA on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been established.
	- The safety and effectiveness of QSYMIA in combination with other products intended for weight loss, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs, and herbal preparations, have not been established.

### Vyvanse [^113PXM9e]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Psychiatric adverse reactions**:

	- **Exacerbation of pre-existing psychosis**: CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder.

	- **Induction of a manic episode in patients with bipolar disorder**: CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed episode. Prior to initiating Vyvanse treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode, such as comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.

	- **New psychotic or manic symptoms**: CNS stimulants, at the recommended dosage, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania, in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing Vyvanse.

- **Long-term suppression of growth in pediatric patients**: CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial of Vyvanse in pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years old with ADHD, there was a dose-related decrease in weight in the Vyvanse groups compared to weight gain in the placebo group. Additionally, in studies of another stimulant, there was slowing of the increase in height [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in pediatric patients receiving long-term CNS stimulant treatment.

### Vyvanse [^112VXyai]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Controlled substance**: Vyvanse contains lisdexamfetamine, a prodrug of amphetamine, which is a Schedule II controlled substance.

- **Abuse**: Vyvanse has a high potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and precautions (5.1)]. Vyvanse can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution. Abuse is defined as the intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, to achieve a desired psychological or physiological effect. Misuse is the intentional use of a drug for therapeutic purposes by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is characterized by a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena, which may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g. continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, prioritizing drug use over other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence.

	- Misuse and abuse of lisdexamfetamine, a prodrug of amphetamine, may cause increased heart rate, respiratory rate, or blood pressure; sweating; dilated pupils; hyperactivity; restlessness; insomnia; decreased appetite; loss of coordination; tremors; flushed skin; vomiting; and/or abdominal pain. Anxiety, psychosis, hostility, aggression, and suicidal or homicidal ideation have also been observed with CNS stimulants abuse and/or misuse. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including Vyvanse, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)].

---

### Qsymia [^111aC35Q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Qsymia contains phentermine, a Schedule IV controlled substance, and topiramate, which is not a controlled substance.

- **Drug abuse and dependence**:
	- **Controlled substance**: Qsymia includes phentermine, a Schedule IV controlled substance, while topiramate is not controlled.

	- **Abuse**: Phentermine has a known potential for abuse. Abuse involves the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Phentermine is chemically and pharmacologically related to amphetamines, which have been extensively abused. Abuse may be linked to impaired control over drug use and severe social dysfunction. Reports indicate patients have increased dosages of these drugs to many times higher than recommended. Therefore, assess the risk of abuse before prescribing Qsymia as part of a weight reduction and long-term maintenance program for body weight.

	- **Dependence**: Physical dependence may occur in patients treated with Qsymia. This state develops due to physiological adaptation from repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.

		- For topiramate, abrupt discontinuation has been associated with seizures in patients without a history of seizures or epilepsy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].
		- For phentermine, abrupt discontinuation following prolonged high-dosage administration results in extended withdrawal symptoms.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for major depressive disorder in adults with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy [^112kexNQ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). High credibility.

Stimulants have long been considered possible treatment options for major depressive disorder (MDD), due in part to the role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of depression and its associated symptoms, such as anhedonia and lethargy. Methylphenidate was first investigated for the treatment of MDD as early as the 1950s. Additionally, meta-analyses conducted since 2003 have identified multiple trials that explored the use of stimulants or modafinil as adjuncts to antidepressants.

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX), a d-amphetamine pro-drug, is approved in the United States and other countries for individuals aged six years and older with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is also approved for adults with moderate to severe binge eating disorder in the United States and Canada. The effects of LDX augmentation therapy on depressive symptoms in individuals with MDD have been examined in two small phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept studies, as well as in two large phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.

In the first phase 2 study, LDX augmentation of escitalopram oxalate (ESC) monotherapy met predefined signal-detection criteria (prespecified critical α = 0.10) for significant reductions in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score compared to placebo in patients whose depression had not remitted with escitalopram monotherapy. The second phase 2 study focused on participants with partially to fully remitted MDD (MADRS total score ≤ 18) and examined executive dysfunction, finding that LDX augmentation of SSRI…

### Medications for the treatment of obesity in adolescents [^112ujaK5]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Common side effects with Qsymia include paresthesia, dry mouth, constipation, dysgeusia, insomnia, depression, and anxiety, with occurrences between 1% and 7%. Uncommon side effects that may be encountered include accelerated heart rate, impaired renal function, metabolic acidosis, and nephrolithiasis. As a safety precaution, depression and suicidal ideations should also be monitored.

Efficacy and safety were assessed in three major studies:

- **Controlled-release phentermine/topiramate in severely obese adults: a randomized controlled trial (EQUIP)**: This study evaluated the effects of the drug in severely obese adults.

- **Effects of low-dose, controlled-release, phentermine-plus-topiramate combination on weight and associated comorbidities in overweight and obese adults (CONQUER)**: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trial.

- **2-year sustained weight loss and metabolic benefits with controlled-release phentermine/topiramate in obese and overweight adults (SEQUEL)**: A randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III extension study.

Patients with BMIs between 27 kg/m² and 35 kg/m² were randomized to receive either placebo, the 7.5 mg/46 mg dose, or the 15 mg/92 mg dose. Total weight loss for participants in the EQUIP and CONQUER studies ranged from 3.5% to 6.6% for the 7.5 mg/46 mg dose and 8.6% to 9.3% for the 15 mg/92 mg dose. SEQUEL, an extension of the CONQUER study, showed prolonged health benefits and greater weight loss in both groups treated with phentermine/topiramate when compared with the placebo group after completing the 52-week extension. EQUATE investigated the difference in weight loss for phentermine and topiramate monotherapy compared with other treatments.

### Qsymia [^112oiK97]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Qsymia is contraindicated in patients who are pregnant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)], with glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)], and with hyperthyroidism. It is also contraindicated for those taking, or within 14 days of stopping, monoamine oxidase inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Known hypersensitivity to phentermine, topiramate, or any of the excipients in Qsymia, or idiosyncrasy to sympathomimetic amines, are additional contraindications [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

### SPL drug information for lisdexamfetamine dimesylate [^116WFQKA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Very common adverse reactions (over 10%) associated with the use of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate PO (also known as Vyvanse) include dry mouth, dystonia, epigastric pain, insomnia, irritability, and loss of appetite.

---

### Vyvanse [^114itd6u]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Studies have examined Vyvanse in drug abusers. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study assessed the abuse liability in 38 patients with a history of drug abuse. Single doses of 50, 100, or 150 mg of Vyvanse, 40 mg of immediate-release d-amphetamine sulfate (a controlled II substance), and 200 mg of diethylpropion hydrochloride (a controlled IV substance) were used. Vyvanse at 100 mg produced significantly fewer "drug liking effects" as measured by the Drug Rating Questionnaire-Subject score, compared to 40 mg of d-amphetamine; and 150 mg of Vyvanse demonstrated similar "drug-liking effects" compared to 40 mg of d-amphetamine and 200 mg of diethylpropion.

- **Intravenous administration**: Administering 50 mg of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate intravenously to individuals with a history of drug abuse elicited positive subjective responses on scales measuring "drug liking", "euphoria", "amphetamine effects", and "Benzedrine effects". These responses were greater than placebo but less than those produced by an equivalent dose (20 mg) of intravenous d-amphetamine.

- **Dependence - Physical dependence**: Vyvanse may produce physical dependence, a state that develops from physiological adaptation due to repeated drug use, and is manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms following abrupt discontinuation or significant dose reduction. Withdrawal symptoms following prolonged use of CNS stimulants, including Vyvanse, may include dysphoric mood, depression, fatigue, vivid unpleasant dreams, insomnia or hypersomnia, increased appetite, and various other symptoms.

### Qsymia [^111Lj1KD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, such as amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine). Drugs of this class are commonly known as "anorectics" or "anorexigenics". The effect of phentermine on weight reduction and long-term maintenance of body weight is likely mediated by the release of catecholamines in the hypothalamus, which results in reduced appetite and decreased food consumption. However, other metabolic effects may also be involved, although the exact mechanism of action is not known.

The precise mechanism of action of topiramate in terms of weight reduction and long-term body weight maintenance is also not fully understood. Its effect may be related to its ability to suppress appetite and enhance satiety, triggered by a combination of pharmacologic effects. These effects include augmenting the activity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyrate, modulation of voltage-gated ion channels, inhibition of AOBMPA/kainite excitatory glutamate receptors, or inhibition of carbonic anhydrase.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with drugs in this class.

- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: The effect of QSYMIA on the QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study (400 mg moxifloxacin), using a parallel group/crossover thorough QT/QTc study design. A total of 54 healthy subjects participated.

### The new weight-loss drugs, lorcaserin and phentermine-topiramate: Slim pickings [^115GH7Qh]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration approved two drugs for long-term weight loss: lorcaserin hydrochloride (Belviq; Eisai Inc) and phentermine-topiramate (Qysmia; Vivus Inc). The approvals were based on one-year trials showing that, in addition to recommendations to follow a calorie-restricted diet and increase exercise, patients randomized to either drug lost more weight than patients randomized to placebo (3% [95% CI, 3%-4%] more weight lost with lorcaserin; 7% [95% CI, 3%-4%] more with phentermine-topiramate).

The drugs have been associated with serious harms. Both drugs' labels include warnings about memory, attention, or language problems and depression. For lorcaserin, the label also warns of valvular heart disease and euphoria, and for phentermine-topiramate, the label warns of metabolic acidosis, increased heart rate, anxiety, insomnia, and elevated creatinine levels. Neither medication is marketed in Europe because of safety concerns. The manufacturer withdrew its application for lorcaserin in Europe after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said approval was unlikely, and the EMA rejected phentermine-topiramate.

In the United States, the required postmarketing safety trials are behind schedule. Until there is more convincing evidence about the cardiovascular safety of these drugs, physicians and patients should approach them cautiously. Patients who do not lose at least 5% of their body weight within 12 weeks of starting to take either drug should stop taking it, as stated in the prescribing information.

### SPL drug information for lisdexamfetamine dimesylate [^11735mvy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate PO (also known as Vyvanse) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use. Evidence of fetal harm in humans has been observed. Monitor neonates for withdrawal symptoms and sedation, as the active metabolite of lisdexamfetamine crosses the placenta. Amphetamines induce vasoconstriction, potentially reducing blood flow to the placenta. Furthermore, they may stimulate uterine contractions, increasing the risk of preterm labor and low birth weight.

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate PO is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. It has been taken by a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. However, studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Cardiovascular effects of phentermine and topiramate: a new drug combination for the treatment of obesity [^113geqG7]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Phentermine is an atypical amphetamine analogue that acts mainly to increase norepinephrine in the central nervous system (CNS), thereby suppressing appetite. Phentermine potently releases norepinephrine [half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) = 39.4 nmol/l], but shows weaker effects on the release of dopamine (IC 50 = 262 nmol/l) and serotonin (IC 50 = 3511 nmol/l). The drug is a weak substrate or uptake inhibitor of the serotonin transporter and has minimal effects on plasma serotonin in vivo. At plasma concentrations associated with low doses of phentermine (e.g. less than 20 mg), there is insufficient exposure to activate either dopamine or serotonin receptors.

Although increased catecholamine release may be perceived to increase the potential for adverse cardiovascular effects, norepinephrine released in the brain can act presynaptically to diminish sympathetic activity through a so-called clonidine-like effect. This mechanism may explain the observation that norepinephrine-uptake inhibitors, such as sibutramine, reboxetine, and desipramine, paradoxically decrease sensitivity to sympathetic stimuli.

### Qsymia [^115oNUbk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Cognitive impairment**: Qsymia can cause cognitive dysfunction, which may include impairment of concentration or attention, difficulties with memory, and speech or language problems, particularly word-finding difficulties. Rapid titration or high initial doses of Qsymia may be associated with higher rates of cognitive events such as attention, memory, and language or word-finding difficulties [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The concomitant use of alcohol or central nervous system (CNS) depressant drugs with Qsymia may potentiate CNS depression or other centrally mediated effects of these agents, such as dizziness, cognitive adverse reactions, drowsiness, light-headedness, impaired coordination, and somnolence. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain Qsymia therapy does not affect them adversely. Caution patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving Qsymia. If cognitive dysfunction persists, consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of Qsymia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

- **Slowing of linear growth**: Qsymia is associated with a reduction in height velocity (centimeters of height gained per year) in obese pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years. In a 56-week study, average height increased from baseline in both Qsymia- and placebo-treated patients; however, a lower height velocity of -1.3 to -1.4 cm/year was observed in Qsymia-treated compared to placebo-treated patients. Monitor height velocity in pediatric patients treated with Qsymia. Consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of Qsymia if necessary.

### Prevention of type 2 diabetes in subjects with prediabetes and metabolic syndrome treated with phentermine and topiramate extended release [^116J92HU]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

In patients for whom lifestyle changes alone are insufficient and bariatric surgery is not an option, pharmacotherapies may be considered. Phentermine and topiramate extended release (PHEN/TPM ER; Qsymia; VIVUS, Inc, Mountain View, CA) have been shown to induce significant weight loss when combined with lifestyle modification in overweight/obese adults.

The CONQUER study assessed the effectiveness of PHEN/TPM ER for weight loss in overweight/obese adults with two or more weight-related comorbidities over 56 weeks (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00553787) and was followed by SEQUEL, a 52-week blinded extension study (NCT00796367). In order to assess the ability of PHEN/TPM ER to reduce progression to type 2 diabetes and improve cardiometabolic parameters in patients at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes, we analyzed the subpopulation of patients meeting the criteria at baseline for prediabetes and/or metabolic syndrome (MetS) who elected to enroll in SEQUEL.

### Cardiovascular safety during and after use of phentermine and topiramate [^115dmwQC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

The present analysis of PHEN used concurrently with TPM, either separately or in a fixed-dose combination, provides some reassurance about the absence of large risks of CV outcomes caused by these agents as used in clinical practice. We found a trend for a lower rate of MACE and other CV outcomes among those with exposure to PHEN/TPM (including the fixed-dose combination) than among the unexposed cohort. However, considerable statistical uncertainty remains, stemming from the small number of events, yielding 95% CIs that ranged from strong negative associations to small positive associations, with an upper 95% confidence limit below a doubling of the rate for the composite MACE outcome, during the relatively short time patients were taking the medication.

### Current and emerging medications for overweight or obesity in people with comorbidities [^114jV7UM]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

The two major pivotal trials of phentermine/topiramate ER, EQUIP and CONQUER, were conducted in overweight or obese populations with, or at a high risk of, weight-related complications.

In the EQUIP study, the focus was on weight loss in subjects with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m². A dose of 15 mg/92 mg resulted in a weight loss of 10.9%, compared to 1.6% with placebo (p < 0.0001) after one year. Participants in the CONQUER trial had a BMI of 27–45 kg/m² and presented with ≥ 2 obesity-related comorbidities. In that study, the one-year weight loss was 7.8% with the mid-range dose of phentermine/topiramate ER (7.5 mg/46 mg once daily) and 9.8% with the maximum dose (15 mg/92 mg once daily), as compared to 1.2% with placebo (p < 0.0001 for both doses). Among those participants who entered the extension phase of the CONQUER study, known as the SEQUEL trial, weight loss was sustained following a total of 108 weeks of phentermine/topiramate ER therapy. Weight loss was −9.3% with 7.5 mg/46 mg and −10.5% with 15 mg/92 mg, compared to 1.8% with placebo (p < 0.0001 for both doses).

### Cardiovascular effects of phentermine and topiramate: a new drug combination for the treatment of obesity [^111qbSDP]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Topiramate immediate-release is currently approved at doses of 100–400 mg/day (titrated over 6 weeks) as monotherapy for treating seizures in adults and children over age 6, with other medicines to treat seizures in adults and children aged at least 2 years, or for preventing migraines in adults. Because weight loss was observed in trials for epilepsy, topiramate immediate-release was evaluated for the treatment of obesity, as well as treatment of hypertension or T2DM in obese patients.

A 6-month, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 385 obese patients demonstrated weight loss of 2.6% with placebo, and 5.0, 4.8, 6.3, and 6.3% in patients randomized to topiramate immediate-release 64, 96, 192, or 384 mg/day along with lifestyle intervention, respectively. Doses were gradually increased over 12 weeks and tapered at the end of the trial. All topiramate immediate-release doses elicited greater weight loss than placebo.

A long-term study (up to 60 weeks) evaluated the safety and efficacy of topiramate immediate-release for weight maintenance in obese patients who had lost at least 8% body weight after 8 weeks on a low-calorie diet. After 44 weeks of treatment, patients treated with topiramate immediate-release had lost 15.4 and 16.5% of their enrollment body weight at 96 and 192 mg/day doses, respectively, compared to 8.9% with placebo. More patients treated with topiramate immediate-release lost at least 15% body weight than those treated with placebo.

### Current and emerging medications for overweight or obesity in people with comorbidities [^113Tukfe]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

There are four separate doses available for phentermine/topiramate ER combination therapy, but only two are recommended for long‐term treatment: 7.5 mg phentermine/46 mg topiramate ER once daily and 15 mg/92 mg once daily. The remaining two doses, 3.75 mg/23 mg and 11.25 mg/69 mg once daily, are titration doses. When prescribing this drug, a 2-week course of 3.75 mg/23 mg is recommended before the recipient is placed on a 'mid‐range' maintenance dose of 7.5 mg/46 mg. It is recommended that the drug is either discontinued or escalated where people have not lost 3% of their body weight after three months on 7.5 mg/46 mg.

At the mid-dose of 7.5 mg/46 mg, the medication can simply be stopped without titration. At the maximum dose of 15 mg/92 mg, drug discontinuation should be tapered by taking a dose every other day for at least one week before stopping treatment in those who have not lost 5% body weight with the maximum dose. The concept of identifying responders and non-responders and acting accordingly is relatively new in the obesity field, and phentermine/topiramate ER was the first obesity medication for which the FDA incorporated non-responder recommendations into the package insert. The Endocrine Society guidelines also include recommendations that alternative weight loss treatments are considered for non-responders or in the case of safety or tolerability issues.

Participant inclusion and exclusion criteria have been reported previously. Eligible adults (aged 18–55 years) met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM‐IV‐TR) criteria for BED and had protocol‐defined moderate to severe BED, defined as having ≥ 3 binge eating days per week for 14 days before baseline and Clinical Global Impressions — Severity scores (from the perspective of binge eating symptoms) at screening and baseline of ≥ 4.

Key exclusion criteria included:

- **Anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa**: Comorbid psychiatric disorders either controlled with prohibited medications or uncontrolled and associated with significant symptoms or any condition that could confound study assessments.
- **Lifetime history**: Psychosis, mania, hypomania, dementia, or ADHD.
- **Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score**: ≥ 18 at screening.
- **Therapy or support**: Psychotherapy or weight loss support for BED within 3 months of screening.
- **Suicide risk assessment**: Being considered a suicide risk in the opinion of the investigator, having a previous suicide attempt, or currently demonstrating active suicidal ideation.
- **Cardiovascular health**: History of cardiovascular disorders or moderate or severe hypertension.
- **Substance abuse history**: Lifetime history of stimulant abuse, recent history of substance abuse or dependence, or known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to LDX or related compounds.

### Cardiovascular effects of phentermine and topiramate: a new drug combination for the treatment of obesity [^114UXNTs]. Journal of hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

The belief that phentermine increases heart rate and blood pressure (BP) may be due to the assumption of amphetamine-like side effects based on similarities in drug pharmacology. However, in the observational study by Hendricks et al, normotensive (14%), prehypertensive (52%), and hypertensive (34%) patients treated long-term with phentermine (mean time on therapy of 92 weeks) demonstrated no significant increase in heart rate. They also experienced reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) similar to those in patients losing weight on a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet alone.

Furthermore, clinical studies using short-term (12 weeks) phentermine monotherapy have shown either reductions in heart rate and BP with phentermine treatment, perhaps linked to weight loss, or no significant changes in BP with phentermine treatment. A study of patients taking phentermine for weight loss (n = 269) found no abuse potential or amphetamine-like withdrawal upon abrupt cessation of long-term treatment, even at doses higher than commonly recommended and after treatment durations of up to 21 years.

Common side effects, as described in the phentermine-prescribing information for short-term (12–14 weeks) use, include dry mouth, insomnia, headache, dizziness, fatigue, tachycardia, and palpitations.

### Cardiovascular effects of phentermine and topiramate: A new drug combination for the treatment of obesity [^11428mhU]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Phentermine is the most widely used weight-loss pharmacotherapy in the US. Phentermine HCl, an immediate-release formulation that undergoes rapid dissolution and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, is currently approved for use at a dose of 15.0–37.5 mg/day (adjusted to the patient's need) for the short-term (up to 12 weeks) treatment of obesity. A phentermine resin that slowly releases the active drug into the gastrointestinal system is also approved in the US for the short-term treatment of obesity.

Phentermine (either phentermine HCl 37.5 mg/day or phentermine resin 15–30 mg/day) has been evaluated as a monotherapy in several studies up to 36 weeks. It demonstrated reductions in body weight and waist circumference and improved achievement of at least 5 or 10% weight loss relative to placebo. Munro et al, in 1968, studied weight loss with phentermine monotherapy (30 mg/day) in a 36-week, double-blind trial of overweight and obese women, and found significant weight loss with both continuous and intermittent regimens of phentermine treatment (12.2 and 13.0 kg, respectively) vs. a dummy vehicle (4.8 kg).

Although no published studies describing long-term, randomized, controlled weight-loss trial data for phentermine are currently available, Hendricks et al, in 2011, observed that patients (n = 300) treated with phentermine monotherapy at doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg/day (mean dose 33.6 mg/day) showed significantly greater weight loss for 1 through 104 weeks of treatment (12.7%).

### Qsymia [^116b66Cu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The recommended dosage, titration, and administration of QSYMIA are as follows:

Take QSYMIA orally once daily in the morning with or without food. Avoid administration of QSYMIA in the evening due to the possibility of insomnia. The recommended starting dosage is one capsule containing 3.75 mg of phentermine and 23 mg of topiramate (3.75 mg/23 mg) taken orally once daily for 14 days. After 14 days, increase to the recommended dosage of QSYMIA 7.5 mg/46 mg orally once daily.

After 12 weeks of treatment with QSYMIA 7.5 mg/46 mg, evaluate weight loss for adults or BMI reduction for pediatric patients aged 12 years and older. If an adult patient has not lost at least 3% of baseline body weight or a pediatric patient has not experienced a reduction of at least 3% of baseline BMI, increase the dosage to QSYMIA 11.25 mg/69 mg orally once daily for 14 days; follow this by an increase in the dosage to QSYMIA 15 mg/92 mg orally once daily.

After 12 weeks of treatment with QSYMIA 15 mg/92 mg, evaluate weight loss for adults or BMI reduction for pediatric patients aged 12 years and older. If an adult patient has not lost at least 5% of baseline body weight or a pediatric patient has not experienced a reduction of at least 5% of baseline BMI, discontinue QSYMIA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] as it is unlikely that the patient will achieve and sustain clinically meaningful weight loss with continued treatment.

Monitor the rate of weight loss in pediatric patients. If weight loss exceeds 2 lbs (0.9 kg) per week, consider dosage reduction.

### Controlled-release phentermine/topiramate in severely obese adults: A randomized controlled trial (EQUIP) [^114sjziT]. Obesity (2012). Low credibility.

The study faced a limitation due to the 40% dropout rate (47.1%, 39.0%, and 33.6% for patients receiving placebo, 3.75/23, and 15/92, respectively). This dropout rate aligns with expectations at 56 weeks in obesity trials as predicted by a published meta-analytic equation and is lower than the 50% dropout observed in two other recent phase 3 obesity RCTs. The approach to retaining subjects involved continuing to include them in the trial even if they discontinued the drug, and using ITT analyses with established missing data management procedures may have mitigated the high dropout rates observed. However, retaining patients in weight loss (WL) trials lasting a year or more remains challenging.

Nevertheless, several methods were employed to handle missing data, all of which yielded confirmatory results. These statistical methods rely on fewer and less restrictive assumptions compared to complete case analyses. Moreover, the retention rate was significantly higher in the active treatment group compared to the placebo group, which might be attributed to greater WL efficacy observed in the treatment groups, though this remains speculative. Early WL may provide tangible encouragement for patients to adhere to lifestyle guidance and has been associated with greater success in WL programs.

There were other notable limitations, including the overrepresentation of women (83%). Further studies involving larger groups of men may provide more comprehensive insights. The trial primarily involved white participants and many did not exhibit significant obesity-associated comorbid diseases; another RCT of PHEN/TPM CR has covered a broader population.

### Evaluation of phentermine and topiramate versus phentermine/topiramate extended-release in obese adults [^113wKP1j]. Obesity (2013). Low credibility.

A 28-week, randomized controlled trial compared the combination of phentermine and topiramate extended-release (PHEN/TPM ER) with its components as monotherapies and with placebo in obese adults.

- **Design and methods**: Subjects were randomized to placebo, phentermine 7.5 mg, phentermine 15 mg, topiramate ER 46 mg, topiramate ER 92 mg, PHEN/TPM ER 7.5/46 mg, or PHEN/TPM ER 15/92 mg. All subjects received lifestyle intervention counseling. Primary endpoints were percent weight loss (WL) and achievement of ≥ 5% WL.

- **Results**: At week 28, PHEN/TPM ER 7.5/46 (-8.5%) and 15/92 (-9.2%) achieved greater percentage WL versus placebo (-1.7%; P < 0.0001) and their respective monotherapies (P < 0.05). The percentage of subjects achieving ≥ 5% WL was 15.5% for placebo, 43.3% for phentermine 7.5, 46.2% for phentermine 15, 39.2% for topiramate ER 46, 48.6% for topiramate ER 92, 62.1% for PHEN/TPM ER 7.5/46, and 66.0% for PHEN/TPM ER 15/92. PHEN/TPM ER was generally well tolerated; comprehensive assessment of cognitive functions with the Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status revealed impairment only in the attention domain.

- **Conclusions**: PHEN/TPM ER demonstrated greater WL when used in combination than when used as monotherapies, suggesting an enhanced ability of the combination formulation to induce WL at doses lower than with available monotherapies.

### Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of controlled-release phentermine/topiramate in adults with obesity in Korea: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 4 trial (QUEEN's study) [^114DpbQA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a combination of phentermine and delayed-release topiramate (PHEN/TPM CR) versus placebo as an adjunct to standard lifestyle recommendations in Korean adults.

- **Materials and methods**: This 56-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 4 trial enrolled adults (age 19–70 years) with obesity (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) at eight sites in South Korea. After a 12-week lifestyle program, participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive PHEN/TPM CR or placebo. PHEN/TPM CR was commenced at 3.75 mg/23 mg daily for 14 days and increased to 7.5 mg/46 mg daily, and to 15 mg/92 mg if a 3% weight loss was not achieved after 12 weeks. The primary outcomes were percentage change in body weight from baseline to Week 56.

- **Results**: A total of 232 participants underwent randomization. At 56 weeks, the percentage change in body weight was -8.3% with PHEN/TPM CR and -2.3% with placebo (treatment difference -6.1%; 95% confidence interval, -7.7 to -4.5, p < 0.001). Participants receiving PHEN/TPM CR were more likely to achieve ≥ 5% weight loss compared with those receiving placebo (68.5% vs. 25.0%, odds ratio [OR], 6.4; 95% CI, 3.5 to 11.6; p < 0.001). Dizziness, paraesthesia, and dry mouth were more common in the PHEN/TPM CR group, although most adverse events were mild or moderate.

- **Conclusions**: Administration of PHEN/TPM CR plus lifestyle intervention in Korean adults with obesity resulted in a greater reduction in body weight and adiposity than lifestyle intervention alone.

### Pharmacotherapy of obesity: An update on the available medications and drugs under investigation [^116mDdq8]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Phentermine/Topiramate (Qsymia)

Three phase 3 RCTs assessed the efficacy of phentermine/topiramate on total body weight loss: EQUIP, CONQUER, and SEQUEL. In the EQUIP trial, patients with obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m²) were randomly assigned to receive phentermine/topiramate 3.75 mg/23 mg or 15 mg/92 mg, or a placebo, in addition to a reduced-calorie diet for 56 weeks. The mean age of participants was 42.7 years, and 83% were women. The mean baseline BMI was 42 kg/m². The percent weight reductions were −5.1 (8.6)% for the low dose group (n = 234), −10.9 (8.5)% for the high dose group (n = 498), and −1.5 (8.5)% for the placebo group (n = 498).

In the CONQUER trial, men and women with overweight/obesity were randomly assigned to receive phentermine/topiramate 7.5 mg/46 mg or 15 mg/92 mg, or a placebo, for 56 weeks. All patients received standardized counseling for diet and lifestyle modification. The mean age of participants was 51.1 years, and 70% were women. The range of mean baseline BMI was 36.2–36.7 kg/m². Weight reductions of 6.6 (9.2)% were achieved for the low dose group (n = 498), 8.6 (10.4)% for the high dose group (n = 995), and 1.2 (8.8)% for the placebo group (n = 994).

The SEQUEL trial was a 52-week extension of the CONQUER trial. Compared to baseline, the weight reduction was 9.3% in the low dose group (n = 153), 10.5% in the high dose group (n = 295), and 1.8% with the placebo (n = 227). A subgroup analysis according to diabetes mellitus status showed a higher weight loss in the intervention arms, compared to placebo arms, with a trend for higher efficacy.

### Qsymia [^115FhU5x]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients with renal impairment: A single-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg in adult patients with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to healthy volunteers with normal renal function. The study included patients with renal impairment classified on the basis of creatinine clearance as mild (greater or equal to 50 and less than 80 mL/min), moderate (greater than or equal to 30 and less than 50 mL/min), and severe (less than 30 mL/min). Creatinine clearance was estimated from serum creatinine based on the Cockcroft-Gault equation.

Compared to healthy volunteers, phentermine AUC0-inf was 91%, 45%, and 22% higher in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively; phentermine Cmax was 2% to 15% higher. Additionally, topiramate AUC0-inf was 126%, 85%, and 25% higher for patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively; topiramate Cmax was 6% to 17% higher. An inverse relationship between phentermine or topiramate Cmax or AUC and creatinine clearance was observed. Qsymia has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis [see Dosage and administration (2.4) and Use in specific populations (8.6)].

Patients with hepatic impairment: A single-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg in healthy volunteers with normal hepatic function compared with patients with mild (Child-Pugh score 5–6) and moderate (Child-Pugh score 7–9) hepatic impairments.

### Phentermine hydrochloride [^116NbKho]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Coadministration with other drug products for weight loss**: Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss, including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended.

- **Primary pulmonary hypertension**: Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) – a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs – has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope, or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope, or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension.

- **Valvular heart disease**: Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic, or tricuspid valves, has been associated with the use of phentermine.

### Time course of the effects of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with binge-eating disorder [^112b6trH]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Although medications other than LDX have been investigated for potential use as BED pharmacotherapy in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, LDX is the only medication currently approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe BED (Vyvanse ®, 2015). To our knowledge, this is the first publication describing time course analyses of treatment effects by week for the efficacy of a pharmacotherapy in individuals with BED. Based on available data from short-term studies for other potential BED therapies, numerically greater reductions in binge eating frequency and body weight for active treatment versus placebo are generally observed within 1–4 weeks of starting treatment [Appolinario et al. 2003; Guerdjikova et al. 2012; Hudson et al. 1998; McElroy et al. 2003, 2000, 2007; Wilfley et al. 2008]. In one study that reported statistical analysis of treatment effects prior to the end of the study, significantly greater reductions in binge eating days/week and weight for sibutramine versus placebo were reported at treatment Weeks 2 and 4, respectively [Appolinario et al. 2003].

### Coadministration of lorcaserin and phentermine for weight management: A 12-week, randomized, pilot safety study [^115qnJpR]. Obesity (2017). Low credibility.

To assess the short-term tolerability of lorcaserin alone or in combination with two dosing regimens of phentermine, a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, pilot safety study was conducted. The study involved 238 non-diabetic patients with obesity or overweight status, accompanied by at least one comorbidity. Participants were randomized to receive either lorcaserin 10 mg twice daily (BID; LOR BID) alone or in combination with phentermine 15 mg once daily (QD; LOR BID+PHEN QD) or phentermine 15 mg twice daily (LOR BID+PHEN BID). The study reported on patients experiencing at least one of nine potentially serotonergic adverse events (AEs), mean weight loss (WL), and those achieving at least 5% weight loss.

A total of 238 patients were randomized, with 235 receiving treatment. Out of those, 94 reported potentially serotonergic AEs: 37.2% in the LOR BID group, 42.3% in the LOR BID+PHEN QD group, and 40.5% in the LOR BID+PHEN BID group. Adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred approximately twice as often in the LOR BID+PHEN BID group compared to the LOR BID group. Mean weight loss was measured at 3.5 kg/3.3% for LOR BID, 7.0 kg/6.7% for LOR BID+PHEN QD, and 7.6 kg/7.2% for LOR BID+PHEN BID. At least 5% weight loss was achieved by 28.2% of LOR BID, 59.0% of LOR BID+PHEN QD (P = 0.0002 vs. LOR BID), and 70.9% of LOR BID+PHEN BID (P < 0.0001 vs. LOR BID) patients.

In conclusion, the addition of phentermine to lorcaserin enhanced short-term weight loss without increasing the incidence of potentially serotonergic AEs. However, phentermine administered twice daily resulted in higher discontinuation rates compared to both lorcaserin alone and lorcaserin with phentermine administered once daily.

### Cardiovascular effects of phentermine and topiramate: a new drug combination for the treatment of obesity [^116PhzJE]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Previously approved pharmacotherapies for treating obesity, including fenfluramine, which was often used in combination with phentermine, were found to have unacceptable cardiovascular risks that outweighed their potential weight-loss benefits. These cardiovascular risks included, but were not limited to, an increased risk of valvulopathy and pulmonary hypertension, which resulted in withdrawal from the market. As a result, the US FDA now requires weight-loss pharmacotherapies to show no excess cardiovascular health risks, similar to treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and frequently requires the drug's manufacturer to conduct post-marketing safety studies, including long-term cardiovascular outcome trials.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) expects new T2DM agents to produce no excess cardiovascular risk, requiring cardiovascular outcomes studies of at least 18–24 months or sufficiently sized meta-analysis data before granting marketing approval. A recent concept paper from the Cardiovascular Working Party of the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) indicates that the EMA is likely to adopt similar cardiovascular safety requirements for weight-loss pharmacotherapies in the near future.

This review aims to summarize and evaluate the cardiovascular benefit–risk profile associated with phentermine monotherapy, topiramate monotherapy, and their use in combination as PHEN/TPM-ER.

### Controlled-release phentermine/topiramate in severely obese adults: A randomized controlled trial (EQUIP) [^115Winbn]. Obesity (2012). Low credibility.

When analyzed as dichotomous data, regardless of the cut-off point (5%, 10%, or 15% of body weight), a higher proportion of patients in the 15/92 group exceeded the threshold than did patients in the 3.75/23 group, whose proportion exceeded that of placebo patients (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). In the prespecified intention-to-treat with last observation carried forward (ITT-LOCF; Analysis A), percentages of patients losing ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, and ≥ 15% of body weight were, respectively, 66.7%, 47.2%, and 32.3% on 15/92; 44.9%, 18.8%, and 7.3% on 3.75/23; and 17.3%, 7.4%, and 3.4% on placebo (all comparisons P < 0.05). Among completers, percentages of patients losing ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, and ≥ 15% of body weight were, respectively, 83.5%, 67.7%, and 48.1% on 15/92; 59.1%, 27.7%, and 12.4% on 3.75/23; and 25.5%, 13.0%, and 5.9% on placebo (all comparisons P < 0.0001).

To test whether results differed by baseline body mass index (BMI), we repeated Analysis A by categorizing patients by baseline BMI and then tested for interaction between baseline BMI category and treatment. The interaction was not significant (P = 0.8056), indicating that results did not significantly differ by baseline BMI.

- **Secondary end point analysis**: The 15/92 group had significantly greater least-squares mean changes, relative to placebo, in waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol. The 3.75/23 group had numerically, but not always statistically significant, greater least-squares mean changes compared with placebo in all these variables.

### Cardiovascular risk and obesity [^113AstCf]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Low credibility.

Phentermine hydrochloride/topiramate (PHEN/TPM) is a combination medication designed for the short-term treatment of obesity in adults who are obese or overweight and have at least one obesity-related condition. In addition to taking PHEN/TPM, patients are encouraged to follow a low-calorie diet and increase physical activity. This medication works through two mechanisms attributable to its components:

- **Phentermine mechanism**: Phentermine antagonizes alpha-adrenergic receptors, such as norepinephrine, releasing them into the hypothalamus. This results in an increase in blood leptin concentration and appetite suppression.

- **Topiramate mechanism**: Topiramate increases the activity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to modulate voltage-gated ion channels, inhibiting carbonic anhydrase or AMPA/kainite excitatory glutamate receptors.

Phentermine/topiramate is administered once a day with doses that can be low (3.75/23 mg), intermediate (7.5/46 mg), or high (15/92 mg). It has potential teratogenic and cardiovascular risks, notably an increase in heart rate. At the top dose, phentermine/topiramate is one of the most effective pharmacotherapies for the treatment of obesity in the US market, although it is not available for prescription in European or Brazilian markets.

The efficacy of phentermine/topiramate has been evaluated in one phase II and two phase III studies. The EQUATE trial, a phase II study, evaluated 776 patients who were randomized to receive phentermine monotherapy (7.5 and 15 mg), topiramate monotherapy (46 and 92 mg), or PHEN/TPM.

### Qsymia [^113qxoBw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Topiramate causes developmental toxicity, including teratogenicity, at clinically relevant doses in multiple animal species. Developmental toxicity, including teratogenicity, occurred at clinically relevant doses in multiple animal species in which topiramate was administered during the period of organogenesis (GD 6–15 in rodents, GD 6–18 in rabbits). In these studies, fetal malformations (primarily craniofacial defects such as cleft palate), limb malformations (ectrodactyly, micromelia, and amelia), rib/vertebral column anomalies, and/or reduced fetal weights were observed at dosages ≥ 20 mg/kg in mice (approximately 2 times the MRHD of topiramate in Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg on a mg/m² basis), 20 mg/kg in rats (2 times the MRHD of Qsymia based on estimated AUC), and 35 mg/kg in rabbits (2 times the MRHD based on estimated AUC). When rats were administered topiramate from GD 15 through lactation day 20, reductions in pre- and/or post-weaning weights occurred at dosages ≥ 2 mg/kg (2 times the MRHD of Qsymia based on estimated AUC).

- **Lactation: Risk summary**: Topiramate and phentermine are present in human milk. There are no data on the effects of topiramate and phentermine on milk production. Diarrhea and somnolence have been reported in breastfed infants with maternal use of topiramate. There are no data on the effects of phentermine in breastfed infants. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including changes in sleep, irritability, hypertension, vomiting, tremor, and weight loss in breastfed infants with maternal use of phentermine, advise pa

### Medications for the treatment of obesity in adolescents [^116AbMDr]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Phentermine/topiramate (Qsymia®) is a combination drug that acts as a norepinephrine and gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist, as well as a glutamate antagonist, which leads to appetite suppression; however, the exact mechanism is still under investigation.

The standard treatment plan for Qsymia involves a four-stage dose escalation. Treatment begins with an immediate-release phentermine/extended-release topiramate dose of 3.75 mg/23 mg once daily for two weeks, followed by 7.5 mg/46 mg once daily for 12 weeks. If the patient does not lose at least 3% of baseline body weight during this period, the medication can either be discontinued or the dose can be escalated. For dose escalation, immediate-release phentermine/extended-release topiramate at 11.25 mg/69 mg can be prescribed daily for two weeks, followed by a final titration to a dose of 15 mg/92 mg daily for an additional 12 weeks. If patients do not achieve weight loss at or above 5% of their baseline body weight after completing the final 12-week treatment period, the drug is gradually discontinued. It is advised that patients refrain from taking any further doses within 14 days after the discontinuation of treatment.

- **Contraindications**: Patients with the following conditions should not be treated with Qsymia: pregnancy, uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, and those using monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

### Efficacy and safety of phentermine/topiramate in adults with overweight or obesity: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115TzELB]. Obesity (2021). High credibility.

The study objective was to examine the association between phentermine/topiramate therapy and weight loss and adverse events in adults with overweight or obesity through meta-analysis and systematic review.

- **Methods**: Medical Subject Headings and free-text terms were selected to search for eligible trials in PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Embase up to April 18, 2020. The quality of randomized controlled trials was evaluated using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Meta-analysis was conducted using random-effect models.

- **Results**: Phentermine/topiramate therapy resulted in an average weight loss of 7.73 kg (95% CI: 6.60–8.85) compared with placebo. The weight loss was related to the dose of phentermine/topiramate. Specifically, the average weight loss was 3.55 kg (95% CI: 2.22–4.88) for 3.75/23 mg, 7.27 kg (95% CI: 6.40–8.13) for 7.5/46 mg, and 8.25 kg (95% CI: 6.92–9.79) for 15/92 mg. For participants in different weight-loss subgroups, those with ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, and ≥ 15% baseline weight loss experienced weight losses of 3.18 kg (95% CI: 2.75–3.67), 5.32 kg (95% CI: 4.53–6.25), and 5.65 kg (95% CI: 3.55–9.01), respectively. Compared with placebo, the adverse events associated with the treatment included dysgeusia (odds ratio [OR] = 8.86, 95% CI: 5.65–13.89), paresthesia (OR = 8.51, 95% CI: 6.20–11.67), dry mouth (OR = 6.71, 95% CI: 5.03–8.94), disturbance in attention (OR = 4.48, 95% CI: 2.39–8.41), irritability (OR = 4.10, 95% CI: 2.29–7.33), hypoesthesia (OR = 3.81, 95% CI: 1.32–11.00), and constipation.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial of phentermine-topiramate ER in patients with binge-eating disorder and bulimia nervosa [^116Kaerx]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2020). High credibility.

Open trials suggest that phentermine/topiramate ER (PHEN/TPM-ER), which is FDA approved for obesity, may have utility for binge eating. This trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PHEN/TPM-ER in a crossover RCT for patients with binge-eating disorder (BED) or bulimia nervosa (BN), as no previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted in this area.

Participants were randomized to receive 12 weeks of PHEN/TPM-ER (dosed at 3.75 mg/23 mg to 15 mg/92 mg) or a placebo, followed by a 2-week drug washout period, before crossing over to the other treatment. Demographics, vital signs, eating disorder behaviors, mood, and side effects were assessed. The primary outcome was the number of objective binge-eating (OBE) days over a 4-week period, while secondary outcomes included rates of binge abstinence. Mixed-effect models, adjusted for treatment, study period, and diagnosis, were used to estimate treatment effects.

Among the 22 adults (18 with BED and 4 with BN), who were predominantly female (96%) and Caucasian (55%), with an average age of 42.9 years (SD = 10.1) and a body mass index of 31.1 kg/m² (SD = 6.2), baseline OBE days over 4 weeks decreased significantly from 16.2 (SD = 7.8) to 4.2 (SD = 8.4) following PHEN/TPM-ER treatment, compared to 13.2 (SD = 9.1) after placebo treatment (p < .0001). Abstinence rates were 63.6% on PHEN/TPM-ER versus 9.1% on placebo (p < .0001). Weight changes were observed as a decrease of 5.8 kg on PHEN/TPM-ER compared to an increase of 0.4 kg on placebo. Drop-out rates were 9% in both the PHEN/TPM-ER and placebo groups, with few side effects reported. Changes in vital signs with PHEN/TPM-ER were minimal and similar to those observed with placebo. There were no significant differences in responses between patients with BED and those with BN.

This first RCT evaluating the efficacy and safety of PHEN/TPM-ER for BED and BN found promising results.

### Qsymia [^1156EK7u]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Risk of ophthalmologic adverse reactions**: A syndrome consisting of acute myopia associated with secondary angle closure glaucoma has been reported in patients treated with topiramate. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity and/or ocular pain. Ophthalmologic findings can include myopia, mydriasis, anterior chamber shallowing, ocular hyperemia (redness), choroidal detachments, retinal pigment epithelial detachments, macular striae, and increased intraocular pressure. This syndrome may be associated with supraciliary effusion resulting in anterior displacement of the lens and iris, with secondary angle closure glaucoma. Symptoms typically occur within one month of initiating treatment with topiramate but may occur at any time during therapy. In contrast to primary narrow angle glaucoma, which is rare under 40 years of age, secondary angle closure glaucoma associated with topiramate has been reported in pediatric patients as well as adults. The primary treatment to reverse symptoms is discontinuation of Qsymia as rapidly as possible in consultation with the treating physician. Elevated intraocular pressure of any etiology, if left untreated, can lead to serious sequelae including permanent loss of vision.

- **Visual field defects**: Visual field defects (independent of elevated intraocular pressure) have been reported in clinical trials and in postmarketing experience in patients receiving topiramate. In clinical trials, most of these events were reversible after topiramate discontinuation.

### Vyvanse [^117Q6iJT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Agents that alter urinary pH can influence blood levels of amphetamine. Acidifying agents decrease amphetamine blood levels, while alkalinizing agents increase these levels. Therefore, adjust Vyvanse dosage accordingly.

- **Drugs having clinically important interactions with amphetamines**: No additional information provided.

- **Drugs having no clinically important interactions with Vyvanse**: From a pharmacokinetic perspective, no dose adjustment of Vyvanse is necessary when co-administered with guanfacine, venlafaxine, or omeprazole. Furthermore, no dose adjustment of guanfacine or venlafaxine is required when administered with Vyvanse [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

From a pharmacokinetic perspective, no dose adjustment is needed for drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2 (e.g. theophylline, duloxetine, melatonin), CYP2D6 (e.g. atomoxetine, desipramine, venlafaxine), CYP2C19 (e.g. omeprazole, lansoprazole, clobazam), and CYP3A4 (e.g. midazolam, pimozide, simvastatin) when co-administered with Vyvanse [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Marketing messages in continuing medical education (CME) modules on binge-eating disorder (BED) [^117FeKqb]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

In 2015, Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) became the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for binge-eating disorder (BED), a condition first recognized by the DSM-V in 2013. Because pharmaceutical companies use continuing medical education (CME) to help sell drugs, we explored possible bias in CME modules on BED.

- **Methods**: We utilized a qualitative thematic analysis research approach to identify and classify patterns in CME activities focusing on BED.

- **Results**: We identified 27 online CME activities on BED in 2015. All were funded by Shire, which manufactures lisdexamfetamine. Seven of 16 presenters disclosed financial ties with Shire. Twenty-nine slides recurred in at least 2 CME modules, and 12 slides were repeated in 5 or more modules. Diagnosis-related themes included: BED is a real, treatable disease; BED is highly prevalent but often missed; BED can occur in anyone; BED results in poor quality of life; many patients with BED are obese; and BED makes losing weight difficult. Treatment-related themes included: lisdexamfetamine is highly effective; topiramate is limited by substantial adverse effects; and other therapeutic options for BED are inferior to lisdexamfetamine because they do not cause weight loss. Although amphetamines can cause addiction, myocardial infarction, stroke, and death, no module mentioned these serious adverse effects.

- **Conclusions**: It seems that CME is being used to promote lisdexamfetamine for weight loss (a contraindicated use) and to highlight benefits of lisdexamfetamine while underplaying the risks.

### Qsymia [^113Qr5au]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In patients, the pharmacokinetics of lithium were unaffected during treatment with topiramate at doses of 200 mg/day. However, there was an observed increase in systemic exposure of lithium (27% for Cmax and 26% for AUC) following topiramate doses up to 600 mg/day.

- **Haloperidol**: The pharmacokinetics of a single dose of haloperidol (5 mg) were not affected following multiple dosing of topiramate (100 mg every 12 hours) in 13 healthy adults (6 males, 7 females).

- **Amitriptyline**: There was a 12% increase in AUC and Cmax for amitriptyline (25 mg per day) in 18 normal subjects (9 males, 9 females) receiving 200 mg/day of topiramate [see Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Sumatriptan**: Multiple dosing of topiramate (100 mg every 12 hours) in 24 healthy volunteers (14 males, 10 females) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of single-dose sumatriptan administered either orally (100 mg) or subcutaneously (6 mg).

- **Risperidone**: When administered concomitantly with topiramate at escalating doses of 100, 250, and 400 mg/day, there was a reduction in risperidone systemic exposure (16% and 33% for steady-state AUC at the 250 and 400 mg/day doses of topiramate). No alterations of 9-hydroxy risperidone levels were observed. Co-administration of topiramate 400 mg/day with risperidone resulted in a 14% increase in Cmax and a 12% increase in AUC12 of topiramate. There were no clinically significant changes in the systemic exposure of risperidone plus 9-hydroxy risperidone or of topiramate; therefore, this interaction is not likely to be of clinical significance.

- **Propranolol**: Multiple dosing of topiramate (200 mg/day).

### Cardiovascular effects of phentermine and topiramate: a new drug combination for the treatment of obesity [^114oF6CT]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

It should be noted that there were reports of valvular heart disease when phentermine was used in combination with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. Of the 132 spontaneous reports with complete information, 113 (86%) met the cardiac valvulopathy case definition. Of these 113 cases, 2 (2%) used fenfluramine alone, 16 (14%) dexfenfluramine alone, 89 (79%) a combination of fenfluramine and phentermine, and 6 (5%) a combination of all three drugs. There were no cases reported with phentermine monotherapy use. Since none of these cases of cardiac valvulopathy was linked directly with phentermine treatment, the US FDA required the removal of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine from the market, while maintaining its approval of phentermine as a monotherapy. Ultimately, activity on the 5-HT2b receptor on heart valves was implicated as the primary mechanism associated with fenfluramine/dexfenfluramine-related valvulopathy. Phentermine has no affinity for the 5-HT2b receptor and does not increase circulating serotonin. Two case reports have described a temporal association between phentermine monotherapy and valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension, but numerous pre-existing and concomitant morbidities in these cases have precluded any definitive conclusion about whether these were linked to treatment.
