## Question

How do transfusions put you at risk for hemolytic anemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how transfusions put patients at risk for hemolytic anemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the immunologic basis of alloimmunization and why it happens. Then, I should distinguish acute from delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions and their mechanisms. Next, I will examine hyperhemolysis and bystander hemolysis. After that, I need to identify patient-specific and transfusion-related risk factors. Finally, I will consider diagnostic pitfalls, prevention strategies, and management principles that mitigate risk, especially in sickle cell disease where the problem is most pronounced [^112kSzwP] [^114Xb53A].

> Let me first confirm the core mechanism: alloimmunization. When a patient receives donor RBCs carrying antigens the patient lacks, the immune system can mount a primary response, forming alloantibodies that may be undetectable at the time of transfusion but persist as immunologic memory, priming future reactions; this is the foundation for delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs) and is particularly common in patients of African ancestry with sickle cell disease who often lack antigens prevalent in donors of European ancestry [^112kSzwP] [^112aUGfA] [^11216r96].

> Wait, let me verify the timing and detection issue because it drives missed diagnoses. Many alloantibodies in SCD evanesce below detection thresholds over months, so a patient may appear "antibody-negative" at the time of a subsequent transfusion; re-exposure then triggers an amnestic response and DHTR days to weeks later, often without a newly detectable antibody on routine serology, which is why DHTRs are underrecognized and frequently misattributed to vaso-occlusive crises in SCD [^114Xb53A] [^112KdUs6] [^111ud9x7].

> I will now examine the delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction itself. DHTR typically presents 3–14 days after transfusion with falling hemoglobin, hemoglobinuria, jaundice, and sometimes pain or fever; critically, up to 30–40% of DHTRs in SCD show no identifiable new alloantibody, implying non–antibody-mediated mechanisms or antibodies below assay detection, which complicates both diagnosis and prevention [^114Xb53A] [^112nJ6sn] [^111ud9x7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without considering hyperhemolysis. Hyperhemolysis is a severe DHTR phenotype in which destruction of transfused RBCs is accompanied by accelerated clearance of the patient's own RBCs, producing a post-transfusion hemoglobin lower than pre-transfusion; complement activation, heme-driven inflammation, and altered macrophage function are implicated, and this can be rapidly life-threatening in SCD [^1164Eive] [^111ud9x7] [^114Xb53A].

> Let me think about the acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR) counterpart to anchor the spectrum. AHTRs occur within minutes to 24 hours, classically from ABO incompatibility, and are typically prevented by rigorous pre-transfusion testing; in contrast, DHTRs reflect secondary immune responses and are harder to preempt because of antibody evanescence and the possibility of antibody-negative presentations, which is why DHTRs are the dominant hemolytic risk in chronically transfused populations like SCD [^113r1A9g] [^113RPePC] [^112KdUs6].

> Next, I should review patient-specific risk factors. SCD confers the highest risk due to antigenic disparity and inflammatory milieu; prior alloimmunization, a history of DHTR, and transfusion for acute complications further increase risk; inflammatory states, including viral infections, can enhance alloimmunization via type I interferon and dendritic cell priming, and donor factors such as high reticulocyte content in units may increase immunogenicity, all of which tilt the balance toward hemolysis risk [^112aUGfA] [^111nb7F8] [^113BGZi7].

> I need to ensure I quantify the burden to contextualize risk. Prospective SCD data show DHTR after 4.2% of episodic transfusions, with mortality around 11% in affected patients, and many events are missed without systematic post-transfusion antibody screening and HbA quantification; this likely underestimates true incidence given misclassification as vaso-occlusive episodes and fragmented medical records across systems [^113RPePC] [^116gDKbQ] [^114Xb53A].

> But wait, what if there is no detectable antibody — does that negate risk? No, because antibody-negative DHTRs occur and may involve complement dysregulation, heme-mediated injury, or phosphatidylserine exposure on RBCs; this is why diagnosis increasingly relies on comparing post-transfusion HbA to baseline and integrating clinical and laboratory markers rather than relying solely on serologic antibody detection [^111ud9x7] [^114Xb53A] [^1164Eive].

> Next, I should review prevention strategies and verify their evidence base. The cornerstone is judicious transfusion and extended antigen matching beyond ABO/RhD to Cc, Ee, and Kell for all patients with SCD, with consideration of Jka/b, Fya/b, and Ss in those with prior alloantibodies; molecular typing can refine matching, and national antibody registries or interoperable records mitigate the harm of evanescence and fragmented histories, though implementation varies and evidence quality is limited [^114m8LT8] [^116NbBGj] [^115ZBaVu].

> Hold on, I should verify acute management principles because they differ from routine anemia care. During an active DHTR, especially with hyperhemolysis, additional RBC transfusion can worsen hemolysis; supportive care, erythropoiesis stimulation, and complement blockade with anti-C5 (eculizumab) are reasonable strategies in severe cases, with corticosteroids and IVIG used variably based on severity and institutional protocols; early recognition and avoidance of further transfusion are critical [^1164Eive] [^115scDoc] [^1124ESr5].

> I should double-check diagnostic recommendations to close the loop. Routine antibody screening and HbA quantification within 48 hours after episodic transfusion, and again if the patient presents within 21 days with pain, anemia, or hemoglobinuria, improve detection of DHTR; this operational approach addresses evanescence and helps distinguish DHTR from vaso-occlusive crises in SCD [^116gDKbQ] [^113RPePC].

> In summary, transfusions risk hemolytic anemia primarily by inducing alloimmunization that manifests as DHTR, with hyperhemolysis as the most severe phenotype; antibody evanescence, antigenic disparity, and inflammatory states amplify risk, particularly in SCD, and prevention hinges on restrictive transfusion, extended antigen matching, and vigilant post-transfusion surveillance, while management emphasizes avoiding further transfusion during active DHTR and deploying supportive and complement-directed therapies when indicated [^112aUGfA] [^1164Eive].

Transfusions can cause hemolytic anemia through **immune-mediated destruction** of donor red cells, most often due to **alloantibodies** from prior transfusions, pregnancy, or antigen mismatch [^1176cY8h] [^111ud9x7]. This includes **acute hemolytic reactions** (within 24 hours) from ABO incompatibility or other red-cell antigens, and **delayed hemolytic reactions** (days to weeks) from anamnestic responses to previously sensitized antigens [^113r1A9g] [^112KdUs6]. Hyperhemolysis can destroy both transfused and patient RBCs, causing severe anemia [^1164Eive]. Non-immune causes include mechanical hemolysis from pumps or filters, and hemolysis from improper storage or warming [^notfound]. Risk is higher in patients with prior alloimmunization, multiple transfusions, or hemoglobinopathies, and can be reduced by **strict crossmatching**, **extended antigen matching**, and **restrictive transfusion** [^114m8LT8] [^116NbBGj] [^1148Repy].

---

## Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia

Immune-mediated hemolysis is the **primary mechanism** by which transfusions cause hemolytic anemia. It occurs when the recipient's immune system recognizes donor RBC antigens as foreign and mounts an immune response, leading to destruction of transfused RBCs [^1176cY8h].

---

### Acute and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions

Key differences include:

| **Aspect** | **Ahtrs** | **Dhtrs** |
|-|-|-|
| Pathophysiology | AHTRs occur within minutes to hours after transfusion, typically due to ABO incompatibility or other red cell antigen mismatches. The recipient's pre-existing antibodies bind to donor RBCs, activating the complement cascade, causing intravascular hemolysis, hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria, and potential renal failure [^113r1A9g] | DHTRs occur days to weeks after transfusion, resulting from an anamnestic immune response. The recipient's previously formed alloantibodies, undetectable at the time of transfusion, rapidly increase in titer, causing extravascular hemolysis of transfused RBCs [^112KdUs6] |
| Clinical manifestations | Fever, chills, chest pain, hypotension, dark urine (hemoglobinuria), and shock [^115bpFnz] | Fever, jaundice, anemia, and hemoglobinuria, often mimicking other conditions such as vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease (SCD) [^112nJ6sn] |
| Incidence | Rare but severe, with a reported incidence of approximately 1 in 76,000 transfusions [^notfound] | DHTRs are more common than AHTRs, with reported incidences ranging from 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 12,000 transfusions, and are significantly underrecognized [^notfound] |

---

### Hyperhemolysis syndrome

Hyperhemolysis is a **severe form of DHTR** characterized by destruction of both transfused and autologous RBCs, resulting in a post-transfusion hemoglobin level lower than pre-transfusion levels [^1164Eive]. It is associated with **significant morbidity and mortality**, particularly in patients with SCD [^114Xb53A].

---

## Non-immune-mediated hemolytic anemia

Non-immune mechanisms can also cause hemolytic anemia following transfusion, though they are less common than immune-mediated reactions [^notfound].

---

### Mechanical hemolysis

Mechanical hemolysis can result from **mechanical destruction** of RBCs due to:

- **Mechanical hemolysis**: Mechanical destruction of RBCs due to improper use of infusion pumps, filters, or other medical devices [^notfound].

- **Improper storage or handling**: Extreme temperatures, improper agitation, or use of hypotonic solutions can cause RBC lysis [^notfound].

---

### Non-immune causes of hemolytic anemia

Non-immune causes include **oxidative hemolysis** from drugs or toxins that induce oxidative stress in RBCs (e.g. dapsone, sulfonamides) and **enzyme deficiencies**, in which patients with G6PD deficiency may experience hemolysis when exposed to certain drugs or oxidative stressors [^notfound].

---

## Risk factors for transfusion-related hemolytic anemia

Several patient and transfusion-related factors **increase the risk** of hemolytic anemia following transfusion:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Prior alloimmunization | Previous formation of alloantibodies significantly increases the risk of DHTRs and hyperhemolysis [^114Xb53A] |
| Multiple transfusions | Repeated transfusions increase the likelihood of alloimmunization and subsequent hemolytic reactions [^114b3BUb] |
| Hemoglobinopathies | Patients with SCD and thalassemia are at higher risk due to frequent transfusions and antigenic disparities [^1122XpBm] |
| Emergency transfusions | Transfusions administered without complete crossmatching carry a higher risk of incompatibility and hemolytic reactions [^116txQJp] |
| Improper storage or handling | Improper storage, extreme temperatures, or mechanical trauma can cause non-immune hemolysis [^notfound] |

---

## Preventive measures and management strategies

To minimize the risk of transfusion-related hemolytic anemia, **several preventive and management strategies** are recommended:

- **Strict crossmatching**: Comprehensive pre-transfusion compatibility testing, including ABO, Rh, and extended antigen matching, significantly reduces the risk of hemolytic reactions [^116NbBGj].

- **Extended antigen matching**: Matching for additional antigens (e.g. Kell, Duffy, Jk) in patients with hemoglobinopathies or prior alloimmunization reduces the risk of DHTRs [^116NbBGj].

- **Restrictive transfusion policies**: Limiting transfusions to clinically indicated scenarios reduces exposure and alloimmunization risk [^1176cY8h].

- **Patient blood management programs**: Implementing patient blood management strategies, including iron supplementation and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, reduces the need for transfusions [^111y3axK].

- **Prompt recognition and management**: Early identification and management of hemolytic reactions, including cessation of transfusion, supportive care, and immunosuppressive therapy when indicated, are critical to patient outcomes [^116AS9XD].

---

Transfusions can cause hemolytic anemia through **immune-mediated destruction** of donor RBCs, with acute and delayed reactions, as well as hyperhemolysis, posing significant risks. Non-immune mechanisms, such as mechanical hemolysis and improper storage, also contribute. Risk is higher with prior alloimmunization, multiple transfusions, and hemoglobinopathies, and can be mitigated by strict crossmatching, extended antigen matching, and restrictive transfusion policies [^notfound].

### How I safely transfuse patients with sickle-cell disease and manage delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions [^116qe2ja]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Transfusions can be a life-saving treatment of patients with sickle-cell disease (SCD). However, availability of matched units can be limiting because of distinctive blood group polymorphisms in patients of African descent. Development of antibodies against the transfused red blood cells (RBCs), resulting in delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs), can be life-threatening and pose unique challenges for this population with regard to treatment strategies and transfusion management protocols. In cases where the transfused cells and the patient's own RBCs are destroyed, diagnosis of DHTR can be difficult because symptoms may mimic vaso-occlusive crisis, and frequently, antibodies are undetectable. Guidelines are needed for early diagnosis of DHTR because treatment may need to include temporarily withholding any new transfusions to avoid further hemolysis. Also needed are case-control studies to optimally tailor treatments based on the severity of DHTR and develop preventive transfusion strategies for patients at DHTR risk. Here, we will review gaps in knowledge and describe through case studies our recommended approach to prevent alloimmunization and to diagnose and treat symptomatic DHTRs for which complementary mechanistic studies to understand their pathogenesis are sorely needed.

Red blood cell transfusions have reduced morbidity and mortality for patients with sickle cell disease. Transfusions can lead to erythrocyte alloimmunization, however, with serious complications for the patient including life-threatening delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions and difficulty in finding compatible units, which can cause transfusion delays. In this review, we discuss the risk factors associated with alloimmunization with emphasis on possible mechanisms that can trigger delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions in sickle cell disease, and we describe the challenges in transfusion management of these patients, including opportunities and emerging approaches for minimizing this life-threatening complication.

### What is really dangerous: anaemia or transfusion? [^116Qxyrx]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Summary While complex physiological mechanisms exist to regulate and optimize tissue oxygenation under various conditions, clinical and experimental evidence indicates that anaemia, unchecked, is associated with organ injury and unfavourable outcomes. More data (especially from human studies) are needed to answer questions regarding the optimal approaches to the treatment of acute and chronic anaemia. Meantime, allogeneic blood transfusions remain the most common treatment, particularly in surgical/trauma patients and those with moderate-to-severe anaemia. Clinical studies emphasize the paradox that both anaemia and transfusion are associated with organ injury and increased morbidity and mortality across a wide span of disease states and surgical interventions. Further characterization of the mechanisms of injury is needed to appropriately balance these risks and to develop novel treatment strategies that will improve patient outcomes. Here, we present the current understanding of the physiological mechanisms of tissue oxygen delivery, utilization, adaptation, and survival in the face of anaemia and current evidence on the independent (and often, synergistic) deleterious impact of anaemia and transfusion on patient outcomes. The risks of anaemia and transfusion in the light of substantial variations in transfusion practices, increasing costs, shrinking pool of donated resources, and ambiguity about actual clinical benefits of banked allogeneic blood demand better management strategies targeted at improving patient outcomes.

### Hemolytic transfusion reactions in sickle cell disease: underappreciated and potentially fatal [^1125ZBdb]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) often receive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion support for the prevention and management of many acute and chronic disease complications. – The beneficial effects of transfusion therapy observed in recent clinical studies, and the lack of effective treatments for this population of patients, have led to an increased use of blood. While RBC transfusions may be life-saving, we are concerned about their expanding use and would like to raise awareness of RBC alloimmunization, a major complication of transfusion, particularly in patients with SCD in whom the incidence is much higher than in other groups of patients. Hemolytic transfusion reactions, which primarily occur in RBC alloimmunized patients, are often under-recognized in patients with SCD, in particular because the symptoms mimic those of acute vaso-occlusive crises, and serological markers of new alloantibodies may be equivocal. In addition to increasing the risk of potentially fatal acute or delayed-type hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTR), – the development of RBC alloantibodies can also significantly delay the procurement of compatible RBC for future transfusions.

Currently, there is a lack of evidence in this area to inform best practice, and management is often based on anecdotal case reports. While there have been reports of a variety of cases illustrating the challenges associated with recognizing and treating hemolytic transfusion reactions in patients with SCD, the potential reasons for the higher incidence of RBC alloantibodies in SCD patients merit discussion. Here, we share our experience in managing alloimmunized patients and hemolytic transfusion reactions, and challenge the medical community to consider lessons learned from diagnostic criteria and mitigation policies for transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) in order to minimize the morbidity and mortality associated with transfusion in patients with SCD.

### Red cell transfusion and alloimmunization in sickle cell disease [^1153nkV6]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Transfusion remains a central intervention for sickle cell disease (SCD), with most patients receiving one or more transfusions by adulthood. Prospective, randomized clinical trials support transfusion for primary and secondary stroke prevention, but for many other indications, treatment is based on expert consensus. Guidelines on transfusion management for SCD are limited by availability of welldesigned studies. Thus, many recommendations are based on low or moderate quality evidence or expert consensus, as well as the balance of benefits and harm for any given intervention. While transfusion therapy reduces SCD-associated morbidity and mortality, attention to prevention and management of alloimmunization, hemolytic transfusion reactions, and iron overload is critical.

### The bloody mess of red blood cell transfusion [^111wHv3v]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

In view of the published literature, anaemia is common in the general population and relevant for patient outcome. In the hospital, acute anaemia is often treated by RBC transfusions, because it has been proven to increase Hb levels in a timely manner. This therapeutic approach, however, usually does not address the underlying disease that triggered anaemia and may carry its own risks that have to be taken into account.

### Reticulocytes in donor blood units enhance red blood cell alloimmunization [^111nb7F8]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Red blood cells (RBC) are transfused to correct anemia from bone marrow failure, hemolytic anemia, and hemorrhage. Although RBC transfusions can be lifesaving, some patients develop alloantibodies against donor RBC blood group antigens. These alloantibodies can be clinically significant, inducing hemolytic transfusion reactions and hyperhemolysis, raising transplantation barriers, and delaying transfusion by making it difficult to find compatible blood for transfusion. Once alloantibodies arise, patient care becomes more challenging. Currently, there are few strategies to prevent RBC alloimmunization besides antigen matching or antigen avoidance, and few treatments are available (with limited efficacy) once alloimmunization occurs.

As opposed to pharmaceuticals, each unit of RBC is unique as it comes from a distinct individual, undergoes multiple manufacturing steps, and then is followed by a variable duration of refrigerator storage up to 42 days before transfusion. Increasing evidence suggests that the risk of alloimmunization following an RBC transfusion is influenced by donor factors (e.g. blood group antigen density), component factors (e.g. storage duration), and host factors (e.g. blood group antigen negativity, HLA type, inflammation). Identifying new risk factors that can prevent and/or reduce risk of future RBC alloimmunization events is a priority, given the current lack of available treatments for sensitized patients. In both humans and mice, RBC alloimmunization rates increase in transfusion recipients with viral infections or viral-like inflammation. Viruses induce robust type I interferon (IFN-α/β) production; in mouse models of RBC alloimmunization, blocking IFN receptors prevents alloantibody production, whereas infusing IFN-α promotes alloantibodies. Mechanistically, viral-like inflammation stimulates splenic antigen-presenting cells (APC) and alters the consumption of transfused RBC towards immunogenic dendritic cell (DC) subsets and away from red pulp macrophages.

Regarding preventative measures for red blood cell transfusion, more specifically with respect to correction of preoperative anemia, assessment and timing of surgery, BSH 2024 guidelines recommend to consider referring patients with unexplained anemia without iron deficiency according to the severity of anaemia (hemoglobin < 120 g/L for males, hemoglobin < 100 g/L for females, or according to locally agreed criteria), recognizing that the risk of a serious cause or haemoglobinopathy is proportional to anemia severity.

### Transfusion-related red blood cell alloantibodies: induction and consequences [^1176cY8h]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Blood transfusion is the most common procedure completed during a given hospitalization in the United States. Although often life-saving, transfusions are not risk-free. One sequela that occurs in a subset of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion recipients is the development of alloantibodies. It is estimated that only 30% of induced RBC alloantibodies are detected, given alloantibody induction and evanescence patterns, missed opportunities for alloantibody detection, and record fragmentation. Alloantibodies may be clinically significant in future transfusion scenarios, potentially resulting in acute or delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions or in difficulty locating compatible RBC units for future transfusion. Alloantibodies can also be clinically significant in future pregnancies, potentially resulting in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. A better understanding of factors that impact RBC alloantibody formation may allow general or targeted preventative strategies to be developed. Animal and human studies suggest that blood donor, blood product, and transfusion recipient variables potentially influence which transfusion recipients will become alloimmunized, with genetic as well as innate/adaptive immune factors also playing a role. At present, judicious transfusion of RBCs is the primary strategy invoked in alloimmunization prevention. Other mitigation strategies include matching RBC antigens of blood donors to those of transfusion recipients or providing immunomodulatory therapies prior to blood product exposure in select recipients with a history of life-threatening alloimmunization. Multidisciplinary collaborations between providers with expertise in transfusion medicine, hematology, oncology, transplantation, obstetrics, and immunology, among other areas, are needed to better understand RBC alloimmunization and refine preventative strategies.

### Alloimmunization and hyperhemolysis in sickle cell disease [^112aUGfA]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Alloimmunization against red blood cell antigens and delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) are major barriers to transfusion in sickle cell disease (SCD). In SCD, DHTR is a potentially life-threatening. Blood group polymorphism in SCD patients, who are of African ancestry and frequently exposed to antigens they do not carry; an inflammatory clinical state; and occasional transfusion in acute situations are risk factors for alloimmunization and DHTR. In patients at risk, the transfusion indication must be balanced against the risk of developing DHTR. However, when transfusion is absolutely necessary, protocols combining the prevention of exposure to immunogenic antigens with immunosuppressive treatments must be implemented, and patients should be carefully monitored during posttransfusion follow-up. This close monitoring makes it possible to diagnose hyperhemolysis as soon as possible; to avoid retransfusion, which can exacerbate hemolysis; and to administer specific treatments, such as anticomplement therapy, in severe cases. Finally, in patients with severe disease, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be indicated. However, transfusion is also required in this context, and its management is complex because these risks must be taken into account.

### Management of hemolytic transfusion reactions [^1164Eive]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs) in patients with sickle cell disease are underappreciated and potentially fatal. Patients with DHTRs typically have symptoms of pain or dark urine days to weeks following a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. In instances of DHTRs with hyperhemolysis, the patient's hemoglobin (Hgb) may be significantly lower than it was pretransfusion, and the Hgb A may drop by more than 50%. In most cases, at least 1 RBC alloantibody and sometimes multiple RBC alloantibodies can be identified during the DHTR, with those antibodies presumably having fallen below the level of detection at the time of the implicated transfusion. However, in up to one-third of cases, no new RBC alloantibodies can be identified posttransfusion. Complement is increasingly being appreciated to play a role in DHTRs and hyperhemolysis, not only due to classic pathway activation (with complement fixed antibody bound to RBCs) but also due to alternative pathway activation (resulting in part from plasma free heme). As such, anti-C5 inhibition has recently been reported to be effective at mitigating hemolysis in the setting of some severe DHTRs. Transfusion avoidance during DHTRs is recommended if possible, with long-term transfusion support advice being less clear; for example, a history of a severe DHTR may lead to questions regarding the safety of transfusions prior to curative therapies such as stem cell transplantation or gene therapy. A better understanding of antibody-positive and antibody-negative DHTRs, including patient- or disease-specific risk factors, is necessary to improve transfusion safety.

### Hemolytic transfusion reactions in sickle cell disease: underappreciated and potentially fatal [^111ZMrNe]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Strategies to prevent delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions

The most effective way to prevent a DTHR is to avoid unnecessary RBC transfusion. When transfusion avoidance is not feasible, provision of the most compatible RBC units is recommended. In an effort to reduce the risk of DHTR, transfusion services keep records of previously identified alloantibodies in order to reduce the risk of re-exposure to a particular alloantigen once an alloantibody has been detected. Using this approach, hospital transfusion services provide RBC that are negative for the particular alloantigens against which a patient has previously made alloantibodies. However, when patients seek care in multiple healthcare systems this information is often not available. In this setting, transfusion services can only rely on transfusion histories at the presenting facility or other facilities if obtainable, which are often either not obtained or incomplete. As this approach often results in inadequate alloimmunization histories, multiple encounters in different healthcare systems place patients with SCD at a significantly high risk of DHTR. Furthermore, transfusions are often initiated when patients present with acute complications at centers where providers may not be familiar with SCD management, including transfusion complications. Implementation of healthcare-wide acute care plans for patients with SCD that include consideration of possible transfusion complications may provide the type of guidance needed to increase awareness among all providers within a healthcare system.

Nonetheless, despite effective communication between healthcare systems, alloantibodies may not be detected if antibody evaluations are not routinely completed following transfusion episodes that are at a higher risk of inducing alloantibodies. This reflects the ability of newly formed alloantibodies to fall below the level of detection prior to a subsequent transfusion evaluation, which may occur months to years later. Thus, RBC alloantibody evanescence can contribute significantly to the risk of DHTR in the absence of systematic post-transfusion serological evaluation. To avoid these challenges, routine serological testing should be considered for all SCD patients 1 to 3 months after each transfusion episode. Even with such a policy in place, up to 30% of DHTR with bystander hemolysis occur in the absence of any detectable alloantibody, making it particularly difficult to predict and prevent these transfusion reactions fully.

### Allogeneic red blood cell transfusions: efficacy, risks, alternatives and indications [^1111PaDV]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

Careful assessment of risks and benefits has to precede each decision on allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Currently, a number of key issues in transfusion medicine are highly controversial, most importantly the influence of different transfusion thresholds on clinical outcome. The aim of this article is to review current evidence on blood transfusions, to highlight 'hot topics' with respect to efficacy, outcome and risks, and to provide the reader with transfusion guidelines. In addition, a brief synopsis of transfusion alternatives will be given. Based on up-to-date information of current evidence, together with clinical knowledge and experience, the physician will be able to make transfusion decisions that bear the lowest risk for the patient.

### Blood product transfusion in adults: indications, adverse reactions, and modifications [^116AS9XD]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Millions of units of blood products are transfused annually to patients in the United States. Red blood cells are transfused to improve oxygen-carrying capacity in patients with or at high risk of developing symptomatic anemia. Restrictive transfusion thresholds with lower hemoglobin levels are typically clinically equivalent to more liberal thresholds. Transfusion of plasma corrects clinically significant coagulopathy in patients with or at high risk of bleeding. Mildly abnormal laboratory coagulation values are not predictive of clinical bleeding and should not be corrected with plasma. Transfused platelets prevent or treat bleeding in patients with thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction. Cryoprecipitate is transfused to treat hypofibrinogenemia. Many adverse reactions can occur during or after blood product transfusion. Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (i.e., volume overload) is the most common cause of mortality associated with blood products. Modifications to blood products can prevent or decrease the risks of transfusion-related adverse reactions. It is critical to quickly recognize when a reaction is occurring, stop the transfusion, assess, and support the patient. Reporting a reaction to the blood bank is part of ensuring patient safety and supporting hemovigilance efforts.

### Alternative blood transfusion triggers: a narrative review [^117QMqDo]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia, characterized by low hemoglobin levels, is a global public health concern. Anemia is an independent factor worsening outcomes in various patient groups. Blood transfusion has been the traditional treatment for anemia; its triggers, primarily based on hemoglobin levels; however, hemoglobin level is not always an ideal trigger for blood transfusion. Additionally, blood transfusion worsens clinical outcomes in certain patient groups. This narrative review explores alternative triggers for red blood cell transfusion and their physiological basis.

Main Text

The review delves into the physiology of oxygen transport and highlights the limitations of using hemoglobin levels alone as transfusion trigger. The main aim of blood transfusion is to optimize oxygen delivery, necessitating an individualized approach based on clinical signs of anemia and the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption, reflected by the oxygen extraction rate. The narrative review covers different alternative triggers. It presents insights into their diagnostic value and clinical applications, emphasizing the need for personalized transfusion strategies.

Conclusion

Anemia and blood transfusion are significant factors affecting patient outcomes. While restrictive transfusion strategies are widely recommended, they may not account for the nuances of specific patient populations. The search for alternative transfusion triggers is essential to tailor transfusion therapy effectively, especially in patients with comorbidities or unique clinical profiles. Investigating alternative triggers not only enhances patient care by identifying more precise indicators but also minimizes transfusion-related risks, optimizes blood product utilization, and ensures availability when needed. Personalized transfusion strategies based on alternative triggers hold the potential to improve outcomes in various clinical scenarios, addressing anemia's complex challenges in healthcare. Further research and evidence are needed to refine these alternative triggers and guide their implementation in clinical practice.

### Identification and management of preoperative anaemia in adults: a British Society for Haematology guideline update [^111Na2Zi]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for red blood cell transfusion, more specifically with respect to correction of preoperative anemia (thresholds), BSH 2024 guidelines recommend to view hemoglobin levels < 130 g/L as the threshold at which patients are likely to benefit from screening for iron and/or other nutrient deficiencies and enhanced patient blood management measures.

### Current evidence and rationale to guide perioperative management, including transfusion decisions, in patients with sickle cell disease [^112B8kXV]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a collection of inherited hemoglobin disorders that results in chronic hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusion, pain, and end organ damage. Surgery in the SCD population requires careful planning, as perioperative stressors can lead to increased sickling and risk of inducing or further exacerbating vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs). Additionally, the underlying hypercoagulability and immunocompromised state due to SCD places patients at increased risk of both venous thromboembolism and infection. Judicious fluid administration, temperature regulation, thorough preoperative and postoperative analgesic planning, and preoperative transfusion are all crucial components of decreasing risks of surgery in patients with SCD.

### The contribution of iron deficiency to the risk of peripartum transfusion: a retrospective case control study [^114evuu2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

A drop in hemoglobin (Hb) level is a physiologic consequence of pregnancy due to an expanded plasma volume. The maternal serum hemoglobin typically reaches the physiological nadir at 24–32 weeks gestation. Iron requirements steadily rise in each trimester, reaching a peak of 7.5 mg/d in the 3rd trimester. Overall, pregnancy has a net iron loss of approximately 740 mg. In Canada, 23% of pregnant women are anemic (Hb < 110 g/L in 1st and 3rd trimesters, < 105 g/L in 2nd trimester) and an estimated 85% of these cases are attributable to iron deficiency. In its early stages, iron deficiency can occur without anemia. Ferritin is the best marker of iron deficiency in pregnancy and a serum ferritin less than 30 μg/L has a sensitivity of 92% for iron deficiency with a positive predictive value of 83%. Recent Canadian data showed that over 73% of pregnant women had ferritin levels < 30 μg/L at first obstetrical evaluation.

Maternal health is impacted by anemia during pregnancy. A recent analysis describes a 2.36 fold higher risk of maternal death in women with severe anemia (hemoglobin < 70 g/L). The risk of postpartum depression is also higher in women with iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Given iron's critical role in DNA synthesis and cellular metabolism, it is not surprising that it also plays a crucial role in fetal development. In fact, maternal IDA increases the risk of prematurity, fetal intrauterine growth restriction, developmental delay and perinatal mortality. The risks associated with anemia in pregnancy correlate best with hemoglobin levels tested in the first trimester, prior to significant plasma expansion.

In addition to these adverse outcomes, treating iron deficiency can also prevent red blood cell (RBC) transfusions for severe, symptomatic anemia. Avoiding RBC transfusions in pregnant women and women of childbearing age is key to preventing the development of red blood cell alloantibodies and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn in subsequent pregnancies, as one in fifteen recipients of RBC transfusions will develop an alloantibody. Further, any transfusion carries the risk of identification errors, viral or bacterial infection, transfusion associated circulatory overload or other transfusion reactions.

Given the high prevalence of iron deficiency in pregnant women, our goal was to elucidate the relative contribution of untreated iron deficiency to peripartum RBC transfusions. We present a case control study aimed at identifying the prevalence of iron deficiency or anemia in pregnant women that were transfused in the peripartum period compared to controls.

### Anemia and transfusions in patients undergoing surgery for cancer [^111y3axK]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Preoperative, operative, and postoperative factors may all contribute to high rates of anemia in patients undergoing surgery for cancer. Allogeneic blood transfusion is associated with both infectious risks and noninfectious risks such as human errors, hemolytic reactions, transfusion-related acute lung injury, transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease, and transfusion-related immune modulation. Blood transfusion may also be associated with increased risk of cancer recurrence. Blood-conservation measures such as preoperative autologous donation, acute normovolemic hemodilution, perioperative blood salvage, recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin alfa), electrosurgical dissection, and minimally invasive surgical procedures may reduce the need for allogeneic blood transfusion in elective surgery. This review summarizes published evidence of the consequences of anemia and blood transfusion, the effects of blood storage, the infectious and noninfectious risks of blood transfusion, and the role of blood-conservation strategies for cancer patients who undergo surgery. The optimal blood-management strategy remains to be defined by additional clinical studies. Until that evidence becomes available, the clinical utility of blood conservation should be assessed for each patient individually as a component of preoperative planning in surgical oncology.

### Challenges in chronic transfusion for patients with thalassemia [^114wgacS]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

The introduction of regular red cell transfusions 60 years ago transformed β-thalassemia major from a fatal childhood illness into a chronic disorder. Further advances in the prevention of transfusion-transmitted infections and management of iron overload have allowed survival and quality of life to approach normal. However, transfusion therapy for some other thalassemia syndromes continues to challenge clinical decision-making. Nearly one-half of the patients with E ß thalassemia are transfusion-dependent, yet the criteria for initiating transfusions or hemoglobin targets are not well defined. Patients with thalassemia intermedia who begin transfusions as adults are at very high risk for developing red cell alloimmunization and serious hemolytic transfusion reactions. In the growing number of survivors of Bart hydrops fetalis, the approach to transfusion therapy and iron chelation is rapidly evolving. A collaboration between hematology and transfusion medicine specialists will be essential to improving patient care and developing evidence-based guidelines.

### Hemolytic transfusion reactions in sickle cell disease: underappreciated and potentially fatal [^112KdUs6]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Definitions of acute and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions and hyperhemolysis

While acute hemolytic transfusion reactions can largely be avoided by stringent alloantibody investigations prior to transfusion, DHTR, which typically occur days or weeks following the implicated transfusion episode of seemingly compatible RBC, are more difficult to avoid. The delayed nature of DHTR is thought to reflect the recrudescence of an alloantibody not detected at the time of the RBC compatibility testing just prior to transfusion. The inability to detect RBC alloantibodies at the time of transfusion presumably reflects evanescence of a prior alloantibody response to a level below the detection threshold in routine clinical assays. Following re-exposure to the implicated alloantigen, immunological memory generated during the primary encounter facilitates an amnestic immune response that results in the rapid production of alloantibodies against the transfused unit (Figure 1). This in turn causes destruction of the transfused RBC, which is often accompanied by clinical symptoms associated with accelerated hemolysis. DHTR can be further complicated by bystander hemolysis or hyperhemolysis, a process that results in the accelerated clearance of both the transfused RBC and the patient's own RBC, (Figure 1). Such hyperhemolysis can be particularly fatal in patients with SCD for reasons that remain incompletely understood.

### Transfusion therapy for sickle cell disease: what's new? [^115ZBaVu]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Prevention of HTRs in high-risk patients (recommendation 3)

Hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs) occur in 3% to 5% of transfusions in individuals with SCD and up to 11% of such reactions are fatal. Mitigation is achieved through judicious use of transfusions and provision of RBCs lacking the cognate antigens against which a recipient has alloantibodies.

New SCD-modifying agents (SCDMAs), which increase baseline hemoglobin levels and reduce markers of hemolysis, offer the potential to minimize the need for RBC transfusions in individuals with SCD at high risk of HTRs. Voxelotor (Oxbryta), a HbS polymerization inhibitor, is a Food and Drug Administration–approved SCDMA for ages ≥ 4 years, which significantly increases hemoglobin levels and reduces markers of hemolysis in individuals with SCD. Although unable to directly prevent HTRs, voxelotor, in addition to hydroxyurea, should be considered to improve the baseline hemoglobin in patients at high risk for hemolytic reactions to minimize future RBC transfusions. Pyruvate kinase activators are another class of agents being investigated to reduce hemolysis and increase baseline hemoglobin in individuals with SCD. Phase 2/3 trials of pyruvate kinase activators mitapivat (AG-348) and etavopivat (FT-4202) are ongoing (, #and #) and may be added to the repertoire of SCDMAs to minimize RBC transfusion in high-risk individuals.

Given that most RBC antibodies in individuals with SCD evanesce over time, identification of RBC antibodies when they are present is critical. Equally important is RBC antibody data sharing between hospitals. Since the guidelines were published, the Department of Health & Human Services' Advisory Committee on Blood and Tissue Safety and Availability has published support for the need of a national RBC antibody registry. Furthermore, there is ongoing research to increase data interoperability and, in the longer term, to require the uniform recording of RBC antibodies using ISBT-128 codes in the electronic medical record.

### How we treat delayed haemolytic transfusion reactions in patients with sickle cell disease [^116nfTBt]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

Transfusion therapy is effective in the prevention and treatment of many complications of sickle cell disease (SCD). However, its benefits must be balanced against its risks, including delayed haemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTR). Not only is the relative rate of alloimmunization higher in patients with SCD than in other patient populations, but attendant risks associated with DHTR are even greater in SCD. Clinicians' awareness of DHTR events is poor because symptoms of DHTR mimic acute vaso-occlusive pain and immunohaematology findings are often negative. Transfusions delivered in the acute rather than elective setting appear to confer a higher risk of DHTR. Management of DHTR in SCD depends on the clinical severity, ranging from supportive care to immunosuppression, and optimization of erythropoiesis. DHTR must be considered in any recently transfused patient presenting with acute sickle cell pain. Meticulous documentation of transfusion and immunohaematology history is key. We anticipate an increase in DHTR events in SCD patients with the increasing use of red blood cell transfusion therapy.

### Alternative blood transfusion triggers: a narrative review [^115PfhjE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Second, the use of blood products comes with inherent risks, including transfusion reactions, infections, and immunological complications. By investigating alternative triggers, we can aim to reduce unnecessary transfusions, thus minimizing these potential adverse events and improving patient safety.

Moreover, studying alternative triggers can lead to more effective and efficient blood utilization, addressing the issue of blood shortages and ensuring the availability of blood products for patients who genuinely need them. This becomes especially critical in high-demand situations, such as during critical care or perioperative periods.

Furthermore, different patient populations may have distinct responses to anemia, making it essential to explore alternative triggers for blood transfusion in specific groups, such as critically ill patients or those undergoing surgical procedures. Tailoring transfusion practices based on individualized triggers may optimize patient outcomes and resource allocation.

In summary, the application and study of alternative triggers for blood transfusion are necessary to enhance patient care, minimize risks associated with transfusions, improve blood product utilization, and ultimately promote better outcomes in diverse clinical scenarios.

### Transfusion therapy for sickle cell disease: a balancing act [^111GhmSD]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Transfusion therapy is a key intervention in decreasing morbidity and mortality in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Current indications for acute and chronic transfusion therapy have significantly increased the number of RBC units transfused to patients with SCD worldwide. This review summarizes transfusion management for the treatment or prevention of neurologic and perioperative complications, acute chest syndrome, and acute anemia associated with SCD. Despite the recognized benefits of transfusion therapy, it is not without the risks of iron overload, alloimmunization, and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions. Transfusional iron overload management includes automated RBC exchange, noninvasive imaging to monitor iron burden, and iron chelation with parenteral or oral agents. Although limited and extended RBC antigen matching reduces antibody formation, the prevalence of RBC alloimmunization in patients with SCD remains high. Recent studies demonstrate that RH genetic diversity in patients with SCD contributes to Rh alloimmunization, suggesting that even more refined RBC matching strategies are needed. Advances in molecular blood group typing offer new opportunities to improve RBC matching of donors and recipients and can be of particular benefit to patients with SCD.

### Transfusion reactions: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment [^113r1A9g]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute transfusion reactions:

- **Definition**: Acute transfusion reactions are adverse reactions that occur during or within the first 24 hours of transfusion of blood and blood components.
- **Pathophysiology**: Acute transfusion reactions are caused by non-immunological reactions resulting from physical and chemical properties of the transfused blood component and by immunological reactions due to transfused erythrocyte, leukocyte, platelet, and plasma proteins.
- **Epidemiology**: Acute transfusion reactions in the US are reported in 282 cases of 100,000 units of transfusions, with 4.7 of these being life-threatening.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for transfusion-related complications include age, sex, pre-existing hematological abnormalities in CBC, and the clinical severity of the underlying disease. The storage duration of the transfused blood, prior history of transfusion, the specific components of the transfused blood, and the number of transfused units also contribute to the risk.
- **Disease course**: The clinical manifestations depend on the type of transfusion reaction, which include acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction, anaphylactic transfusion reaction, minor allergic transfusion reaction, transfusion-related acute lung injury, transfusion-associated circulatory overload, massive transfusion-associated complications, septic transfusion reaction, and acute pain transfusion reaction. Symptoms vary from fever, chills, headache, anxiety, transient hypertension, discomfort, dyspnea, kidney pain, hemoglobinuria, pruritus, urticaria, jaundice, hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, pain, nausea, acute respiratory distress, elevated natriuretic peptide, elevated central venous pressure, left HF, positive fluid balance, radiological evidence of pulmonary edema, DIC, acute renal failure, shock and even death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Acute transfusion reactions can lead to significant morbidity and mortality; therefore, early symptoms and signs of acute reactions to transfusion of blood and its products should be carefully monitored.

### Red blood cell transfusion for hematologic disorders [^113xmEQh]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have determined, in surgical and critically ill patients, relatively safe hemoglobin (Hb) thresholds of 7–8 g/dL to guide restrictive transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs). However, in patients with various hematologic disorders, strong evidence in support of such an approach is sparse and the optimal transfusion practice is yet to be defined. This review focuses on RBC transfusion practice in three hematologic diseases and a treatment strategy, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia, thalassemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These entities manifest in a broad spectrum of anemia, acute or chronic, in patients with different comorbidities and degrees of transfusion requirement. Thus the nuances in the indications of RBC transfusion and the goals to achieve in these specific situations may have been underappreciated. The limited data available highlight the importance of titrating RBC transfusion based on the clinical context and patient characteristics. Future RCTs are necessary to firmly establish the Hb thresholds associated with improved outcomes relevant to these specific patient populations, which will facilitate the personalized decision-making in RBC transfusion.

### Hemolytic transfusion reaction after preoperative prophylactic blood transfusion for sickle cell disease in pregnancy [^114MuddS]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Preoperative transfusions are frequently given to prevent morbidity in nonpregnant patients with sickle cell disease. We describe a case of a life-threatening delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction with hyperhemolysis syndrome in pregnancy.

Case

A multigravida with sickle cell disease underwent prophylactic blood transfusion before repeat cesarean delivery. Her immediate postpartum course was uneventful, but on postoperative day number 6 she presented in grave condition with what was thought initially to be an infection versus crisis. Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction with hyperhemolysis was ultimately diagnosed.

Conclusion

In the gravida with sickle cell disease and known multiple red cell antibodies, blood transfusion may incur a higher risk for delayed transfusion reaction, hyperhemolysis syndrome, and possible death. Blood transfusion should be used cautiously in these patients.

### A murine neonatal model of necrotizing enterocolitis caused by anemia and red blood cell transfusions [^1142pAi8]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an inflammatory bowel necrosis of premature infants, and is a leading cause of mortality in infants born between 22 and 28 weeks gestation. In the past decade, more than 20 retrospective clinical studies – and the meta-analysis of observational data presented in these studies, have shown an association between red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and NEC. These studies are constrained by limitations of sample size and center-based differences in demographics, severity of illness, and the baseline rates of NEC, but there are several common elements: (a) 25–40% of all cases developed NEC within 48 h following a RBC transfusion; (b) infants with transfusion-associated NEC were born at an earlier gestational age and with a lower birth weight than those who developed NEC unrelated to transfusions; and (c) many cases had received multiple RBC transfusions. Despite the consistency of this association, the retrospective, observational design of these studies has left unaddressed concerns about causality and the overall quality of evidence. Consequently, there has been a long-standing need for a preclinical model to investigate this association.

In this study, we address these knowledge gaps by developing a neonatal murine model of transfusion-associated NEC. We hypothesized that RBC transfusions may trigger NEC in the presence of severe anemia; the emphasis on anemia was based on several emerging lines of evidence: (a) NEC has been reported in patients with anemia related to diverse neonatal conditions such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, hemolytic disease of the newborn, and twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome;, (b) transfusion-associated NEC is usually a late event seen beyond 4 weeks of postnatal age, when these infants are usually anemic; and (c) intestinal injury has been observed in other populations of critically ill infants such as those undergoing treatment with cardiopulmonary bypass or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, particularly when they receive top-up transfusions to treat severe anemia. The effect of anemia in risk stratification for transfusion-associated NEC has been described in at least two clinical studies. In the following sections, we show that severe anemia in the murine neonate leads to the development of a low-grade inflammatory state in the intestine with prominent macrophage infiltration. Subsequent RBC transfusions activate these macrophages and causes NEC-like intestinal injury.

Goals of transfusion

Red cell transfusion improves oxygen-carrying capacity and symptoms of anemia. For SCD, it may be used to increase a patient's hematocrit and/or to reduce endogenous production of red cells containing hemoglobin S (HbS). Episodic transfusions are used for preoperative preparation or treatment of acute complications. Chronic transfusion therapy is utilized when the goal is to sustain a lower HbS level, such as for primary or secondary stroke prevention. A standard goal is to maintain HbS levels ≤ 30% or to raise the hemoglobin to 10–12 g/dL depending on the transfusion indication. Raising the hemoglobin to levels greater than 10–12 g/dL is generally avoided to limit the risk of hyperviscosity.

### Hemolytic transfusion reactions in sickle cell disease: underappreciated and potentially fatal [^116gDKbQ]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Routine post-transfusion antibody screening and HbA quantification should be considered to improve identification of red blood cell alloantibodies and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions

Although additional studies are certainly needed to establish the incidence of DHTR in various hospital settings, more uniform detection of these reactions is important if future DHTR are to be avoided and if effective treatment strategies are to be implemented. While patients may experience accelerated clearance of transfused RBC in the absence of clinical systems, to facilitate detection of clinically meaningful DHTR, we recommend that patients with SCD with a history of transfusion in the preceding 21 days who present with any complication requiring medical attention should be evaluated with an antibody screen regardless of whether or not another RBC transfusion is warranted. Using this approach, a higher percentage of alloantibodies that form as a result of a recent transfusion should be identified. However, as nearly 30% of DHTR have been reported to occur in the absence of detectable alloantibodies, evaluation for DHTR will also require acquisition of HbA values following transfusion and at the time of clinical presentation of any complication requiring medical attention. As episodic transfusions are much more likely to be initiated during acute complications and result in DHTR, polices that include obtaining HbA values within 48 h following an episodic transfusion may be particularly helpful when interpreting a HbA value at the time of suspected DHTR. Thus, we recommend considering routine HbA measurements following any episodic RBC transfusion and an antibody screen and HbA measurement at the time of any hospital presentation within 21 days of the most recent episodic transfusion (Table 1).

### Hemolytic transfusion reactions in sickle cell disease: underappreciated and potentially fatal [^111UstPX]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

In conclusion, RBC alloantibodies and DHTR are not uncommon in patients with SCD. They are underappreciated and, in our opinion, are the single leading cause of transfusion-associated morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population of patients. Many of the challenges associated with preventing and treating DTHR can be addressed by developing international and national RBC alloantibody databases, limiting RBC transfusions to situations that are evidence-based, implementing more accurate diagnostic strategies (through routine use of HbA quantification and standard antibody screening), better understanding the pathophysiology, and formally testing additional prophylactic and treatment approaches to prevent and treat these reactions. We urge our colleagues in hematology, transfusion medicine (from donor centers to transfusion services), laboratory information technology, funding agencies, and regulatory agencies to view RBC alloimmunization and DTHR in patients with SCD with a similar urgency as TRALI was viewed in past decades. Such a heightened awareness, and subsequent industry changes, are predicted to directly reduce the significant transfusion-associated complications that contribute to the current morbidity and mortality of patients with SCD.

### Immunological complications of blood transfusion: current insights and advances [^113Xp3Cn]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Blood transfusion is integral to modern medicine but carries significant immunological risks. This review outlines key immune-mediated complications, including acute hemolytic transfusion reactions from ABO incompatibility, and febrile nonhemolytic reactions caused by cytokines or antileukocyte antibodies. Other reactions include allergic responses, anaphylaxis (notably in IgA-deficient patients), and transfusion-related acute lung injury - the leading cause of transfusion-related mortality. Delayed hemolytic reactions, alloimmunization-induced platelet refractoriness, transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease, and post-transfusion purpura also contribute to morbidity. Transfusion-related immunomodulation may increase infection and cancer recurrence risks. Preventive measures such as leukoreduction, irradiation, extended antigen matching, and restrictive transfusion strategies are crucial. This review article emphasis the importance on the need for strict adherence to protocols, enhanced hemovigilance, and education, especially in resource-limited settings. This review article summarizes the various immunological complications of blood transfusion and the recent advances in their etiopathogenesis, prevention, mitigation, and future research direction.

Attention to a high incidence of delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions

While DHTR can be life-threatening, unawareness of their frequency and lack of severity of these transfusion reactions have likely resulted in too little attention regarding their potential impact on overall SCD morbidity and mortality. For years, the overall incidence of DHTR per transfusion in SCD was estimated to be around 1:1000. – making it a relatively uncommon transfusion reaction in this population of patients. However, newer reports suggest that these data may be misleading. As mentioned previously, given the similarities between the clinical presentation of DHTR and the more common complications of vaso-occlusive crises, DHTR can be easily missed. Unless an alloantibody screen is performed, an amnestic alloantibody response will not be detected and a diagnosis of DHTR may not be entertained. Furthermore, as some reports suggest that as many as 30% of DHTR can be alloantibody-negative, clinicians must rely on HbA measurements obtained within 48 h of the implicated transfusion and at the time of a presumptive DHTR in order to make a reliable diagnosis of DHTR, (Figure 1). Unfortunately, alloantibody screens and HbA values are not routinely ordered following transfusion or in recently transfused patients admitted for acute pain, raising the possibility that the incidence of DHTR in patients with SCD may be much higher than previously appreciated.

In an effort to assess the incidence of DHTR more accurately, a recent prospective study evaluated adult patients after transfusion using total Hb, HbA and HbS quantification within 48 h after all transfusions and defined DHTR as a significant decrease in HbA (> 50%) and/or in total Hb levels (> 30%) within 25 days of a trigger transfusion along with hemoglobinuria, symptoms of a vaso-occlusive crisis, and/or worsening symptoms of anemia. Using this approach, a DHTR was found to occur following 4.2% of episodic transfusions, over ten times more frequently than previously speculated, making DHTR the single most common adverse event following episodic transfusion in patients with SCD. Nearly 11% of all patients with DHTR died, suggesting that these reactions are not only more common than previously suggested, but also likely to affect SCD mortality significantly. These results provide one possible explanation for the recent observation that alloimmunized patients with SCD have a much higher mortality rate than non-alloimmunized individuals with SCD.

### How to avoid the problem of erythrocyte alloimmunization in sickle cell disease [^11216r96]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Erythrocyte alloimmunization is a major barrier to transfusion in sickle cell disease (SCD) because it can lead to transfusion deadlock and the development of life-threatening hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs). Several risk factors have been identified, such as blood group polymorphism in these patients of African ancestry frequently exposed to antigens they do not carry and an inflammatory clinical state of the disease. The most important preventive measure is prophylactic red blood cell antigen matching, and there is a consensus that matching for Rh (D, C, E, c, e) and K antigens should be performed for all SCD patients. However, some patients are high responders and more at risk of developing antibodies and HTRs. For these patients, the extension of matching to other blood groups, including variant antigens of the RH blood group, the use of genotyping rather than serology to characterize significant blood groups, and the prophylactic administration of immunosuppressive treatments remain a matter of debate due to low levels of certainty concerning their effects and the difficulty of determining which patients, other than those already immunized, are at high risk. These issues were recently addressed by a panel of experts established by the American Society of Hematology. Here, we review and stratify the various interventions for preventing alloimmunization, based on the literature and our experience and taking into account the obstacles to their implementation and any future developments required.

### Red cell transfusion and alloimmunization in sickle cell disease [^112oAnWM]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Red cell transfusion remains a critical component of care for acute and chronic complications of sickle cell disease. Randomized clinical trials demonstrated the benefits of transfusion therapy for prevention of primary and secondary strokes and postoperative acute chest syndrome. Transfusion for splenic sequestration, acute chest syndrome, and acute stroke are guided by expert consensus recommendations. Despite overall improvements in blood inventory safety, adverse effects of transfusion are prevalent among patients with sickle cell disease and include alloimmunization, acute and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, and iron overload. Judicious use of red cell transfusions, optimization of red cell antigen matching, and the use of erythrocytapheresis and iron chelation can minimize adverse effects. Early recognition and management of hemolytic transfusion reactions can avert poor clinical outcomes. In this review, we discuss transfusion methods, indications, and complications in sickle cell disease with an emphasis on alloimmunization.

These complications and others are reviewed, and several controversial methods for prevention of noninfectious complications of transfusion are discussed, including universal leukoreduction of erythrocyte units, use of male-only plasma, and restriction of erythrocyte storage age.

### Risk of hemolytic transfusion reactions following emergency-release RBC transfusion [^116txQJp]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Group O RBCs are typically issued for urgent transfusions to avoid ABO-incompatible hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs). Identification of other clinically significant alloantibodies requires an antibody detection test, and emergency release (ER) of RBCs before its completion carries a risk of non-ABO alloantibody-mediated HTRs. We performed a retrospective review of 1,002 ER RBC transfusions involving 265 ER episodes (262 recipients) in a tertiary medical center, 2006–2008, to determine the risk of non-ABO alloantibody-mediated HTRs. A positive antibody detection test was found in 29 (10.9%) of 265 ER episodes, with clinically significant alloantibodies in 17 (6.4%) of 265 ER episodes. Fifteen antigen-incompatible RBC units were transfused to 7 recipients with clinically significant alloantibodies; 1 transfusion was followed by an HTR. Based on our study, transfusion of ER RBCs before completion of routine blood bank testing carries a low risk of non-ABO alloantibody-mediated HTRs (1/265 [0.4% ER episodes]) and receipt of antigen-incompatible RBCs (7/265 [2.6% ER episodes]).

Additional complications of packed red blood cell transfusion

Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions and hyperhemolysis

DHTR is a feared adverse outcome of transfusion in SCD.DHTR classically occurs after re-exposure to a red cell antigen that the patient had previously been immunized against. As many as 80% of alloantibodies in patients with SCD become undetectable. In patients with SCD, 30–40% of DHTR are associated with no identifiable antibodies, and in one-third of cases, autoantibodies or antibodies of unclear specificity are the only detectable finding. The mechanisms of red cell destruction in antibody-negative DHTR have not been elucidated, however hypotheses include hyperactivated macrophages and red cells with increased membrane exposure of phosphatidylserine. Alternatively, the antibody may simply be difficult to detect. The most severe complication is hyperhemolysis, in which hemolysis of bystander autologous cells occurs, leading to a hemoglobin level lower than pre-transfusion levels and often life-threatening anemia.

The reported incidence of DHTR in SCD is 4.8–7.7%. These rates may be underestimates, as many DHTR are misdiagnosed as vaso-occlusive episodes or go undetected. In one of the largest cohorts to date, the most common clinical manifestations of DHTR were hemoglobinuria, pain, and fever. Only 44% of patients had overt signs of anemia. Signs and symptoms of DHTR vary among individuals. The recent ASH guidelines define DHTR as a significant drop in hemoglobin within 21 days after transfusion in the presence of hemoglobinuria, newly detected alloantibodies, accelerated increase in HbS, significant change in reticulocyte percentage, or increase in lactate dehydrogenase level above baseline. Rapid decline in HbA concentration relative to an early post-transfusion measurement is highly predictive of DHTR. Risk factors include a history of alloimmunization, prior DHTR, and transfusion for acute complications.

### Hemolytic transfusion reactions in sickle cell disease: underappreciated and potentially fatal [^111ud9x7]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Delayed-type hemolytic transfusion reactions. (A) Exposure to a red blood cell (RBC) alloantigen through transfusion or pregnancy can result in the development of alloantibodies (allo) that quickly evanescence over time, possibly preventing their detection prior to a subsequent transfusion. Re-exposure to RBC expressing the same alloantigen can induce an amnestic alloantibody response, which can cause accelerated clearance of the transfused RBC, resulting in hemolysis and a delayed-type transfusion reaction (DHTR). Alloantibody-induced clearance of transfused RBC can occasionally result in hyperhemolysis, otherwise known as hyperhemolytic syndrome (HHS), which is signified by the accelerated clearance of the patient's own RBC and which can be particularly fatal. (B). Alloantibodies that develop in response to exposure to alloantigens can lead to direct clearance of RBC through a variety of antibody effector mechanisms, including complement activation. Sometimes patients will experience a DHTR in the absence of a detectable alloantibody; an alloantibody may be present and simply be below the detection threshold of clinical assays or an alloantibody may be absent entirely, with the DHTR possibly reflecting heme-mediated complement activation and RBC hemolysis. Regardless of the mode of hemolysis experienced by transfused RBC in the setting of a DHTR, heme released may activate complement, thereby potentially contributing to the development of hyperhemolysis.

### The contribution of iron deficiency to the risk of peripartum transfusion: a retrospective case control study [^1178CyNS]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency in pregnancy is associated with inferior maternal and fetal outcomes. Postpartum depression, prematurity, intrauterine growth restriction, impaired childhood cognition and transfusion are all sequelae of maternal iron deficiency anemia. Transfusion to women of childbearing age has important consequences including increasing the risk of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn with future pregnancies. The relative contribution of iron deficiency to transfusion rates in the peripartum period is unknown. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of iron deficiency and anemia in pregnant women that received peripartum transfusions relative to age-matched non-transfused controls.

Methods

We performed a retrospective case-control study of all women that were transfused in the peripartum period from January, 2014 to July, 2018. Cases were compared to the next age matched control to deliver at our institution. The primary objective was to determine the proportion of patients with iron deficiency in pregnancy or anemia in pregnancy in cases and controls. Charts were reviewed for predisposing risk factors for iron deficiency, laboratory measures of iron deficiency and anemia, iron supplementation history and maternal and fetal outcomes. Factors associated with peripartum transfusion were analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression.

Results

169 of 18, 294 (0.9%) women were transfused in the peripartum period and 64 (44%) of those transfused received 1 unit. Iron deficiency or anemia were present in 103 (71%) transfused women and 74 (51%) control women in pregnancy (OR 2.34, 95% CI: 3.7–18.0). Multivariate analysis identified social work involvement (adjusted OR 4.1, 95% CI: 1.8–10.1), intravenous iron supplementation in pregnancy (adjusted OR 3.8, 95% CI: 1.2–17.4) and delivery by unscheduled cesarean section (adjusted OR 2.8, 95% CI: 1.3–6.2) as significant predictors of peripartum transfusion.

Conclusions

Pregnant women being followed by a social worker, receiving intravenous iron supplementation in pregnancy or who deliver by unscheduled cesarean section are more likely to receive a red blood cell transfusion. Women with iron deficiency or anemia in pregnancy are at increased risk of peripartum blood transfusions and warrant early and rigorous iron supplementation.

### Challenges of alloimmunization in patients with haemoglobinopathies [^113pr5bf]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions can be life-sustaining in chronic inherited anaemias, such as thalassaemia, and the indications for blood transfusions in patients with sickle cell disease continue to expand. Complications of transfusions, such as allosensitization, can create significant medical challenges in the management of patients with haemoglobinopathies. This review summarizes key findings from the medical literature related to alloimmunization in haemoglobinopathies and examines potential measures to mitigate these risks. Areas where future studies are needed are also addressed.

G2 is Hgb 10.0 to 8.0 g/dL; < 6.2 to 4.9 mmol/L; < 100 to 80 g/L with guidance to Hold ICPi and strongly consider permanent discontinuation. Administer 0.5–1 mg/kg/d prednisone equivalents. G3 is Hgb < 8.0 g/dL; < 4.9 mmol/L; < 80 g/L; transfusion indicated with Permanently discontinue ICPi, Prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/d (oral or IV equivalent depending on symptoms or speed of development), and transfusion precautions including Do not transfuse more than the minimum number of RBC units necessary to relieve the symptoms of anemia or to return a patient to a safe hemoglobin range (7–8 g/dL in stable, noncardiac inpatients), and Should offer patients supplementation with folic acid 1 mg daily. G4 is Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated with Permanently discontinue ICPi, IV prednisone corticosteroids 1–2 mg/kg/d, consideration of other immunosuppressive drugs if no improvement, and RBC transfusion per existing guidelines with Discuss with blood bank team before transfusions that a patient with possible ICPi SAE is in the hospital. Additional considerations include Monitor hemoglobin levels weekly until the steroid tapering process is complete. Thereafter, less frequent testing is needed.

### Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction in children with sickle cell disease [^112nJ6sn]. Haematologica (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Transfusion is a cornerstone of the management of sickle cell disease but carries a high risk of hemolytic transfusion reaction, probably because of differences in erythrocyte antigens between blood donors of European descent and patients of African descent. Patients may experience hemolytic transfusion reactions that are delayed by from a few days to two weeks and manifest as acute hemolysis (hemoglobinuria, jaundice, and pallor), symptoms suggesting severe vaso-occlusive crisis (pain, fever, and acute chest syndrome), and profound anemia, often with reticulocytopenia. This case-series study aims to describe the main characteristics of this syndrome, to discuss its pathophysiology, and to propose a management strategy.

Design and Methods

We identified 8 pediatric cases of delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions between 2006 and 2009 in the database of the Necker Hospital, France. All patients had received cross-matched red cell units compatible in the ABO, RH, and KEL systems. We reviewed the medical charts in the computerized blood transfusion databases. All patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. We progressively adopted the following strategy: intravenous immunoglobulins, and darbopoietin alpha when the reticulocyte count was below 150×10(9)/L, without further blood transfusion during the acute episode unless absolutely necessary.

Results

The median time between the transfusion and the diagnosis of delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction was six days. All patients had severe bone pain; all but one had a high-grade fever. Five patients had hemoglobin levels less than than 4 g/dL and 3 had reticulocytopenia. In 5 patients, no new antibody was found; one patient had weakly reactive antibodies. Only 2 patients had new allo-antibodies possibly responsible for the delayed hemolytic reaction.

Conclusions

The initial symptoms of delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction were complex and mimicked other complications of sickle cell disease. In most of our cases, no new antibody was identified, which underlines the complexity of the pathophysiology of this syndrome.

### Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn: systematic literature review of the antenatal landscape [^113HbAmY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite advances in the prevention of pregnancy-related red blood cell immunization and management and treatment of pregnancies affected by hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) over recent decades, the disease still poses a significant risk in affected pregnancies. HDFN is caused by maternal alloimmunization through exposure to incompatible red blood cell antigens of the fetus or through incompatible blood transfusion. The then-formed immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies are actively transported across the placenta and can cause fetal hemolysis and anemia. When untreated, progressive fetal anemia results in hydrops fetalis and ultimately fetal demise. If the fetus survives, persistent hemolysis causes neonatal anemia and hyperbilirubinemia, which — when untreated — ultimately leads to a severe cerebral condition ("kernicterus").

No cure exists for HDFN. Hence, interventions have focused on its prevention and minimizing adverse effects of associated complications. Through transfusing women within the reproductive ages with Kell-negative donor blood, if possible, and through the introduction of Rhesus (Rh) immunoglobulin prophylaxis, the occurrence of red blood cell alloimmunization and the prevalence of Rh(D)- and K-mediated HDFN has decreased; however, the gap between anti-Rh(D) supply and demand is large in low-income countries and is below the optimal threshold in high-income countries. Additionally, the disease still poses a significant risk for mortality and morbidity in developing countries, whereas it is considered treatable with good outcomes in developed countries. Serological monitoring, ultrasonography, and Doppler imaging decreased the need for risky and invasive diagnostic procedures. Antenatal treatment, however, still relies predominantly on (often serial) intrauterine transfusion (IUT) — an invasive procedure that carries maternal and fetal risks.

Considering improvements in HDFN care, the objectives of this systematic literature review were to assess the prenatal treatment landscape and outcomes of Rh(D)- and K-mediated HDFN in mothers and fetuses to identify the burden of disease, to identify evidence gaps in the literature, and to provide recommendations for future research. Secondarily, we aim to determine the humanistic and economic burden of HDFN.

### Red cell specifications for blood group matching in patients with haemoglobinopathies: an updated systematic review and clinical practice guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^1122XpBm]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

In sickle cell disease (SCD; including HbSS, HbSC, HbS‐beta thalassaemia, HbSD, HbSE, HbSO Arab) and thalassaemia, including transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia (TDT), the development of alloantibodies following red blood cell (RBC) transfusion has well‐recognised clinical consequences, including haemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs) and delays in sourcing appropriately matched RBCs for transfusion. There is a need to understand to what degree the high prevalence of alloimmunisation in SCD and thalassaemia can be prevented by matching transfused RBCs as closely as possible to the RBC antigen phenotype of the patient. The feasibility of providing more extended matched RBC units than is standard practice is dependent on many factors including the size of the donor pool, differences between donor and recipient ethnicity, and the laboratory resources available at the hospital, donor centre, and blood transfusion services. The provision of extended matched RBCs for transfusion may however be associated with delays in transfusion, which may have a clinical impact. There are also concerns that sequestering of RBC units for purposes of prophylactic matching may deplete the availability of antigen‐negative units to patients who have previously formed antibodies, placing these patients at risk of harm.

Previous evidence‐based guidelines have provided recommendations for prophylactic RBC matching beyond ABO and RhD in patients with SCD and thalassaemia aimed at reducing risks of alloimmunisation. Such practices are relevant both in patients who have never developed an alloantibody, and in those who have been previously alloimmunised, but with the added need to minimise the formation of new alloantibodies. In 2018, the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines (ICTMG)made several recommendations based on a systematic review of 18 published studies (Appendix A). However, recommendations are not always consistent across guidelines, and a subsequent position paper from the British Society for Haematology (BSH)raised uncertainties about the recommendations to provide extensive phenotype‐matched RBC in patients who had acquired any RBC alloantibodies. As part of an ongoing need to review guidelines in response to new literature, this evidence‐based guideline was commissioned by ICTMG. An updated systematic review of relevant literature evidence was conducted for studies published after 2015. An international panel of experts was convened to review the new literature and to determine whether previous recommendations were still appropriate and relevant to the current clinical practice and literature or needed updating.

### Design of a phase 3, global, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of nipocalimab in pregnancies at risk for severe hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn [^111LS2Vp]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) is a rare, potentially life-threatening condition of progressive fetal/neonatal anemia due to the transplacental transfer of maternal anti–red blood cell (RBC) immunoglobulin G (IgG) alloantibodies. In severe HDFN (defined as HDFN associated with poor fetal outcomes or neonatal death), sufficient maternal IgG alloantibody transfer leads to fetal anemia or neonatal death. Despite the introduction of Rhesus D (RhD) IgG prophylaxis to prevent alloimmunization in RhD-negative pregnant individuals, the risk of developing severe HDFN remains. Severe HDFN is associated with substantial fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality. The risk for recurrence of severe HDFN has been reported as 86% in subsequent pregnancies following previous severe HDFN, with a significant proportion developing HDFN at an earlier gestational age (GA) than in the prior severe HDFN pregnancy.

Standard-of-care HDFN management involves noninvasive monitoring with middle cerebral artery (MCA) Doppler ultrasound for fetal anemia. When MCA Doppler ultrasound results suggest moderate-to-severe fetal anemia, cordocentesis, and intrauterine transfusion (IUT) of RBCs are performed to avoid hydrops fetalis and fetal loss. However, the IUT procedure is an invasive intervention that is associated with procedural complications, including an increased risk of emergency cesarean delivery, premature or preterm birth, or fetal loss, as well as increased maternal alloimmunization. Management of severe HDFN with standard-of-care monitoring and IUTs requires significant expertise and experience, including a maternal–fetal medicine specialist, dedicated transfusion medicine unit, anesthesiologist, operating room with specialized staff, and/or on-call neonatal intensive care unit support.

### Hemolytic transfusion reactions in sickle cell disease: underappreciated and potentially fatal [^113hSbzG]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Comparison of delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions with transfusion-related acute lung injury

There are resemblances between the underappreciated incidence and impact of DHTR in patients with SCD and the history of other transfusion reactions with fatal outcomes. Until relatively recently, TRALI was a rarely recognized complication of primarily platelet and plasma transfusion defined by acute lung injury within 6 h of transfusion in the presence of hypoxia, with radiographic evidence of bilateral infiltrates in the absence of circulatory overload. Because patients who are susceptible to TRALI often have significant comorbidities, changes in pulmonary function that accompanied transfusion were historically attributed to other etiologies. However, once the impact of TRALI was recognized and regulatory agencies heightened hemovigilance efforts, TRALI quickly became identified as the most common cause of transfusion-related mortality in the United States and Europe. Epidemiological studies found associations between blood products donated from multiparous women and other donor factors that increased the likelihood that a recipient would develop TRALI. In particular, anti-HLA and other anti-leukocyte alloantibodies that may bind and activate leukocytes intravascularly became implicated in the pathogenesis of TRALI. – Implementation of manufacturing practices that excluded multiparous females and other donors who appeared to increase the risk of TRALI in transfusion recipients has resulted in a significant reduction in TRALI cases. Thus, TRALI provides a key example of an underappreciated transfusion complication that can result in significant morbidity and mortality and that, upon additional study, improved diagnostic criteria and changes in clinical practice, has dramatically reduced in incidence over time.

Intrauterine transfusion — hematocrit targets and thresholds — In general, the final target hematocrit should be approximately 40 — 50%. If the fetal hematocrit is greater than 30%, no transfusion is necessary, although a resampling may be recommended within 1 — 2 weeks, depending on the clinical circumstances, and transfusion to higher levels has been associated with a theoretical increased risk of complications.

Recommendations

The panel reviewed and formulated recommendations in the light of the new evidence. These recommendations are summarised and compared with the 2018 ICTMG recommendations in Table 4.

TABLE 4
Recommendations, as per the updated evidence.

Recommendation 1: Patients with SCD who do not have any known alloantibodies and who are anticipated to have a transfusion (either top‐up/small volume or exchange) should probably be transfused with ABO, RhD, RhCcEe, and K‐matched RBCs to reduce the risk of alloimmunisation and delayed haemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs) (low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

Evidence summary and rationale: Neither the updated review nor the previous one conclusively compared the outcomes of matching for ABO and RhD alone versus additional matching that has been described in publications (most commonly RhCcEe and K antigens). Although Campbell‐Lee et al.compared extended prophylactic matching for RhCcEe, Fy a, Fy b, Jk a, Jk b, K, and S to matching for antigens against which patients had alloantibodies, and demonstrated a significant reduction in alloantibody development, the apparent reduction in alloimmunisation associated with the prophylactic extended matching may have been confounded by a significantly longer follow‐up period for those who had received less extensive matching. Whilst the additional evidence available since the publication of the original guideline remains low quality, a strong recommendation is made to account for anecdotal case reports demonstrating the serious consequences of HTRs, particularly in SCD.

### Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction in children with sickle cell disease: first 5-year retrospective study in mainland France [^1124ESr5]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Further transfusion should be avoided during the acute episode, as it can lead to HH, as observed in eight children in our study with apparently overlooked DHTR. However, the SCD-related complications, as well as life-threatening anemia and intravascular hemolysis reactions that can arise during DHTR are not without risks. Timely transfusion, before irreversible multiorgan failure or stroke has occurred, should be considered, to improve oxygen delivery, together with the use of corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. The efficacy of more recent therapeutic interventions such as eculizumab or tocilizumab needs to be confirmed by additionnal reports. In the acute DHTR setting, as during future patient management in situations which subsequent RBC transfusion may be required, shared decision-making is crucial. We propose national multidisciplinary meetings, to facilitate close communication between SCD physicians and transfusion medicine specialists for the discussion of preventive strategies.

Perioperative blood management — patient evaluation guidance specifies that preoperative evaluation to identify risk factors for requiring a blood transfusion or adjuvant therapy includes reviewing previous medical records, conducting a patient or family interview, reviewing existing laboratory test results, and ordering additional laboratory tests when indicated. Literature findings state that although reviewing medical records and conducting a patient interview are well accepted practices, comparative studies are insufficient to evaluate their impact; observational studies and case reports indicate conditions such as sickle-cell anemia, clotting factor deficiency, hemophilia, and liver disease may be associated with blood transfusion complications (Category B3/B4-H evidence).

### Anemia, allogenic blood transfusion, and immunomodulation in the critically ill [^1156YzSj]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Anemia and allogenic RBC transfusions are exceedingly common among critically ill patients. Multiple pathologic mechanisms contribute to the genesis of anemia in these patients. Emerging risks associated with allogenic RBC transfusions including the transmission of newer infectious agents and immune modulation predisposing the patient to infections requires reevaluation of current transfusion strategies. Recent data have suggested that a restrictive transfusion practice is associated with reduced morbidity and mortality during critical illness, with the possible exception of acute coronary syndromes. In this article, we review the immune-modulatory role of allogenic RBC transfusions in critically ill patients.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing intraoperative red blood cell transfusion strategies [^113jQxTb]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are commonly administered in the perioperative setting. In the United States alone, 11 million units of RBCs are administered annually, of which over one quarter are given to surgical patients. By international estimates, surgical services account for 24%–44% of transfused RBC units among inpatients. Although the need for transfusion is variable, its incidence in the perioperative period can be as high as 50% in procedures associated with a high risk of bleeding. –

Although potentially lifesaving, RBC transfusions are not benign interventions. Risks include transfusion-associated acute lung injury, transfusion-associated circulatory overload, hemolytic reactions, bacterial contamination, viral transmission, alloimmunization, and a risk of mistransfusion due to human error.RBC transfusion may also lead to transfusion-related immunomodulation, which may be associated with worse oncologic outcomes in surgical patients. Finally, blood products are a limited and expensive, costing up to 761 US dollars per RBC unit in surgical patients.

There is evidence in the literature of significant variation in transfusion practice in patients undergoing surgery, both in the intraoperative and postoperative settings. Risk-adjusted variation in RBC transfusion has been identified prominently in cardiac surgeryand in major noncardiac surgery.– Although a certain degree of variation is expected based on casemix, wide variation that cannot be explained by disease severity or patient preference likely reflects unwarranted variation in clinical care. – A critical examination of factors contributing to this variation is warranted.

Recommendations guiding the administration of RBCs during surgery exist in the literature. – Guidance pertaining to intraoperative transfusion management is generally limited and endorses the use of restrictive transfusion thresholds. However, this endorsement generally relies on evidence from clinical trials conducted in the postoperative and nonoperative settings. The generalizability of these recommendations to patients undergoing a surgical procedure under general anesthesia is limited for several reasons. First, despite a majority of anesthesiologists identifying hemoglobin concentration as the most important factor when deciding on an intraoperative transfusion, it may be less relevant to guide RBC transfusion in the setting of active or rapid blood loss, particularly given the significant variation in hemoglobin concentration with volume of administered crystalloid or colloid fluids. Second, hemodynamic variations in surgical patients are not necessarily reflective of anemia from surgical bleeding, and may result from other factors such as pharmacologic anesthetic agents, patient positioning, mechanical ventilation, neuraxial analgesia, surgical manipulation, and abdominal insufflation. A comprehensive synthesis of randomized trials comparing intraoperative transfusion strategies does not exist, and is thus timely and necessary.

### Transfusions in autoimmune hemolytic anemias: frequency and clinical significance of alloimmunization [^114b3BUb]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) may be associated with transfusion reactions and risk of alloimmunization.

Objectives

To evaluate the transfusion policy and rate of alloimmunization and its clinical significance in AIHA.

Methods

Data from 305 AIHA patients followed at a reference hematologic Center in Milan, Italy from 1997 to 2022 were retrospectively/prospectively collected (NCT05931718).

Results

Overall, 33% patients required transfusions with a response rate of 83% and eight transfusion reactions (7%), none hemolytic. Alloantibodies were detected in 19% of patients, being associated with higher transfusion burden (p = 0.01), lower Hb increase post-transfusion (p = 0.05), and transfusion reactions (p = 0.04). Along decades, the rate of RBC transfusions decreased from 53% to 20% and that of alloimmunization dropped from 30% to 6% likely due to the adoption of prestorage leukoreduction, the use of more restrictive Hb thresholds, and the implementation of molecular typing.

Conclusions

Severe symptomatic AIHA may be safely transfused provided appropriate matching of patients and donors.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guideline on blood product transfusion in burn care [^115qdZJj]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Burn-related anemia and transfusion thresholds — Anemia after a major burn injury is ubiquitous, and the most common treatment of anemia in patients with major burns is to transfuse RBC units; however, blood transfusion is not without risks and potential morbidity and allogeneic RBC units are expensive and are increasingly a scarce resource, worldwide, with adverse effects including acute fluid overload, acute lung injury, immune responsiveness, allergic or hemolytic reactions, bacterial contamination, disease transmission, and kidney injury. In 1999, the Transfusion Requirement in Critical Care (TRICC) trial studied critically ill patients and compared a restrictive (7 g/dL) versus liberal (10 g/dL) hemoglobin threshold for administering RBCs, and in 2017 the Transfusion Requirement in Burn Care Evaluation (TRIBE) study reported that a restrictive transfusion threshold for burn patients resulted in dramatically fewer transfusions, with no worse outcomes than a liberal approach to blood transfusion.

Early gestation severe anemia — risk, limits, and scheduling — Severely anemic fetuses at 18 — 24 weeks of gestation are at high risk of complications from intrauterine transfusion, and it has therefore been suggested that the posttransfusion hematocrit at these early gestations should not exceed 25% or a 4-fold increase from the pretransfusion value; if needed, a second intrauterine transfusion can be performed within 48 hours and a third procedure scheduled in 7 — 10 days, and in fetuses at less than 22 weeks' gestation, an intraperitoneal transfusion may be a safer approach.

### Reticulocytes in donor blood units enhance red blood cell alloimmunization [^113BGZi7]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

RBC transfusion is an essential therapy in numerous diseases and is the most common inpatient therapeutic procedure requiring consent, with approximately 11 million transfusions per year in the US. Although RBC transfusions can be lifesaving, some patients develop alloantibodies against donor RBC blood group antigens. RBC alloimmunization is clinically significant because it can cause adverse events (e.g. hyperhemolysis) and pose barriers to future care (e.g. organ transplantation). In addition, alloantibody prevention and detection, and mitigation of adverse events, currently requires significant medical, financial, and human resources. As such, identifying risk factors that promote alloimmunization is a high priority and would allow for reallocation of resources to patients most at-risk and provide potential therapeutic interventions. Herein, we demonstrate that the reticulocyte count in donor RBC units can enhance RBC alloimmunization, suggesting that increased reticulocyte frequencies may make RBC units more immunogenic and screening for reticulocyte count and/or lengthening the time between donations for repeat blood donors may reduce alloimmunization events.

### How I treat challenging transfusion cases in sickle cell disease [^114R8Jzc]. Blood (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) can be lifesaving for individuals living with sickle cell disease (SCD). However, alloimmunization after transfusion is more common with patients with SCD than in other patient populations, resulting in morbidity and mortality. Management of complications related to RBC alloantibodies, including delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs) and identifying compatible RBCs for future transfusions, remains a challenge for hematologists and transfusion medicine providers. Although transfusion guidelines from organizations, including the American Society for Hematology provide general recommendations, individual cases remain challenging. Antibody evanescence and the lack of widespread RBC alloantibody data sharing across hospitals pose unique challenges, as do RH variants in both transfusion recipients and blood donors. Further, as potentially curative therapies require RBC transfusions to lower the hemoglobin S before cellular therapy collections and infusions, patients who are highly alloimmunized may be deemed ineligible. The cases described are representative of clinical dilemmas the authors have encountered, and the approaches are as evidence-based as the literature and the authors' experiences allow. A future desired state is one in which RBC alloantibody data are efficiently shared across institutions, Rh alloimmunization can be mitigated, better treatments exist for DHTRs, and a label of difficult to transfuse does not prevent desired therapies.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: transfusion support [^114m8LT8]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Red cell transfusions remain a mainstay of therapy for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), but pose significant clinical challenges. Guidance for specific indications and administration of transfusion, as well as screening, prevention, and management of alloimmunization, delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs), and iron overload may improve outcomes.

Objective

Our objective was to develop evidence-based guidelines to support patients, clinicians, and other healthcare professionals in their decisions about transfusion support for SCD and the management of transfusion-related complications.

Methods

The American Society of Hematology formed a multidisciplinary panel that was balanced to minimize bias from conflicts of interest and that included a patient representative. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes. The Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Research Program supported the guideline development process. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to form recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel developed 10 recommendations focused on red cell antigen typing and matching, indications, and mode of administration (simple vs red cell exchange), as well as screening, prevention, and management of alloimmunization, DHTRs, and iron overload.

Conclusions

The majority of panel recommendations were conditional due to the paucity of direct, high-certainty evidence for outcomes of interest. Research priorities were identified, including prospective studies to understand the role of serologic vs genotypic red cell matching, the mechanism of HTRs resulting from specific alloantigens to inform therapy, the role and timing of regular transfusions during pregnancy for women, and the optimal treatment of transfusional iron overload in SCD.

CONCLUSION

The guideline panel recognised the paucity of evidence favouring the use of extended matching strategies. Well‐designed adequately resourced studies are needed to inform how to reduce alloimmunisation and hence the risks related to transfusion, especially in vulnerable patient groups who rely on transfusion as a primary treatment for their conditions. Specific matching strategies, if implemented, may need to be further adapted for different areas of the world depending on donor profiles.

Therapeutic options for ongoing delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions

In addition to facilitating more accurate diagnoses of DHTR, routine approaches aimed at identifying DHTR will allow consideration of more effective therapeutic options for ongoing DTHR; these therapies are particularly important to consider for DHTR involving hyperhemolysis. Erythropoietin and intravenous iron are often given to boost endogenous RBC production in a setting of severe anemia. Plasmapheresis has also been attempted to reduce heme levels, although the level of anemia and inability to transfuse may prevent this from becoming a realistic option in many patients. Intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids may further reduce hemolysis in the setting of DHTR. While characteristics of the transfused unit, such as RBC storage, may have an impact on transfusion outcomes in SCD, recent studies suggest that exuberant complement activation may account for the most severe DHTR with accompanying hyperhemolysis. Consistent with this, treatment of patients experiencing DHTR-associated hyperhemolysis with eculizumab, an anti-C5 complement-blocking antibody, has been shown to reverse complement activation, reduce hemolysis, and result in rapid clinical improvement. While additional studies are needed, these reports hold promise and suggest that more effective treatment options that could significantly improve patients' care may be on the horizon (Table 1).

Avoiding additional RBC transfusion at the time of an ongoing DHTR with bystander hemolysis is recommended, as transfusion of even seemingly compatible RBC that are negative for all alloantigens that the patient is known to be alloimmunized against may worsen the ongoing hemolysis. If the alloantibody in question cannot be identified or if it is identified but compatible units cannot be allocated, alloantibody function tests can be ordered to assess the clinical significance of a patient's alloantibodies. This test typically involves evaluation of monocyte engulfment of antibody-coated cells in vitro as a read out of alloantibody function. However, this approach is time-consuming, and may not provide timely results in an acute setting. Should the clinical status of the patient necessitate consideration of a "least incompatible" RBC transfusion, rituximab prophylaxis has been described to reduce DHTR in small case reports.

### The bloody mess of red blood cell transfusion [^1128rB2i]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is one of the most iconic intravenous treatments in medicine. In life-threatening conditions of massive blood loss, state-of-the-art RBC transfusion might be the most prominent option to prevent immediate death. Based on this tradition, a healthcare provider treating an anaemic surgical or critically ill patient may consider RBC transfusion as a life-saving treatment. Increasing evidence, however, indicates that RBC transfusion might also induce harm in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, any transfusion decision presupposes not only a thorough consideration of pros and cons, but also a careful assessment of potential alternatives.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine (SMFM) clinical guideline # 8: the fetus at risk for anemia – diagnosis and management [^114h717R]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

Fetal anemia — monitoring and timing of repeat intrauterine transfusion (IUT): After a transfusion in an alloimmunized pregnancy, fetal hemoglobin and hematocrit are expected to decline at approximately 0.4 g/dL per day and 1% per day, respectively; using the MCA-PSV can give an accurate assessment of when to resample, with reported detection of severe anemia at 100% sensitivity and a false-positive rate of 6%. Following an initial transfusion, the recommended threshold for diagnosing fetal anemia that requires a second transfusion is higher (MoM > 1.69). If the posttransfusion hematocrit is known or can be estimated, timing of the next transfusion can be calculated using the expected decline in fetal hematocrit, and after a second transfusion the intertransfusion interval should be individualized based on pathology, fetal condition, and posttransfusion hematocrit rather than MCA-PSV thresholds.

### Role of red blood cells in clinically relevant bleeding tendencies and complications [^1116t7wH]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

6 | CONCLUSIONS

Although there has long been observational evidence that RBCs play a role in hemostasis, it is only recently that some of the mechanisms have been discovered. Nevertheless, this remains a rich area for both basic and clinical studies since much is still unknown.

Particularly, a comprehensive analysis of sets of both clinical and laboratory-based variables as risk factors for bleeding and thrombosis should be taken into account. A clean wound and exposed collagen surface, enough platelets and RBCs with their functional capacities, good coagulation factor activity and cationic environment, and appropriate fibrinolysis are the building blocks of hemostasis (Figure 4). Educational efforts related to how to interpret the currently available clinical laboratory testing demand constant attention. Unfortunately, the current transfusion guidelines do not provide guidance on special groups of patients, namely, severe inherited and acquired bleeding disorders. We will need more practical tools to reach goals for the efficacious and safe management of our patients with anemia and coagulation disorders.

### Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction in children with sickle cell disease: first 5-year retrospective study in mainland France [^11642T5h]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) is increasingly being reported as a serious complication of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Alloimmunization against RBC antigens has been identified as its leading underlying cause.

DHTR remains a major challenge as it may be under-recognized, leading to patient receiving inappropriate further transfusion that may result in life-threatening exacerbation of hemolysis. Moreover there is no consensus on its optimal management. Immunoglobulins (IVIG) and erythropoïetin (EPO) are considered beneficial, and eculizumab has recently emerged as a possible alternative treatment. It has been recommended that RBC transfusions be withheld during DHTR as this might aggravate hemolysis, whereas the use of corticosteroids (CS) is still controversial because of its suspected vaso-occlusive triggering effect. However, in the setting of acute severe DHTR, the potential risks of steroids associated with RBC transfusion must be balanced against their potential life-saving effects. For patients requiring further transfusion away from the DHTR acute episode, rituximab is recommended to prevent the production of additional alloantibodies. However, there is currently a lack of evidence to guide the best management of these "untransfusable" patients.

Our main objective was therefore to update the clinical description of DHTR, immuno-hematology findings, laboratory explorations and immediate management, at nationwide scale for children with SCD, over a 5-year period beginning in 2015, a period of improved awareness of DHTR. The secondary objective was to describe future patient management, when a subsequent RBC transfusion was required, later following the resolution of DHTR.

This study was based on a national survey performed through the French national SCD network in which all cases of DHTR in children (age < 18 years) diagnosed with SCD, occurring between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2020 and followed-up in mainland France were collected. Relevant patient data were retrospectively collected from medical files and anonymized. The data collected included clinical and laboratory data at the time of the triggering transfusion (TT) and during the DHTR episode (including evidence of the selective destruction of transfused cells over self-sickle RBC), management and clinical course. Transfusion and antibody history data from the French Blood Agency information system were also analyzed. Following national recommendations, all French centers deliver cross-matched, leukocyte-reduced, RBC units matched for ABO, RH and K. This study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

### Noninfectious transfusion-associated adverse events and their mitigation strategies [^112v9zw3]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Blood transfusions are life-saving therapies; however, they can result in adverse events that can be infectious or, more commonly, noninfectious. The most common noninfectious reactions include febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions, allergic transfusion reactions, transfusion-associated circulatory overload, transfusion-related acute lung injury, and acute and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions. These reactions can be asymptomatic, mild, or potentially fatal. There are several new methodologies to diagnose, treat, and prevent these reactions. Hemovigilance systems for monitoring transfusion events have been developed and demonstrated decreases in some adverse events, such as hemolytic transfusion reactions. Now vein-to-vein databases are being created to study the interactions of the donor, product, and patient factors in the role of adverse outcomes. This article reviews the definition, pathophysiology, management, and mitigation strategies, including the role of the donor, product, and patient, of the most common noninfectious transfusion-associated adverse events. Prevention strategies, such as leukoreduction, plasma reduction, additive solutions, and patient blood management programs, are actively being used to enhance transfusion safety. Understanding the incidence, pathophysiology, and current management strategies will help to create innovative products and continually hone in on best transfusion practices that suit individualized patient needs.

### Interventions to prevent iatrogenic anemia: a Laboratory Medicine Best Practices systematic review [^113z4Pm4]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

The interventions examined in this review have been discussed multiple times. Institutions may not currently use blood conservation devices due to a number of concerns. One concern is that such devices may increase the risk of catheter-acquired infections. None of the studies of blood conservation devices in the review reported on this outcome. Blood conservation devices are also costly, and without evidence of impact on health outcomes, institutions may be reluctant to invest in the devices. The cost of the device may be offset by savings on the cost of blood for transfusions.

We found evidence on three additional interventions aimed at reducing blood loss for diagnostic testing and the associated risk of iatrogenic anemia and transfusions. These were point of care testing devices, policy changes and provider education aimed at reducing unnecessary testing, and bundles of interventions implemented together. The evidence was insufficient in supporting the effectiveness of these interventions.

The inability of our review to evaluate several commonly proposed interventions to reduce blood loss from diagnostic testing among critically ill patients illustrates the need for additional research and for improvements in research on this topic to improve both individual studies and future systematic reviews. Although we used recommended methodological practices to limit the risk of bias in our review, the available evidence required accommodations that may have introduced bias. Most notably, the included studies reported on different measurements of outcomes of interest. We identified the most clinically relevant measures among those commonly reported and attempted to convert reported results into those measures. This conversion sometimes required assumptions, such as using the average number of days of ICU admission and the average total blood loss to calculate blood loss per patient per day. In other cases, we were unable to convert the measures and had to consider similar but unequal measures, such as median loss per day rather than mean loss per day, as if they were equivalent. If the assumptions underlying these conversions and groupings were wrong, our findings may be biased in unpredictable ways. In addition, the body of evidence for any given outcome was small, limiting our ability to examine direct evidence across the causal chain.

### The acute hemolytic anemias: the importance of emergency diagnosis and management [^113edu4K]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hemolytic anemias are defined by the premature destruction of red blood cells. These anemias have many causes that are mostly due to chronic diseases, but, occasionally, cases of acute life-threatening hemolysis can occur.

Objective

The objectives of this article were to review the pathophysiology of hemolytic anemias, to discuss the general emergency department (ED) evaluation, and to discuss the assessment and treatment of important and "cannot miss" hemolytic diseases.

Discussion

Because hemolytic anemias are rarely seen, the emergency physician may consider a patient's anemia as due to blood loss rather than hemolysis, and the workup and treatment may not be appropriate. The primary goal for the emergency provider is to resuscitate, but he or she also must recognize that a hemolytic process is present. Appropriate laboratory work and specialist consultation should be obtained. While focused treatment is rarely necessary in the ED, the avoidance of certain treatments, such as early platelet transfusion in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, may be necessary.

Conclusions

Hemolytic anemias are rare, but should still be considered in the ED differential diagnosis of low hemoglobin. Emergency physicians should first resuscitate, but should also be able to identify the presence of hemolysis and obtain the appropriate laboratory tests. Occasionally, specific treatments are needed but should be discussed in conjunction with a specialist.

### Red blood cell transfusion to treat or prevent complications in sickle cell disease: an overview of cochrane reviews [^111Xy4x5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Globally, sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are used to treat complications of SCD, e.g. acute chest syndrome (ACS) (this often involves a single transfusion episode), or they can be part of a regular long-term transfusion programme to prevent SCD complications.

Objectives

To summarize the evidence in Cochrane Reviews of the effectiveness and safety of RBC transfusions versus no transfusion, or restrictive (to increase the total haemoglobin) versus liberal (to decrease the haemoglobin S level below a specified percentage) transfusion, for treating or preventing complications experienced by people with SCD.

Methods

We included Cochrane Reviews of randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, that addressed various SCD complications and had RBC transfusion as an intervention or comparator. We assessed the methodological quality of included reviews according to the AMSTAR quality assessment.

Main Results

We included 15 Cochrane Reviews, 10 of which had no included studies with an RBC transfusion intervention (five reported RCTs with other interventions; and five contained no studies). Five of the 15 reviews included participants randomised to RBC transfusion, but in one of these reviews only 10 participants were randomised with no usable data. Four reviews (nine trials with 1502 participants) reported data comparing short- or long-term RBC transfusions versus standard care, disease-modifying agents, a restrictive versus a liberal transfusion strategy and long-term RBC transfusions versus transfusions to treat complications. All reviews were of high quality according to AMSTAR quality assessment, however, the quality of the included trials was highly variable across outcomes. Trials were downgraded according to GRADE methodology for risk of bias, indirectness (most trials were conducted in children with HbSS), and imprecision (outcomes had wide confidence intervals). In all four reviews and all comparisons there was little or no difference in the risk of death (very low-quality evidence). There were either no deaths or death was a rare event. Short-term RBC transfusion versus standard care (one review: two trials, 434 participants, GRADE very low- to low-quality evidence)In people undergoing low- to medium-risk surgery, RBC transfusions may decrease the risk of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in people with African haplotypes compared to standard care (low-quality evidence), but there was little or no difference in people with the Arabic haplotype (very-low quality evidence). There was also little or no difference in the risk of other SCD-related or transfusion-related complications (very-low quality evidence). Long-term RBC transfusion versus standard care (two reviews: three trials, 405 participants, very low- to moderate-quality evidence)In children and adolescents at high risk of stroke (abnormal transcranial doppler (TCD) velocities or silent cerebral infarct (SCI)), long-term RBC transfusions probably decrease the risk of stroke (moderate-quality evidence) and may decrease the risk of ACS and painful crisis compared to standard care (low-quality evidence). Long-term RBC transfusions may also decrease the risk of SCI in children with abnormal TCD velocities (low-quality evidence), but there may be little or no difference in the risk of SCI in children with normal TCD velocities and previous SCI (low-quality evidence). In children and adolescents already receiving long-term RBC transfusions for preventing stroke, in comparison to standard care, continuing long-term RBC transfusions may reduce the risk of SCI (low-quality evidence) but we do not know whether there is a difference in the risk of stroke (very-low quality evidence). In children with normal TCD velocities and SCI there was little or no difference in the risk of alloimmunisation or transfusion reactions, but RBC transfusions may increase the risk of iron overload (low-quality evidence). Long-term RBC transfusion versus RBC transfusion to treat complications (one review: one trial, 72 participants, very low- to low-quality evidence)In pregnant women, long-term RBC transfusions may decrease the risk of painful crisis compared to transfusion for complications (low-quality evidence); but there may be little or no difference in the risk of other SCD-related complications or transfusion reactions (very-low quality evidence).RBC transfusion versus disease-modifying agents (hydroxyurea) (two reviews: two trials; 254 participants, very low- to low-quality evidence)For primary prevention of stroke in children, with abnormal TCD and no severe vasculopathy on magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography (MRI/MRA), who have received at least one year of RBC transfusions, we do not know whether there is a difference between RBC transfusion and disease-modifying agents in the risk of stroke; SCI; ACS; or painful crisis (very-low quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in the risk of iron overload (low-quality evidence). Similarly, for secondary prevention of stroke in children and adolescents, we do not know whether there is a difference between these interventions in the risk of stroke; SCI; or ACS (very-low quality evidence); but hydroxyurea with phlebotomy may increase the risk of painful crisis and global SCD serious adverse events compared to RBC transfusion (low-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in the risk of iron overload (low-quality evidence). Restrictive versus liberal RBC transfusion strategy (one review: one trial; 230 participants, very low-quality evidence)In people undergoing cholecystectomy, there was little or no difference between strategies in the risk of SCD-related or transfusion-related complications (very-low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This overview provides support from two high-quality Cochrane Reviews for the use of RBC transfusions in preventing stroke in children and adolescents at high risk of stroke (abnormal TCDs or SCI) and evidence that it may decrease the risk of SCI in children with abnormal TCD velocities. In addition RBC transfusions may reduce the risk of ACS and painful crisis in this population. This overview highlights the lack of high-quality evidence in adults with SCD and the number of reviews that have no evidence for the use of RBC transfusions across a spectrum of SCD complications. Also of concern is the variable and often incomplete reporting of patient-relevant outcomes in the included trials such as SCD-related serious adverse events and quality of life.

### Hemolytic transfusion reactions | NEJM resident 360… [^115bpFnz]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published July 10, 2019 Although technical and administrative controls to prevent transfusion of ABO-mismatched blood have reduced transfusion-related deaths, immune-mediated hemolysis remains an important, if underappreciated, risk. Read the latest Review Article here. A: Although fever, flank pain, and reddish urine represent the classic triad of an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, this type of reaction may also be suspected if one or more of the following signs or symptoms appears within minutes to 24 hours after a transfusion: a temperature increase of 1 degree C or more, chills, rigors, respiratory distress, anxiety, pain at the infusion site, flank or back pain, hypotension, or oliguria. One fascinating early symptom, a "sense of impending doom, " has been reported by numerous patients and should not be ignored.

A: When an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction is suspected, the transfusion should be stopped immediately, and the blood being transfused should be saved for analysis. Laboratory testing should include repeat ABO and Rh compatibility testing, along with additional antibody testing for non-ABO incompatibility. Visual inspection of urine and plasma, as well as testing for urine and plasma free hemoglobin, is standard. Timing is critical, since free hemoglobin is cleared rapidly from the circulation. Simultaneously, alternative causes, including infectious agents, must be ruled out by means of Gram's staining and cultures of the remaining transfused component. A: Delayed hemolysis, occurring days to a month after transfusion, is less evident than an acute hemolytic reaction, since the temporal relationship to transfusion is often overlooked.

Unlike acute hemolytic transfusion reactions, delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions are almost invariably caused by secondary immune responses in patients immunized by previous transfusions, allogeneic stem-cell transplants, or pregnancy. These reactions rarely constitute a medical emergency. In many instances, alloantibodies appear on routine testing in the blood bank and are not associated with clinical events. Clinical manifestations, if they occur, include anemia and jaundice due to extravascular red-cell destruction, followed by hemoglobin degradation and liberation of bilirubin into the plasma. Fever, hemoglobinuria, and hemoglobinemia are even less frequent.

### Transfusion complications monitoring… [^114ARnFL]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance Learn about transfusion complications and access available resources on this topic. Overview CDC's t ransfusion complications monitoring work is helping us learn more about the health issues that sometimes occur after people with sickle cell disease or thalassemia receive blood transfusions. Transfusions for people with SCD and thalassemia Red blood cell transfusions are an important part of medical care for many patients with a hemoglobinopathy. Hemoglobinopathies is the medical term for a group of blood disorders and diseases that affect RBCs. These disorders include both SCD and thalassemia.

RBC transfusions are often used to
- Treat people with severe forms of thalassemia who develop anemia, a condition in which the blood does not have enough healthy RBCs; and
- Prevent health problems for people with SCD While these transfusions are very helpful for treating issues related to blood disorders, they can lead to additional health problems including.
- Alloimmunization — a condition in which a person's immune system sees the blood from a transfusion as possibly harmful and, therefore, tries to destroy it
- Iron overload — a buildup of excess iron in the body that can result in organ damage if left untreated
- Infection CDC works with partners to better understand these health problems.
- Provide information about blood transfusions and call attention to the health problems that can occur in people receiving regular blood transfusions
- Describe the steps that can be taken to prevent or reduce health problems
- Raise awareness about the importance of blood donations from people with diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds to help reduce complications in people with hemoglobinopathies who receive transfusions. The project's goal was to improve the quality and length of life for people with a hemoglobinopathy. In a current project CDC funds and collaborates with programs at three universities — Georgia State University Research Foundation, Inc.; the Joan & Sanford I. Weill Medical College of Cornell University; and the Regents of the University of California San Francisco — to develop resources for healthcare providers, blood banks, and people with thalassemia and their families.

These resources provide key information from a recent evidence-based report that details recommendations for the transfusion management of beta thalassemia in the United States.

### What to transfuse: specifications for red cell products… [^1172PrUh]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key facts about β thalassemia
- β thalassemia is caused by β-globin gene variants that reduce the production of adult hemoglobin, which may cause anemia.
- Chronic anemia can have serious consequences for people with β thalassemia. Children may experience: reduced activity, growth problems and delayed puberty, hepatosplenomegaly, osteopenia, and cognitive impairment. Adults may experience: fatigue, decline in capacity to work or perform usual activities, cognitive impairment, osteopenia, fractures, hypersplenism, and reduced quality of life.
- The primary management of severe anemia in β thalassemia is regular red blood cell transfusions. Healthcare providers can work with their blood bank partners to develop thalassemia-specific red blood cell transfusion protocols.

In selecting RBC products for patients receiving regular transfusions, it's important for the clinical team to carefully consider which products emphasize efficacy while also minimizing risk of hemolytic and non-hemolytic transfusion complications.
- Leukoreduction of RBC units via filtration during the pre-storage period to prevent febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions
- Storage of RBC units in additive solutions or citrate phosphate dextrose-adenine
- Using non-apheresis-derived RBC units for transfusions in adults due to smaller hemoglobin increments with apheresis-derived units.
- Washed RBC units for individuals who experience severe, recurrent allergic reactions
- RBC units that are less than 2 weeks old, when possible, to reduce the impact of the storage lesion on red cell survival
- Using non-irradiated RBC units, as routine use of irradiated RBC units may be detrimental.
- Individuals without a history of alloimmunization are given RBC units matched to Cc, Ee, and K blood group antigens
- Individuals with one or more alloantibodies are given RBC units matched to Cc, Ee, K, Jka/b, Fya/b, and Ss blood group antigens It is important for providers to maintain an accurate antibody history, as an antibody screen can become negative over time, and individuals with a history of developing antibodies need antigen-negative blood to prevent hemolytic transfusion reactions.
