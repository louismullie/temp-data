## Question

Patient assessment in heart failure exacerbation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a step-by-step approach to patient assessment in heart failure exacerbation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and triage. Then, I should verify the core history and precipitating factors. Next, I will examine the physical assessment of congestion and perfusion. After that, I need to check the initial diagnostic workup including ECG, chest radiography, biomarkers, and point-of-care ultrasound. Then, I will classify the hemodynamic profile and risk stratify. I should also consider special populations and comorbidities, integrate data to make the diagnosis, and finally plan disposition, monitoring, and follow-up, ensuring each step aligns with guideline-backed evidence and appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: airway, breathing, and circulation, because delays in recognizing and treating acute heart failure worsen outcomes. I need to ensure oxygenation, assess mental status, obtain vital signs including orthostatics, and rapidly screen for shock or respiratory failure requiring ICU-level care, since approximately 80% of hospitalized HF patients arrive through the ED and early stabilization is critical [^115Vyzgx] [^111sfgF6].

> Wait, let me verify the hemodynamic profile early: warm-and-wet suggests congestion with adequate perfusion, cold-and-wet indicates cardiogenic shock with congestion, and warm-and-dry or cold-and-dry reflect euvolemic or hypovolemic states respectively. This classification guides therapy and disposition, and I should not jump to conclusions before I correlate with perfusion markers like extremity temperature, capillary refill, and mentation [^116nvVdu] [^113jjda1].

> Next, I should review the history with attention to precipitants, because identifying triggers changes management. I need to check for medication nonadherence, dietary indiscretion, infection, ischemia or arrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension, renal dysfunction, pulmonary embolism, and endocrine causes, and I should double-check for drugs that worsen HF such as NSAIDs, some antiarrhythmics, and calcium channel blockers, since these are common and modifiable drivers of decompensation [^115Pse8s] [^115f2DtN].

> I will now examine the patient systematically for congestion and perfusion. I should confirm jugular venous pressure elevation, pulmonary rales, S3, peripheral edema, and orthopnea, and I need to ensure I document daily weights and trends because small weight gains often precede overt decompensation. I should also remember that in hypoalbuminemia, edema may be disproportionate to volume, so I must interpret edema cautiously and check serum albumin to avoid over-diuresis and renal injury [^1136cDWr] [^112VU6Aw].

> Hold on, I should verify the initial diagnostic workup: a 12-lead ECG is mandatory in all suspected HF presentations to assess rhythm, ischemia, and conduction. Chest radiography helps detect cardiomegaly, interstitial edema, pleural effusions, and alternative pulmonary pathology. Natriuretic peptides support diagnosis and risk stratification, with NT-proBNP age-adjusted rule-in thresholds and a very low cutoff of 300 pg/mL offering high negative predictive value. I need to ensure I interpret gray-zone values with clinical context and ancillary testing, and I should add troponin to evaluate myocardial injury and consider D-dimer if PE is suspected [^112L6gSz] [^113sYqT2] [^111eKzvo] [^117LKkra].

> Let me consider point-of-care ultrasound next. Lung ultrasound for B-lines improves diagnostic confidence for pulmonary congestion when uncertainty exists, and focused cardiac ultrasound can rapidly assess LV function, pericardial effusion, and gross valvular pathology. I should confirm that these modalities complement, not replace, standard diagnostics and are best used when the diagnosis is uncertain or to refine hemodynamic assessment at the bedside [^112y69MJ] [^114XSrqi].

> I need to ensure I classify the hemodynamic profile explicitly and then risk stratify. Tools like the ADHERE risk model using BUN, systolic blood pressure, and creatinine help estimate in-hospital mortality, and newer ED-derived scores such as HEARTRISK6 identify patients at highest short-term risk for serious outcomes. I should double-check that these tools inform disposition but are integrated with clinical judgment rather than used in isolation [^115vvR3w] [^115DnkTn].

> But wait, what if the patient is elderly, has COPD, or is pregnant? I should adapt thresholds and expectations because older adults often have atypical presentations, COPD frequently coexists and confounds dyspnea assessment, and pregnancy alters natriuretic peptide interpretation. In pediatrics, I must rely on age-specific norms and consider transfer to specialized centers for severe disease, so I need to ensure my diagnostic and therapeutic approach is tailored to these contexts [^117J8Qgz] [^114PTVyq] [^113yXRRf].

> Next, I should review how to integrate data into a working diagnosis. Since no single test is definitive in acute HF, I must synthesize symptoms, signs, imaging, and biomarkers while excluding mimics like pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, pulmonary embolism, and acute coronary syndrome. I should confirm that the diagnosis remains clinical and that objective tests reduce uncertainty rather than replace bedside assessment [^112KE5Ro] [^114XSrqi].

> I will now examine disposition and monitoring. Critically ill patients require ICU admission, those with new HF generally merit inpatient evaluation, and selected lower-risk patients may be managed in observation units or with early follow-up. I need to ensure a written action plan, medication reconciliation, and close follow-up because early readmission risk is high and residual congestion at discharge predicts worse outcomes. Serial assessment of congestion and perfusion should guide diuretic titration and readiness for discharge [^115mQzwM] [^114xKoFp].

> Hold on, I should verify the follow-up testing and timing. Before discharge or within 7 days, I should recheck basic metabolic panel, CBC, natriuretic peptides, liver function, and consider iron studies, and I should review LVEF with transthoracic echocardiography if not available. I also need to check whether ischemia evaluation is indicated and ensure GDMT optimization plans are in place, escalating every 1–2 weeks as tolerated after stabilization [^112aeesj] [^112U2zWv].

> Let me reconsider the role of natriuretic peptides in acute management. While they support diagnosis and risk stratification, randomized data have not consistently shown that routine NP-guided therapy improves outcomes in the acute setting, so I should avoid overinterpreting small serial changes within biological variability and instead use clinical congestion and perfusion to guide therapy while acknowledging that NP trends can contextualize response when used thoughtfully [^113QrUHH] [^111Qjoe5].

> Finally, I should confirm that I have addressed patient-reported outcomes and functional status. Documenting NYHA class at baseline and follow-up is recommended, and in selected ambulatory patients, CPET or a 6-minute walk test can refine functional capacity and prognosis. I need to ensure symptom tracking is embedded in care transitions to align treatment with patient goals and detect early deterioration [^114BSxts] [^116MRwgu].

In heart failure exacerbation, assessment centers on **rapid identification of congestion and perfusion status** [^115CPuj1] and **early risk stratification** to guide therapy and disposition [^115mQzwM]. Use the **history and exam** to classify the patient as warm/cold and wet/dry, and confirm with chest radiography, natriuretic peptides, and echocardiography as indicated [^113sYqT2] [^111eKzvo] [^111sfgF6]. Apply validated tools (e.g. HEARTRISK6) [^115DnkTn] to predict short-term risk and guide admission versus observation or discharge with close follow-up [^115mQzwM]. Early, structured assessment improves outcomes by enabling timely decongestion, addressing precipitants, and reducing readmissions [^113kJr5e].

---

## Clinical presentation and initial assessment

Patients typically present with **dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fatigue, and edema** [^notfound]. Initial assessment should rapidly determine hemodynamic stability, degree of congestion, and organ perfusion [^115CPuj1].

---

## Key components of clinical assessment

### History

- **Symptom onset and progression**: Acute vs subacute; severity and functional impact [^112b7rxM].
- **Precipitating factors**: Infection, medication nonadherence, dietary indiscretion, ischemia, arrhythmias, uncontrolled hypertension, renal dysfunction [^117LKkra].
- **Comorbidities**: COPD, diabetes, renal disease, hypertension, valvular disease [^notfound].
- **Medication history**: Diuretics, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, beta-blockers, MRAs, SGLT2 inhibitors, NSAIDs, calcium channel blockers [^115xPbGF].

---

### Physical examination

- **Vital signs**: Heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation [^notfound].
- **Volume status**: Jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, pulmonary rales, S3 gallop, hepatojugular reflux [^1136cDWr].
- **Perfusion**: Cool extremities, delayed capillary refill, altered mental status [^115CPuj1].
- **Cardiac exam**: Murmurs, rubs, gallops, irregular rhythm [^111Pxqnt].

---

## Diagnostic testing

### Laboratory tests

- **Natriuretic peptides**: BNP or NT-proBNP to support diagnosis and assess severity; NT-proBNP < 300 pg/mL or BNP < 100 pg/mL strongly excludes HF [^111eKzvo].
- **Cardiac troponins**: Assess myocardial injury, especially if ischemia suspected [^114PTVyq].
- **Renal and hepatic function**: BUN, creatinine, liver enzymes, electrolytes [^111sfgF6].
- **Complete blood count**: Evaluate for anemia or infection [^111sfgF6].

---

### Imaging studies

Obtain a **chest radiograph** to assess cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion, pleural effusions, and alternative diagnoses [^113sYqT2]. Use **echocardiography** to evaluate ventricular function, wall motion abnormalities, and valvular disease [^111sfgF6]. Consider **lung ultrasound** at the point of care when diagnostic uncertainty exists to detect B-lines suggestive of pulmonary edema [^112y69MJ].

---

## Risk stratification tools

Several **validated tools** aid risk assessment and disposition:

| **Tool** | **Parameters** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| HEARTRISK6 | - Valvular disease <br/> - Tachycardia <br/> - Noninvasive ventilation <br/> - Troponin <br/> - Creatinine <br/> - Failure of reassessment | Predicts short-term serious outcomes [^115DnkTn] |
| ADHERE | - BUN <br/> - SBP <br/> - Creatinine | Predicts in-hospital mortality [^115vvR3w] |
| MAGGIC | - Age <br/> - EF <br/> - NYHA class <br/> - Creatinine <br/> - Diabetes <br/> - COPD <br/> - SBP <br/> - BMI <br/> - Smoking | Estimates mortality risk [^notfound] |

---

## Hemodynamic profiling

Classify patients into **four hemodynamic profiles** to guide therapy:

- **Warm and dry**: Stable, no congestion or perfusion issues.
- **Warm and wet**: Congestion with adequate perfusion.
- **Cold and dry**: Low perfusion without congestion.
- **Cold and wet**: Low perfusion with congestion (cardiogenic shock) [^115CPuj1].

---

## Identification of precipitating factors

Common precipitants include **infection, medication nonadherence, dietary indiscretion, acute coronary syndromes, arrhythmias, uncontrolled hypertension, renal dysfunction, and pulmonary embolism** [^notfound]. Identifying and addressing these factors is essential to prevent recurrence [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and reassessment

Continuous monitoring of **vital signs, urine output, and oxygen saturation** is essential [^111ytRnn]. Serial assessment of congestion and perfusion guides therapy adjustments and detects early deterioration [^117NvbMZ].

---

## Documentation and communication

Clear documentation of **clinical findings, diagnostic results, and treatment plans** is essential. Effective communication with the care team and patient/family improves adherence and outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Impact of assessment on management and outcomes

Structured assessment enables **early decongestion, optimization of guideline-directed medical therapy, and identification of precipitants**, reducing readmissions and improving survival [^113jjda1]. Early risk stratification and appropriate disposition (ICU, ward, observation, or discharge) are critical [^115mQzwM].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: Overlap with other causes of dyspnea (COPD, pneumonia, PE) [^114XSrqi].
- **Patient variability**: Elderly, obese, and chronic HF patients may have atypical presentations [^notfound].
- **Resource constraints**: Limited access to advanced imaging or biomarkers in some settings [^notfound].

---

Effective assessment in heart failure exacerbation requires a **structured approach** integrating history, examination, diagnostics, and risk tools to guide timely, individualized care and improve outcomes [^114XSrqi].

Assessment of dyspnoea and worsening heart failure

Patients assessed their dyspnoea at baseline and then at 6, 12, and 24 h from randomization and then daily to Day 5, and then at Day 14, using patient-reported assessment tools, which included the following two main measures. (i) Absolute dyspnoea severity, assessed at each time point on a visual analogue scale (VAS) using a 100 mm vertical line, upon which patients were required to draw a horizontal line rating their breathing, with 100 representing the 'best imaginable health state' and zero 'the worst imaginable health state'. (ii) Additionally, relative changes in dyspnoea were captured using a 7-point Likert scale by which patients were required to rate their breathing as being markedly, moderately, or minimally better; no change; or minimally, moderately, or markedly worse compared with baseline.

Dyspnoea assessment was done at all-time points with the patient lying on the bed, with the head of the bed elevated to 30 degrees, legs on the bed, and oxygen withdrawn for 5 min. If the patient could not tolerate the position or being taken off oxygen for 5 min, these measures were discontinued, and the patient was requested to complete the dyspnoea assessment describing how they felt at the time the oxygen was withdrawn. Dyspnoea questionnaires were translated into all languages by certified translators.

After the assessment of dyspnoea, physicians were requested to perform, on a daily basis, additional clinical evaluations including assessment of orthopnoea, dyspnoea on exertion, as well as congestion by assessing jugular venous pressure (JVP), pulmonary rales, peripheral oedema, and body weight. After these clinical assessments, the physician was requested to specify whether the patient had worsening symptoms and/or signs of heart failure requiring the increase or re-institution of intravenous or mechanical therapy for heart failure (WHF). Physicians were instructed that either a pulmonary oedema event during the preceding 24 h or a gradual deterioration, both requiring addition of IV or mechanical therapy for heart failure, should be reported as WHF. On the other hand, addition of IV therapy for other reasons, such as control of hypertension or enhanced diuresis in the absence of worsening symptoms or signs of heart failure, was not considered WHF. Worsening heart failure through Day 5 was examined in the current analysis. Blood samples for central laboratory analysis, including serum creatinine, were collected daily through Day 5 and at Day 14.

### Acute heart failure: alternatives to hospitalization [^112SCsS5]. JACC: Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Acute heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem with substantial associated economic costs. Because most patients who present to hospitals are admitted irrespective of their level of risk, novel approaches to manage acute HF are needed, such as the use of same-day access clinics for outpatient diuresis and observation units from the emergency department. Current published data lacks a comprehensive overview of the present state of acute HF management in various clinical settings. This review summarizes the strengths and limitations of acute HF care in the outpatient and emergency department settings. Finally, a variety of innovative technologies that have the potential to improve acute HF management are discussed.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® suspected and known heart failure: 2024 update [^1123catf]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a prevalent and complex clinical syndrome with no single reference standard diagnostic test. Imaging has a supportive role in patients with suspected and known HF, including initial imaging assessment of an adult with suspected HF, but without history of HF, including evaluation of pulmonary edema and detection of left ventricular dysfunction (Variant 1). In adults with established diagnosis of HF but unknown etiology, imaging also has an important role in the assessment of the underlying disease process, including ischemic and nonischemic etiologies (Variant 2). In the course of continuing care for adult patients with an established diagnosis of HF without new symptoms, follow-up imaging is performed to assess for longitudinal changes in ventricular function, response to therapy and prognostication (Variant 3). The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Guiding and monitoring of heart failure therapy with NT-proBNP: concepts and clinical studies [^114vLPpJ]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Since 1988 with the discovery of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), many reports have confirmed the elevation of plasma BNP in symptomatic heart failure and confirmed that plasma levels are an independent predictor of death and cardiovascular events in both acute and chronic heart failure.

Methods and Results

A more slender evidence base attests that knowledge of plasma BNP levels can be used to produce clinical benefit. One randomized controlled trial demonstrated that measurements of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) can be used to improve diagnostic accuracy in patients with heart failure in the community. A second study demonstrated that the provision of plasma BNP data improves the speed of diagnosis and reduces the rates of hospital admission and length of hospital stay (while reducing the costs of care) in patients with heart failure who are seen the emergency department with acute dyspnea. Finally, a randomized controlled pilot study demonstrated that serial measurements of NT-proBNP can be used to more effectively optimize heart failure pharmacotherapy with a concomitant improvement in outcome.

Conclusion

The large body of observational data, coupled with this small but promising evidence base from controlled trials (which attests to beneficial effects on clinical outcomes) encourages an optimistic outlook for the further implementation of plasma BNP and/or NT-proBNP in the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure.

### In-hospital worsening heart failure and associations with mortality, readmission, and healthcare utilization [^115FbKRr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Our findings suggest that worsening heart failure during an acute heart failure hospitalization has a strong association with worse in‐hospital and postdischarge outcomes. These findings have important implications for patients hospitalized with acute heart failure. Prevention or early recognition of in‐hospital worsening heart failure may improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare resource use. Prevention of worsening heart failure has also been reported in acute heart failure clinical trials without a detailed understanding of its implications. Our findings suggest that prevention of in‐hospital worsening heart failure may be an important end point in acute heart failure trials.

On the basis of our findings, we believe that worsening heart failure should be considered in the design of acute heart failure trials. However, a standard definition based on objective criteria is needed. Recent clinical trials have used varying definitions. For example, in the RELAX‐AHF trial, worsening heart failure was defined as the presence of worsening signs or symptoms of heart failure requiring escalation of any intravenous therapy or mechanical support after study drug initiation within 16 hours of presentation. In the Value of Endothelin Receptor Inhibition With Tezosentan in Acute Heart Failure Study, worsening heart failure was defined as the presence of persistent or worsening signs or symptoms requiring escalation of therapy, or restarting previous therapies, or readmission after discharge, from the initiation of the study drug to 7 days. Our definition focused on the timing of the initiation of specific medications and advanced medical therapies or transfer to an intensive care unit. This definition may be more reproducible than physician‐ or investigator‐based assessments of worsening heart failureand may also be incorporated into clinical trials or quality‐improvement initiatives that use electronic health records for data collection.

Our study has limitations. First, the study population was limited to patients who were enrolled in the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry from 2001 through 2004 and who were 65 years or older and could be linked to Medicare claims data. The findings may not be generalizable to other patient populations, including younger patients and patients hospitalized during other time periods. Second, our definition of worsening heart failure included evidence for escalation of therapy while hospitalized for heart failure; we were unable to describe the reason for escalation of therapy and cannot be certain all escalation of care was for worsening heart failure. For example, while some patients were hospitalized for acute heart failure, they may have received advanced medical therapies such as mechanical ventilation for a concomitant condition such as pneumonia. Third, we were only able to adjust for variables collected in the registry. Associations between worsening heart failure and poor outcomes may be confounded by measured or unmeasured variables.

### Acute coronary syndromes and acute heart failure: a diagnostic dilemma and high-risk combination. A statement from the acute heart failure committee of the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^117LKkra]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome is a precipitant of acute heart failure in a substantial proportion of cases, and the presence of both conditions is associated with a higher risk of short-term mortality compared to acute coronary syndrome alone. The diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome in the setting of acute heart failure can be challenging. Patients may present with atypical or absent chest pain, electrocardiograms can be confounded by pre-existing abnormalities, and cardiac biomarkers are frequently elevated in patients with chronic or acute heart failure, independently of acute coronary syndrome. It is important to distinguish transient or limited myocardial injury from primary myocardial infarction due to vascular events in patients presenting with acute heart failure. This paper outlines various clinical scenarios to help differentiate between these conditions and aims to provide clinicians with tools to aid in the recognition of acute coronary syndrome as a cause of acute heart failure. Interpretation of electrocardiogram and biomarker findings, and imaging techniques that may be helpful in the diagnostic work-up are described. Guidelines recommend an immediate invasive strategy for patients with acute heart failure and acute coronary syndrome, regardless of electrocardiographic or biomarker findings. Pharmacological management of patients with acute coronary syndrome and acute heart failure should follow guidelines for each of these syndromes, with priority given to time-sensitive therapies for both. Studies conducted specifically in patients with the combination of acute coronary syndrome and acute heart failure are needed to better define the management of these patients.

### Heart failure (HF) guideline (2017) [^116ucaUt]. AND (2017). Medium credibility.

Non-invasive cardiac imaging — Class I: Patients with suspected or new-onset HF or those presenting with acute decompensated HF should undergo a chest X-ray to assess heart size and pulmonary congestion and to detect alternative cardiac, pulmonary and other diseases that may cause or contribute to the patient's symptoms (Level of Evidence: C).

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^114PTVyq]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Confounders or contributors in suspected COPD exacerbation — COPD exacerbations are usually associated with increased airway inflammation, increased mucus production and marked gas trapping, with increased dyspnea as the key symptom and other symptoms including increased sputum purulence and volume, together with increased cough and wheeze; however, patients with COPD are at increased risk of other acute events, particularly decompensated heart failure, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism that may also mimic or aggravate an ECOPD, so worsening of respiratory symptoms, particularly dyspnea without the classic characteristics of ECOPD, should prompt careful consideration and/or search of those potential confounders, or contributors. Figure 4.1 lists conditions and suggested tests: most frequent — pneumonia (Chest radiograph), pulmonary embolism (Clinical probability assessment [Hemoptysis, surgery, fracture, history of cancer, DVT]; D-dimer; CT angiography for pulmonary embolism), and heart failure (Chest radiograph; NT-Pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide [Pro-BNP] and BNP; Echocardiography); less frequent — pneumothorax, pleural effusion (Chest radiograph; Thoracic ultrasound) and myocardial infarction and/or cardiac arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation/flutter) (Electrocardiography; Troponin).

### Brain natriuretic peptide in the evaluation of emergency department dyspnea: is there a role? [^113SLws9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute decompensated congestive heart failure (ADCHF) is a common etiology of dyspnea in emergency department (ED) patients. Delayed diagnosis of ADCHF increases morbidity and mortality. Two cardiac biomarkers, N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) have demonstrated excellent sensitivity in diagnostic accuracy studies, but the clinical impact on patient-oriented outcomes of these tests remains in question.

Clinical Question

Does emergency physician awareness of BNP or NT-proBNP level improve ADCHF patient-important outcomes including ED length of stay, hospital length of stay, cardiovascular mortality, or overall health care costs?

Evidence Review

Five trials have randomized clinicians to either knowledge of or no knowledge of ADCHF biomarker levels in ED patients with dyspnea and some suspicion for heart failure. In assessing patient-oriented outcomes such as length-of-stay, return visits, and overall health care costs, the randomized controlled trials fail to provide evidence of unequivocal benefit to patients, clinicians, or society.

Conclusion

Clinician awareness of BNP or NT-proBNP levels in ED dyspnea patients does not necessarily improve outcomes. Future ADCHF biomarker trials must assess patient-oriented outcomes in conjunction with validated risk-stratification instruments.

### Disposition decisions: what Do you need to know to triage patients with acute heart Failure? [^115DnkTn]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

In this issue of JACC: Advances, Stiell et alaimed to create a more parsimonious risk score to identify patients with HF who are at highest risk for short-term serious outcomes (SSO) upon presentation to the ED. This analysis combined 3 prospective cohorts of patients with HF, totaling 2,246 individuals, enrolled over 12 years at 10 Canadian academic hospital EDs. Notably, patients who were deemed too ill for discharge after up to 12 hours of ED management were excluded. The primary SSO was a composite defined as either all-cause mortality at 30 days or any of the following within 2 weeks of the ED visit: need for noninvasive ventilation or endotracheal intubation after hospital admission, myocardial infarction diagnosed after admission, major cardiovascular procedure (coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous coronary intervention, valvular surgery, new hemodialysis), or need for hospital admission after initial ED discharge.

The study population was of advanced age (mean 77.4 years) and had HF across the spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction (mean 45.1%). Forty-nine percent (n = 1,091/2,246) were admitted on the index ED visit, and of these, 14% suffered an SSO, largely driven by the need for a major procedure (5.4%) or death (3.6%). Of the 51% who were discharged from the index ED visit, 11% (n = 124/1,155) suffered an SSO, nearly all of which were hospital readmissions. For generation of the risk score, the authors prespecified 13 variables, chosen a priori based on prior studies and clinical experience, as predictors for their logistic regression model to predict SSO. Predictors were further narrowed via bootstrapped internal validation and stepwise selection, ultimately yielding the HEARTRISK6 score. The 6 independent predictors in the model included a history of moderate-severe valvular disease, tachycardia on arrival, need for noninvasive ventilation within 1 hour of arrival, increased troponin and creatinine in the ED, and failure of reassessment after treatment in the ED based on either abnormal resting vital signs or inability to execute a 3-minute walk test. Overall, the HEARTRISK6 score yielded a modest C-statistic of 0.69 and high sensitivity but low specificity, suggesting it could be a robust score for identifying those at high risk for subsequent SSO but would lead to a higher-than-average hospital admission rate.

Heart failure clinical congestion assessment — Clinicians use extent of clinical congestion to guide titration of pharmacological treatments, including doses of diuretics, and observational studies have shown that clinical congestion is an important adverse risk factor in patients with heart failure (HF). In patients with chronic HFrEF, changes in markers of clinical congestion were associated with QOL and provided prognostic information independently even of natriuretic peptides or the MAGGIC risk score, highlighting the ongoing relevance of clinical congestion ascertained by the history and physical examination.

### Advances in the management of acute decompensated heart failure [^111pgiZZ]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Heart failure is a common condition that affects millions of people worldwide and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Acute decompensated heart failure refers to the worsening of symptoms that requires changes in drugs or the start of new treatments such as non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. This review summarizes the current data and provides an evidence based approach to the diagnosis and management of acute decompensated heart failure. The review discusses common nomenclature and classifications of the condition, followed by the diagnostic accuracy of medical history, physical examination, electrocardiography, radiographs of the chest, point-of-care ultrasound, and laboratory testing. Current and emerging medical treatments are also discussed.

### Implementation of a palliative care consultation trigger tool for hospitalised patients with acute decompensated heart failure [^115yqEkr]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Although implementation of palliative care services is a class-1 indication in the ACC/AHA guidelines, palliative care consultations, especially in the hospital setting, remain suboptimal. This is attributed in part to lack of standardised triggers, along with other factors such as an unpredictable trajectory, attitudes and beliefs of palliative care from both patients and providers, and lack of inpatient palliative care resources. The identification of patients with heart failure in need of palliative care services remains a vexing issue. The 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines state that palliative care or hospice care should be considered 'throughout the hospital stay, before discharge, at the first visit after discharge, and during follow-up in selected patients', and that 'palliative and supportive care are effective for patients with symptomatic advanced heart failure to improve quality of life'. The latest 2022 ACC/AHA guidelines recommend implementing palliative care consults in specific instances, including patients with refractory heart failure symptoms and those with multiple comorbidities and frailty, and to assist in major medical decisions, such as placement of left ventricular assist device, which in and of itself requires a palliative care consult for Medicare coverage. One study advocated for the administration of standardised symptom assessment scores to identify patients with heart failure who may be eligible for palliative care. There is a lack of consensus regarding referral criteria for palliative care services in hospitalised patients with heart failure. Our goal was to formulate a list of common-sense indications that would act as a trigger tool for inpatient palliative care consults.

We initially conducted a root cause analysis to identify reasons for decreased palliative care consults in our hospital; this was highlighted by the fishbone diagram in figure 1. Thereafter, a review of the existing literature was performed to identify the most common indications for palliative care consults, outlined in box 1. These criteria were ultimately used as a trigger tool for inpatient palliative care consults. Most of these criteria had been summarised in a systematic review that advocated for the use of disease-based triggers, including progression of heart failure despite optimal medical therapy, ACC/AHA stage C–D heart failure, multiple hospitalisations for heart failure exacerbations and ICU level of care and/or ionotropic support. Due to the level of subjectivity, physical and psychological symptoms were not included. Other narrative reviews have advocated for palliative care referrals among hospitalised patients with acute decompensated heart failure when there are other comorbidities, such as chronic lung disease, end-stage kidney disease, and cancer.

### 2021 ACC / AHA key data elements and definitions for heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical data standards (writing committee to develop clinical data standards for heart failure) [^111J6YPS].

Summary assessment — heart failure stages by ejection fraction definitions are as follows: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is "also referred to as systolic HF or cardiomyopathy" and is HF "in a patient with documented LVEF of ≤ 40%". Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is HF "in a patient with documented LVEF of ≥ 50%". Heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF) is HF "in a patient with documented LVEF > 40% and ≤ 50%". Heart failure with recovered ejection fraction (HFrecovEF) is HF "in a patient with reduced EF in the past but with improved ejection fraction to ≥ 50%".

AHF: a diagnostic and management challenge

AHF is a syndrome rather than a diagnosis per se, caused by a wide array of pathologies that result in a spectrum of disease severity ranging from breathlessness to cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. AHF is a highly lethal condition, and studies have shown that minimizing the 'time to appropriate therapy' — the initiation of treatment as soon as possible, including in the prehospital setting — is potentially beneficial in improving outcomes. AHF is variably defined as the rapid onset or acute worsening of symptoms and signs of heart failure that is associated with elevated plasma levels of natriuretic peptides. However, substantial diagnostic uncertainty is inevitable when relying only on traditional clinical findings, and currently a lack of specificity exists in routine investigations for this condition. Indeed, although patients often present with a suggestive history, clinical features (such as shock, and pulmonary or peripheral congestion), and/or symptoms related to the underlying potential cause, these traditional clinical features are frequently absent; over-reliance on these factors might delay diagnosis and implementation of appropriate therapy, or contribute to a missed diagnosis in up to 20% of patients. Furthermore, patients' clinical features might vary according to the site of initial medical contact and the management strategies employed.

The majority of patients with AHF present to emergency departments; however, many patient are also assessed and managed in other acute care settings such as in intensive care and inpatient cardiology units. Patients with AHF usually present with symptoms of congestion and breathlessness rather than cardiac arrest or shock. Symptoms of breathlessness account for 3–5% of emergency department attendances in Europe and the USA, and the major causes of breathlessness and their prevalence include AHF (50%), pneumonia or bronchitis (20%), exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma (20%), and pulmonary embolism (5–10%). Current guidelines recommend that clinical examination and investigations should be integrated to form the diagnosis, including the use of electrocardiogram (ECG), chest radiograph, and biomarkers such as natriuretic peptides, troponin, and D-dimer as indicated. Unfortunately, these data can be challenging to interpret, in particular in the 10–15% of patients in whom two concomitant diagnoses exist. Specifically, although included in the current definition of AHF, levels of natriuretic peptides can be elevated in respiratory disease and other acute conditions such as pulmonary embolism, sepsis, and anaemia –.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Chronic New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV heart failure with prior guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) often necessitates careful de-escalation or adjustment during stalled or worsening inpatient trajectories: whereas SGLT inhibitors are likely to be widely tolerated and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) tolerated in patients with adequate kidney function, the addition of ARNIs/ACE inhibitors/ARBs or beta-blockers is generally not attempted; decreased dosages or discontinuation of these classes may be required to achieve adequate blood pressure and kidney function, and neurohormonal antagonists are usually discontinued when intravenous inotropic support or pressors are used. In the LIFE trial of high-risk patients with recent class IV symptoms, enrollment required class IV symptoms at screening or within the previous 3 months, with a minimum of 3 months of guideline-directed therapy with RAS inhibitors, beta-blockers, and MRAs or intolerance, plus 1 additional high-risk feature (most commonly recent inotropic therapy, 1 or more heart failure hospitalizations in the past 6 months, or LVEF < 0.25); the mean duration of heart failure before enrollment was 6 years with average LVEF 0.20, inclusion allowed a lower limit of SBP of 95 mm Hg, and patients could be receiving inotropic therapy. Before randomization, an ACE inhibitor or ARB had been taken by 72% of patients; the run-in period was 3 to 7 days at the lowest dose (24–26 mg of sacubitril/valsartan), which 18% of patients did not tolerate, and among randomized patients there was no trend seen for benefit of sacubitril/valsartan to reduce N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide levels, readmission, or death compared to valsartan.

### From acute decompensated to chronic heart failure [^116c5iDQ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

An acute decompensation of heart failure resulting in hospital admission represents a critical juncture in the natural history of the disease, as evidenced by poor mortality and readmission outcomes after hospital discharge. For this reason, a number of new short-term vasoactive therapies have been or are being tested in clinical trials. Furthermore, in response to unacceptable readmission rates, there has been intense interest in improving the transition from hospital discharge to the outpatient arena. Between these 2 areas of focus exists an often overlooked internal transition from acute vasoactive therapies to oral chronic heart failure medications. This transition from acute presentation to the rest of the hospital stay forms the basis of this review.

Pediatric acute decompensated heart failure — diagnosis and monitoring recommendations specify that the diagnosis of acute HF should be based on signs and symptoms of HF combined with supportive evidence from chest X-ray imaging, ECG, echocardiography, and laboratory evaluations, including natriuretic peptide levels (Class I, Level of Evidence B). The severity of HF should be assessed based on the degree of congestion and adequacy of perfusion (Class I, Level of Evidence C). In patients with severe acute HF, it is reasonable to initiate transfer to a center with pediatric HF specialists who have the expertise and ability to optimize medical therapy, evaluate for heart transplantation, and provide mechanical support (Class IIa, Level of Evidence C). For patients with acute HF, serial testing to monitor for electrolyte abnormalities, hemoglobin levels, end-organ perfusion, and response to therapy is indicated (Class I, Level of Evidence C). In children hospitalized with acute HF, evaluation and monitoring for arrhythmias with continuous ECG monitoring/telemetry is warranted (Class I, Level of Evidence C).

### A review of dyspnea in acute heart failure syndromes [^116exsoz]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

In acute heart failure syndrome (AHFS), dyspnea is one of the most common but least understood presenting symptoms for hospitalization. For this reason, dyspnea relief is increasingly becoming a focus in the development of therapies for the treatment of AHFS, and currently stands as an acceptable primary end point for regulatory approval by governmental agencies. This raises the question of how best to measure such a subjective symptom. In this review, we will describe the basis for dyspnea, provide a detailed description of the strengths and weaknesses of the current best tools used to measure it, and describe future directions for future development of dyspnea measurement in AHFS.

Inpatient AHFTC training expectations — As the prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is approximately 50%, trainees should know the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis and management of acute decompensations of this type. The AHFTC trainee should rapidly identify patients with heart failure in danger of hemodynamic collapse or death and know how to stabilize them, and a key element of the initial assessment is to identify factors that precipitate hospitalization for heart failure. In addition, proficiency in obtaining a history and performing a physical examination is essential to assessing a patient's hemodynamic profile, and although invasive hemodynamic monitoring is not routinely indicated in the management of patients with acute heart failure, trainees should become familiar with indications for pulmonary artery catheterization as supported by the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure.

### Acute precipitants of congestive heart failure exacerbations… [^115Pse8s]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background Few studies have prospectively and systematically explored the factors that acutely precipitate exacerbation of congestive heart failure in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Knowledge of such factors is important in designing measures to prevent deterioration of clinical status. The objective of this study was to prospectively describe the precipitants associated with exacerbation of CHF status in patients enrolled in the Randomized Evaluation of Strategies for Left Ventricular Dysfunction Pilot Study. As part of the clinical event reporting for the study, investigators completed a CHF Event Form for all patients experiencing any worsening of CHF. This form was completed regardless of whether the patient required hospitalization. Data collected on the form included symptoms and physical signs present at the time of diagnosis of the CHF exacerbation, treatments used, and factors considered by the investigator to have contributed to the episode.

Investigators also indicated the single most responsible factor for the patient's deterioration. For the purposes of the present analysis, each episode of worsening CHF was treated as an independent event. Of the 323 CHF events, 143 events required that the patient be hospitalized, and 180 cases were managed on an ambulatory basis. Five patients died in the hospital. Patients gained an average weight of 1. 16 kg compared with baseline. Physical examination revealed lung crackles in 66% of cases, peripheral edema in 52%, elevation of jugular venous pressure in 55%, and a third heart sound in 36%. Hospitalized cases had more crackles and were more likely to have a chest radiograph performed compared with those not hospitalized. Treatments administered for the exacerbation of CHF included oral diuretics in 56% of cases, intravenous diuretics in 48%, and addition of a new diuretic in 19%.

There were no major differences observed in the factors associated with CHF exacerbation between patients who were hospitalized vs not hospitalized. Patients presenting with worsening of CHF symptoms had the typical physical signs of lung crackles, edema, and elevation of jugular venous pressure. At least some weight gain was associated with most CHF exacerbations. The weight gain observed was small, which might be indicative of the fact that many patients do not weigh themselves daily. This simple, important measurement should be used by patients to help identify the onset of an impending exacerbation of their disease, and they should seek medical attention before severe cardiovascular compromise occurs.

Appendix 4 — Acute heart failure (COVID-19) is defined as HF with new or worsening signs and symptoms in a patient with probable or confirmed acute COVID-19; it can occur with preserved or reduced LVEF, may be a first HF presentation, or reflect acute decompensation of chronic HF, and is described as a clinical syndrome from impairment of LV filling or reduced ejection fraction with congestion or hypoperfusion; distinguishing respiratory failure from acute COVID-19 versus concomitant acute HF is important, and unlike acute myocardial injury this element does not require a troponin rise and patients may not exhibit acute cardiac injury.

### Acute heart failure: more questions than answers [^111ytRnn]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute heart failure (AHF) is a life-threatening condition with a dramatic burden in terms of symptoms, morbidity and mortality. It is a specific syndrome requiring urgent, life-saving treatment. Multiple specific pathophysiologic mechanisms may be involved, including congestion, inflammation, and neurohormonal activation. This process eventually leads to symptoms, end-organ damage, and adverse outcomes. Clinical presentation varies, but it almost universally includes worsening of congestion associated with different degrees of hypoperfusion. Due to substantial early symptoms burden and high morbidity and mortality, patients with AHF require intensive monitoring and intravenous treatment. However, beyond variable improvement in congestion, none of the available intravenous therapies for AHF was shown to improve longer term outcomes. Although oral treatment with guideline-directed therapies for stable patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) before discharge may fully prevent subsequent episodes, proof that this strategy may benefit patients is lacking. First, most patients with AHF have preserved EF (HFpEF) where no therapies have been shown to be effective. Second, all therapies developed for patients with HFrEF were tested for efficacy on outcomes in patients who were stable without recent AHF. Hence, the implementation of these chronic therapies during an AHF episode is untested. Third, the problem to better treat AHF patients in their early phase remains crucial with treatment strategies largely untested, yet. Further studies targeting AHF specific mechanisms, such as inflammation and end-organ damage, and finding effective intravenous drugs remain therefore warranted.

### Pathophysiology and therapeutic approaches to acute decompensated heart failure [^114xKoFp]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) continues to be an entity with incompletely understood pathophysiology and limited therapeutic options. Although agents for the management of chronic HF continue to expand and the arsenal of guideline-directed medical therapies is robust, the same cannot be said for management of ADHF. This is clinically relevant as acute HF (AHF) events and repeat hospitalizations are associated with a worse prognosis and progressive multiorgan failure. There are over 1 million hospitalizations per year for HF in the United States and Europe with an astounding 24% readmission rate within 30 days and 50% within 6 months. – Patients with readmission for cardiovascular disease within 90 days of discharge for HF hospitalization have a higher risk of mortality independent of the exact amount of time from discharge. One in 6 patients admitted for HF die within 30 days of hospitalization. These grim statistics for ADHF in contrast to the promising future of chronic HF management prompt the need for a better understanding of the distinct entity of ADHF. Additionally, suboptimal medical management of ADHF often results in persistent congestion upon hospital discharge and subsequent increased risk of recurrent hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality.

In light of the stagnating clinical outcomes with ADHF, the American College of Cardiology released an expert consensus decision pathway in 2019 to assist in risk assessment, management, and evaluation of clinical trajectory of patients with ADHF. The highlight of this document lay in the importance of effective decongestion and cardiac function optimization, frequent reevaluation of clinical trajectory and ensuring improvement in symptoms, hemodynamics, and biomarkers, comprehensive evaluation of comorbid contributions, and safe discharge preparation and follow-up. We will use this outline to guide our discussion as it relates to current data for patients with ADHF. This review will focus on the current limited understanding of ADHF pathophysiology, possible therapeutic targets, and current limitations in expanding available therapies in light of the unmet need among these high-risk patients. The discussion will predominantly focus on typical cases of ADHF (not including the relatively rare cases of cardiogenic shock or requirement of mechanical circulatory support).

The 2013 (with updates in 2016 and 2017) American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and 2016 European Society of Cardiology guidelines provide practical evidence-based clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of both acute and chronic heart failure (HF). Both guidelines address noninvasive and invasive testing to establish the diagnosis of HF with reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction. Extensive trial evidence supports the use of guideline-directed medical therapy and device-based therapies for the optimal management of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction. Specific recommendations are also provided for HF with preserved ejection fraction although the evidence is substantially weaker. Management of medical comorbidities is now addressed in both guidelines. Acute HF and end-stage disease requiring advanced therapies are also discussed. This review compares specific recommendations across the spectrum of HF phenotypes and disease severity, highlights areas where differences exist, and lists consequential studies published since the latest guidelines.

### Acute right ventricular failure: pathophysiology, aetiology, assessment, and management [^1148MCZv]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute right ventricular failure is a complex and rapidly progressive clinical syndrome, whereby the right ventricle fails to provide adequate left ventricular preload, dilates, and causes systemic venous congestion. Previous research in acute heart failure has primarily focused on the left ventricle. Yet, the need for a better understanding of right ventricular anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology, as well as of the diagnosis and management of its acute failure is crucial. Diagnosis mandates a high degree of clinical suspicion, as the majority of signs and symptoms are nonspecific. An accurate and prompt identification of the underlying causes, including pulmonary embolism, right ventricular myocardial infarction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, post-cardiac surgery, and decompensated chronic pulmonary hypertension, is therefore essential. This review provides insights into right ventricular anatomy and functioning and discusses the pathophysiology of acute right ventricular failure, its differential aetiologies, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment.

In patients with palliated or repaired CHD who present with acute HF, cardiac catheterization is indicated if a noninvasive evaluation fails to establish a definitive diagnosis or if invasive hemodynamic measurements are needed for management decisions (Level of Evidence C). For patients with acute HF, serial testing to monitor for electrolyte abnormalities, hemoglobin levels, end-organ perfusion, and response to therapy is indicated (Level of Evidence C). In children hospitalized with acute HF, evaluation and monitoring for arrhythmias with continuous ECG monitoring/telemetry is warranted (Level of Evidence C).

Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — risk periods, assessment, and treatment: Ischaemic heart disease should be considered in all COPD patients depending on their risk factor profile, and cardiovascular risk may be assessed by the global risk calculator, which can be found on the US National Heart Blood Lung Institute website and treatment initiated based on the current recommendations. During, and for at least 90 days after, acute COPD exacerbations there is an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients at high risk of concomitant IHD, and hospitalization for an acute COPD exacerbation has been associated with 90-day mortality of acute myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and intracranial hemorrhage; patients who demonstrate abnormal cardiac troponins in isolation are at increased risk of adverse outcomes including short-term (30-day) and long-term mortality. The treatment of ischaemic heart disease should be according to guidelines irrespective of the presence of COPD and vice versa.

### Outcomes of acute exacerbation of severe congestive heart failure… [^116o75w9]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Of patients interviewed at 180 days, the median health rating on a scale of 0 to 100 was 60, and 59. 7% were independent in their activities of daily living. Overall quality of life was reported to be good, very good, or excellent in 58. 2% at 180 days. Patients with worse functional capacity were more likely to die. Health perceptions among the patients with available interview data improved at 60 and 180 days after acute exacerbation of severe CHF. Patients' physiologic status was evaluated using the Acute Physiology Score component of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III, which is an ordinal scale consisting of weights assigned to 17 physiologic measurements. 41, 48, 49 The Acute Physiology Score has a possible range of scores from 0 to 252; increased scores are strongly associated with an increased risk for death. The Glasgow Coma Scale50 was used to assess patients' neurologic status.

The admission physical examination reflected a population with the following multiple findings representing severe CHF:

78. 5%, rales;
48. 8%, elevated jugular venous pressure; and 57. 0%, peripheral edema. Nonsinus rhythm was detected on an electrocardiogram in 28. 0% of patients. Change of HRQL in time among patients depends on the following factors: HRQL of individual patients may change; change of HRQL of the group may be influenced by missing values; and change may be due to chance. Change of HRQL measurement values among the patients with available data at all 3 times is presented in Table 3. Health perceptions among the patients with available interview data improved at 60 and 180 days after acute exacerbation of severe CHF. We did not detect change in functional capacity as measured by the Index of ADL. At 60 days, lower time−tradeoff utility and worse overall quality of life were significantly related to higher mortality rates.

Patients who survived the interval and did not complete the interview after did not differ significantly by HRQL outcomes from patients who completed the interview.

ACC/AHA heart failure data standards — cardiovascular history (heart failure) define HF as a complex clinical syndrome that results from any structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood, with cardinal manifestations of dyspnea and fatigue that may limit exercise tolerance and cause or lead to fluid retention with pulmonary and/or splanchnic congestion and/or peripheral edema; some patients have exercise intolerance but little evidence of fluid retention, whereas others complain primarily of edema, dyspnea, or fatigue; because some patients present without signs or symptoms of volume overload, the term HF is preferred over congestive HF; provider documentation or report of a former diagnosis of HF before a care encounter, or a previous hospital admission with a diagnosis of HF, is considered evidence of HF history. Permissible values for HF history are Yes, No, or Unknown. Additional notes specify there is no single diagnostic test for HF because it is largely a clinical diagnosis based on a careful history and physical examination, that a low EF alone, without clinical evidence of HF does not qualify as HF, and that HF subtypes are specified in Appendix 6.

Natriuretic peptides across acute heart failure care — Natriuretic peptide (NP) levels fluctuate with left ventricular (LV) filling pressures during decompensation and improvement and exhibit intrinsic biological variability of 25–30% for NT-proBNP and 40% for BNP; in the emergency department (ED) NP use includes accuracy of diagnosis with high negative predictive value (NPV), stratification and triage, shortening decision time, and prognosis, in-hospital applications include correlation to LV filling pressure, monitoring response to intravenous (IV) therapies, assessing hemodynamic congestion, guiding discharge decisions and prognosis, and post-discharge uses include identification of residual congestion, prompting early interventions to reduce congestion, and prognosis at 1 week and 1 month; these biomarkers have the highest class of recommendation for exclusion of heart failure because of very high NPV (94%–97%), are helpful in judging whether reported worsening symptoms are related to increased left-sided cardiac filling pressures, but lack a prognostic effect in predominant right-sided HF such as severe tricuspid regurgitation.

Methods

Study population

We did a systematic review to identify studies that evaluated the diagnostic performance of NT-proBNP in patients with suspected acute heart failure. We updated a previous review by Roberts et alwith studies published up to 18 August 2021 by searching titles and abstracts on Embase, Medline, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials with the key words "heart failure" and "natriuretic peptide" (supplementary text 1). Studies were eligible if they met the following pre-specified inclusion criteria: enrolled patients aged ≥ 18 years with suspected acute heart failure in an acute care setting, measured NT-proBNP in blood samples obtained during the patients' initial assessment on the day of the hospital attendance, and adjudicated diagnosis of acute heart failure by using an acceptable reference standard. Two investigators (KKL and MA) independently screened all studies identified in the systematic literature search, and a third (NLM) adjudicated conflicts by using a pre-specified protocol (PROSPERO register: CRD42019159407).

We contacted the corresponding authors of all eligible cohorts to request anonymised individual patient level data on NT-proBNP concentrations, adjudicated diagnosis of acute heart failure, demographics (age, sex, ethnicity), past medical history (heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, smoking, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease), physiological variables during the initial assessment (heart rate and blood pressure), and clinical haematology and biochemistry profiles. We checked accuracy, definitions of variables, and completeness with all corresponding authors before harmonisation. All studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with ethical approval to permit sharing of individual patient level data to conduct this meta-analysis. Two investigators (KKL and MA) independently assessed risk of bias for each study by using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2 (QUADAS-2) tool, with conflicts resolved by a third (NLM).

Results

Condition scope

The working group defined a broad scope as it applies to heart failure. Consistent with major guidelines, patients would be diagnosed as having heart failure if they had clinically identified heart failure signs and symptoms and objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction. All patients with the diagnosis of heart failure would be included, whether presenting acutely or chronically, regardless of etiology, and across the spectrum of ejection fraction. Acute heart failure was classified as either an acute first presentation or as an acute decompensation of chronic heart failure, whether or not it resulted in a hospital admission.

Patients with a first presentation as cardiogenic shock were excluded from the scope, as there is often a distinct upstream precipitating factor, which requires urgent or emergent intervention. As such, the patient does not fit in with the typical management pattern for the general heart failure population. However, patients surviving the initial event, with or without aggressive medical or surgical intervention, and continuing to be in heart failure, would be included after stabilization. Similarly, patients with coronary or valvular disease may fit the scope if presenting with objective signs of ventricular dysfunction in the absence of immediately correctable causes such as active ischemia. Patients with heart failure who had undergone transplant or mechanical assistance were considered outside the scope. These populations present unique treatment challenges not concordant with the majority of heart failure patients. The scope did not include patients with isolated right heart failure.

Treatment variables

Treatments included for measurement and recording reflect the recommendations of major evidence-based guidelines. These therapies are known to affect mortality, hospitalization, quality of life, or a combination of these in the heart failure patient. Broadly, these can be divided into pharmacotherapy, invasive therapies, and rehabilitation. Pharmacotherapy includes all heart failure medications at baseline and any changes made to the therapeutic regime over time. Invasive therapies include devices such as pacemakers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, and cardiac resynchronization therapy, as well as cardiac surgery. Cardiac rehabilitation program initiation was included to complete the treatment options available (Online Table S1). Treatment variables will be captured through the patient's medical record. Ongoing treatment variable modifications will be overseen by the ICHOM steering committee in line with emerging evidence.

### Acute heart failure is a malignant process: but we can induce remission [^112KE5Ro]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

DEFINITION

In part the lack of progress in AHF research over the past decades can be attributed to its subjective definition. Most authors, define it as a sudden worsening of symptoms and signs of congestion associated with some cardiac abnormality requiring emergency treatment. Some add to the definition the need for admission, whereas others add requirements for intravenous therapy. However, compared with other acute cardiovascular conditions, such as myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, or pulmonary embolism, where electrocardiographic data, imaging data, and biomarkers can confirm or refute the diagnosis with high certainty, no such imaging or blood test exists for the diagnosis of AHF. Although elevated natriuretic peptides are important in diagnosing AHF and a lack of increase in natriuretic peptides can rule out AHF with high certaintyincreased natriuretic peptides can also be caused by other disease states, most notably chronic stable heart failure (HF). Hence, natriuretic peptides by themselves are not specific for AHF. Chest x‐ray signs of congestion, on the other hand, are highly specific but lack sensitivity. Therefore, despite years of research, no single biomarker or imaging technique has been found to be both specific and sensitive to the diagnosis of AHF; and its diagnosis remains subjective and based mostly on symptoms, clinical assessments, and ruling out of other reasons for acute congestion, such an acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, or infection.

Introduction

Acute heart failure (AHF) is associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). In the United States, AHF results in 676,000 annual ED visits, with over 80% of patients requiring hospitalization. Hospitalization for AHF is associated with high risk for poor outcomes; more than one-third of patients die or require rehospitalization within 90 days of discharge. Heart failure (HF) is also associated with substantial costs. Total estimated HF expenditures in the United States are over $39 billion/year, and by 2030 costs are projected to increase to $70 billion. About 68% of HF-related costs are attributable to direct medical costs, and 80% are related to hospitalization.

Accurate diagnosis of AHF is often challenging because signs and symptoms are nonspecific. ED physicians can use their clinical judgment to accurately diagnose AHF in about 75% of patients. Even after considering laboratory and radiographic test results, ~12% of patients presenting to an urgent or emergency care environment with dyspnea are misdiagnosed. Additionally, AHF severity is often underappreciated. A significant subset of patients with end-stage HF may be in occult shock, but are clinically indistinguishable from patients with less severe decompensation. To facilitate rapid diagnosis of AHF, other tools (e.g. biomarkers, ultrasound) should be combined with clinical judgment. When B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP levels are used in conjunction with clinical judgment, the accuracy of diagnosing AHF improves from ~75% to ~80%. However, delaying treatment initiation until comprehensive diagnostic testing is completed worsens clinical prognosis. For example, with each 4-hour delay in initiation of intravenous diuretics, the risk of in-hospital death increases for patients with BNP levels > 865 pg/ml. Delays in treatment may also result in increased ED and overall hospital length of stay (LOS), which can increase costs. Although many hospitals have developed AHF care pathways to improve patient management, there is still a lack of evidence-based guidelines for the care of undifferentiated patients with possible AHF.

This review details the importance of early diagnosis in patients presenting to the ED with AHF and discusses early treatment options for individuals both with and without a clear diagnosis. To help guide treatment decisions, methods for early risk stratification and patient differentiation are discussed. A novel discussion of diagnosis and initial treatment considerations is provided for undifferentiated patients with dyspnea.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Natriuretic peptide testing for suspected acute heart failure — diagnostic thresholds and interpretation include the following: In suspected acute heart failure, a BNP cut-off concentration of 100 pg/mL provides an excellent negative predictive value to exclude acute heart failure, whereas higher values (> 400 pg/mL) deliver excellent positive predictive value. For NT-proBNP, age-dependent rule-in cut-offs are preferred (450/900/1800 pg/mL), and independent of age an NT-proBNP concentration < 300 pg/mL provides a very high negative predictive value for heart failure. When using rule-in thresholds, identification of any potential relevant confounder should be required, and patients with levels in the gray zone need extra physician attention and ancillary testing, such as chest x-ray and echocardiography. A change of 25%–30% or more from presentation usually indicates a change in clinical status, and individualized interpretation of biomarker levels, particularly in special populations and in the setting of comorbidities, is recommended.

Serum albumin and congestion assessment in HF — serum albumin levels should be checked routinely at HF admission, and peripheral edema should be interpreted with caution in the presence of hypoalbuminemia, which has been associated with up to 6-fold higher in-hospital mortality; reduced plasma oncotic pressure from hypoalbuminemia enhances extravascular fluid accumulation, for which overzealous diuresis may deplete intravascular volume and decrease renal function and blood pressure, particularly with nephrotic syndrome or chronic malnutrition.

The clinical calculator "Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry (ADHERE) Algorithm" for heart failure.

The Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry (ADHERE) Algorithm is a clinical decision tool designed for patients presenting with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). This algorithm aids clinicians in risk stratification, guiding therapeutic decisions based on the severity of the patient's condition. It utilizes key parameters such as blood urea nitrogen (BUN), systolic blood pressure, and creatinine levels to predict in-hospital mortality.

The ADHERE Algorithm is particularly useful in the emergency department setting, where rapid assessment and treatment initiation are critical. It assists in identifying patients at high risk of adverse outcomes, thereby facilitating prompt intervention and potentially improving patient prognosis.

However, it is important to note that the ADHERE Algorithm may not be applicable to patients with acute heart failure secondary to acute coronary syndromes, severe valvular disease, or congenital heart disease. Additionally, it may not be suitable for patients with end-stage renal disease or those on dialysis, as their BUN and creatinine levels may be significantly altered.

The Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry (ADHERE) Algorithm helps assess the risk level of heart failure patients by evaluating three specific health metrics. Here's how it works:

Inputs:

- **Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level**: This input is "Yes" if the BUN is equal to or exceeds 43 mg/dL (15.35 mmol/L); otherwise, it's "No".
- **Systolic Blood Pressure (sBP)**: This input is "Yes" if the sBP is lower than 115 mmHg; otherwise, it's "No".
- **Creatinine level**: This input is "Yes" if Creatinine is equal to or exceeds 2.75 mg/dL (243.1 mmol/L); otherwise, it's "No".

Computation:

- The algorithm checks these inputs to categorize risk levels:

- **Low Risk**: If neither BUN nor sBP is "Yes", the patient falls into the low-risk category.
- **Intermediate Risk**: If either BUN or sBP is "Yes", but not both, it indicates an intermediate risk.
- **High Risk**: If all three inputs — BUN, sBP, and Creatinine — are "Yes", it denotes a high risk.

Interpretation:

- The classification into low, intermediate, or high risk aids healthcare providers in making informed clinical decisions, allowing them to tailor treatment plans to improve patient outcomes. This risk stratification helps in determining the necessary level of monitoring and intervention required for the patient.

2013 ACCF/AHA heart failure clinical practice guideline — A thorough history and physical examination should be obtained/performed in patients presenting with heart failure to identify cardiac and noncardiac disorders or behaviors that might cause or accelerate the development or progression of HF (Class I, Level of Evidence: C). The guideline notes that the NYHA functional classification gauges the severity of symptoms in those with structural heart disease and that the NYHA functional classification is an independent predictor of mortality; it is widely used in clinical practice and research and for determining the eligibility of patients for certain healthcare services, yet NYHA functional class assessment is not reported in a significant number of patients in contemporary HF practices in the United States. It also directs clinicians to evaluate general health status and clarifies that although no specific 2013 ACCF/AHA guideline recommendation is made regarding collection of NYHA or other quantitative result, knowledge of symptom status is needed to determine candidacy for appropriate HF treatments.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Heart failure practice guideline implementation — isolated provider interventions and disease-management systems: "A recent controlled trial has shown that the simple dissemination of an HF guideline followed by written and verbal reminders about recommended actions was unable to change the treatment of HF in the intensive care unit", and "Basic physician education and passive dissemination of guidelines alone are generally insufficient to sustain quality improvement". The report notes that "Chart audit and feedback of results, reminder systems to consider use of specific medicines or tests, and the use of local opinion leaders have had variable results", whereas "Multifactorial interventions that simultaneously attack different barriers to change tend to be more successful than isolated efforts", so "dissemination of a practice guideline must be accompanied by more intensive educational and behavioral interventions to maximize the chances of improving physician practice patterns". For disease-management systems, "Observational studies and randomized controlled trials have shown that disease-management programs can reduce the frequency of hospitalization and can improve quality of life and functional status", and "Patients at high risk for clinical deterioration or hospitalization are likely to benefit from disease-management programs and represent those for whom such interventions are most likely to be cost-effective". One randomized trial targeted elderly patients "who had been hospitalized for HF, had a prior history of HF, had 4 or more hospitalizations within 5 years, and had an HF exacerbation caused by an acute MI or uncontrolled hypertension", and reported that "Patients randomized to the disease-management program had significantly fewer hospitalizations".

Heart failure–related cardiogenic shock initial assessment should be rapid, focusing on vital signs and critical examination components to establish the diagnosis, assess tissue perfusion, mental status, and volume status, identify underlying triggers, evaluate the severity of acute heart failure, and recognize end-organ injuries. There is lack of a standardized nomenclature and definition of HF-CS, and the cardiogenic shock definition used in clinical trials associated with AMI-CS includes systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg for ≥ 30 minutes (or support to maintain blood pressure), a cardiac index ≤ 2.2 liter min^-1 m^-2, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ≥ 15 mm Hg, and markers of end-organ hypoperfusion (urine output < 30 ml/h or < 0.3–0.5 ml/kg/h, altered mental status, cool extremities, lactate > 2 mmol/liter). Compared with AMI-CS, HF-CS often presents with exaggerated hemodynamic derangements representing congestion instead of hypotension, making the clinical assessment of shock severity challenging.

Heart failure afflicts large numbers of patients and is the leading cause for hospitalizations in the United States. Diagnosis and management of decompensated heart failure present a clinical challenge, requiring complex decision-making. History and physical examination findings are important in the diagnosis of heart failure. Diagnostically, B-type natriuretic peptide levels appear very useful to separate cardiac from noncardiac causes of dyspnea and provide information about heart failure severity and prognosis. Immediate management goals include improvement of symptoms and hemodynamic parameters. Diuretics, vasodilators, and inotropic agents are useful in the acute setting.

### Standardized reporting criteria for studies evaluating suspected acute heart failure syndromes in the emergency department [^112fxwnS]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Heart failure requiring urgent therapy represents a burgeoning health care burden. Although acute heart failure syndromes are commonly defined as a change in chronic heart failure signs and symptoms requiring urgent therapy, the presentation, development, and response to treatment is highly dependent on individual patient characteristics. This heterogeneity has led to challenges in interpreting widely differing study methods, including eligibility requirements and outcome measures. To improve interpretation of results and translate such information to better patient care, it is essential to present an accurate description of the patient population and study design. Based on existing recommendations and expert consensus, the authors present standardized reporting criteria to improve interpretability of research in this challenging cohort.

### Acute heart failure syndromes [^112pRCpt]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Heart failure resulting in hospitalization represents a significant and growing health care burden. Heterogeneity characterizes this group in terms of mode of presentation, pathophysiology, and prognosis. The vast majority of patients symptomatically improve during hospitalization; however, their early post-discharge rehospitalization and mortality rates continue to be high. Worsening signs and symptoms, neurohormonal, and renal abnormalities occurring soon after discharge may contribute to these high post-discharge event rates. Currently available assessment modalities combined with recent advances in cardiovascular therapies provide present-day opportunities to improve post-discharge outcomes. Further investigation into pathophysiologic targets and novel approaches to clinical trial design are needed. Improving post-discharge outcomes is the single most important goal in the management of acute heart failure syndromes.

Acute heart failure — testing recommendation and clinical utility: In acute HF care settings, natriuretic peptide testing has the potential to augment physicians' decision making across the spectrum of care, and natriuretic peptides have the advantages of objectivity, reproducibility, and widespread availability with evidence they define risk better than clinician judgment alone; importantly, natriuretic peptides should be measured in all patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of new-onset or worsening HF.

Heart failure (HF) is a global epidemic affecting millions of individuals worldwide. Although important progress has been made in the management of HF, this condition remains a common cause of morbidity and death. Since the publication of the previous sets of guidelines for the management of HF, new diagnostic and therapeutic options for HF have emerged. Now, both the ESC and the ACC/AHA/HFSA have simultaneously published an update of their guidelines incorporating, among others, recommendations for the use of new pharmacological therapies for the treatment of HF. For this Viewpoint article, we have asked the chairs of the ESC Task Force, the chairs of the ACC/AHA/HFSA Writing Committee, and an independent opinion leader in the field to offer their expert insight into the new guidelines, highlighting what is new, what the main differences are between the two sets of guidelines, and what steps should be taken to improve the guidelines in future updates.

### Organ dysfunction, injury and failure in acute heart failure: from pathophysiology to diagnosis and management. A review on behalf of the acute heart failure committee of the heart failure association (HFA) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [^113jjda1]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Organ injury and impairment are commonly observed in patients with acute heart failure (AHF), and congestion is an essential pathophysiological mechanism of impaired organ function. Congestion is the predominant clinical profile in most patients with AHF; a smaller proportion presents with peripheral hypoperfusion or cardiogenic shock. Hypoperfusion further deteriorates organ function. The injury and dysfunction of target organs (i.e. heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, intestine, brain) in the setting of AHF are associated with increased risk for mortality. Improvement in organ function after decongestive therapies has been associated with a lower risk for post-discharge mortality. Thus, the prevention and correction of organ dysfunction represent a therapeutic target of interest in AHF and should be evaluated in clinical trials. Treatment strategies that specifically prevent, reduce or reverse organ dysfunction remain to be identified and evaluated to determine if such interventions impact mortality, morbidity and patient-centred outcomes. This paper reflects current understanding among experts of the presentation and management of organ impairment in AHF and suggests priorities for future research to advance the field.

### Early management of patients with acute heart failure: state of the art and future directions. A consensus document from the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine / Heart Failure Society of America acute heart failure working group [^115Qv5Ka]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) afflicts nearly 6 million Americans, resulting in one million emergency department (ED) visits and over one million annual hospital discharges. An aging population and improved survival from cardiovascular diseases is expected to further increase HF prevalence. Emergency providers play a significant role in the management of patients with acute heart failure (AHF). It is crucial that emergency physicians and other providers involved in early management understand the latest developments in diagnostic testing, therapeutics and alternatives to hospitalization. Further, clinical trials must be conducted in the ED in order to improve the evidence base and drive optimal initial therapy for AHF. Should ongoing and future studies suggest early phenotype-driven therapy improves in-hospital and post-discharge outcomes, ED treatment decisions will need to evolve accordingly. The potential impact of future studies which incorporate risk-stratification into ED disposition decisions cannot be underestimated. Predictive instruments that identify a cohort of patients safe for ED discharge, while simultaneously addressing barriers to successful outpatient management, have the potential to significantly impact quality of life and resource expenditures.

New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification — symptom-based functional status and staging linkage is described as follows: The NYHA classification is used to characterize symptoms and functional capacity of patients with symptomatic (stage C) heart failure (HF) or advanced HF (stage D), and it is a subjective assessment by a clinician that can change over time. The NYHA functional classification is an independent predictor of mortality and is widely used in clinical practice to determine the eligibility of patients for treatment strategies. Clinicians specify NYHA classification at baseline after the initial diagnosis and after treatment through the continuum of care, and although a patient with symptomatic HF (stage C) may become asymptomatic with treatment (NYHA class I), that patient will still be categorized as stage C HF; patients with stage C HF can also be classified according to the trajectory of their symptoms.

### Evolution of the American college of cardiology and American Heart Association cardiology clinical practice guidelines: a 10-year assessment [^1174EaSP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Over the past 10 years, ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines have been significantly streamlined and increasingly emphasize high‐quality evidence and de‐emphasize expert opinion and other lower levels of evidence. This focus on condensing recommendations has the potential to increase the clinical utility of guidelines for practicing clinicians.

### Personalized medicine and hospitalization for heart failure: if we understand it, we may be successful in treating it [^1143oYGT]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Lack of robust consideration of the presenting phenotype

In our opinion, it is unrealistic to expect a change in outcomes until a personalized approach is adopted (Figure 1). This includes categorizing the heart failure aetiology, presenting clinical phenotype and precipitant of hospitalization. Detailed and precise investigation of the heart, broader cardiovascular system and co‐morbidity is required (Table 1). Once the reason for HHF is known, existing treatments can be applied (primarily loop diuretics and nitrates) and novel investigational drugs and techniques or devices can be assessed. Applying one therapy in patients with different aetiologies and mechanisms has been surprisingly successful in the more homogeneous ambulatory population with chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), but in HHF this broad‐brush approach has not been effective.

Figure 1
Dichotomies in the approach to hospitalized heart failure (HHF). HFrEF, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

Table 1
Personalized assessment of hospitalized heart failure

Patients who present primarily with dyspnoea at rest comprise up to 42% of 'real‐world' patients with HHF in registries 1 but over 90% in randomized controlled trials. 2 Those who present with peripheral oedema as their main complaint and who are only breathless on exertion have worse outcomes than those with pulmonary congestion and consequent breathlessness at rest. 1 In clinical trials, it is likely that the under‐representation of patients with predominant peripheral oedema dilutes treatment effects. We would argue that there is a growing need to separate these groups in the design of trials assessing mechanistically‐targeted therapies.

Differentiation of those with a slower 'sub‐acute' decline in their condition from those with 'acute' breathlessness has only recently received attention. 1 Perhaps those who present with increasing symptoms over weeks or months have fluid overload as their primary therapeutic target. The minority who present with a true 'acute decompensation' in the absence of a slow, often sub‐clinical, accumulation of fluid might have uncontrolled hypertension, unstable coronary disease or an acute arrhythmia as a precipitant, and thus require quite different treatment approaches. It seems logical that targeting the cause or causes of decompensation should yield better long‐term benefits than the undifferentiated treatment of the resulting signs and symptoms.

### Considerations for initial therapy in the treatment of acute heart failure [^114Nz91F]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of patients presenting to the emergency department with acute heart failure (AHF) is challenging due to the similarity of AHF symptoms to other conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Additionally, because AHF is most common in an older population, the presentation of coexistent pathologies further increases the challenge of making an accurate diagnosis and selecting the most appropriate treatment. Delays in the diagnosis and treatment of AHF can result in worse outcomes and higher healthcare costs. Rapid initiation of treatment is thus necessary for optimal disease management. Early treatment decisions for patients with AHF can be guided by risk-stratification models based on initial clinical data, including blood pressure, levels of troponin, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, B-type natriuretic peptide, and ultrasound. In this review, we discuss methods for differentiating high-risk and low-risk patients and provide guidance on how treatment decisions can be informed by risk-level assessment. Through the use of these approaches, emergency physicians can play an important role in improving patient management, preventing unnecessary hospitalizations, and lowering healthcare costs. This review differs from others published recently on the topic of treating AHF by providing a detailed examination of the clinical utility of diagnostic tools for the differentiation of dyspneic patients such as bedside ultrasound, hemodynamic changes, and interrogation of implantable cardiac devices. In addition, our clinical guidance on considerations for initial pharmacologic therapy in the undifferentiated patient is provided. It is crucial for emergency physicians to achieve an early diagnosis of AHF and initiate therapy in order to reduce morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on clinical assessment, management, and trajectory of patients hospitalized with heart Failure focused update: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^115mQzwM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Risk stratification of acute heart failure (HF) in the emergency department outlines sequential triage: "Critically ill at presentation?" leads to "Admit for critical care", and if not, "New diagnosis of HF?" leads to "Admit for evaluation of new HF". Subsequent assessment includes "Marked degree of congestion?", "Medical risk/complexity?", and "Need for more information about history/regimen/comorbidities?" followed by "Review of triggers Focused re-education Limited diagnostic workup". Disposition options shown include "Home with recheck < 7 days", "Potential for observation unit", and "Possible Hospital at Home". The figure notes that signs of marked congestion may include "Marked leg edema, ascites, or scrotal or perineal edema", and that radiographic and biochemical abnormalities may also indicate congestion.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115f2DtN]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Definitions of evaluation criteria for drug-related heart failure (HF) categorize magnitude as follows: major effects are life-threatening or lead to hospitalization or emergency room visit; moderate effects can lead to an additional clinic visit, change in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, change in cardiac function, or worsening cardiovascular disease and can warrant a permanent change in the long-term medication regimen; minor effects lead to increased assessment/surveillance or symptoms that warrant a transient medication change. Levels of evidence are defined as Level A (multiple populations evaluated; data from multiple randomized, controlled trials or meta-analyses), Level B (limited populations evaluated; data from a single randomized, controlled trial or nonrandomized studies), and Level C (very limited populations evaluated; case reports, case studies, expert opinion, and consensus opinion). Onset of effect is defined as immediate when demonstrated within 1 wk of drug administration, intermediate when demonstrated within weeks to months, and delayed when demonstrated within ≥ 1 y of drug administration.

Laboratory and electrocardiographic evaluation — Laboratory evaluation provides important information regarding patients' comorbidities, suitability for and adverse effects of treatments, potential causes or confounders of HF, severity and prognosis of HF, and is usually performed on initial evaluation, and pertinent laboratory tests are repeated with changes in clinical condition or treatments. Electrocardiography is part of the routine evaluation of a patient with HF, provides information on rhythm, heart rate, QRS morphology and duration, cause, and prognosis of HF, and is repeated when there is a clinical indication such as a suspicion for arrhythmia, ischemia or myocardial injury, conduction, or other cardiac abnormalities.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) has developed a concept of heart failure staging — see table 2. In practice, presenting patients with heart failure are those in Stage C or D. Such patients are assessed according to their symptoms and identified as being in one of four New York Heart Association (NYHA) classifications — see table 3. The principal goals of management are to relieve symptoms, avoid hospitalisation and improve prognosis, and clinical trials have concentrated on these three aspects.

ACC/AHA stages of HF

NYHA classification

Occasionally an LVEF of < 40% is detected incidentally in individuals who are truly asymptomatic — this is not heart failure by definition and is termed asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), equivalent to ACC/AHA Stage B. ACE inhibition has an evidence base and is generally recommended in such cases, and most heart failure specialists would advocate the use of βB and MRA, particularly given the recognised heterogeneity observed when assessing severity of symptoms.

Once a patient has been identified as having HFrEF, the underlying aetiology of their LVSD should be sought. Most commonly this will relate to ischaemic heart disease or an idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Patients with chronic impairment of LV systolic function may well have complete resolution of symptoms and LVEF with appropriate therapy but be at risk of recurrent decompensation and continuing medical therapy is supported by experience and randomised trial evidence. More rarely, patients may present with a reversible underlying cause of LVSD such as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy, thyrotoxicosis and others. Critical ischaemia corrected by revascularisation may reverse HFrEF in carefully selected patients but identifying individuals in this category is challenging and the literature would not support routine revascularisation in the absence of anginal symptoms.

The key to understanding the aetiology underlying HFrEF is a careful history and physical examination combined with appropriate investigations. Cardiac MRI is increasingly used to identify specific appearances related to various potential aetiologies, according to patterns of myocardial scar following the administration of gadolinium contrast (figure 2).

Acute heart failure syndromes — terminology, definition, and ED context: "Acute decompensated heart failure" typically describes patients with known heart failure who experience acute or subacute worsening, whereas "acute heart failure syndromes" were defined by an international workgroup as the "gradual or rapid deterioration in heart failure signs and symptoms resulting in a need for urgent therapy", with symptoms primarily from increased pulmonary congestion due to elevated left ventricular filling pressures (with or without low cardiac output) that may occur with normal or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction; the American College of Emergency Physicians' Clinical Policies Committee chose to use the term "acute heart failure syndromes" as previously defined. Appreciation of disease heterogeneity supports that evaluation and management are best performed on an individualized basis, and the emergency department plays a critical role given that approximately 80% of patients hospitalized for the condition are admitted through the ED.
