## Question

Can dronedarone be used to treat Wolff–Parkinson–White (WPW) syndrome?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether dronedarone can be used to treat Wolff–Parkinson–White (WPW) syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the WPW pathophysiology and the high-risk scenario of pre-excited atrial fibrillation. Then, I should verify guideline-recommended acute and chronic management in WPW. Next, I will examine dronedarone's pharmacology and labeled indications. After that, I need to check whether any guidelines or studies support dronedarone in WPW. Finally, I will synthesize a risk–benefit conclusion and outline safer alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the critical physiology. WPW involves an accessory atrioventricular pathway that can bypass the AV node; the most dangerous presentation is atrial fibrillation with pre-excitation, where very rapid atrial impulses conduct antegrade over the pathway and may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, so I need to ensure I avoid drugs that slow the AV node while leaving the pathway unopposed [^115YjCUR].

> Next, I should review current guideline-directed therapy for acute pre-excited AF. The ESC SVT guideline recommends agents that increase accessory pathway refractoriness such as IV ibutilide, procainamide, flecainide, or propafenone in hemodynamically stable pre-excited AF, and synchronized cardioversion if unstable or if drugs fail; importantly, amiodarone is not recommended in this scenario, and AV nodal blockers are to be avoided because they can facilitate faster pathway conduction; wait, older practice sometimes listed amiodarone for wide-complex AF, but hold on, the 2019–2020 recommendations specifically advise against it in pre-excited AF, so I should align with those updates [^114BTHDs] [^112rmMsH] [^112xTZF5] [^114BTHDs].

> I will now examine dronedarone's pharmacology. Dronedarone is a multichannel antiarrhythmic with class III properties and also antiadrenergic and calcium channel–blocking effects that slow AV nodal conduction; let me think about this in WPW, because those AV nodal–blocking actions, similar to amiodarone's, are precisely what can be hazardous in pre-excited AF by preferentially shifting conduction down the accessory pathway, which is the pathophysiologic setup I want to avoid [^111hTztG].

> I need to check label and evidence scope. The FDA-labeled indication for dronedarone is maintenance of sinus rhythm in adults with paroxysmal or persistent AF, not treatment of WPW or accessory pathway–mediated tachyarrhythmias; let me double-check whether any high-credibility society guidelines list dronedarone for WPW or pre-excited AF, and I find no such recommendation, while dronedarone evidence syntheses focus on general AF populations without ventricular pre-excitation, reinforcing that there is no supportive WPW-specific evidence base here [^112yziTy] [^113WGoZZ] [^112GgKHF] [^113M1e1e].

> Synthesizing risk–benefit, I should conclude that dronedarone should not be used to treat WPW, particularly in pre-excited AF, because its AV nodal–blocking properties create the same mechanistic hazard that leads guidelines to advise against AV nodal blockers and amiodarone in this setting; safer, guideline-endorsed acute options target the accessory pathway itself, and definitive therapy for WPW is catheter ablation of the accessory pathway when appropriate, which cures the substrate rather than masking it pharmacologically [^114BTHDs] [^116pkzw8] [^116pkzw8] [^113Wdapq].

> Practically, if faced with pre-excited AF, I need to ensure strict avoidance of AV nodal blockers including beta-blockers, diltiazem, verapamil, digoxin, and amiodarone, and by extension avoid dronedarone; instead, I should use procainamide, ibutilide, flecainide, or propafenone if stable, and proceed to synchronized cardioversion if unstable or if drug therapy fails, while arranging referral for accessory pathway ablation for long-term management; hold on, I should verify cardioversion guidance one more time, and yes, synchronized direct cardioversion is recommended when instability occurs or when pharmacologic conversion is unsuccessful [^114BTHDs] [^112xTZF5] [^113M1e1e].

Dronedarone is **not recommended for Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome** because it does not reliably slow conduction over accessory pathways and may increase the risk of rapid ventricular rates or ventricular fibrillation in pre-excited atrial fibrillation. Current guidelines do not support its use in WPW, and **catheter ablation remains the preferred definitive therapy** [^115YjCUR] [^116pkzw8] [^113M1e1e].

---

## Pharmacological properties of dronedarone

Dronedarone is a **multichannel blocker** (Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺) with antiadrenergic effects, structurally related to amiodarone but lacking iodine, reducing thyroid and pulmonary toxicity [^111hTztG]. It is approved to maintain sinus rhythm in paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation/flutter, but **not for WPW or pre-excited AF** [^112yziTy].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines regarding dronedarone in WPW

There is **no clinical evidence supporting dronedarone for WPW**, and major guidelines do not recommend it for WPW or pre-excited AF. The ESC 2020 guidelines explicitly recommend against intravenous amiodarone in pre-excited AF due to the risk of accelerating ventricular response or VF; thus, dronedarone is also avoided [^112rmMsH]. Additionally, the CCS/CHRS 2020 guidelines **advise against AV nodal blockers**, digitalis, and amiodarone in ventricular pre-excitation; dronedarone is not mentioned, underscoring its lack of a role in WPW [^115YjCUR].

---

## Risks and adverse effects of dronedarone in WPW

Dronedarone **does not reliably slow accessory pathway conduction** and may increase ventricular rates or precipitate VF in pre-excited AF. It can cause bradycardia, QT prolongation, and proarrhythmia, including torsades de pointes, and is **contraindicated in severe heart failure or permanent AF** [^114MW8eb] [^112yziTy].

---

## Comparison with other antiarrhythmic medications

Dronedarone is **less effective than amiodarone** for maintaining sinus rhythm and is inferior to class IC (flecainide, propafenone) and class IA (procainamide) agents for acute management of pre-excited AF. These agents are recommended for acute pharmacologic management of stable pre-excited AF; dronedarone is not.

---

## Alternative treatments for WPW syndrome

Catheter ablation is the **definitive therapy** for WPW, with high success and low complication rates [^117Tgkqk] [^113Wdapq]. For acute management of stable pre-excited AF, procainamide, flecainide, propafenone, or ibutilide are recommended; synchronized cardioversion is indicated for instability or when drugs fail [^114BTHDs] [^112xTZF5] [^113M1e1e].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus **do not recommend dronedarone for WPW**. The ESC 2020 and CCS/CHRS 2020 guidelines emphasize avoiding AV nodal blockers and amiodarone in pre-excited AF, and do not include dronedarone in WPW management recommendations [^112rmMsH] [^115YjCUR].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Dronedarone is **not recommended for WPW** because of the lack of evidence and the potential to accelerate ventricular response or precipitate VF in pre-excited AF. Catheter ablation is the preferred **definitive therapy** [^117Tgkqk]; procainamide, flecainide, propafenone, or ibutilide are recommended for acute pharmacologic management of stable pre-excited AF [^114BTHDs].

### Cardiac involvement in mitochondrial DNA disease: Clinical spectrum, diagnosis, and management [^1163S3sn]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

- **Ventricular pre-excitation and tachyarrhythmias**: Ventricular pre-excitation and Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome may be more common in patients with mtDNA disease than in the general population. First observed in association with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, ventricular pre-excitation has been reported in 10% of patients and 8% of maternal relatives compared with 1.6% of paternal relatives. Although supported by several studies, the failure of some groups to replicate this finding has stimulated debate as to whether these results represent chance findings or evidence of a direct aetiological link. Evidence in support of the latter is provided by reports of ventricular pre-excitation occurring in association with the m.8344A > G and m.3243A > G mutations, where manifest pre-excitation was observed in 3–27% of patients. Although ventricular pre-excitation has been reported in association with mtDNA-related cardiomyopathy, this combination does not appear as common as in other forms of inherited disease such as that caused by PRKAG2 gene mutations. Symptomatic patients with mtDNA disease and manifest ventricular pre-excitation have undergone successful radio-frequency ablation (RFA) of accessory pathways, but the natural history remains unclear and invasive management of asymptomatic patients is controversial.

- **Supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias**: Both have been reported in patients with mtDNA disease, particularly in children and in those with cardiomyopathy. Although prolongation of the QT interval has been identified in some patient groups, determining the true incidence remains challenging.

### Risk of sudden death after successful accessory atrioventricular pathway ablation in resuscitated patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^113gtiyZ]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2002). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome can be due to ventricular fibrillation mediated by fast conduction over the accessory pathway during atrial fibrillation. However, if primary ventricular fibrillation is the reason for resuscitation, the placement of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) would be indicated. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that in resuscitated patients with WPW syndrome, recurrences can be prevented by sole ablation of their accessory pathways.

- **Methods and results**: We performed a long-term follow-up study of 48 resuscitated patients with WPW syndrome who underwent successful accessory pathway ablation as their sole primary treatment. Cardiac arrest had occurred either spontaneously in 32 patients (Group A) or after intravenous administration of antiarrhythmic drugs in 16 patients (Group B) and was never associated with an acute myocardial infarction or other concomitant factors. All patients had normal left ventricular function at echocardiography. A total of 56 accessory AV pathways were ablated successfully with radiofrequency current (n = 55) or during surgery (n = 1) and were located at the left free wall (n = 35), right free wall (n = 8), or septal-paraseptal region (n = 13). Follow-up 5.0 ± 1.9 years after ablation (range 0.2 to 7.9) was obtained in all 48 patients. All of the patients were alive, and none had a life-threatening arrhythmia or syncope after successful ablation of their accessory pathways.

Conclusion

In resuscitated patients with WPW syndrome who have normal left [content appears cut off]

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^113upGPf]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Electrophysiological study and catheter ablation**:

	- **AP ablation**: All patients in both the AP group and AP + PVI group underwent successful AP ablation. A two-dimensional mapping system or the CARTO three-dimensional electroanatomical mapping system (Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, California) was used in the ablation procedures. Patients underwent an electrophysiological study after all antiarrhythmic drugs had been discontinued for at least five half-lives and before AP ablation was performed. Three 6-French multipolar electrode catheters (Biosense Webster) were introduced percutaneously into the bilateral femoral veins for electrophysiological studies. The catheters were positioned in the high right atrium, across the tricuspid valve, to record the His-bundle ECG, and in the right ventricular apex. Another 6-French multipolar electrode catheter (Biosense Webster) was advanced from the right internal jugular vein and positioned in the coronary sinus. A retrograde aortic approach or the trans-septal approach was used for left-sided pathways. Right-sided pathways were approached via the femoral veins. The locations of the APs were determined from the position of the catheter at a successfully ablated site in the left oblique fluoroscopic view.

	- **AF ablation**: Patients in the AP + PVI group underwent additional PVI immediately after AP ablation. Additional PVI was offered to patients, with their consent and at the operator's discretion. The PVI procedure was performed in the post-absorptive state under conscious sedation. We used the technique of circumferential…

### Cardiac memory in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Noninvasive imaging of activation and repolarization before and after catheter ablation [^111p1ddr]. Circulation (2008). Low credibility.

Cardiac memory refers to a change in ventricular repolarization induced by and persisting for minutes to months after cessation of a period of altered ventricular activation (e.g. resulting from pacing or preexcitation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome). ECG imaging (ECGI) is a novel imaging modality for noninvasive electroanatomic mapping of epicardial activation and repolarization.

- **Methods and results**: Fourteen pediatric patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and no other congenital disease were imaged with ECGI a day before and 45 minutes, 1 week, and 1 month after successful catheter ablation. ECGI determined that preexcitation sites were consistent with sites of successful ablation in all cases to within a 1-hour arc of each atrioventricular annulus. In the preexcited rhythm, the activation-recovery interval (ARI) was the longest (349 ± 6 ms) in the area of preexcitation, leading to a high average base-to-apex ARI dispersion of 95 ± 9 ms (normal is approximately 40 ms). The ARI dispersion remained the same 45 minutes after ablation, although the activation sequence was restored to normal. ARI dispersion was still high (79 ± 9 ms) 1 week later and returned to normal (45 ± 6 ms) 1 month after ablation.

- **Conclusions**: The study demonstrates that ECGI can noninvasively localize ventricular insertion sites of accessory pathways to guide ablation and evaluate its outcome in pediatric patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Wolff-Parkinson-White is associated with high ARI dispersion in the preexcited rhythm that persists after ablation.

### Risk stratification in pediatric Wolff-Parkinson-White: Practice variation among pediatric cardiologists and electrophysiologists [^117Cpj9F]. Pediatric Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Published guidelines provide recommendations for risk stratification in pediatric Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW). There are no data on provider concordance with these guidelines. We hypothesized that significant practice variation exists between pediatric cardiologists (PC) and electrophysiologists (EP).

The records of all patients aged 8 to 21 years, with a new ECG diagnosis of WPW between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2018, from a single center, were retrospectively reviewed. Subjects were categorized based on symptoms and resting ECG findings as one of the following: asymptomatic intermittent WPW, asymptomatic persistent WPW, or symptomatic WPW. The performance and results of diagnostic testing, including Holter monitor, event monitor, exercise stress test (EST), and electrophysiology study (EPS), were recorded. The primary outcome was concordance with published guidelines. A secondary outcome was documentation of a discussion of sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk.

A total of 615 patient encounters were analyzed in 231 patients with newly diagnosed WPW pattern on ECG (56% male; mean age at diagnosis 13.9 ± 2.5 years). EP were observed to have a significantly higher rate of guideline concordance than PC (95% vs. 71%, p < 0.001). There was significant practice variation between PC and EP in the documentation of a discussion of SCD risk: 96% in EP vs. 39% in PC (p < 0.001).

Significant practice variation exists in the non-invasive and invasive risk stratification of pediatric WPW, with lower concordance to published guidelines among PC compared to EP.

### Dronedarone versus sotalol in patients with atrial fibrillation: A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^113WGoZZ]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

This review has several strengths. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review (SLR) to combine published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized clinical trial data, along with real-world evidence (RWE) from observational studies, to summarize the comparative safety and efficacy of dronedarone versus sotalol in atrial fibrillation (AF). The literature search was comprehensive and included three major electronic databases, as well as several gray literature sources. This evidence base is representative of the published quantitative analyses on this topic.

- **Limitations**:
	- Restrictions in the inclusion criteria were limited to articles published only in English, which, in addition to language bias, has the potential to introduce the risk of ignoring key data and missing cultural contexts. However, we consider this bias to be minimal, as many studies included in this review comprised patients/subjects from jurisdictions outside of the US and EU. Other limitations related to the included studies were the tendency for methods of ascertainment of AF recurrence to vary and heterogeneity in the length of follow-up. Most studies included in this review reported a treatment duration of only several months or did not report treatment duration at all.

Further prospective multicenter RCTs with sufficient follow-up are needed to confirm these findings.

### Dronedarone versus sotalol in patients with atrial fibrillation: A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^111eTw8w]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

For all‐cause death, there were seven observational studies contributing to the analysis, published between 2009 and 2020. One study from this set, reporting outcomes from the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease, found that death rates were lower in patients treated with sotalol versus amiodarone or no AAD. Four of these observational studies comprised large national database data sets from Sweden, Denmark, and South Korea. In the Danish study (2009), published at a time when sotalol, flecainide, and propafenone were guideline‐recommended first‐line treatments, no increased death rate was evident in patients treated with these AADs or amiodarone compared with no treatment. The more recent Swedish study (2018) reported lower all‐cause death with dronedarone or flecainide versus sotalol; however, this study also showed a potential for hidden confounding. The earlier Swedish study (2014) reported that overall death rates with AF patients on dronedarone were lower than the general population. In the Korean study, no difference in the risk of death from any cause was evident between dronedarone and sotalol.

In this NMA, risk of CV death was numerically lower with dronedarone by 75%; however, this result was based on only two studies and failed to reach statistical significance. It should be noted that the inclusion of RWE in this analysis of dronedarone versus sotalol provides a naturalistic means of comparing perhaps broadly similar AF patient populations, based on the proportions of specific AF patient populations in the US and EU receiving dronedarone or sotalol.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^116CamTC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

- **Trend of ventricular response**: At different infusion times of nifekalant during preexcited states, the trend showed that neither acceleration nor termination of ventricular response occurred within 7 minutes in 42 patients and within 30 minutes in 18 patients. The maximal therapeutic effect of nifekalant was observed between 7 and 10 minutes of infusion.

One patient developed TdP after nifekalant infusion. This patient, a 58-year-old female, exhibited spontaneous sustained preexcited AF. Twelve minutes post-infusion, AF converted to sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 40 beats/min, followed by the development of TdP. This was immediately terminated by pacing the right ventricle at 90 beats/min and administering a 2.5 g intravenous bolus of magnesium sulfate. The patient had a low blood potassium level of 3.0 mmol/L. Additionally, AF changed to AFL in 2 patients. No patients developed VF, cardiac arrest, or syncope during nifekalant infusion. There was no transient loss of the δ wave, defined as its complete disappearance on the ECG for at least 1 minute, in any of the patients during the infusion.

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^115AenWH]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs frequently in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, with a reported incidence ranging from 9% to 38%. Previous studies have reported a decreased incidence of AF following the successful elimination of the accessory pathway (AP). This suggests that the AP itself may play an important role in the initiation of AF. However, paroxysmal AF still frequently recurs in some patients with WPW syndrome, despite successful AP elimination. Identifying patients at high risk for the recurrence of AF is clinically important because additional therapeutic strategies are needed for these patients.

Interatrial block (IAB) denotes a conduction delay between the right and left atria, which manifests in a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) as a P-wave duration of more than 120 ms. A prolonged P-wave with biphasic (±) morphology in the inferior leads represents an even higher degree of IAB and has been referred to as advanced IAB. The appearance of advanced IAB is frequently associated with atrial tachyarrhythmias and has been found to predict AF in multiple clinical scenarios. However, the role of advanced IAB in predicting the recurrence of AF after AP ablation in patients with WPW syndrome is unclear. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the clinical utility of advanced IAB for predicting the risk of AF recurrence in patients with verified paroxysmal AF and WPW syndrome after successful AP ablation.

### Dronedarone versus sotalol in patients with atrial fibrillation: A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^114MW8eb]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

While both ESC and AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines emphasize that safety should primarily guide the selection of AAD therapy in AF, the AIM‐AF survey of US and EU physicians found efficacy to be the most important consideration for AAD selection. In spite of a recent change in recommendation from class IA to IIbA for sotalol in the ESC AF guidelines due to its safety profile, the survey study noted significant use of sotalol in general, but also in specific patient populations of concern, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, or HFrEF. ESC guidelines state that dronedarone has the most solid safety data, but is not indicated in patients with decompensated heart failure, HFrEF, or patients with permanent AF. The use of RWE provides a measure of external validity that helps to bridge the gap between clinical practice and the well‐powered RCTs that provide the evidence base for clinical treatment guidelines. Both approaches applied to well‐designed and well‐powered studies of safety and efficacy will ultimately benefit the judicious use of AAD therapy in AF.

### Dronedarone versus sotalol in patients with atrial fibrillation: A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^112GgKHF]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review (SLR) and network meta-analysis (NMA) combining published data from clinical trials and observational studies to compare the safety and efficacy of dronedarone versus sotalol in atrial fibrillation (AF). This comparison considers the benefit‐risk profile of the Vaughan‐Williams class III and class II properties of these two antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs).

A major finding from this NMA included evidence for a lower risk of all‐cause death with dronedarone relative to sotalol. These findings are consistent with a previous NMA of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by Freemantle et al, as well as a more recent meta‐analysis of RCTs as part of a Cochrane Review by Valembois et al. In both of these meta‐analyses, effect measures for the selected drugs were estimated relative to placebo, with evidence of a higher risk of death for sotalol and a lower risk of stroke with dronedarone. All 23 RCTs that were included in the present NMA were also included in the Cochrane Review. The inclusion of real‐world evidence (RWE) from observational studies with head‐to‐head comparison of treatments commonly used for maintenance of sinus rhythm in adults with nonpermanent AF in the review represents a novel approach to evaluating treatment options in AF.

### Dronedarone versus sotalol in patients with atrial fibrillation: A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^116wDx1V]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

- **Study selection**: The search identified a total of 3,576 records in MEDLINE®, Embase, and CENTRAL, along with five additional records from gray literature and hand searches. Following full-text screening, 54 records pertaining to 50 unique studies were retained for qualitative synthesis as part of the systematic literature review (SLR). Ultimately, 37 studies were judged to be sufficiently homogeneous with outcomes data shared by at least one other study, and these were included in the network meta-analysis (NMA). The PRISMA diagram is presented in Figure 1. The full list of final included and excluded studies, along with reasons for exclusion at the full-text review stage and the corresponding publications per included trial, are available in Supporting Information: Tables A.4 and A.5.

- **Study characteristics and interventions**: The present SLR included a total of 50 studies: 27 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 19 retrospective cohort studies, 2 retrospective case-control studies, 1 prospective cohort study, and 1 nonrandomized clinical trial. Sample sizes across included studies ranged from 33 patients to 312,341 patients (median = 404 patients). Among the studies reporting arrhythmia-related endpoints (n = 39), 26 described methods used for arrhythmia monitoring. Common methods for monitoring treatment efficacy included tele-electrocardiogram recorders (n = 12), implantable devices (n = 3), 24-hour Holter monitoring (n = 2), or other unspecified ambulatory measurement devices (n = 3). Eight studies conducted rhythm measurements only at follow-up visits.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: electrophysiological and clinical findings [^115CJKrx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

A total of 201 patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), with a mean age of 38 ± 13 years and consisting of 128 males, underwent electrophysiological (EP) studies. All patients presented with sinus rhythm; 87 of the 201 patients (43%) exhibited preexcitation on an ECG, while 114 (57%) showed no evidence of preexcitation on an ECG, indicating either concealed accessory pathway (AP) or dual atrioventricular node (AVN) pathways. One patient had Ebstein anomaly, whereas the remainder did not have structural heart disease. None of the patients had electrolyte abnormalities or a prolonged QT interval (QTc ≥ 470 ms).

Nifekalant was infused as described previously. EP studies were conducted at baseline before drug infusion (baseline state) and periodically during the infusion (7–30 minutes). Seven-beat stimuli at a basic drive cycle length (S1) of either 450 or 600 ms, delivered in -10 ms decrements, were employed. The following indices were measured: antegrade AP effective refractory period (ERP) and block cycle length (BCL), antegrade AVN ERP, ERP of the right atrium, ERP of the right ventricle (RV), AH interval, HV interval, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, heart rate (HR), and blood pressure.

- **Definitions**:
	- Antegrade AP and AVN ERP were defined as the longest A1-A2 interval that failed to conduct over the AP or AVN.
	- The antegrade BCL over the AP was defined as the shortest S1 cycle length that maintained 1:1 conduction at a decremental paced interval of 10 ms.
	- The right atrium and RV ERPs were defined as the longest S1-S2 interval at which A2 (or V2) failed to produce a response.
	- The antegrade AP ERP and BCL were measured in patients with preexcitation, while the antegrade AVN ERP was recorded mainly in patients with no antegrade conduction.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^116ii4TK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Eighty-seven patients (mean age 53 ± 11 years, 52 males) with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) and no accessory pathway (AP) were studied. The participants did not have abnormal electrolytes, prolonged QT interval (QTc ≥ 470 ms), atrioventricular (AV) conduction disorders, or left atrial thrombus. Twenty-three of the 87 patients (26%) had structural heart disease and a low left ventricular ejection fraction (39 ± 5%).

Nifekalant was infused as described above, and the following parameters were assessed: ventricular rate of AF before and 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes from the onset of infusion; AF cardioversion; blood pressure (BP); torsades de pointes (TdP); and other arrhythmias.

- **Statistical analysis**: Continuous variables with normal distribution were presented as mean values ± SD. The Student paired t-test was used to determine the significance between baseline and drug infusion. The variable PP with skew distribution was presented as median (percentiles 25–75), and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. A 2-sided P value of < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

### A randomized study of prophylactic catheter ablation in asymptomatic patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^113Wdapq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Young age and the inducibility of atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia or atrial fibrillation during invasive electrophysiological testing identify asymptomatic patients with a Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern on the electrocardiogram as being at high risk for arrhythmic events. We tested the hypothesis that prophylactic catheter ablation of accessory pathways would provide meaningful and durable benefits compared with no treatment in such patients.

- **Methods**: From 1997 to 2002, among 224 eligible asymptomatic patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, patients at high risk for arrhythmias were randomly assigned to radio-frequency catheter ablation of accessory pathways (37 patients) or no treatment (35 patients). The end point was the occurrence of arrhythmic events over a five-year follow-up period.

- **Results**: Patients assigned to ablation had baseline characteristics similar to those of the controls. Two patients in the ablation group (5 percent) and 21 in the control group (60 percent) experienced arrhythmic events. One control patient had ventricular fibrillation as the presenting arrhythmia. The five-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of the incidence of arrhythmic events were 7 percent among patients who underwent ablation and 77 percent among the controls (P < 0.001 by the log-rank test); the risk reduction with ablation was 92 percent (relative risk, 0.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.33; P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Prophylactic accessory-pathway ablation markedly reduces the frequency of arrhythmic events in asymptomatic patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

### Extracorporeal life support for cardiac arrest in a 13-year-old girl caused by Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^113Y8ho9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Generally, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome presents with a good prognosis. However, several case reports have demonstrated malignant arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death as the first presentation of WPW syndrome. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation using extracorporeal life support is a therapeutic option in cases of refractory cardiac arrest. We present a WPW syndrome patient who experienced sudden cardiac arrest as the initial presentation of the disease, and was treated using extracorporeal life support with a good neurologic outcome.

### Is Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome a genetic disease [^112ZREQi]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2005). Low credibility.

Family studies and more recent molecular genetic investigations indicate that Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and associated preexcitation disorders can have a substantial genetic component. Because preexcitation disorders are sometimes inherited as single-gene disorders, key mechanistic insights can be gained that are expected to be relevant to the more common multifactorial forms of these traits. Potentially, such insights will inform the future management of these conditions. Where WPW is inherited as a familial trait, with or without associated cardiac defects or a systemic syndrome, there are clinical genetic ramifications that are already of practical importance.

### Catheter ablation therapy for supraventricular arrhythmias [^117Tgkqk]. JAMA (2007). Low credibility.

Supraventricular arrhythmias encompass a broad spectrum of disorders including, in descending order of frequency, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrioventricular nodal reentry, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and atrial tachycardia. While these conditions are not life-threatening in most cases, they can cause significant symptoms such as palpitations, chest discomfort, breathlessness, anxiety, and syncope, which markedly impair quality of life.

Medical therapy exhibits variable efficacy, with most patients not achieving symptom-free statuses. Over the past several decades, research has clarified the fundamental mechanisms involved in the initiation and maintenance of these arrhythmias. Understanding these mechanisms has, in turn, led to the development of highly effective surgical and catheter-based treatments. Although atrial fibrillation remains a therapeutic challenge, ongoing investigations and therapeutic advancements are showing promise. The supraventricular arrhythmias and their treatment are elaborated upon in this report.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^1163t3F3]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

The main findings in this study were as follows: (a) pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) after successful accessory pathway (AP) ablation significantly reduced atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence in the subgroup of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) patients with advanced interatrial block (IAB) and (b) PVI did not reduce AF recurrence in nonselective WPW patients and in patients aged over 50 years.

Previous studies have shown that patients with WPW syndrome have a high incidence of paroxysmal AF. The potential mechanisms responsible for the occurrence of AF in patients with WPW syndrome are thought to be non-PV related. These mechanisms are attributed to the spontaneous degeneration of atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia into AF, electrical properties of the AP, effects of AP on atrial architecture, and intrinsic atrial muscle vulnerability. However, Derejko et al. recently suggested a potential role of the pulmonary veins also in patients with WPW syndrome and AF. Because successful ablation of the AP eliminates AF in some patients but not in others, it is suggested that AP-dependent and AP-independent paroxysmal AF exist in patients with WPW. PVI is a widely accepted treatment option for symptomatic paroxysmal AF. Although the pulmonary veins are reportedly involved in the development of paroxysmal AF in patients with WPW syndrome, atrial substrate abnormalities are thought to be mainly associated with the risk of AF recurrence. Thus, it is unknown whether additional PVI immediately after AP ablation effectively prevents AF recurrence in these patients.

### Malignant vasovagal syndrome in two patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^117Uv3Wk]. Heart (2004). Low credibility.

The presence of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome in patients presenting with syncope suggests that tachyarrhythmia may be the cause. However, the symptoms require careful evaluation. Two young patients presented with syncope and were found to have WPW syndrome on their ECG. In both patients, symptoms were suggestive of vasovagal syncope. During tilt testing, both patients developed their typical symptoms with a fall in blood pressure and heart rate, confirming the diagnosis of malignant vasovagal syndrome.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^1142hog1]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Additional pulmonary vein isolation after successful accessory pathway ablation may not reduce atrial fibrillation recurrence in non-selective Wolff-Parkinson-White patients; however, the recurrence rate was significantly reduced in the subgroup of patients with advanced interatrial block. Screening a resting 12-lead ECG immediately after accessory pathway ablation helps identify patients for whom additional pulmonary vein isolation would be beneficial.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^114tFe24]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Several limitations of our study should be considered:

- **Small sample size**: The small sample size may have introduced statistical bias. Further studies with larger numbers of patients are needed to evaluate the effects of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) on atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence after accessory pathway (AP) ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome.

- **Advanced IAB identification**: It is not possible to identify advanced interatrial block (IAB) before AP ablation in patients with WPW syndrome. This is because the delta wave overshadows the point at which the P-wave ends.

- **P-wave duration**: P-wave duration was measured based on the ECG obtained immediately after the ablation procedure. The residual atrial injury from the ablation procedure may have affected the P-wave duration.

- **Generalizability of findings**: The generalizability of our findings may be limited by the single-center, retrospective, observational approach.

### Dronedarone versus sotalol in patients with atrial fibrillation: A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^113Fx5xR]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Recent updates to atrial fibrillation (AF) guidelines have led to clear differences in first-line treatment recommendations for dronedarone and sotalol. Clinical guidelines for AF patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) vary, as ESC guidelines recommend that sotalol should not be used, and AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines recommend excluding its use or using it with caution in heart failure, except when combined with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.

The recently published Antiarrhythmic Medication for Atrial Fibrillation (AIM-AF; 2022) survey highlighted that 12% of responding EU physicians and 25% of US physicians still selected sotalol as a first-line treatment in patients with HFrEF. ESC guidelines advise that dronedarone should only be used in AF patients with mildly impaired but stable left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), including heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Meanwhile, AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines advise excluding or using it with caution in AF patients with heart failure. Nonetheless, the AIM-AF survey found that 8% of EU and US physicians selected dronedarone as a first-line treatment in patients with AF and HFrEF.

The AIM-AF physician survey highlighted quantifiable deviations between guideline recommendations and real-world practice in AF patients. It is very likely that similar suboptimal adherence to guideline recommendations is reflected in the data set from observational studies included in this network meta-analysis.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^111m6W3b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The electrophysiological effects of nifekalant on AVN conduction in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but no accessory pathway (AP) were determined. Nifekalant infusion terminated AF in 33 of 87 patients (38%). Fifty-four of 87 patients (62%) continued to have AF after 30 minutes of nifekalant treatment. The mean age of this group without AF termination was 58 ± 13 years (ranging from 18 to 74 years), and 32 were male. Twenty of 54 patients (37%) had structural heart diseases and a low left ventricular ejection fraction (37 ± 5%).

- **Ventricular rate at different times**:
	- **Baseline**: 97 ± 17 beats/min
	- **After 1 minute**: 97 ± 16 beats/min
	- **After 3 minutes**: 99 ± 18 beats/min
	- **After 5 minutes**: 101 ± 20 beats/min
	- **After 7 minutes**: 103 ± 22 beats/min
	- **After 10 minutes**: 104 ± 24 beats/min
	- **After 15 minutes**: 102 ± 21 beats/min
	- **After 20 minutes**: 96 ± 19 beats/min
	- **After 30 minutes**: 95 ± 15 beats/min

Nifekalant did not significantly decrease the mean ventricular rate of AF in the absence of an AP (97 ± 17 versus 95 ± 15 beats/min, n = 54, P = 0.22). A trend toward an increased ventricular rate was noted at infusion time 0 to 10 minutes, and a trend toward a decrease at 10 to 30 minutes of the infusion period. In addition, the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) in patients with AF but no AP did not change with nifekalant infusion (106 ± 16 versus 109 ± 17 mm Hg, n = 54, P = 0.30). No torsades de pointes (TdP) occurred in these patients during nifekalant infusion.

### Surgical treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Resuscitation of a forgotten technique [^115qm9SR]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Low credibility.

Dissection of the RCA into the pyramidal space exposes the site of the accessory pathway. This article describes, in detail, the techniques of surgical ablation for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Surgery is now rarely performed for this indication but may be necessary in refractory cases.

First performed by Sealy in 1968, surgical ablation of an accessory pathway was the gold standard for curative treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW). However, in the early 1990s, the safety and efficacy of catheter radiofrequency ablation replaced the surgical procedure. In most patients, catheter ablation will provide a cure for WPW; however, in select, refractory cases, there is still a role for surgical intervention. Here, we present a case and the technical details for the surgical correction of WPW. Consent was obtained from the patient to publish the images and the data (IRB approval No. HM13607; July 29, 2013).

### Dronedarone versus sotalol in patients with atrial fibrillation: A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^111NsYrc]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

- **Methods**: This systematic literature review (SLR) was carried out according to standard methods as per the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. This review was registered with (NCT05279833).

- **Data sources and search strategies**: Searches were conducted in MEDLINE®, Embase, and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) via OvidSP to capture records published up to June 15, 2021. Additionally, conference abstracts published between 2019 and 2021 from the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), Heart Rhythm Society (HRS), and ESC congresses were searched, among others. Searches of US and EU clinical trial registry databases were also conducted to find articles that had reported results. Finally, "hand searches" of the reference lists of previously published literature reviews on the same topic were also conducted to capture additional eligible studies that were missed during the main database search.

- **Study selection**: Study eligibility criteria for the SLR were defined using the PICO framework (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome). Clinical trials and comparative observational studies that evaluated dronedarone and/or sotalol in adults with atrial fibrillation (AF) were included. Excluded were studies of patients with permanent AF.

Two independent senior reviewers were responsible for reviewing all abstracts according to the PICO criteria. Abstracts considered eligible for inclusion proceeded to a full-text screen.

### Long-term natural history of adult Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome patients treated with and without catheter ablation [^111HqAsp]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

There is a paucity of data about the long-term natural history of adult Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) patients regarding the risk of mortality and atrial fibrillation. We sought to describe the long-term outcomes of WPW patients and ascertain the impact of ablation on their natural history.

- **Methods and results**: Three groups of patients were studied: two WPW populations (ablation: 872, no ablation: 1461) and a 1:5 control population (n = 11,175). Long-term mortality and atrial fibrillation rates were determined. The average follow-up for the WPW group was 7.9 ± 5.9 years (median: 6.9 years), which was similar between the ablation and non-ablation groups. Death rates were similar between the WPW group and the control group (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.83–1.11; P = 0.56). Non-ablated WPW patients had a higher long-term death risk compared with ablated WPW patients (hazard ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.50–20.93; P < 0.0001). Incident atrial fibrillation risk was higher in the WPW group compared with the control population (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.29–1.87; P < 0.0001). Non-ablated WPW patients had a lower risk than ablated patients (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.28–0.53; P < 0.0001).

- **Conclusions**: Long-term mortality rates in WPW patients are low and similar to an age-matched and gender-matched control population. WPW patients that underwent the multifactorial process of ablation had lower mortality compared to non-ablated WPW patients. Atrial fibrillation rates are high long-term, and ablation does not reduce this risk.

### Dronedarone versus sotalol in patients with atrial fibrillation: A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^115VXAJG]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

There are limited comparative data on safety and efficacy within commonly used Vaughan-Williams (VW) class III antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in adults with atrial fibrillation (AF).

- **Hypothesis**: We hypothesized that dronedarone and sotalol, two commonly prescribed VW class III AADs with class II properties, have different safety and efficacy effects in patients with nonpermanent AF.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature review was conducted by searching MEDLINE®, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to June 15, 2021 (NCT05279833). Clinical trials and observational studies that evaluated the safety and efficacy of dronedarone or sotalol in adults with AF were included. Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis (NMA) was used to quantify comparative safety and efficacy. Where feasible, we performed sensitivity analyses by including only randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Results**: Of 3581 records identified through database searches, 37 unique studies (23 RCTs, 13 observational studies, and 1 nonrandomized trial) were included in the NMA. Dronedarone was associated with a statistically significantly lower risk of all-cause death versus sotalol (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.38 [95% credible interval, CrI: 0.19, 0.74]). The association was numerically similar in the sensitivity analysis (HR = 0.46 [95% CrI: 0.21, 1.02]). AF recurrence and cardiovascular death results were not significantly different between dronedarone and sotalol in all-studies and sensitivity analyses.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^115kLETs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

**Figure 5**: Effects of nifekalant on antegrade conduction (n = 78). A, The changes in the conduction of antegrade in every patient at baseline and during nifekalant infusion were observed. B, Nifekalant was associated with the prolongation of antegrade conduction, with a change from 272 ± 52 ms to 309 ± 59 ms and from 323 ± 51 ms to 381 ± 63 ms, respectively (all P < 0.001). Nifekalant significantly decreased the proportion of patients with conduction time < 260 ms and 260 ≤ conduction time < 300 ms from 40% to 23% and from 32% to 22%, respectively. Conversely, it increased the proportion of patients with 300 ≤ conduction time < 350 ms and conduction time ≥ 350 ms from 19% to 28% and 9% to 27%, respectively. The term "indicates accessory pathway" followed by "block cycle length" and "effective refractory period" refers to specific electrophysiological parameters measured during the study.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^114YrSMx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The effects of procainamide, propafenone, flecainide, and ibutilide, recommended by the guideline or consensus, on preexcited atrial fibrillation (AF), have been reported by several investigators. Sellers et al. evaluated procainamide in 21 patients with preexcited AF. Boahene et al. evaluated procainamide in 30 patients and propafenone in 25 patients. Ludmer et al. evaluated propafenone in 10 patients, O'Nunain et al. evaluated propafenone and flecainide in 16 patients, and Glatter et al. evaluated ibutilide in 14 patients. All studies showed the effectiveness of these agents in preexcited AF, albeit with different magnitudes of efficacy. For example, Boahene et al. showed that propafenone prolonged the shortest preexcitation refractory period (SPRR) from 215 ± 40 to 415 ± 198 ms (ΔSPRR 200 ms). Ludmer et al. showed a propafenone ΔSPRR of 75 ms, whereas O'Nunain et al. showed a propafenone ΔSPRR of 37 ms. This indicates considerable heterogeneity among the studies.

Factors contributing to the heterogeneity might include drug dose, infusion speed and time, intrinsic effective refractory period (ERP) of antegrade accessory pathway (AP), hemodynamic status, and sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, among others. The heterogeneity was more evident in the small-sample-size studies. Therefore, it is difficult to compare the effectiveness of nifekalant and other agents in treating preexcited AF. Randomized controlled studies with large samples would be valuable in determining the comparative effectiveness of these agents. One notable difference is that propafenone, flecainide, and ibutilide could completely block the accessory pathway, whereas nifekalant did not completely block the accessory pathway in the present study.

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^1167RxQw]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients with overt or intermittent WPW syndrome who were hospitalized at Henan Provincial People's Hospital and Fuwai Central China Cardiovascular Hospital for radiofrequency ablation between January 2013 and September 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The inclusion criteria were: (a) at least one documented episode of AF before ablation; (b) performance of AP ablation alone, with no catheter ablation for AF; (c) successful catheter ablation, defined as the elimination of Kent bundle conduction by demonstration of atrial and ventricular pacing even after isoproterenol infusion; and (d) available records of a post‐ablation 12‐lead ECG. The exclusion criteria were: (a) repeated ablations; (b) previous cardiac surgery, congenital heart disease, or serious valvular heart disease; and (c) thyroid dysfunction on admission (abnormal free thyroxine or thyroid‐stimulating hormone level). The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients were informed about the investigational nature of the catheter ablation procedure and provided written informed consent to undergo the procedure. The study protocol was approved by the local institutional review board. The requirement for informed consent has been waived because of the retrospective nature of the study.

- **Electrophysiological study and catheter ablation**: The patients underwent an electrophysiological study after all antiarrhythmic drugs had been discontinued for at least five half‐lives and before radiofrequency catheter ablation was performed.

### Dronedarone: an emerging agent with rhythm- and rate-controlling effects [^111hTztG]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2006). Low credibility.

Among antiarrhythmic agents, amiodarone is among the most effective, with the additional advantage of having little proarrhythmic potential. However, it can cause potentially serious extracardiac side effects, prompting the search for safer derivatives. Dronedarone, a new antiarrhythmic drug structurally related to amiodarone, lacks an iodine moiety, thus reducing amiodarone's iodine-related organ toxicity. Its methane sulfonyl group decreases lipophilicity, shortening the half-life and decreasing tissue accumulation. Electrophysiological studies show that dronedarone shares amiodarone's multichannel blocking effects, inhibiting transmembrane Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, and slow L-type calcium channels, as well as its antiadrenergic effects. Unlike amiodarone, it minimally affects thyroid receptors.

Possessing both rate- and rhythm-control properties, dronedarone has proven safe and effective in preventing the recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with persistent AF. This was demonstrated in the Dronedarone Atrial Fibrillation Study After Electrical Cardioversion (DAFNE) trial, the first prospective randomized trial to evaluate its efficacy and safety. Dronedarone has since undergone further extensive evaluation in three pivotal phase III trials. In two sister studies, the European Trial in Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter Patients Receiving Dronedarone for the Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm (EURIDIS) and the American-Australian-African Trial with Dronedarone in Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Patients for the Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm (ADONIS), dronedarone 400 mg b.i.d. showed significant efficacy.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^114t35rU]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs frequently in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, with a reported incidence of 9% to 38%. Although previous studies have reported a decreased incidence of AF after successful elimination of the accessory pathway (AP), paroxysmal AF frequently recurs in some patients with WPW syndrome despite successful AP elimination. Our recent study found that the presence of advanced interatrial block (IAB) and age greater than 50 years were associated with a higher risk of AF recurrence after AP ablation in WPW patients. For patients at high risk of AF recurrence, additional preventive interventions are required.

Currently, pulmonary vein intervention (PVI) is a widely accepted treatment for symptomatic paroxysmal AF. However, it is unknown whether additional PVI after successful AP ablation effectively prevents AF recurrence in patients with WPW syndrome, especially in patients at high risk of AF recurrence. The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the efficacy of additional PVI after AP ablation in preventing AF recurrence in all patients with WPW syndrome and paroxysmal AF, and in patients at high risk of AF recurrence, identified by advanced IAB or age greater than 50 years.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^111uBaxx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

The authors declare that all supporting data are available within the article. We conducted 3‐part prospective noninvasive and invasive electrophysiology (EP) studies to determine the efficacy of nifekalant in preexcited atrial fibrillation (AF) and to assess its mechanisms of action. All patients provided written informed consent, and the study protocol was approved by the Committee on Human Research at the Second Affiliated Hospital of NanChang University, NanChang of JiangXi Province. All antiarrhythmic medications were discontinued for at least five drug half‐lives before the study.

Fifty‐one patients (mean age 53 ± 12 years, 33 males) with sustained preexcited AF and stable hemodynamics were treated with nifekalant. Among them, 20 patients (39%) had spontaneous sustained preexcited AF (at least one hour before admission). Twelve (24%) had preexcitation and paroxysmal AF and presented with sinus rhythm and preexcitation on ECG upon admission. Nineteen patients (37%) had preexcitation and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) but no documented AF, with sinus rhythm and preexcitation on ECG on admission. The latter two groups (31 patients) were induced to generate sustained AF during EP studies. Nifekalant was administered if induced AF was sustained for 10 minutes.

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^111fi1R9]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) frequently occurs in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Although successful ablation of the accessory pathway (AP) eliminates paroxysmal AF in some patients, it can recur in others. We investigated the clinical utility of advanced interatrial block (IAB) for predicting the risk of AF recurrence in patients with verified paroxysmal AF and WPW syndrome after successful AP ablation.

This retrospective study included 103 patients (70 men, 33 women; mean age, 44 ± 16 years) with WPW syndrome who had paroxysmal AF. A resting 12-lead electrocardiogram was performed immediately after successful AP ablation to evaluate the presence of advanced IAB, which was defined as a P-wave duration of > 120 ms and biphasic morphology in the inferior leads.

During the mean follow-up period of 30.9 ± 20.0 months (range, 2–71 months), 16 patients (15.5%) developed AF recurrence. Patients with advanced IAB had significantly reduced event-free survival from AF (P < .001). Multivariate analysis identified advanced IAB (hazard ratio, 3.91; 95% CI, 1.27–11.99; p = 0.017) and age > 50 years (hazard ratio, 12.64; 95% CI, 1.33–119.75; p = 0.027) as independent predictors of AF recurrence.

In conclusion, advanced IAB was an independent predictor of AF recurrence after successful AP ablation in patients with WPW syndrome.

### Thyroid storm in a patient with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^115AateQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

A 44-year-old woman with no medical history presented to the emergency department with a two-hour history of sudden onset chest pressure, palpitations, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath. She reported a 90-pound unintentional weight loss, increased appetite, irritability, night sweats, and palpitations over the past two months. Physical examination revealed a heart rate of 269 bpm and a blood pressure of 116/94 mm Hg. Her ECG revealed a wide-complex tachycardia with right bundle branch morphology and a heart rate of 265 bpm. Intravenous adenosine was administered, resulting in the resolution of both the arrhythmia and symptoms. Subsequent ECG showed sinus tachycardia with δ waves, consistent with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Laboratory findings confirmed a thyroid storm, and treatment commenced with intravenous hydrocortisone, methimazole, metoprolol, amiodarone, and iodine drops. Graves' disease was confirmed based on the presence of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies. The patient underwent successful WPW accessory tract ablation six weeks after the initial presentation.

### Effects of dronedarone started rapidly after amiodarone discontinuation [^111DPb7Q]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Multiple studies have shown that amiodarone is effective in treating atrial fibrillation (AF) but is associated with a relatively high incidence of side effects. Due to amiodarone's long elimination half-life (20–100 days), physicians may hesitate to start other drugs until it has fully cleared.

- **Hypothesis**: A rapid switch from amiodarone to dronedarone is feasible.

- **Methods**: EURIDIS and ADONIS were double-blind, multinational, parallel-group trials comparing the efficacy and safety of dronedarone with a placebo over 12 months. This retrospective subanalysis of EURIDIS/ADONIS compared the effects of dronedarone in patients discontinuing amiodarone within 2 days before randomization ("rapid switch") with results in patients who had received no amiodarone during the 2 months preceding randomization.

- **Results**: In total, 1237 patients were enrolled ("rapid switch", n = 154; "no amiodarone", n = 1014). In both the "rapid switch" and the "no amiodarone" groups, dronedarone users had significantly lower AF recurrence than patients receiving placebo (HR = 0.64, 95% CI, 0.44–0.95; P = 0.0224 and HR = 0.79, 95% CI, 0.67–0.92; P = 0.0027, respectively). Dronedarone users had a higher incidence of bradyarrhythmic events than placebo-treated patients. A "rapid switch" from amiodarone to dronedarone was associated with a higher incidence of serious heart failure events and heart failure hospitalizations versus all other groups. Overall event rates were low, and there was no significant difference in total adverse event rates or deaths between groups.

### The Harmony trial: Combined ranolazine and dronedarone in the management of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Mechanistic and therapeutic synergism [^115ongQ9]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2015). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) arises from arrhythmogenic changes in atrial ion channels or receptors and is often accompanied by altered atrial structure. AF is typically managed with antiarrhythmic drugs, although their modest efficacy, intolerance, and safety issues limit their use. These drugs are most effective when they block multiple ion channels or receptors. We proposed that combining agents with diverse anti-AF mechanisms at reduced doses might enhance efficacy and improve tolerance and safety.

- **Methods and results**: The Harmony trial evaluated the efficacy of midrange ranolazine (750 mg BID) combined with two reduced doses of dronedarone (150 mg BID and 225 mg BID). This approach aimed to mitigate dronedarone's negative inotropic effects over 12 weeks in 134 patients with paroxysmal AF and implanted pacemakers, allowing continuous assessment of AF burden (AFB). Participants were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive either a placebo, ranolazine alone (750 mg BID), dronedarone alone (225 mg BID), or one of the drug combinations. Individual treatments with placebo or stand-alone drugs did not significantly reduce AFB. However, the combination of ranolazine 750 mg BID and dronedarone 225 mg BID reduced AFB by 59% compared to placebo (P = 0.008), whereas the ranolazine 750 mg BID and dronedarone 150 mg BID combination reduced AFB by 43% (P = 0.072). Both combinations were well-tolerated.

- **Conclusions**: The Harmony trial demonstrated that moderate-dose ranolazine combined with reduced-dose dronedarone achieved a synergistic reduction in AFB with good tolerance and safety in the study population.

### Cardiovascular disease in the young council's science and clinical education lifelong learning committee: Year in review [^113bovY4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

This year, three articles advanced our understanding of Wolf-Parkinson-White and Brugada syndromes, challenging existing knowledge and provoking new thoughts about paradigms for treatment and management of these diseases. Practice guidelines for management of Wolf-Parkinson-White in children have largely been based on the assumption that the risk of sudden death is both predictable and ascertainable. A large retrospective multicenter international study of 912 children with Wolf-Parkinson-White provided evidence to suggest that, while the risk of sudden death in children remains low, the ability to identify those at highest risk remains difficult. These findings raise questions about future management recommendations and will likely affect the manner by which physicians counsel patients in the future.

Brugada syndrome has classically been considered a primary ion channel disorder. Although small case studies had previously suggested ablation as a curative therapy, multiple studies this year provide further evidence that epicardial ablation may successfully treat ventricular arrhythmias associated with Brugada syndrome in symptomatic adults. While long-term follow-up following ablation is lacking and studies in children have not been performed, these preliminary results provide new insights into this disease. Regardless of whether ablation is found to be a treatment option for children with symptomatic Brugada syndrome, the manner in which we approach this disease and counsel patients regarding management will evolve.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^115YJHzp]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Although successful ablation of the accessory pathway (AP) eliminates atrial fibrillation (AF) in some patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and paroxysmal AF, in other patients it can recur. Whether adding pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) after successful AP ablation effectively prevents AF recurrence in patients with WPW syndrome is unknown.

We retrospectively studied 160 patients (102 men, 58 women; mean age, 46 ± 14 years) with WPW syndrome and paroxysmal AF who underwent AP ablation. Of these, 103 (64.4%) underwent only AP ablation (AP group) and 57 (35.6%) underwent AP ablation plus PVI (AP + PVI group). Advanced interatrial block (IAB) was defined as a P-wave duration of > 120 ms and biphasic (±) morphology in the inferior leads, as determined by 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG).

During the mean follow-up period of 30.9 ± 9.2 months (range, 3–36 months), 22 patients (13.8%) developed AF recurrence. The recurrence rate did not differ between patients in the AP + PVI group and those in the AP group (15.5% vs 10.5%, respectively; p = 0.373). Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses showed that PVI was not associated with the risk of AF recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.26–1.68; p = 0.380). However, in WPW patients with advanced IAB, the recurrence rate was significantly lower in the AP + PVI group compared to the AP group (90% vs 33.3%, respectively; p = 0.032).

PVI after successful AP ablation significantly reduced the AF recurrence rate in WPW patients with advanced IAB. Screening of a resting 12-lead ECG is recommended for identifying candidates for this combined intervention strategy.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^115gQTAx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

Nifekalant, initially named MS‐551 in Japan, is a pure class 3 antiarrhythmic drug that is highly selective for blocking the rapid component of the delayed‐rectifier potassium currents without affecting the inward sodium and calcium currents or β‐adrenergic activity. Nifekalant prolongs the effective refractory period (ERP) of ventricular and atrial myocytes, exerts antiarrhythmic effects, and decreases the defibrillation threshold. Increasing clinical data indicate that nifekalant is an effective and safe drug in the treatment of refractory ventricular arrhythmias, especially in patients with idiopathic left ventricular fibrillation (ILVF). Nifekalant is also recommended by the European Resuscitation Council Guidelines and International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. More recently, nifekalant has been used in the treatment of atrial arrhythmia and cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter. However, the potential utility of nifekalant in the treatment of preexcited AF has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to assess the electrophysiological and clinical effects of nifekalant in patients with preexcited AF.

### Dronedarone versus sotalol in patients with atrial fibrillation: A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^1151aHDw]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice and remains one of the major causes of stroke, transient ischemic attack, and heart failure. Despite improvements in rhythm control interventions, there is still a considerable risk of mortality, AF-related stroke, frequent hospitalization, and complications due to hemodynamic abnormalities and thromboembolic events in patients with AF.

The main antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) for rhythm control and prevention of AF recurrence include Vaughan-Williams class III drugs: amiodarone, dofetilide, dronedarone, sotalol, and class Ic drugs: flecainide and propafenone. Reservations exist about the use of amiodarone as a long-term therapy option due to well-recognized extracardiac side effects. Similarly, dofetilide has extensive contraindications due to a relatively high risk of torsades de pointes.

Dronedarone and sotalol are both class III agents (with antiadrenergic effects) which have demonstrated similar efficacy, and although guideline and label recommendations emphasizing safety considerations vary for the two agents according to clinical circumstances of AF patient populations, United States (US) and European Union (EU) physician adherence to guideline recommendations for these and other AADs was shown in a recent study to be suboptimal. Direct comparisons between dronedarone and sotalol are limited; however, some evidence has shown that sotalol use is associated with a higher risk of ventricular proarrhythmia and increased overall mortality.

### Clinical profile and management of Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome and asymptomatic pre-excitation carriers in Africa: A multicenter Pan-African registry from 17 countries [^116ZxthC]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). High credibility.

Data are scarce regarding Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) and asymptomatic pre-excitation in Africa. This study aimed to understand the approaches utilized in Africa for the diagnosis and management of both symptomatic and asymptomatic ventricular pre-excitation.

- **Methods**: The prospective study was conducted in 20 centers located in 17 countries spanning all areas of Africa. Participants included those with ventricular pre-excitation patterns. The data collected included symptoms, locations of accessory pathways (AP) and tachyarrhythmia, risk stratification, as well as acute and long-term management. In addition, the clinical effectiveness of the centers and the impact of socioeconomic and health metrics on these treatment approaches were assessed.

- **Results**: Among 541 participants, 93% were diagnosed with WPW syndrome, with orthodromic atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT) being the most prevalent arrhythmia, affecting 55% of the cases. Approximately 30% of patients in Africa, except for the southern region, received intravenous amiodarone as the first-choice drug for orthodromic AVRT, while adenosine was the drug of choice in the southern region. Electrical cardioversion was the first-line treatment for pre-excited atrial fibrillation and antidromic AVRT across all of Africa. Radiofrequency ablation (RF) was the first long-term therapy option for 88% of patients in all African regions, unlike western and central Africa where it was implemented for less than 30% of patients (p < 0.001).

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^1173fpR8]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

The presence of advanced interatrial block (IAB) may be used to predict future recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) after successful accessory pathway (AP) ablation in patients with verified paroxysmal AF and Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome.

### Atrial fibrillation with broad QRS tachycardia and undiagnosed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas in a pediatric patient [^111w8og3]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

A 10-year-old girl presented to the emergency department of a regional hospital with one episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Postictal monitoring followed by a 12-lead electrocardiogram showed fast atrial fibrillation with intermittent wide QRS regular tachycardia. Immediately following this, her rhythm changed to wide QRS irregular tachycardia without hemodynamic compromise. She was suspected to have ventricular tachycardia and was treated with intravenous amiodarone, which resulted in cardioversion to sinus rhythm. A subsequent electrocardiogram in sinus rhythm showed typical features of manifest Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) accessory pathway.

This case illustrates the diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas in patients with atrial fibrillation, wide QRS tachycardia, and undiagnosed WPW syndrome with antidromic conduction of atrial arrhythmias through the accessory pathway. Furthermore, this case demonstrates that undiagnosed wide QRS tachycardias need to be treated with drugs acting on the accessory pathway, thus keeping in mind underlying WPW syndrome as a possibility to avoid potentially catastrophic events.

### Risk of malignant arrhythmias in initially symptomatic patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: results of a prospective long-term electrophysiological follow-up study [^112Ga2h4]. Circulation (2012). High credibility.

The available amount of detailed long-term data in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is limited, and no prospective electrophysiological studies looking at predictors of malignant arrhythmia are available.

- **Methods and results**: Among 8575 symptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White patients with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia referred for electrophysiological test, 369 (mean age, 23 ± 12.5 years) declined catheter ablation and were followed up. The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate over a 5-year follow-up the predictors and characteristics of patients who develop malignant arrhythmias. After a mean follow-up of 42.1 ± 10 months, malignant arrhythmias developed in 29 patients (mean age, 13.9 ± 5.6 years; 26 male), resulting in presyncope/syncope (25 patients), hemodynamic collapse (3 patients), or cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation (1 patient).

Of the remaining 340 patients, 168 (mean age, 34.2 ± 9.0 years) remained asymptomatic up to 5 years, and 172 (mean age, 13.6 ± 5.1 years) had benign recurrence, including sustained atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (132 patients) or atrial fibrillation (40 patients). Compared with the group with no malignant arrhythmias, the group with malignant arrhythmias showed shorter accessory-pathway effective refractory period (P < 0.001) and more often exhibited multiple accessory pathways (P < 0.001), and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia triggering sustained pre-excited atrial fibrillation was more frequently inducible (P < 0.001).

Multivariable analysis demonstrated that short accessory-pathway effective refractory periods were significant predictors of the development of malignant arrhythmias in these patients.

### Surgical treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Resuscitation of a forgotten technique [^112x7AwZ]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Low credibility.

The presurgical history involves a 27-year-old man with a history of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and two prior unsuccessful catheter ablation attempts. He presented with cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation and was successfully resuscitated. Following recovery, his ejection fraction was noted to be 20%, with an electrocardiogram showing a short PR interval and a delta wave (Figure 1, A). Electrophysiology mapping indicated a posterior-septal accessory pathway. Multiple attempts to ablate the accessory pathway endocardially and via the middle cardiac vein were unsuccessful. An additional attempt at catheter ablation using both endocardial and epicardial mapping was also unsuccessful. In view of the resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation due to rapid atrial fibrillation conducting rapidly over the accessory pathway, the patient was referred for surgical ablation.

- **A**: Preoperative electrocardiogram showing a short PR interval and preexcitation (delta wave).
- **B**: Five-year postoperative electrocardiogram: Normal PR interval and absence of preexcitation.

### Long term risk of Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern and syndrome [^112Tj9wj]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

For years, conventional wisdom has held that patients with asymptomatic ventricular pre-excitation (asymptomatic WPW or WPW pattern) were at low risk for adverse outcomes. This assumption has been challenged more recently in a number of observational/natural history studies as well as in prospective trials in which patients were more aggressively studied via invasive electrophysiology study (EPS) and more aggressively treated, in some cases, with pre-emptive catheter ablation, despite the lack of symptoms.

In sum, the data do not definitively support one approach (early, upstream EPS and/or ablation) versus the other (watchful waiting with close monitoring). The most recent pediatric and adult guidelines reflect this ambiguity with a broad spectrum of approaches endorsed.

### The use of sugammadex in a pregnant patient with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^1149kFR6]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a rare pre-excitation syndrome which develops when atrioventricular conduction occurs through a pathological accessory pathway known as the bundle of Kent instead of the atrioventricular node, resulting in tachycardia. Patients with WPW syndrome may experience various symptoms including mild-to-moderate chest disease, palpitations, hypotension, and severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction. These patients are most often symptomatic due to cardiac arrhythmias.

In this case report, we present an uneventful anesthetic management of a pregnant patient with WPW syndrome undergoing cesarean delivery. A 23-year-old American Society of Anesthesiologists class 2 pregnant patient was diagnosed with WPW syndrome. Her preoperative 12-lead electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm at 82 beats per minute, a delta wave, and a short PR interval. After an uneventful surgery, sugammadex 2 mg/kg was administered as a reversal agent instead of neostigmine, and then she was discharged to her obstetrics service.

Serious hemodynamic disorders may occur in patients with WPW syndrome due to the development of fatal arrhythmias. Neostigmine used as a reversal agent in general anesthesia can trigger such fatal arrhythmias by altering cardiac conduction. We believe that sugammadex, which is safely used in many areas of clinical practice, can also be used for patients diagnosed with WPW syndrome.

### PACES/HRS expert consensus statement on the management of the asymptomatic young patient with a Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW, ventricular preexcitation) electrocardiographic pattern: Developed in partnership between the Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society (PACES) and the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS). Endorsed by the governing bodies of PACES, HRS, the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), the American Heart Association (AHA), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the Canadian Heart Rhythm Society (CHRS) [^113hJ2ZS]. Heart Rhythm (2012). High credibility.

The disease Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome can be associated with various symptoms such as syncope, pre-syncope, delta wave, palpitations, paradoxic split of the second heart sound, increased QRS duration, chest pain, decreased PR duration, dizziness, lightheadedness, and the WPW triad.

### Safety and efficacy of flecainide in the treatment of symptomatic children with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^113hx9e2]. Pediatric Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Sudden cardiac death may occur in children with both symptomatic and asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPWS). Symptomatic patients are usually treated with antiarrhythmic drugs until ablation of an accessory pathway (AP) can be performed. The objective of this study was to review the safety and efficacy of flecainide in the treatment of children with symptomatic WPWS.

Twenty-two children (14 male) with WPWS and without structural heart disease were studied. AP location was determined by electrophysiological testing or a 12-lead electrocardiogram tracing. Symptomatic children, who experienced frequent palpitations or episodes of supraventricular tachycardia, received flecainide. Patients were followed up for an average of 3.4 years until ablation of AP.

Eighteen children reported clinical symptoms at diagnosis, but only 13 initiated treatment during a period of 16.23 months (range 1–55). Flecainide was effective in all patients: seven became asymptomatic, and six experienced isolated episodes of palpitations. One child experienced hair loss as a side effect.

AP location was as follows: left free wall (n = 7), right free wall (n = 4), posteroseptal (n = 8), and anteroseptal (n = 4). Ablation was performed without complications in 13 children. Symptomatic WPWS in children can be treated safely and efficiently with flecainide. It represents a good alternative therapy until AP ablation can be performed.

### Efficacy and safety of dronedarone in patients previously treated with other antiarrhythmic agents [^117XL4JD]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Currently available antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) for the prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) suffer from incomplete efficacy and poor tolerability.

- **Hypothesis**: Dronedarone could represent an effective and safe option in patients previously treated with AADs, especially class Ic AADs and sotalol.

- **Methods**: Retrospective analysis of two double-blind, parallel-group trials (EURIDIS [European trial in atrial fibrillation or flutter patients receiving dronedarone for the maintenance of sinus rhythm] and ADONIS [American-Australian-African trial with dronedarone in atrial fibrillation or flutter patients for the maintenance of sinus rhythm]) comparing the efficacy and safety of dronedarone with placebo over 12 months. The primary end point was AF/AFL recurrence in patients previously treated with another AAD that was discontinued for any reason prior to randomization.

- **Results**: In patients previously treated with any AADs, dronedarone decreased the risk of AF recurrence by 30.4% compared to placebo (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.59–0.82; P < 0.001). In patients previously treated with a class Ic agent, dronedarone decreased the risk of recurrence by 31.4% (HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.53–0.89; P = 0.004). In contrast, in patients previously treated with sotalol, dronedarone showed a trend toward a decrease in the risk of recurrence (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.67–1.11; P = 0.244). Dronedarone was equally effective irrespective of whether class Ic or sotalol was stopped due to lack of efficacy or adverse events (AEs). Discontinuation rates were similar.

### Occurrence of intermittent Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome during intravenous sedation [^1136LByR]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with intermittent Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, characterized by the intermittent loss of delta waves, can exhibit occasional conduction through the accessory pathway. WPW syndrome frequently causes paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation. However, preoperative identification of these abnormalities may be challenging due to their intermittent nature. We report a case where exogenous epinephrine administration and an autonomic imbalance may have triggered the abrupt occurrence and disappearance of delta waves.

### Identification of a gene responsible for familial Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^1118xBuA]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, with a prevalence in Western countries of 1.5 to 3.1 per 1000 persons, causes considerable morbidity and may lead to sudden death. We identified two families in which the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome segregated as an autosomal dominant disorder.

- **Methods**: We studied 70 members of the two families (57 in Family 1 and 13 in Family 2). The subjects underwent 12-lead electrocardiography and two-dimensional echocardiography. Genotyping mapped the gene responsible to 7q34-q36, a locus previously identified as responsible for an inherited form of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Candidate genes were identified, sequenced, and analyzed in normal and affected family members to identify the disease-causing gene.

- **Results**: A total of 31 members (23 from Family 1 and 8 from Family 2) had the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Affected members of both families had ventricular preexcitation with conduction abnormalities and cardiac hypertrophy. The maximal combined two-point lod score was 9.82 at a distance of 5 cM from marker D7S636, which confirmed the linkage of the gene in both families to 7q34-q36. Haplotype analysis indicated that there were no alleles in common in the two families at this locus, suggesting that the two families do not have a common founder. We identified a missense mutation in the gene that encodes the gamma2 regulatory subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (PRKAG2). The mutation results in the substitution of glutamine for arginine at residue 302 in the protein.
