## Question

Viral sinusitis treatments

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatments for viral rhinosinusitis, with explicit stepwise thinking and self-verification language preserved and enhanced. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define viral rhinosinusitis and distinguish it from bacterial disease. Then, I should verify the natural history and expected trajectory to set expectations. Next, I will review core management principles, especially why antibiotics are not indicated. After that, I should examine symptomatic therapies with attention to evidence quality and safety. Finally, I will consider special populations, red flags, and a practical follow-up plan, while double-checking areas where evidence is limited or evolving.

> Let me first confirm the definition and diagnostic framework. Viral rhinosinusitis is an acute inflammatory process of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses caused by a viral upper respiratory infection, typically lasting up to 4 weeks, with symptoms peaking around day 3 and resolving within 10–14 days; clinically, it presents with cloudy or colored nasal drainage plus nasal obstruction and/or facial pain-pressure-fullness, and importantly, purulence alone does not distinguish viral from bacterial disease, so I need to be careful not to overcall bacterial infection based on color alone [^116pDK81] [^114hjmjk] [^116dMDhJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify how to separate viral from bacterial disease at the bedside. The key discriminator is time course and trajectory: if symptoms are less than 10 days and not worsening, viral is most likely; if symptoms persist without improvement for 10 days or more, or if there is a "double-worsening" pattern after initial improvement, that pattern supports acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and warrants consideration of antibiotics, though I should remember that even with these criteria, culture-proven bacterial disease is present in only about 60% of cases, underscoring the need for restraint early on [^113CWCdx] [^114jTpcF] [^114hjmjk].

> I need to check the natural history to set expectations. Most adults experience 2–5 episodes of viral rhinosinusitis per year, and secondary bacterial infection complicates only about 0.5–2% of these events; symptoms typically peak by day 3 and then decline, resolving within 10–14 days, so reassurance and watchful waiting are appropriate for the majority of patients who are clinically stable and improving [^116yhLrd] [^116dMDhJ].

> Next, I should review core management principles. Antibiotics are not recommended for viral rhinosinusitis because they are ineffective against viruses and do not provide direct symptom relief; management is supportive, with goals of reducing symptom burden, maintaining hydration, and avoiding unnecessary medications, and I should explicitly counsel patients about this to reduce inappropriate antibiotic requests [^116yhLrd] [^115hCaj7].

> Let me consider symptomatic therapy, starting with analgesics. Non-narcotic options such as acetaminophen or NSAIDs can be used for pain, headache, and malaise; acetaminophen may modestly reduce nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea, whereas NSAIDs improve malaise, sneezing, headache, and otalgia but do not reduce nasal discharge, and I should use caution with NSAIDs in older adults due to gastrointestinal and renal risks [^116yhLrd].

> Now, nasal saline irrigation. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence. The Cochrane review suggests limited but acceptable evidence that saline irrigation can modestly improve symptoms and may reduce time off work, with higher-volume devices possibly superior; adverse effects are generally minor, though some patients experience discomfort, so I should tailor device and volume to tolerance and reinforce technique to maximize benefit and minimize irritation [^116JrZPA] [^116yhLrd].

> I will now examine intranasal corticosteroids. Guidelines allow considering topical intranasal steroids as an option for symptomatic relief in viral rhinosinusitis, with an estimated number needed to treat around 13 and possibly greater benefit with longer courses and higher doses; however, I should confirm that evidence quality is limited and that shared decision-making is appropriate, especially in patients with a history of allergic rhinitis where benefit may be more plausible [^113tMAcp] [^116yhLrd].

> But wait, what about decongestants and antihistamines. I should double-check the current stance. The FDA advisory committee discouraged oral phenylephrine as a nasal decongestant due to lack of efficacy; short courses of topical oxymetazoline up to 3–5 days can be considered with strict rebound-congestion counseling, and pseudoephedrine may be an alternative in appropriate patients, though I must screen for cardiovascular contraindications; first-generation antihistamines show no clinically meaningful benefit on obstruction or rhinorrhea and should generally be avoided, especially in older adults due to anticholinergic effects [^116yhLrd].

> Let me synthesize a practical, evidence-aligned regimen. For most adults with mild to moderate viral rhinosinusitis, I would recommend analgesics as needed, isotonic or hypertonic saline irrigation once or twice daily, and consider a short course of a topical intranasal corticosteroid if symptoms are bothersome or allergic features are present; I would avoid routine decongestants and antihistamines unless there is a compelling, individualized rationale and counsel on rebound risk and sedation concerns [^116yhLrd] [^113tMAcp].

> I should confirm red flags and when to escalate evaluation. Persistent symptoms beyond 10 days without improvement, new fever or facial pain after initial improvement, severe unilateral facial pain with fever, periorbital edema, proptosis, cranial neuropathies, or altered mental status should prompt reassessment for complications or alternative diagnoses and may warrant imaging and specialty referral; in these scenarios, contrast-enhanced CT is appropriate when complications are suspected, whereas routine imaging is not recommended for uncomplicated cases [^115u5tC1] [^116dMDhJ].

> Next, I should review special populations. In older adults, I need to ensure cautious use of NSAIDs and first-generation antihistamines due to adverse event risk, and in patients with comorbid asthma or allergic rhinitis, intranasal corticosteroids may be more beneficial; in pregnancy, I should preferentially use acetaminophen, saline irrigation, and consider topical steroids if needed, avoiding systemic decongestants and first-generation antihistamines when possible [^116yhLrd] [^113tMAcp].

> Hold on, I should verify the follow-up cadence. If symptoms are improving, no routine follow-up is needed; if symptoms persist beyond 10 days or worsen at any time, I should reassess to distinguish evolving bacterial disease or an alternative diagnosis, and if bacterial criteria are met, discuss watchful waiting versus antibiotics with shared decision-making, emphasizing that many patients improve without antibiotics and that first-line therapy, when chosen, should be narrow-spectrum [^115hCaj7] [^116dMDhJ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought imaging might help distinguish viral from bacterial disease early on, but I should correct that. Imaging cannot reliably distinguish viral from bacterial rhinosinusitis because mucosal thickening and opacification are common in viral URIs; therefore, imaging should be reserved for suspected complications or alternative diagnoses, not for routine evaluation of uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis [^115u5tC1] [^115PcCWY].

> Finally, I need to ensure antibiotic stewardship messaging is explicit. Antibiotics are frequently overprescribed for viral respiratory infections, including sinusitis, and eliminating unnecessary antibiotic use for viral URIs is a major stewardship target; reinforcing the viral nature, expected course, and lack of antibiotic benefit in viral rhinosinusitis helps reduce resistance and adverse effects without compromising outcomes [^113n6h24] [^1179AaFn].

Viral sinusitis is managed with **supportive care only** [^116yhLrd] because antibiotics are ineffective and not recommended [^115hCaj7]. Use **analgesics, intranasal corticosteroids, and saline irrigation** for symptom relief [^113tMAcp]; avoid antibiotics unless bacterial infection is confirmed or strongly suspected [^111jPD58]. Most cases resolve within 10–14 days [^116yhLrd]; **seek care if symptoms persist beyond 10 days**, worsen, or severe complications develop [^116dMDhJ].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Viral sinusitis typically presents with the following **symptoms**:

- **Nasal congestion**: stuffy or blocked nose [^111jPD58].

- **Nasal discharge**: cloudy or colored (yellow/green) [^111jPD58].

- **Facial pain or pressure**: discomfort in the face, head, or around the eyes [^111jPD58].

- **Other symptoms**: sneezing, sore throat, cough, mild fever, and general malaise [^116yhLrd].

Diagnosis is primarily **clinical**, based on symptom duration and progression [^111jPD58]. Viral sinusitis is likely if symptoms are present for less than 10 days without worsening, whereas bacterial sinusitis is suspected if symptoms persist beyond 10 days or worsen after initial improvement ("double worsening") [^113CWCdx].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Supportive care

Supportive care is the cornerstone of viral sinusitis management, aiming to **alleviate symptoms** and improve patient comfort [^116yhLrd]. Recommended supportive measures include:

- **Analgesics**: Acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain and fever relief [^116yhLrd].

- **Nasal saline irrigation**: Regular use of saline sprays or rinses to reduce nasal congestion and improve mucociliary clearance [^notfound].

- **Hydration**: Adequate fluid intake to maintain mucosal hydration.

- **Rest**: Sufficient rest to support immune function and recovery.

---

### Pharmacological interventions

Pharmacological treatments may be considered for symptomatic relief, but their use should be **carefully evaluated** for efficacy and safety:

- **Intranasal corticosteroids**: May reduce nasal inflammation and congestion, particularly in patients with a history of allergic rhinitis [^113tMAcp] [^113SK6oh].

- **Topical decongestants**: Short-term use (≤ 3 days) of oxymetazoline may provide temporary relief but should be avoided beyond three days due to the risk of rebound congestion [^116yhLrd].

- **Antihistamines**: Generally not recommended due to limited efficacy in viral sinusitis and potential side effects such as sedation and anticholinergic effects [^116yhLrd].

---

### Antibiotics

Antibiotics are **not recommended** for viral sinusitis because they are ineffective against viral infections and do not shorten illness duration or reduce symptom severity [^116yhLrd]. Their use should be reserved for confirmed or strongly suspected bacterial sinusitis, typically characterized by persistent symptoms beyond 10 days, severe onset with high fever and purulent discharge, or worsening symptoms after initial improvement [^113CWCdx] [^115izRZV].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patient education is essential to **manage expectations**, reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, and promote adherence to supportive care measures. Key educational points include:

- **Natural course**: Explain that viral sinusitis typically resolves within 10–14 days without antibiotics [^116yhLrd].

- **Symptom management**: Provide clear instructions on the use of analgesics, nasal saline irrigation, and hydration [^113tMAcp].

- **Warning signs**: Educate patients on signs of bacterial infection or complications, such as persistent symptoms beyond 10 days, high fever, severe facial pain, or visual disturbances, which require medical evaluation [^116dMDhJ].

---

## Potential complications

Although viral sinusitis is generally self-limiting, **complications can occur**, particularly if secondary bacterial infection develops or if the patient is immunocompromised. Potential complications include:

- **Acute bacterial sinusitis**: Secondary bacterial infection requiring antibiotic therapy [^notfound].

- **Chronic sinusitis**: Persistent inflammation lasting beyond 12 weeks [^116pDK81].

- **Orbital or intracranial complications**: Rare but serious complications such as orbital cellulitis, abscess formation, or meningitis [^111khKvo].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies focus on **reducing exposure to viral pathogens** and supporting overall immune health:

- **Hand hygiene**: Regular handwashing to reduce viral transmission [^notfound].

- **Avoidance of allergens**: Minimize exposure to known allergens to reduce nasal inflammation [^112gQ14r].

- **Vaccination**: Annual influenza vaccination may reduce the risk of viral upper respiratory infections [^notfound].

---

## Current research and emerging therapies

Recent research has explored novel therapeutic approaches, including **antiviral agents** and herbal remedies. A randomized controlled trial investigating the phytomedicine **ELOM-080** demonstrated significant symptom improvement and reduced viral load in acute viral rhinosinusitis, suggesting potential adjunctive therapeutic options [^112DvJcv]. However, further research is needed to validate these findings and establish **standardized treatment protocols**.

---

Viral sinusitis is a self-limiting condition managed primarily with supportive care, including analgesics, nasal saline irrigation, and patient education. Antibiotics are **not recommended** unless bacterial infection is confirmed or strongly suspected. Most cases resolve within 10–14 days, but persistent or severe symptoms require medical evaluation to exclude complications or bacterial infection [^116yhLrd].

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^115hCaj7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Table 5 — Patient information sheet on diagnosis of acute sinusitis — defines key diagnostic features and distinguishes viral from bacterial illness for adults. Sinusitis, also called rhinosinusitis, affects about 1 in 8 adults annually. Acute sinusitis is present with up to 4 weeks of cloudy or colored nasal drainage plus one or both of the following: a stuffy, congested, or blocked nose, and pain, pressure or fullness in the face, head, or around the eyes. Acute viral sinusitis is likely if illness has been present less than 10 days without worsening, whereas acute bacterial sinusitis is likely when there is no improvement within 10 days of getting sick or when symptoms worsen within 10 days after beginning to get better. Because treatment differs by cause, acute viral sinusitis does not benefit from antibiotics, but some patients with acute bacterial sinusitis may get better faster with an antibiotic.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis [^115vXTiX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing sinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. Sinusitis affects 1 in 7 adults in the United States, resulting in about 31 million individuals diagnosed each year. Since sinusitis almost always involves the nasal cavity, the term rhinosinusitis is preferred. The guideline target patient is aged 18 years or older with uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with rhinosinusitis would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with sinusitis.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, reduce inappropriate use of radiographic imaging, and promote appropriate use of ancillary tests that include nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. In creating this guideline the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of allergy, emergency medicine, family medicine, health insurance, immunology, infectious disease, internal medicine, medical informatics, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pulmonology, and radiology.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that 1) clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions, and a clinician should diagnose ABRS when (a) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis are present 10 days or more beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or (b) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening), and 2) the management of ABRS should include an assessment of pain, with analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The panel made a recommendation against radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for acute rhinosinusitis, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected. The panel made recommendations that 1) if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin as first-line therapy for most adults, 2) if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications, 3) clinicians should distinguish chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms, 4) clinicians should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis for factors that modify management, such as allergic rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, ciliary dyskinesia, and anatomic variation, 5) the clinician should corroborate a diagnosis and/or investigate for underlying causes of CRS and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, 6) the clinician should obtain computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 7) clinicians should educate/counsel patients with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis regarding control measures. The panel offered as options that 1) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing viral rhinosinusitis, 2) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing ABRS, 3) observation without use of antibiotics is an option for selected adults with uncomplicated ABRS who have mild illness (mild pain and temperature < 38.3 degrees C or 101 degrees F) and assurance of follow-up, 4) the clinician may obtain nasal endoscopy in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 5) the clinician may obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis.

Disclaimer

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance for managing adults with rhinosinusitis. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### Microbiology and antimicrobial management of sinusitis [^112B1T7R]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The growing resistance to antimicrobial agents of all respiratory tract bacterial pathogens has made the management of sinusitis more difficult. The upper respiratory tract including the nasopharynx serves as the reservoir for pathogenic bacteria that can cause respiratory infections including sinusitis. During a viral respiratory infection, potential pathogens can relocate from the nasopharynx into the sinus cavity, causing sinusitis. Establishment of the correct microbiology of all forms of sinusitis is of primary importance, because it can serve as a guide for choosing the adequate antimicrobial therapy. This article summarizes the current information regarding the microbiology of all forms of sinusitis and approaches to antimicrobial therapy.

### Viral respiratory infection therapy: historical perspectives and current trials [^111XSQGi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Attempts to relieve the misery of the common cold have been made since long before current understanding of its viral origin. Although current symptomatic therapies provide some relief, any effective treatment must incorporate an antiviral to address the infection. Symptom production is related not only to viral cytopathic effect but also to the early activation of several inflammatory pathways. Antiviral treatment alone may not be able to prevent these events. Combining an antiviral with selected therapeutic agents that block these inflammatory pathways has been shown to improve the effectiveness of cold treatment. Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment combined with regular dosing until symptoms subside appears to be the most effective treatment strategy to maximize therapeutic outcomes. This strategy reduces viral shedding in nasal fluid, provides treatment for the period of maximum symptom burden, and may reduce the frequency and severity of the sinus disease that accompanies colds.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^111qyTS8]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic therapy for acute bacterial sinusitis — rationale and indications note that "In the United States, antibiotics are prescribed for 82% of children with acute sinusitis", and support treatment based on recovery of bacteria "in high density (≥ 10^4 colony-forming units/mL) in 70% of maxillary sinus aspirates obtained from children with a clinical syndrome characterized by persistent nasal discharge, daytime cough, or both". Severe-onset cases are presumed bacterial because "a temperature of at least 39°C/102.2°F coexisting for at least 3 consecutive days with purulent nasal discharge is not consistent with the well-documented pattern of acute viral URI", and "children with worsening-course acute bacterial sinusitis have a clinical course that is also not consistent with the steady improvement that characterizes an uncomplicated viral URI"; additionally, "In both guidelines, however, children presenting with severe or worsening illness (which was not defined explicitly in the 2001 guideline) are to receive antibiotic therapy".

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^113CWCdx]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — Statement 1a (differential diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis) states that clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions. A clinician should diagnose ABRS when symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis (purulent nasal drainage accompanied by nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure-fullness, or both) persist without evidence of improvement for at least 10 days beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or when symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening). This is a strong recommendation based on diagnostic studies with minor limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile notes a quality improvement opportunity to avoid inappropriate use of antibiotics for presumed viral infections, aggregate evidence quality Grade B and Level of Confidence in Evidence Medium, a benefits-harm assessment of preponderance of benefit over harm, and harms including the risk of misclassifying acute bacterial rhinosinusitis as viral, or vice-versa, with intentional vagueness and role of patient preferences listed as none.

### Should we prescribe antibiotics to this patient with persistent upper respiratory symptoms? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^115izRZV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently published advice for high-value care on the appropriate use of antibiotics for acute respiratory tract infections. They conducted a narrative literature review of evidence for antibiotic use in this setting that included recent clinical guidelines from professional societies supplemented by randomized, controlled trials; meta-analyses; and systematic reviews. They concluded that clinicians should reserve antibiotic treatment for acute rhinosinusitis in patients with persistent symptoms for more than 10 days, high fever and purulent nasal discharge or facial pain lasting for at least 3 consecutive days, or worsening symptoms after a typical viral illness that lasted 5 days and had initially improved ("double-sickening"). In this Grand Rounds, 2 prominent clinicians debate whether to initiate antibiotic treatment in a 62-year-old man with a history of recurrent sinusitis who presents with persistent upper respiratory symptoms. They review the data on which the ACP/CDC recommendations are based and discuss the potential benefits and risks, as well as the challenges and controversies, of prescribing antibiotic therapy in this setting.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^116yhLrd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — viral rhinosinusitis (VRS) supportive care and natural history note that acute VRS is estimated to occur from 2 to 5 times per year in the average adult, secondary bacterial infection is believed to complicate only 0.5% to 2.0% of these events, and symptoms typically peak within 3 days then decline and resolve within 10 to 14 days. Management is symptomatic: antibiotics are not recommended for treating VRS as antibiotics are ineffective for viral illness and do not provide direct symptom relief, and palliative medications — non-narcotic analgesics (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, acetaminophen), nasal saline, decongestants, antihistamines, mucolytics, cough suppressants, and topical or oral corticosteroids — may be used alone or in varying combinations for symptom relief. Acetaminophen may help relieve nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea but does not alleviate other viral symptoms, whereas nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents do not improve nasal discharge but improve malaise, sneezing, headache, and otalgia, and should be used with caution in older adults. Nasal saline may be palliative and cleansing with low risk of adverse reactions, with minor improvements in nasal symptom scores reported and a meta-analysis indicating that higher volume irrigations may be superior. For decongestants, in 2023 the FDA advisory committee discouraged the use of oral phenylephrine as a nasal decongestant; use of up to 3 to 5 days of topical oxymetazoline may be beneficial but clinicians should warn patients against paradoxical rebound congestion with use greater than 3 days; pseudoephedrine could be considered beyond this, although recent evidence is lacking and the patient should be counseled regarding contraindications of elevated blood pressure and heart rate. Commonly used antihistamines show no clinically significant effect on nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea or sneezing, and first-generation varieties should be avoided in older adults. While not supported by a large body of evidence, topical corticosteroids in VRS is an option for symptomatic relief, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 13 and greater effect with longer courses and higher doses. Diagnostic caveats include that nasal purulence alone does not indicate a bacterial infection.

### Acute community-acquired bacterial sinusitis: continuing challenges and current management [^112SaKn8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Acute sinusitis is one of the most common infections seen in general clinical practice. The most common cause of acute sinusitis is viral; however, many patients receive a prescription for an antibiotic. Such injudicious prescribing habits have a major impact on health care costs, contribute to the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant strains of common respiratory pathogens, and reflect many of the challenges in differentiating viral and bacterial disease. Sinus puncture and culture of the aspirate, the diagnostic reference standard in the research setting, are not appropriate for routine clinical practice. However, certain clinical signs and symptoms that do not improve or that worsen after 7–10 days are currently accepted criteria for diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis. Accurate diagnosis can select patients who would benefit most from antimicrobial use. Antimicrobial agents should be selected on the basis of local resistance patterns, and their spectrum of activity should cover the common bacterial pathogens, including resistant strains.

### Viral respiratory infections in association with asthma and sinusitis: a review [^111tCcJB]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Viral respiratory infections (VRIs) commonly precede asthma exacerbations in both children and adults. Likewise, VRIs may affect the paranasal sinuses, predisposing infected individuals to the development of subsequent acute bacterial sinusitis. This article discusses the role that viruses play in both the development of asthma and in acute asthma exacerbations. Mechanisms by which viral infections provoke asthma exacerbations are reviewed, and treatment of such episodes is discussed. The pathogenesis of sinusitis and association with VRIs is reviewed along with treatment recommendations.

Data Sources

Relevant articles in the medical literature were reviewed with sources including randomized, controlled clinical trials, review articles, epidemiologic studies, and standard textbooks in allergy and immunology.

Conclusions

This review highlights the prominent role that viral pathogens (especially rhinovirus) play in exacerbation of asthma and in the development of sinus disease. The specific mechanisms whereby viral infection leads to an acute asthma exacerbation or to subsequent bacterial sinusitis are described. Treatment options are outlined including the potential future application of antiviral compounds.

### Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections during influenza seasons [^113n6h24]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are targets for improving antibiotic stewardship for outpatient acute respiratory infections?

Findings

Among 14 987 outpatients with acute respiratory infections enrolled in this cohort study during influenza seasons, 41% were prescribed antibiotics, 41% of whom had diagnoses for which antibiotics are not indicated, primarily viral upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis; 29% of patients with influenza confirmed through research testing were prescribed antibiotics. Among patients prescribed antibiotics, 38% with pharyngitis tested negative for group A streptococcus and 38% with sinusitis had symptoms for 3 days or less before the visit, suggesting antibiotic therapy was not required.

Meaning

Eliminating antibiotic treatment of viral upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis, improving influenza diagnosis and treatment, and reinforcing prescription guidelines for pharyngitis and sinusitis could improve outpatient antibiotic stewardship.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^111LrN1E]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial sinusitis in children — treatment research priorities call for determining the optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy, evaluating a "wait-and-see prescription" strategy for persistent symptoms, selecting the optimal antimicrobial agent while balancing narrow-spectrum choices with disease microbiology and resistance patterns, determining the causes and treatment of subacute, recurrent acute, and chronic bacterial sinusitis, establishing the efficacy of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent RABS, assessing effects of resistance among S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and M catarrhalis via randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, defining the role of adjuvant therapies (antihistamines, nasal corticosteroids, mucolytics, decongestants, nasal irrigation) through prospective randomized trials, determining whether early treatment prevents orbital or central nervous system complications, evaluating complementary and alternative medicine strategies through systematic, prospective, randomized clinical trials, and developing new bacterial and viral vaccines to reduce incidence.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^1156zny1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, more specifically with respect to symptomatic treatment (AAO-HNSF), AAO-HNS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering analgesics, topical intranasal corticosteroids, and/or intranasal saline irrigation for symptomatic relief in patients with acute bacterial or viral rhinosinusitis.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^114RCeCn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and 3 new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy, which includes radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should distinguish presumed ABRS from acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions and (2) should confirm a clinical diagnosis of CRS with objective documentation of sinonasal inflammation, which may be accomplished using anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or computed tomography. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should either offer watchful waiting (without antibiotics) or prescribe initial antibiotic therapy for adults with uncomplicated ABRS; (2) should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as ﬁrst-line therapy for 5 to 10 days (if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic); (3) should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days after diagnosis or worsens during the initial management; (4) should distinguish CRS and recurrent ARS from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms; (5) should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent ARS for multiple chronic conditions that would modify management, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia; (6) should confirm the presence or absence of nasal polyps in a patient with CRS; and (7) should recommend saline nasal irrigation, topical intranasal corticosteroids, or both for symptom relief of CRS. The update group stated as options that clinicians may (1) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation for symptomatic relief of viral rhinosinusitis; (2) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation) for symptomatic relief of ABRS; and (3) obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent ARS. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should not obtain radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for ARS, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected, and (2) should not prescribe topical or systemic antifungal therapy for patients with CRS.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: background [^116JknDp]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections. Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions. Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have bacterial infection, although rarely some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever. Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases. Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance is the preferred initial management strategy for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms-especially those with unilateral facial pain-regardless of duration of illness. For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the likely pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, should be used.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^116GSbUg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common reasons for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, though there is little clinical evidence to support this practice, especially for chronic rhinosinusitis. Despite considerable research, the etiology of chronic rhinosinusitis, including the pathogenic role of microbes, remains poorly understood. Rigorous studies of the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of chronic sinusitis are surprisingly few in number and the results are somewhat conflicting. This article will review the rationales for and against the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with antibiotics, based on current evidence and understanding of pathophysiology, and will also summarize the current guidelines.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

Some unanswered questions in CRS antibiotic research are listed in Table II. Several expert guidelines call for RCTs to study the widespread practice of antibiotics for CRS. 3,72 Due to the variable quality of much of the existing evidence, it remains uncertain whether the use of short or long-term antibiotics have an impact on patient outcomes in adults with CRS. Further randomised studies with larger population sizes are needed. Unlike macrolides, the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not believed to have direct sinonasal anti-inflammatory properties, and so studies are needed to determine conclusively its effectiveness in CRS given the frequency of its prescription for CRS.

Antibiotic resistance is a major threat to public health that demands ongoing attention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than 2 million patients suffer from complications of antibiotic resistance, with 23,000 patients dying from such complications annually in the United States. 73 Furthermore, the CDC estimates that at least 1 in 3 prescriptions for antibiotics are unnecessary, and the majority of the unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed for respiratory disease caused by viruses. 73 Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use is critical to combating antibiotic resistance. CRS is an ideal condition to clarify the appropriateness and efficacy of antibiotic prescriptions, which is very pertinent in the context of the global crisis of resistance to antibiotics. 3

### Acute and chronic bacterial sinusitis [^111gAkAy]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Sinusitis is one of the most common complaints resulting in physician visits in the United States. An antecedent viral infection of the upper respiratory tract is the most common presentation. Despite its prevalence, most cases resolve spontaneously. Only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection that will benefit from antimicrobial therapy. This article discusses the microbiology and pathogenesis of acute and chronic bacterial sinusitis. The role anaerobic bacterial in chronic and recurrent sinusitis is emphasized, and appropriate antimicrobial regimens are discussed.

Adult sinusitis guideline — acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) diagnosis and differential state that clinicians should distinguish presumed ABRS from viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions, and diagnose ABRS when symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis persist without evidence of improvement for at least 10 days beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening). Strong recommendation.

### Severe rhinosinusitis [^115pibAd]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Rhinosinusitis is diagnosed frequently in clinical practice, but the term may in fact encompass a wide spectrum of diseases. Inflammation of the nasal and sinus mucosa can arise from various causes and lead to different sequelae. Moreover, the term rhinosinusitis is more accurate than sinusitis. Causes range from a viral infection leading to the common cold to an invasive, fungal infection. An accurate diagnosis is important because effective therapy is available if recognized early and if specific therapy is used. Importantly, there is a close relationship between upper and lower airway disease and each have unique structural and functional differences that make an understanding of rhinosinusitis important not only for upper airway disease, but also for the management of asthma. All too often, rhinosinusitis becomes chronic and this becomes a challenge because medical therapy may not be sufficient to control disease. Finally, we should note that the differential diagnosis of rhinosinusitis is extensive and physicians should place heavy emphasis not only on the history, but also on appropriate imaging studies. A normal exam does not rule out the possibility of rhinosinusitis. Finally, we should emphasize that effective treatment is dependent on the etiology of the symptoms but also dependent on whether it is acute or chronic.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^116pDK81]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult rhinosinusitis scope and definitions — the target patient for this guideline is aged 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, where rhinosinusitis is defined as inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity and uncomplicated rhinosinusitis is defined as rhinosinusitis without clinically evident extension of inflammation outside the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity at the time of diagnosis. Rhinosinusitis may be classified by duration as acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) if less than 4 weeks' duration, or as CRS if lasting more than 12 weeks, with or without acute exacerbations; ARS may be classified further by presumed etiology into acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) or viral rhinosinusitis (VRS), and distinguishing presumed bacterial versus viral infection is important because antibiotic therapy is inappropriate for the latter. When patients have 4 or more annual episodes of ABRS, without persistent symptoms in between, the condition is termed recurrent ARS (RARS). Nearly all experts agree that CRS begins after 12 weeks duration, and we agree with other guideline groups that define ARS as up to 4 weeks' duration; very limited data are available on rhinosinusitis lasting 4 to 12 weeks, sometimes called subacute rhinosinusitis, and we do not distinguish rhinosinusitis in this time frame as an explicit entity in the guideline with decisions individualized.

### Rhinitis and sinusitis [^112gQ14r]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Rhinitis and sinusitis are among the most common medical conditions and are frequently associated. In Western societies an estimated 10% to 25% of the population have allergic rhinitis, with 30 to 60 million persons being affected annually in the United States. It is estimated that sinusitis affects 31 million patients annually in the United States. Both rhinitis and sinusitis can significantly decrease quality of life, aggravate comorbid conditions, and require significant direct medical expenditures. Both conditions also create even greater indirect costs to society by causing lost work and school days and reduced workplace productivity and school learning. Management of allergic rhinitis involves avoidance, many pharmacologic options, and, in appropriately selected patients, allergen immunotherapy. Various types of nonallergic rhinitis are treated with avoidance measures and a more limited repertoire of medications. For purposes of this review, sinusitis and rhinosinusitis are synonymous terms. An acute upper respiratory illness of less than approximately 7 days' duration is most commonly caused by viral illness (viral rhinosinusitis), whereas acute bacterial sinusitis becomes more likely beyond 7 to 10 days. Although the mainstay of management of acute bacterial sinusitis is antibiotics, treatment of chronic sinusitis is less straightforward because only some chronic sinusitis cases have an infectious basis. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has been subdivided into 3 types, namely CRS without nasal polyps, CRS with nasal polyps, and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. Depending on the type of CRS present, a variety of medical and surgical approaches might be required.

### Treatment options for chronic rhinosinusitis [^112Dt9y7]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is defined as persistent symptomatic inflammation of the nasal and sinus mucosa. Although insights into the pathophysiology of CRS have largely expanded over the last 2 decades, the exact etiology is still unknown and is likely due to multiple host and environmental factors. Treatments are aimed at reducing mucosal inflammation, controlling infection, and restoring mucociliary clearance within the sinuses. The principal goal of this article is to outline a rational approach to the treatment of chronic sinus disease on the basis of currently available diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. Emphasis will be placed on the management, therapeutic response, and objective evaluation of therapeutic efficiency.

### Acute sinusitis in children [^11681APj]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is a common illness in children. Viral upper respiratory tract infection is the most common presentation of rhinosinusitis. Most children resolve the infection spontaneously and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. The proper choice of antibiotic therapy depends on the likely infecting pathogens, bacterial antibiotic resistance, and pharmacologic profiles of antibiotics. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is currently recommended as the empiric treatment in those requiring antimicrobial therapy. Isolation of the causative agents should be considered in those who failed the initial treatment. In addition to antibiotics, adjuvant therapies and surgery may be used in the management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is a common complication of viral upper respiratory tract infections and is associated with a significant socioeconomic burden. Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ABRS have been produced in association with a number of societies in the United States; these guidelines aim to promote the rational selection of antibiotic therapy to optimize clinical outcomes while minimizing the potential for selection of antibiotic resistance. This article provides an overview of current U.S. guidelines for the treatment of ABRS, focusing on the impact of antibiotic resistance on treatment options.

### Management of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis during the COVID-19 pandemic-an EAACI position paper [^114RyrhY]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic rhinosinusitis is regarded as a chronic airway disease. According to WHO recommendations, it may be a risk factor for COVID-19 patients. In most CRSwNP cases, the inflammatory changes affecting the nasal and paranasal mucous membranes are type-2 (T2) inflammation endotypes.

Methods

The current knowledge on COVID-19 and on treatment options for CRS was analyzed by a literature search in Medline, Pubmed, international guidelines, the Cochrane Library and the Internet.

Results

Based on international literature, on current recommendations by WHO and other international organizations as well as on previous experience, a panel of experts from EAACI and ARIA provided recommendations for the treatment of CRS during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Conclusion

Intranasal corticosteroids remain the standard treatment for CRS in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Surgical treatments should be reduced to a minimum and surgery preserved for patients with local complications and for those with no other treatment options. Systemic corticosteroids should be avoided. Treatment with biologics can be continued with careful monitoring in noninfected patients and should be temporarily interrupted during the course of the COVID-19 infection.

### Rhinitis and sinusitis [^116iE3ij]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Rhinitis and sinusitis are prevalent medical conditions that are often associated with each other and may result in significant morbidity and medical costs. They can cause systemic symptoms, decrease quality of life, and result in reduced workplace productivity and missed school days. Appropriate management of rhinitis or sinusitis may be an important component in effective management of coexisting or complicating conditions, such as asthma, allergic conjunctivitis, or chronic otitis media. Rhinitis may be caused by allergic, non-allergic, infectious, hormonal, occupational, and other factors. Defining the basis for rhinitis in an individual is important in selection of therapeutic options. Rhinitis and sinusitis may be difficult to distinguish from each other on the basis of history alone. Although most acute upper respiratory infections are viral and do not require antibiotic treatment, persistence of symptoms for ≥ 7 days makes acute bacterial sinusitis more likely and antibiotics an appropriate consideration. Radiographic imaging is not required for diagnosis of acute, uncomplicated sinusitis, although CT scans are indicated in evaluation of suspected chronic sinusitis or treatment failures. Chronic sinusitis may have an infectious or non-infectious basis. Underlying disorders that predispose to chronic sinusitis should be identified and treated as part of the treatment of chronic sinusitis.

### Chronic sinusitis in children [^115tJ7HH]. Clinical Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines for the management of acute sinusitis in children have been published by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Of note is that in this document, a brief discussion of chronic disease concluded that the pathogenesis and management are essentially unknown. Although there are insufficient data in the literature to develop evidence-based clinical guidelines, a careful review of the literature and clinical experience of experts who manage pediatric chronic sinusitis is presented in an effort to develop specific recommendations and to offer practical treatment options. Factors associated with chronic sinusitis should be addressed individually and include recurrent viral upper respiratory infections, allergic and nonallergic rhinitis, ciliary dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis, immunodeficiency, and anatomic abnormalities. Bacteriology includes the 3 pathogens associated with acute disease i.e. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis but with chronic sinusitis also includes Staphylococcus aureus, anaerobic bacteria, and fungi. Medical interventions discussed include endoscopic sinus surgery, saline nasal irrigation, intranasal decongestant therapy, intranasal steroids, and oral antibiotics. Clinical ranking without regard to side effects and cost suggests that endoscopic sinus surgery and antral irrigation have the highest probability of substantial symptom improvement. Other issues discussed include identification and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), allergy, and immune deficiency.

### Medical management strategies in acute and chronic rhinosinusitis [^116hidHG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis, historically, has been considered to be caused by upper airway anatomical abnormalities. However, today that concept has changed, for it is now recognized as an inflammatory disorder of the nasal and sinus mucosa. Acute rhinosinusitis is usually caused by a viral infection, whereas chronic rhinosinusitis is a persistent and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder with increased expression of type 1, 2, or 17 cytokines in the nasal and sinus mucosa, similar to that which occurs in asthma. Exacerbations are caused by aeroallergens in the allergic individual and irritants, pollutants, and viral/bacterial infections in all subjects. It may be categorized by phenotypes, examples of which include chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps. Defined endotypes are based on underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Knowledge of chronic rhinosinusitis endotypes will optimize management by employing targeted medical therapies. Understanding that rhinosinusitis is a heterogeneous inflammatory disease has led to the identification of a variety of different predisposing conditions, new medical treatment options, and the concept that rhinosinusitis is primarily a medical problem.

### Sinusitis (acute) [^113eDFe2]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute sinusitis is defined pathologically, by transient inflammation of the mucosal lining of the paranasal sinuses lasting less than 4 weeks. Clinically, it is characterised by nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, facial pain, hyposmia, sneezing, and, if more severe, additional malaise and fever. It affects 1% to 5% of the adult population each year in Europe.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments in people with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, and in people with radiologically or bacteriologically confirmed acute sinusitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 19 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid [co-amoxiclav], doxycycline, cephalosporins, macrolides; different doses, long-course regimens), antihistamines, decongestants (xylometazoline, phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine), saline nasal washes, steam inhalation, and topical corticosteroids (intranasal).

### Issues in the management of bacterial sinusitis [^116g1zbi]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Office visits for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) have increased steadily in the past 2 decades, and ABRS accounted for 0.4% of ambulatory diagnoses in 1995, ranking as the fifth most common diagnosis for which an antibiotic is prescribed. ABRS typically begins as a viral respiratory tract infection, but bacterial growth is demonstrated in 60% of adults with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms of at least 10 days duration. Important factors to consider when selecting an antibiotic regimen for ABRS include: severity of disease, rate of disease progression, earlier antibiotic treatment, regional resistance rates, and, in children, an age < 5 years and attendance in day care centers. The most prevalent causative pathogens of sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Antimicrobial agent use is under significant scrutiny in this era of emerging bacterial resistance, and antibiotic treatment for sinusitis should include consideration of drug pharmacodynamics. Several agents, once considered first-line therapies, can no longer be considered dependable in this role. Rather, newer antibiotics may be called on to provide efficacy and forestall additional antimicrobial resistance among respiratory tract pathogens.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^111qvLyV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic efficacy rationale and trial interpretation in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS): The purpose is to promote prescribing of antibiotics with known efficacy and safety for ABRS and to reduce prescribing of antibiotics with potentially inferior efficacy because of a limited antimicrobial spectrum against usual pathogens that cause ABRS in adults. Dozens of RCTs have assessed the comparative clinical efficacy of antibiotics for ABRS in adults, but most participants were not microbiologically confirmed and likely included uncomplicated viral rhinosinusitis (VRS) expected to recover spontaneously; this is supported by the finding that only ~50% clinically diagnosed ABRS had positive bacterial cultures by antral or middle meatal cultures.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^117Rncy4]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline regarding the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children and adolescents.

Methods

Analysis of the medical literature published since the last version of the guideline (2001).

Results

The diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis is made when a child with an acute upper respiratory tract infection (URI) presents with (1) persistent illness (nasal discharge [of any quality] or daytime cough or both lasting more than 10 days without improvement), (2) a worsening course (worsening or new onset of nasal discharge, daytime cough, or fever after initial improvement), or (3) severe onset (concurrent fever[temperature ≥ 39°C/102.2°F] and purulent nasal discharge for at least 3 consecutive days). Clinicians should not obtain imaging studies of any kind to distinguish acute bacterial sinusitis from viral URI, because they do not contribute to the diagnosis; however, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the paranasal sinuses should be obtained whenever a child is suspected of having orbital or central nervous system complications. The clinician should prescribe antibiotic therapy for acute bacterial sinusitis in children with severe onset or worsening course. The clinician should either prescribe antibiotic therapy or offer additional observation for 3 days to children with persistent illness. Amoxicillin with or without clavulanate is the firstline treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. Clinicians should reassess initial management if there is either a caregiver report of worsening(progression of initial signs/symptoms or appearance of new signs/symptoms) or failure to improve within 72 hours of initial management. If the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis is confirmed in a child with worsening symptoms or failure to improve, then clinicians may change the antibiotic therapy for the child initially managed with antibiotic or initiate antibiotic treatment of the child initially managed with observation.

Conclusions

Changes in this revision include the addition of a clinical presentation designated as "worsening course", an option to treat immediately or observe children with persistent symptoms for 3 days before treating, and a review of evidence indicating that imaging is not necessary in children with uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis.

Management of frontal sinusitis can be challenging for even the most experienced otolaryngologists. A thorough understanding of the anatomy and pathophysiology of the frontal sinus is essential to properly manage disease affecting the frontal sinus. Being able to distinguish acute viral from acute bacterial and acute from chronic sinusitis is crucial because these distinctions guide appropriate management. Nasal endoscopy can confirm diagnosis, and radiologic imaging, including computed tomography and MRI, is often a necessary adjunct that aids in determining appropriate therapeutic decisions. One must be aware of the many procedures used in the surgical treatment of frontal sinusitis.

### Acute community-acquired bacterial sinusitis: the value of antimicrobial treatment and the natural history [^114bRpnQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Two areas of investigation were reviewed: (1) placebo-controlled trials of antimicrobial treatment involving patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute community-acquired bacterial sinusitis (ACABS) for whom pre- and posttherapy sinus aspirate cultures were not performed, and (2) uncontrolled trials of antimicrobial treatment involving patients with ACABS for whom pre- and posttherapy sinus aspirate cultures were performed. The clinical diagnostic criteria in the controlled trials were not correlated with sinus aspirate culture results and, thus, were of questionable validity. Most of the populations probably included patients with viral rhinosinusitis. In 10 uncontrolled studies, the posttreatment, weighted, pooled mean bacterial resolution rate (± standard error) at 7–10 days, based on sinus aspirate culture results, was 91% ± 10%. In 9 controlled trials, the weighted pooled mean rate of clinical improvement (± standard deviation) at 7–14 days for placebo recipients was 52% ± 18%. In 1 controlled trial in which diagnosis was based on duration of unimproved illness, 57% of placebo recipients and 85.5% of treated patients were healthy or had improved by day 10. Additional studies of ACABS are needed.

### Acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis [^112jaiYY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis are 2 of the most common indications for antimicrobial agents in children. Together, they are responsible for billions of dollars of health care expenditures. The pathogenesis of the 2 conditions is identical. In the majority of children with each condition, a preceding viral upper respiratory tract infection predisposes to the development of the acute bacterial complication. It has been shown that viral upper respiratory tract infection predisposes to the development of acute otitis media in 37% of cases. Currently, precise microbiologic diagnosis of acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis requires performance of tympanocentesis in the former and sinus aspiration in the latter. The identification of a virus from the nasopharynx in either case does not obviate the need for antimicrobial therapy. Furthermore, nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs are not useful in predicting the results of culture of the middle ear or paranasal sinus. However, it is possible that a combination of information regarding nasopharyngeal colonization with bacteria and infection with specific viruses may inform treatment decisions in the future.

### Current concepts in adult acute rhinosinusitis [^1156AdH2]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common conditions that physicians treat in ambulatory care. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis are caused by viral upper respiratory infections. A meta-analysis based on individual patient data found that common clinical signs and symptoms were not effective for identifying patients with rhinosinusitis who would benefit from antibiotics. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are somewhat useful tests for confirming acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis. Four signs and symptoms that significantly increase the likelihood of a bacterial cause when present are double sickening, purulent rhinorrhea, erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 10 mm per hour, and purulent secretion in the nasal cavity. Although cutoffs vary depending on the guideline, antibiotic therapy should be considered when rhinosinusitis symptoms fail to improve within seven to 10 days or if they worsen at any time. First-line antibiotics include amoxicillin with or without clavulanate. Current guidelines support watchful waiting within the first seven to 10 days after upper respiratory symptoms first appear. Evidence on the use of analgesics, intranasal corticosteroids, and saline nasal irrigation for the treatment of acute rhinosinusitis is poor. Nonetheless, these therapies may be used to treat symptoms within the first 10 days of upper respiratory infection. Radiography is not recommended in the evaluation of uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. For patients who do not respond to treatment, computed tomography of the sinuses without contrast media is helpful to evaluate for possible complications or anatomic abnormalities. Referral to an otolaryngologist is indicated when symptoms persist after maximal medical therapy and if any rare complications are suspected.

### Antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^117LcnhV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute rhinosinusitis is an acute infection of the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses that lasts less than four weeks. Diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms in ambulatory care settings. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor are they recommended in most countries. Some trials show a trend in favour of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear. We merged two Cochrane Reviews for this update, which comprised different approaches with overlapping populations, resulting in different conclusions. For this review update, we maintained the distinction between populations diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms, or imaging.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in adults with acute rhinosinusitis in ambulatory care settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2017, Issue 12), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (January 1950 to January 2018), Embase (January 1974 to January 2018), and two trials registers (January 2018). We also checked references from identified trials, systematic reviews, and relevant guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in people with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms or sinusitis confirmed by imaging.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data about cure and side effects and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information as required.

Main Results

We included 15 trials involving 3057 participants. Of the 15 included trials, 10 appeared in our 2012 review, and five (631 participants) are legacy trials from merging two reviews. No new studies were included from searches for this update. Overall, risk of bias was low. Without antibiotics, 46% of participants with rhinosinusitis, whether or not confirmed by radiography, were cured after 1 week and 64% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten time to cure, but only 5 to 11 more people per 100 will be cured faster if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment: clinical diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.54; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 19, 95% CI 10 to 205; I² = 0%; 8 trials; high-quality evidence) and diagnosis confirmed by radiography (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.39; NNTB 10, 95% CI 5 to 136; I² = 0%; 3 trials; moderate-quality evidence). Cure rates with antibiotics were higher when a fluid level or total opacification in any sinus was found on computed tomography (OR 4.89, 95% CI 1.75 to 13.72; NNTB 4, 95% CI 2 to 15; 1 trial; moderate-quality evidence). Purulent secretion resolved faster with antibiotics (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.22; NNTB 10, 95% CI 6 to 35; I² = 0%; 3 trials; high-quality evidence). However, 13 more people experienced side effects with antibiotics compared to placebo or no treatment (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.82; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 8, 95% CI 6 to 12; I² = 16%; 10 trials; high-quality evidence). Five fewer people per 100 will experience clinical failure if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment (Peto OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.63; NNTH 19, 95% CI 15 to 27; I² = 21%; 12 trials; high-quality evidence). A disease-related complication (brain abscess) occurred in one participant (of 3057) one week after receiving open antibiotic therapy (clinical failure, control group).

Authors' Conclusions

The potential benefit of antibiotics to treat acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed either clinically (low risk of bias, high-quality evidence) or confirmed by imaging (low to unclear risk of bias, moderate-quality evidence) is marginal and needs to be seen in the context of the risk of adverse effects. Considering antibiotic resistance, and the very low incidence of serious complications, we conclude there is no place for antibiotics for people with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. We could not draw conclusions about children, people with suppressed immune systems, and those with severe sinusitis, because these populations were not included in the available trials.

### Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections during influenza seasons [^1179AaFn]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study adds to evidence that misuse of antibiotics, characterized by antibiotic overuse and inappropriate antibiotic selection, is widespread in the treatment of outpatient ARIs. The study indicates a number of potential targets to achieve the goal of the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria of reducing inappropriate outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020. We must strengthen outpatient antibiotic stewardship efforts to eliminate antibiotic treatment for viral URIs and acute bronchitis, which our study indicates would make the largest contribution to decreasing unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions. Increased efforts are needed to support improved adherence to guidelines for antibiotic prescribing for common diagnoses, including more stringent adherence to GAS pharyngitis testing guidelines and clinical criteria for antibiotic treatment of sinusitis, as well as interventions focused on appropriate selection of first-line antibiotics for these conditions if treatment is indicated. In addition, our findings indicate that improved point-of-care influenza diagnostics and increased recognition and appropriate treatment of influenza virus infection may also aid in decreasing unnecessary antibiotic use for ARIs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published "Core Elements of Outpatient Antibiotic Stewardship", which provides guidance to clinicians and facility leadership to implement activities to improve antibiotic use. Improving antibiotic prescribing for ARIs during the influenza season represents an important opportunity to improve the long-term quality of patient care.

### Impact of rhinitis on airway inflammation: biological and therapeutic implications [^112ZnM8Y]. Respiratory Research (2001). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence for a close link between the upper and the lower respiratory tracts and the fact that rhinitis has an important impact on asthma. Several clinical and experimental observations suggest a similar immunopathology between the upper and lower airways in allergic subjects. The common inflammatory process that develops in the respiratory tract explains some of the complex interactions among different clinical diseases such as rhinitis, sinusitis, asthma, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and viral infections. There are also non-inflammatory mechanisms that may contribute to the link between rhinitis and asthma. Moreover, the outcomes of various pharmacological treatments of rhinitis have recently provided further support for the hypothesis of the united airways. We discuss some of the recent observations on the nose-lung interaction and some of the novel therapeutic approaches used to treat rhinitis and asthma that arise from this.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaSinonasal disease [^115PcCWY]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Imaging of sinonasal pathology may occur for assessment of rhinosinusitis or mass lesions. Rhinosinusitis is prevalent in up to 16% of the US population with annual economic burdens estimated at 22 billion dollars. Rhinosinusitis is characterized as acute or chronic based on symptom duration; if four or more episodes occur annually, the term recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) is used. In acute uncomplicated rhinosinusitis when inflammatory change remains in the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity, imaging may not be required. Distinction between viral or bacterial rhinosinusitis is a clinical diagnosis, and imaging should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and endoscopic findings. Sinus CT imaging is appropriate per clinical judgment in associated complications including headache, facial pain, swelling, orbital proptosis, or cranial nerve palsies. In maxillary sinusitis, teeth may require assessment because 20% may be odontogenic in origin. MRI may be complementary in aggressive infections with intraocular/intracranial complications, invasive fungal sinusitis, or sinonasal masses. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Guideline definitions for evidence-based statements — clinician implications: Table 1 provides categories (strong recommendation, recommendation, option, and no recommendation) with explicit practice implications. Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Clinicians would be prudent to follow a recommendation, but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Clinicians should consider the option in their decision-making, and patient preference may have a substantial role. Clinicians should be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm.

### Phytomedicine ELOM-080 in acute viral rhinosinusitis: a randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded clinical trial [^112DvJcv]. The Laryngoscope (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

ELOM-080 is a phytomedicine approved for the treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract, sinusitis, and bronchitis in particular. This prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial was conducted to assess efficacy and safety of ELOM-080 in the treatment of acute viral rhinosinusitis (AVRS).

Methods

Patients with AVRS received oral treatment (4 ×1 capsule per day) with either ELOM-080 or matching placebo. Primary endpoints were the change in major symptom score (MSS) after 7 and 14days of treatment assessed by the investigator (MSS INV). Secondary endpoints were changes in MSS assessed by the patients (MSS PAT), olfactory function (12-item Sniffin' Sticks), 20-Item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-20 GAV; German adapted version), influence of treatment on viral load, and safety.

Results

Four hundred and sixty-three patients were randomized. At day 4, subjective burden of disease (MSS) was significantly ameliorated compared to placebo (p = 0.012). During the first treatment week MSS scores improved about 1 day earlier, and 3days earlier in the second week. Effect with ELOM-080 on mean MSS INV was statistically significantly superior to placebo at visit 3 (p = 0.016) and visit 4 (p = 0.014). In chemosensory testing identification scores improved comparably in both treatments. The improvement of the SNOT-20 GAV was more pronounced in ELOM-080 patients. Treatment with ELOM-080 indicated a potential for decreasing viral load. Both treatments were well tolerated.

Conclusion

ELOM-080 improves the burden of AVRS significantly in comparison to placebo, remission of symptoms occurred 3days earlier. The results confirm the efficacy and safety of ELOM-080 for treatment of AVRS.

### Acute rhinosinusitis: rapid evidence review [^111khKvo]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis causes more than 30 million patients to seek health care per year in the United States. Respiratory tract infections, including bronchitis and sinusitis, account for 75% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in primary care. Sinusitis is a clinical diagnosis; the challenge lies in distinguishing between the symptoms of bacterial and viral sinusitis. Cardinal features of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis are unilateral facial pain or pressure, fever greater than 102°F (39°C), and purulent nasal discharge with obstruction of the nasal passages. Antibiotics should be considered for patients with 3 or more days of severe symptoms, significant worsening after 3 to 5 days of symptoms, or 7 or more days of symptoms. Diagnostic testing for acute rhinosinusitis with antral puncture is impractical because of its invasiveness. Point-of-care testing for elevated C-reactive protein may be helpful, but it is not widely available. Studies have shown that amoxicillin is as effective as amoxicillin-clavulanate as a first-line treatment for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis for those without a beta-lactam allergy. For patients with a beta-lactam allergy, appropriate antibiotics include doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone; clindamycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin is an option for children with non-type I hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics. Supportive care for rhinosinusitis, including use of saline irrigation, nasal steroids or antihistamines, and decongestants, may help reduce the severity of symptoms. Most episodes of rhinosinusitis are self-limited, lasting 7 to 10 days. Complications of rhinosinusitis are rare but may include orbital cellulitis, meningitis, and abscess. Computed tomography and referral to an otolaryngologist should be considered for patients with recurrent rhinosinusitis or concern about complications.

Adult sinusitis guideline — antibiotics in chronic rhinosinusitis states that clinicians should not routinely prescribe antimicrobial therapy for adults with CRS without acute exacerbation or as a mandatory prerequisite for paranasal sinus imaging or surgery. The action statement identifies aggregate evidence quality Grade A from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials with a high level of confidence, notes the role of patient preferences as limited, and specifies exceptions of acute exacerbation of CRS and odontogenic infection accompanying CRS, with policy level Recommendation. Supporting text notes that first-line treatment for CRS is nasal saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroid spray, and that there is no recent evidence for widespread empiric usage of antibiotic therapy for treating CRS; a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 50 patients studied 3 weeks of treatment with 3 arms, and clinical improvement was noted with the irrigation and the oral steroid arms but not with the antibiotics.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride tablets, 400 mg [^113SVNvH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

See the section " What are the possible side effects of moxifloxacin tablets?" for more information about side effects.

What are moxifloxacin tablets?

Moxifloxacin tablets are a fluoroquinolone antibiotic medicine used to treat certain types of infections caused by certain germs called bacteria in adults 18 years or older. These bacterial infections include:

Community Acquired Pneumonia
Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections
Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections
Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections
Plague
Acute Bacterial Sinusitis
Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis

Moxifloxacin tablets should not be used in patients with acute bacterial sinusitis or acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis if there are other treatment options available.

Studies of moxifloxacin hydrochloride for use in the treatment of plague were done in animals only, because plague could not be studied in people.

It is not known if moxifloxacin tablets are safe and works in people under 18 years of age. Children have a higher chance of getting bone, joint, and tendon (musculoskeletal) problems while taking fluoroquinolone antibiotic medicines.

Sometimes infections are caused by viruses rather than by bacteria. Examples include viral infections in the sinuses and lungs, such as the common cold or flu. Antibiotics, including moxifloxacin tablets, do not kill viruses.

Disclaimer for guideline use — the document clarifies scope and limits by stating that "The clinical practice guideline is not intended as the sole source of guidance in managing patients with AR. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies", and that "The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this program of care". It further notes that guidance is conditional, not prescriptive: "As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, clinical indicators and guidelines are promoted as conditional and provisional proposals of what is recommended under specific conditions but are not absolute", "Guidelines are not mandates; these do not and should not purport to be a legal standard of care", "Adherence to these guidelines will not ensure successful patient outcomes in every situation", and "The AAO-HNSF emphasizes that these clinical guidelines should not be deemed to include all proper treatment decisions or methods of care or to exclude other treatment decisions or methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results".

### A 51-year-old woman with acute onset of facial pressure, rhinorrhea, and Tooth pain: review of acute rhinosinusitis [^116dMDhJ]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is a common ailment accounting for millions of office visits annually, including that of Mrs D, a 51-year-old woman presenting with 5 days of upper respiratory illness and facial pain. Her case is used to review the diagnosis and treatment of acute rhinosinusitis. Acute viral rhinosinusitis can be difficult to distinguish from acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, especially during the first 10 days of symptoms. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines developed to guide diagnosis and treatment of acute viral and bacterial rhinosinusitis recommend that the diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis be based on the presence of "cardinal symptoms" of purulent rhinorrhea and either facial pressure or nasal obstruction of less than 4 weeks' duration. Antibiotic treatment generally can be withheld during the first 10 days of symptoms for mild to moderate cases, given the likelihood of acute viral rhinosinusitis or of spontaneously resolving acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. After 10 days, the likelihood of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis increases, and initiation of antibiotic therapy is supported by practice guidelines. Complications of sinusitis, though rare, can be serious and require early recognition and treatment.

Results

Patient Enrollment

Enrollment was slower than expected for 3 reasons: (1) the diversion of many patients to urgent care providers; (2) the need to warn patients of the risk of severe diarrhea found in the previous study; and (3) the onset of COVID-19, which led to many virtual sick visits and fewer outpatient visits overall. In addition, we had an unexpectedly high rate of failure to obtain primary outcome information (21 of 157 enrolled [13.4%]) as a result of 7 participants who dropped out before day 3, 13 who could not be contacted, and 1 who neglected to provide a global rating. Before continuing the study, our statistician (A. A.) performed an unplanned interim analysis to check for futility and found that the primary outcome in the high-dose arm was inferior to that in the standard-dose arm and that it would be futile to expect to find either a clinically or a statistically significant benefit. As a result, we stopped the trial in May 2020.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^116AkdqZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology and the Role of Microbes

The role of microbes in the pathogenesis of ARS is reasonably well established, and ARS can be divided into acute viral rhinosinusitis, post-viral rhinosinusitis and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. However, the relationship between CRS and microbes is far less certain. No single bacterial species fulfils Koch's postulates for this condition, even although pathogenic species such as Staphylococcus aureus are frequently cultured from the middle meatus of CRS patients (as indeed they are from a significant percentage of normal controls). Research over the last couple of decades has suggested that bacteria may be involved in the pathogenesis of CRS without actually causing an infection. A great deal of interest in biofilms as a cause of CRS was generated by observations using an array of different imaging modalities of biofilms on the sinus mucosa. Subsequently, carefully performed microscopy studies have revealed micro-colonies of bacteria growing within the mucosa of up to half of patients with idiopathic CRS. The actual pathogenic link between the presence of bacteria in biofilms on the mucosal surface and micro-colonies within the mucosa is not clear, as these bacterial colonies often do not appear to provoke a local inflammatory response. Many studies have shown that bacteria in biofilms are much more resistant to antibiotics than are bacteria in planktonic form, partly due to the extracellular matrix of the biofilm structure inhibiting the diffusion of antibiotics and partly due to metabolic changes adopted by the bacteria in biofilms.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^111jPD58]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) definitions — diagnostic thresholds and subtypes are specified as follows: ARS involves up to 4 weeks of purulent nasal drainage with nasal obstruction, facial pain–pressure–fullness, or both, with discharge described as cloudy or colored and typical features of obstruction and facial pain detailed. A clinician should diagnose viral rhinosinusitis (VRS) when symptoms or signs are present less than 10 days and are not worsening. A clinician should diagnose acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) when symptoms or signs fail to improve within 10 days or more beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening). Facial pain–pressure–fullness without purulent nasal discharge is insufficient to establish ARS.

### Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in adults: part I. evaluation [^111DS9Ni]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common conditions that physicians treat in ambulatory practice. Although often caused by viruses, it sometimes is caused by bacteria, a condition that is called acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. The signs and symptoms of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and prolonged viral upper respiratory infection are similar, which makes accurate clinical diagnosis difficult. Because two thirds of patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis improve without antibiotic treatment and most patients with viral upper respiratory infection improve within seven d antibiotic therapy should be reserved for use in patients who have had symptoms for more than seven days and meet clinical criteria. Four signs and symptoms are the most helpful in predicting acute bacterial rhinosinusitis: purulent nasal discharge, maxillary tooth or facial pain (especially unilateral), unilateral maxillary sinus tenderness, and worsening symptoms after initial improvement. Sinus radiography and ultrasonography are not recommended in the diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, although computed tomography has a role in the care of patients with recurrent or chronic symptoms.

### Could nasal nitric oxide help to mitigate the severity of COVID-19? [^114zgGA1]. Microbes and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

The nasal cavity and turbinates play important physiological functions by filtering, warming and humidifying inhaled air. Paranasal sinuses continually produce nitric oxide (NO), a reactive oxygen species that diffuses to the bronchi and lungs to produce bronchodilatory and vasodilatory effects. Studies indicate that NO may also help to reduce respiratory tract infection by inactivating viruses and inhibiting their replication in epithelial cells. In view of the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), clinical trials have been designed to examine the effects of inhaled nitric oxide in COVID-19 subjects. We discuss here additional lifestyle factors such as mouth breathing which may affect the antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2 by bypassing the filtering effect of the nose and by decreasing NO levels in the airways. Simple devices that promote nasal breathing during sleep may help prevent the common cold, suggesting potential benefits against coronavirus infection. In the absence of effective treatments against COVID-19, the alternative strategies proposed here should be considered and studied in more detail.

### Acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^111RohWg]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common conditions for which patients seek medical care. Subtypes of rhinosinusitis include acute, subacute, recurrent acute, and chronic. Acute rhinosinusitis is further specified as bacterial or viral. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis are caused by viral infections associated with the common cold. Symptomatic treatment with analgesics, decongestants, and saline nasal irrigation is appropriate in patients who present with nonsevere symptoms (e.g., mild pain, temperature less than 101°F [38.3°C]). Narrow-spectrum antibiotics, such as amoxicillin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, are recommended in patients with symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis that do not improve after seven days, or that worsen at any time. Limited evidence supports the use of intranasal corticosteroids in patients with acute rhinosinusitis. Radiographic imaging is not recommended in the evaluation of uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. Computed tomography of the sinuses should not be used for routine evaluation, although it may be used to define anatomic abnormalities and evaluate patients with suspected complications of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. Rare complications of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis include orbital, intracranial, and bony involvement. If symptoms persist or progress after maximal medical therapy, and if computed tomography shows evidence of sinus disease, referral to an otolaryngologist is warranted.

### Saline nasal irrigation for acute upper respiratory tract infections [^116JrZPA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), including the common cold and rhinosinusitis, are common afflictions that cause discomfort and debilitation, and contribute significantly to workplace absenteeism. Treatment is generally by antipyretic and mucolytic drugs, and often antibiotics, even though most infections are viral. Nasal irrigation with saline is often employed as an adjunct treatment for chronic or allergic sinusitis, but little is known about its effect on acute URTIs.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of saline nasal irrigation in treating the symptoms of acute URTIs.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 2) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to May 2009), EMBASE (1974 to May 2009), CINAHL (1982 to May 2009), AMED (1985 to 2009) and LILACS (May 2009).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical nasal saline treatment to other interventions in adults and children with clinically diagnosed acute URTIs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (DK, GS) independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. All data were analysed using Cochrane Review Manager software.

Main Results

Three RCTs (618 participants) were included. Most results showed no difference between nasal saline treatment and control. However, there was limited evidence of benefit with nasal saline irrigation in adults. One study showed a mean difference of 0.3 day (out of eight days) for symptom resolution, but this was not significant. Nasal saline irrigation was associated with less time off work in one study. Minor discomfort was not uncommon and 40% of babies did not tolerate nasal saline drops.

Authors' Conclusions

Included trials were too small and had too high a risk of bias to be confident about the possible benefits of nasal saline irrigation in acute URTIs. Future trials should involve much larger numbers of participants and be rigorously designed and controlled.

### Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections during influenza seasons [^11724anF]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are the syndrome for which antibiotics are most commonly prescribed; viruses for which antibiotics are ineffective cause most ARIs.

Objectives

To characterize antibiotic prescribing among outpatients with ARI during influenza season and to identify targets for reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for common ARI diagnoses, including among outpatients with laboratory-confirmed influenza.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cohort study enrolling outpatients aged 6 months or older with ARI evaluated at outpatient clinics associated with 5 US Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network sites during the 2013–2014 and 2014–2015 influenza seasons. All patients received influenza testing by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for research purposes only. Antibiotic prescriptions, medical history, and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis codes were collected from medical and pharmacy records, as were group A streptococcal (GAS) testing results in a patient subset.

Exposure

Visit for ARI, defined by a new cough of 7 days' duration or less.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Antibiotic prescription within 7 days of enrollment. Appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing was based on diagnosis codes, clinical information, and influenza and GAS testing results.

Results

Of 14 987 patients with ARI (mean [SD] age, 32 [24] years; 8638 [58%] women; 11 892 [80%] white), 6136 (41%) were prescribed an antibiotic. Among these 6136 patients, 2522 (41%) had diagnoses for which antibiotics are not indicated; 2106 (84%) of these patients were diagnosed as having a viral upper respiratory tract infection or bronchitis (acute or not otherwise specified). Among the 3306 patients (22%) not diagnosed as having pneumonia and who had laboratory-confirmed influenza, 945 (29%) were prescribed an antibiotic, accounting for 17% of all antibiotic prescriptions among patients with nonpneumonia ARI. Among 1248 patients with pharyngitis, 1137 (91%) had GAS testing; 440 of the 1248 patients (35%) were prescribed antibiotics, among whom 168 (38%) had negative results on GAS testing. Of 1200 patients with sinusitis and no other indication for antibiotic treatment who received an antibiotic, 454 (38%) had symptoms for 3 days or less prior to the outpatient visit, suggesting acute viral sinusitis not requiring antibiotics.

Conclusions and Relevance

Antibiotic overuse remains widespread in the treatment of outpatient ARIs, including among patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza, although study sites may not be representative of other outpatient settings. Identified targets for improved outpatient antibiotic stewardship include eliminating antibiotic treatment of viral upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis and improving adherence to prescribing guidelines for pharyngitis and sinusitis. Increased access to sensitive and timely virus diagnostic tests, particularly for influenza, may reduce unnecessary antibiotic use for these syndromes.

### Management of acute rhinosinusitis in children [^115YYLTP]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) is a common condition in children, usually preceded by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Diagnosing ARS can be challenging, relying primarily on clinical history and examination. Differentiating between viral URTI, post-viral ARS and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is crucial for guiding appropriate antibiotic treatment. Antibiotics have been showed to be effective in improving symptom scores and cure rates in ABRS. Adjunct therapies, including corticosteroids, nasal saline irrigation and analgesics, may provide symptomatic relief. While viral ARS is self-limiting, bacterial ARS can lead to severe complications, including orbital and intracranial involvement, necessitating timely diagnosis and treatment. This review highlights current evidence on the diagnosis and management of ARS in children, emphasising best practices to optimise patient outcomes and prevent complications.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^1166rVzL]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Viral infections in acute and chronic rhinosinusitis — Adults have an average of 2 to 3 viral upper respiratory infections (URIs) annually and children have 3 to 8, and during viral URIs, computed tomography (CT) shows sinus mucosal thickening in 39% to 90%. Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is reported after URIs in 0.5% to 13% of patients. Polymerase chain reaction studies in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) detected respiratory syncytial virus in 4 of 20 (20%) sinus mucosal specimens and rhinovirus in 8 of 39 patients with CRS (21%), while in acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) biopsy samples 50% had RNA evidence of rhinovirus; evidence thus supports the clinical observation that a significant number of ABRS infections is caused by viruses but that viruses are less likely to play an important role in CRS compared with ABRS.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) specificity and severe presentation — the guideline update group considered the criteria in Table 4 best for distinguishing presumed bacterial versus viral ARS; the specificity for ABRS increases when paired with concurrent purulent nasal discharge, and absence of purulent nasal discharge excludes the diagnosis by definition. A special circumstance of ABRS was defined when purulent nasal discharge for 3 to 4 days was accompanied by high fever.

Allergic rhinitis guideline — epidemiology and scope: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is characterized as one of the most common diseases affecting adults and as the most common chronic disease in children in the United States and the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States overall, affecting nearly 1 in every 6 Americans and generating $2 to $5 billion in direct health expenditures annually, with as much as $2 to $4 billion in lost productivity annually. The guideline is applicable to both pediatric and adult patients with AR, but children under the age of 2 years were excluded; there is considerable variation in use of diagnostic tests and treatments, and the recommendations are not intended to represent the standard of care or limit individual care.

Sinusitis — epidemiology and etiologic patterns note that "Rhinosinusitis (the preferred term; encompassing both acute and chronic disease) affects approximately 12%–15.2% of the adult population in the United States, annually". "The direct costs of managing ARS and CRS exceed US$11 billion per year". In pediatrics, "ages 1–8, it is estimated that 6%–7% of patients seeking care for respiratory symptoms had an illness consistent with rhinosinusitis". Regarding bacterial causes, "Streptococcus pneumoniae, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common bacterial causes of acute maxillary sinusitis", while "Staphylococcus aureus, gram-negative bacilli, Streptococcus spp., and anaerobic bacteria are associated more frequently with subacute, chronic, or healthcare associated sinusitis". Viral contribution is noted: "The role of respiratory viruses in sinusitis needs further studies, but most patients with acute sinusitis have an upper-respiratory virus detectable early in illness".

### Chronic rhinosinusitis in adults [^114AXRN3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

There is no consensus on diagnostic criteria for chronic rhinosinusitis. By convention, the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis are similar to those of acute rhinosinusitis but last more than 8 weeks. Diagnosis is based on history, physical examination, and computed tomography scan of the sinuses or rhinoscopy. Treatment options are numerous and, for the most part, not evidence based. They include antibiotics, nasal or oral corticosteroids, antihistamines, naval lavage, decongestants, immunotherapy, and surgery. Which diagnostic and therapeutic options to exercise when, is the focus of this article.

### A study of adherence to the AAO-HNS "Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis" [^111WeADN]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2014). Low credibility.

A retrospective study was conducted to determine if physicians in otolaryngology practice adhered to the clinical practice guideline for adult sinusitis that had been issued by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) 3 years earlier. We analyzed data obtained from the charts of 90 adults who had presented to an otolaryngology outpatient department with a diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), or acute viral rhinosinusitis (AVRS); there were 76 cases of CRS, 11 cases of ABRS, and 3 cases of AVRS. Our goal was to ascertain how closely the treating physician had adhered to the AAO-HNS recommendations with respect to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of these diseases. The study group was made up of 10 otolaryngologists. We evaluated 7 clinical practice metrics for CRS, 7 metrics for ABRS, and 3 for AVRS. We found that individual physician adherence rates for cases of CRS ranged from 0 to 100%; average scores for the 7 metrics ranged from 4 to 88%. For cases of ABRS, adherence scores ranged from 0 to 100%; average scores for the 7 metrics ranged from 0 to 41%. For AVRS, the rate of adherence for all 3 metrics was 0%. This study revealed wide variations in adherence to the AAO-HNS guideline, but overall adherence was generally poor. Adherence appeared to be worse for the acute types of rhinosinusitis than for chronic rhinosinusitis. In view of these findings, a worksheet was developed that clinicians could use to improve compliance with the guidelines.

### Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections during influenza seasons [^113rDVxj]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Antibiotics were likely prescribed inappropriately to a majority of the nearly 15 000 outpatients in this study who presented during influenza season with symptoms of a broadly defined ARI characterized by cough. Among all patients prescribed antibiotics, 41% lacked a diagnosis code for which antibiotic therapy is potentially indicated. Those with influenza confirmed through research testing accounted for a substantial proportion (17%) of all antibiotics prescribed; fewer than one-third of patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza were given a clinical diagnosis of influenza. Patients with influenza virus infection accounted for a substantial proportion of those given antibiotics for diagnoses for which antibiotics may be appropriate, including pharyngitis (12%), sinusitis (14%), and suppurative OM (11%), although most patients with influenza are unlikely to benefit from antibiotic treatment. In addition, among those patients given diagnoses for which antibiotic therapy may be appropriate, many patients prescribed antibiotics likely did not meet criteria for antibiotic therapy based on clinician-ordered laboratory testing and clinical criteria, including 47% of those with a pharyngitis diagnosis and 38% with a sinusitis diagnosis.

Our study is consistent with previous studies that indicate clinicians overprescribe antibiotics for outpatient ARIs. These studies used national survey data, which lack detailed clinical data, including laboratory testing results. We used a sensitive clinical definition of ARI and had data including illness onset date, laboratory confirmation of influenza, and, for many patients, self-reported fever and the results of clinician-ordered GAS testing. As noted in previous studies, we found that a substantial proportion of antibiotic overuse was driven by prescribing for conditions for which antibiotics were not indicated, including viral URIs and acute bronchitis. Our results also suggest antibiotics were frequently overprescribed for patients with 2 common diagnoses for which antibiotics are potentially indicated, pharyngitis and sinusitis, underscoring that these diagnoses are important targets for improving antibiotic use. For pharyngitis, national guidelines recommend antibiotic therapy only for laboratory-confirmed GAS; in our study, nearly half of patients diagnosed as having pharyngitis who received antibiotics either tested negative for GAS or were not tested. For patients with sinusitis, among those prescribed an antibiotic, 38% had symptoms for 3 days or less and most did not report fever, indicating that many patients likely did not meet clinical criteria for antibiotic treatment as defined by national guidelines.

### Executive summary of the clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis update [^112B66Gz]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published the updated "Clinical Practice Guideline: Adult Sinusitis" as a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 14 developed recommendations address diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, the appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management (including radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function), and the judicious use of systemic and topical therapy. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia. An updated guideline is needed as a result of new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group. METHODS: This executive summary describes the guideline developed using the 55-page protocol published as the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual (3 rd edition), which summarizes the methodology for assessments of current data, topic prioritization, development of key action statements, application of value judgements, and related procedures. The guideline update group represented the disciplines of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, infectious disease, family medicine, allergy and immunology, advanced practice nursing, and a consumer advocate. DIFFERENCES FROM PRIOR GUIDELINE: This clinical practice guideline is as an update, and replacement, for an earlier guideline published in 2015 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF). 1 An update was planned for 5 years after the initial publication date and was further necessitated by new primary studies and systematic reviews that might suggest a need for modifying clinically important recommendations. 2 Changes in content and methodology from the prior guideline include the following: New evidence from 14 guidelines, 194 systematic reviews, and 133 RCTs. Emphasis on patient education and counseling with new explanatory tables. Expanded action statement profiles to explicitly state quality improvement opportunities, confidence in the evidence, intentional vagueness, and differences of opinion. Enhanced external review process to include public comment and journal peer review. New algorithm to clarify decision making, watchful waiting, action statement relationships. Extension of watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as an initial management strategy to all patients with uncomplicated acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) regardless of severity, not just patients with "mild" illness (prior guideline). Clarified the recommended timeline for the diagnosis, conservative management and antibiotic treatment of ABRS. Change in recommendation to first-line antibiotic therapy for ABRS amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, from amoxicillin alone (prior guideline). Addition of aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) as a chronic condition that modifies management of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Three new key action statements on managing CRS that focus on the use of biologics (recommend against when patients do not have polyps and educate patients about them when they do) and a recommendation against the empiric use of antibiotics for CRS solely as a third-party requirement for surgery or imaging.

Rhinosinusitis is a term that has long been used to describe a diverse disease entity that encompasses several related but distinct conditions involving the paranasal sinuses. Frontal sinusitis represents one such entity with its own unique treatment considerations. Like rhinosinusitis as a whole, the role of medical management in the treatment of frontal sinusitis cannot be overlooked. Contemporary medical management of frontal sinusitis requires recognition of the unique disease process with implementation of targeted therapies aimed at addressing the specific pathophysiology.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^115u5tC1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis — imaging for acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) should be avoided in uncomplicated cases, as "clinicians should not obtain radiologic imaging for patients presenting with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis (ARS), unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected". Imaging is "unnecessary for diagnosis in patients who meet clinical diagnostic criteria (Table 4) for ABRS", and plain sinus radiography shows only moderate accuracy — "sensitivity (76%) and specificity (79%) compared with sinus puncture in diagnosing ABRS". Imaging cannot distinguish viral from bacterial disease since "Sinus involvement is common in documented viral URIs, making it impossible to distinguish ABRS from VRS based solely on imaging studies". When complications are suspected, "CT imaging of the sinuses is appropriate… based on severe headache, facial swelling, cranial nerve palsies, or forward displacement or bulging of the eye (proptosis)", and "Complications of ABRS are best assessed using iodinated contrast-enhanced CT or gadolinium-based MR imaging", with "Suspected complications… the only indication for MR imaging of the paranasal sinuses in the setting of ABRS". CT may be used if dental origin is suspected: "CT imaging may also be considered for patients in whom there is a suspicion for odontogenic sinusitis", which "may be the cause of 15% of ABRS cases". Radiation exposure is a limitation, where inappropriate technique "may deliver over 10 times the dosage compared with plain film radiography", though "CT dosage can be lowered to 2 times the dose of plain radiography". For in-office cone-beam CT, "the indications… are the same as for traditional scanners, and their role in diagnosing or managing uncomplicated ABRS is limited and should not be routinely performed".

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^114NUEJG]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Modifying factors in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) should be evaluated by clinicians, who should assess the patient with CRS or RARS for multiple chronic conditions that would modify management such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, aspirin‑exacerbated respiratory disease, and ciliary dyskinesia. This recommendation is based on multiple systematic reviews and observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm, and the quality improvement opportunity is to promote effective treatment by identifying comorbid conditions known to accompany CRS and RARS, knowledge of which would improve sinusitis management and, conversely, management of sinusitis may improve the associated chronic condition (asthma).

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis in… [^113MZb5B]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Treatment VIRAL RHINOSINUSITIS Antibiotics are not recommended to treat viral rhinosinusitis because they are ineffective against viral illness and do not directly relieve symptoms. However, physicians may treat symptoms. Topical or systemic decongestants may provide further relief, although their effects are limited to the nasal cavity. Topical decongestants are more effective than oral decongestants, but physicians usually stop therapy after three days because of the risk of rebound nasal congestion after discontinuation of therapy. ACUTE BACTERIAL RHINOSINUSITIS Management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis focuses on pain assessment and may include therapy for pain relief, patient observation, or antibiotic therapy. If the patient fails to improve within seven days of diagnosis, or if symptoms worsen, antibiotic therapy should be initiated or changed.

Adjunctive treatments such as alpha-adrenergic decongestants, corticosteroids, saline irrigation, and mucolytics may be considered for symptomatic relief in patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. Although the U. S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved these therapies for acute rhinosinusitis and few studies support their use, physicians may decide to use them based on the individual patient. Patient Observation. Some randomized controlled trials have shown a high rate of improvement in patients taking placebo; and moderate, incremental benefits in patients taking antibiotics. Therefore, patient observation without antibiotics for up to seven days after diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis is an option for patients with uncomplicated, mild illness; follow-up should be assured. Management is limited to symptom relief during observation.

Although illness severity is the main consideration when deciding on observation, other factors include patient preference, age, general health, cardiopulmonary status, and comorbidities. Antibiotic Therapy. If antibiotic treatment is initiated, amoxicillin should be the first-line therapy because of its safety, effectiveness, low cost, and narrow microbiologic spectrum. Folate inhibitors and macrolide antibiotics are alternatives for patients who are allergic to penicillin.
