## Question

Dose of jardisnce for maintenance on hfpef?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the maintenance dose of Jardiance (empagliflozin) in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact clinical indication and whether HFpEF is an approved use. Then, I should verify the pivotal trial dose used in HFpEF. Next, I will check contemporary guideline recommendations for starting and target doses. After that, I need to review renal function thresholds for initiation and continuation. Finally, I should consider special populations, safety monitoring, and whether any dose titration is required before concluding with a clear maintenance dose recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the indication and the evidence base. Empagliflozin is FDA-approved to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure in adults with chronic heart failure, including both reduced and preserved ejection fraction, based on the EMPEROR-Preserved program in patients with LVEF greater than 40% and the broader HF program, so HFpEF is indeed an approved indication [^116vQxWR].

> Wait, let me verify the exact dose used in the HFpEF trial. In EMPEROR-Preserved, patients were randomized to empagliflozin 10 mg once daily versus placebo, and this dose produced a significant reduction in the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, largely driven by fewer heart failure hospitalizations, establishing 10 mg once daily as the trial-proven dose in HFpEF [^116vQxWR] [^114YUNwz].

> Next, I should review guideline recommendations to ensure alignment. The 2023 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway for HFpEF explicitly recommends empagliflozin 10 mg daily as both the starting and target dose, with no titration required for HF outcomes, which matches the trial regimen and supports using 10 mg once daily as standard maintenance therapy in HFpEF [^116p7pT3].

> Hold on, I should verify renal considerations because SGLT2 inhibitors have eGFR-related guidance. For empagliflozin, initiation is reasonable down to eGFR 20 mL/min/1.73 m², and if eGFR falls below 20 during therapy, continuation can still be considered given renal and HF benefits observed in trials and consensus statements; I initially thought the continuation threshold was 25, but wait, I should correct that — empagliflozin specifically has supportive data down to eGFR 20, so the maintenance dose remains 10 mg once daily unless eGFR is below 20 or there are safety concerns [^115r2dVh] [^113dFj4k].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and practical safety. In older adults, no dose adjustment is routinely required, but I should monitor more frequently for volume depletion and hypotension, especially if on diuretics; in patients with high diuretic burden, empagliflozin still improved outcomes without excess volume depletion overall, though a small increase in volume depletion events was observed, so I should reassess diuretics if symptomatic hypotension or renal changes occur rather than preemptively changing the SGLT2 dose [^111L6n5s] [^116GmPPE].

> Let me consider whether any titration is needed. Unlike some neurohormonal therapies, SGLT2 inhibitors for HF outcomes are typically initiated at the trial dose with no further up-titration; expert pathways reiterate that both starting and target doses for empagliflozin in HFpEF are 10 mg daily, so maintenance is the same as initiation, with ongoing therapy individualized to tolerability and comorbidities rather than dose escalation [^116p7pT3] [^115JdpUi].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final recommendation. The maintenance dose of Jardiance (empagliflozin) for HFpEF is 10 mg orally once daily, regardless of diabetes status, with continuation generally appropriate down to eGFR 20 mL/min/1.73 m² and routine monitoring of renal function and volume status after initiation and during therapy [^116p7pT3] [^115r2dVh].

---

The maintenance dose of Jardiance (empagliflozin) for HFpEF is **10 mg once daily** [^116p7pT3]. This dose is supported by the EMPEROR-Preserved trial [^117My3gK] and ACC expert consensus [^116p7pT3], which recommend 10 mg daily as both the starting and target dose. No dose adjustment is needed for age, sex, or mild-to-moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m²) [^notfound]; however, monitor renal function and potassium after initiation and periodically thereafter [^115r2dVh]. If eGFR falls below 20 mL/min/1.73 m², consider discontinuation. The dose is the same regardless of diabetes status [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the 10 mg daily dose

- **EMPEROR-Preserved trial**: Evaluated empagliflozin 10 mg daily in patients with chronic heart failure and LVEF > 40% [^117My3gK]. The trial demonstrated a significant reduction in the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69–0.90) [^116R1kWo], primarily driven by a reduction in heart failure hospitalizations [^114kmycz].

- **ACC expert consensus**: Recommends empagliflozin 10 mg daily as both the starting and target dose for HFpEF [^116p7pT3], emphasizing its efficacy in reducing heart failure hospitalizations and improving quality of life [^11648bTX].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Both the **2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guidelines** [^112LrkGJ] and the **2023 ACC expert consensus** [^116p7pT3] recommend SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin, as a core component of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HFpEF [^116p7pT3]. The consensus specifically recommends empagliflozin 10 mg daily as the standard maintenance dose for HFpEF patients [^116p7pT3].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

### Renal function

For **eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m²**, no dose adjustment is required; empagliflozin has demonstrated cardiovascular and renal benefits even in patients with moderate renal impairment [^115r2dVh] [^113dFj4k]. If **eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m²**, consider discontinuation, as the safety and efficacy of empagliflozin in this population are limited.

---

### Age and sex

For **age and sex**, no dose adjustment is necessary; empagliflozin's efficacy and safety profile are consistent across different age groups and sexes [^111L6n5s].

---

### Comorbidities

For **diabetes mellitus**, the recommended dose remains 10 mg daily, regardless of diabetes status, as empagliflozin provides cardiovascular benefits independent of glycemic control [^114AEsMZ]. For **hypertension**, empagliflozin may cause modest blood pressure reductions; monitor for hypotension, especially in patients concurrently receiving antihypertensive therapy [^116y2dGT].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Renal function and electrolytes**: Monitor renal function and serum potassium within 1–2 weeks after initiation [^1125hA23] and periodically thereafter, especially in patients with renal impairment or those receiving concomitant medications affecting renal function or potassium levels [^1125hA23].

- **Volume status**: Assess for signs of volume depletion, particularly in elderly patients or those receiving diuretics [^111L6n5s].

- **Adverse effects**: Monitor for genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections, and ketoacidosis, although these are relatively rare [^111L6n5s].

## Empagliflozin dosing for HFpEF

| **Patient population** | **Recommended dose** | **Dose adjustment** |
|-|-|-|
| General HFpEF population | 10 mg once daily | None |
| eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m² | 10 mg once daily | None |
| eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m² | Consider discontinuation | Required |
| Elderly patients | 10 mg once daily | None |
| Patients with diabetes mellitus | 10 mg once daily | None |

---

The recommended maintenance dose of Jardiance (empagliflozin) for HFpEF is **10 mg once daily** [^116p7pT3], supported by robust clinical evidence and expert consensus [^11648bTX]. This dose is appropriate for a broad range of patients, including those with mild-to-moderate renal impairment, and does not require adjustment based on age or sex [^115r2dVh]. Regular monitoring of renal function, electrolytes, and volume status is essential to ensure safe and effective therapy [^115r2dVh].

EMPEROR-Preserved (NCT03057951) was a double-blind trial conducted in adults with chronic heart failure NYHA Class II-IV with LVEF > 40% to evaluate the efficacy of JARDIANCE as adjunct to standard of care therapy.

Of 5,988 patients, 2,997 were randomized to JARDIANCE 10 mg and 2,991 to placebo and were followed for a median of 26 months. The mean age of the trial population was 72 years (range: 22 to 100 years) and 55% were men, 45% were women, and 43% were 75 years of age or older. Approximately 76% of the trial population were White, 14% Asian, and 4% Black or African American.

At randomization, 82% of patients were NYHA class II, 18% were class III, and 0.3% were class IV. The EMPEROR-Preserved trial population included patients with a LVEF < 50% (33.1%), with a LVEF 50 to < 60% (34.4%) and a LVEF ≥ 60% (32.5%). At baseline, the mean eGFR was 61 mL/min/1.73 m2and the median urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) was 21 mg/g. Approximately half of the patients (50%) had eGFR equal to or above 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 26% had eGFR 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 19% had eGFR 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 5% had eGFR 20 to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.

At baseline, 88% of patients were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), 95% with beta-blockers, 71% with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), and 95% with diuretics.

The primary endpoint was the time to first event of either cardiovascular (CV) death or hospitalization for heart failure (HHF). First and recurrent HHF was assessed as a key secondary endpoint.

JARDIANCE was superior in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure compared with placebo, mostly through a reduction in hospitalization for heart failure. JARDIANCE reduced the risk of first and recurrent HHF (see Table 16 and Figures 7 and 8).

Figure 7	Time to First Occurrence of the Primary Composite Endpoint of CV Death or Hospitalization for Heart Failure

Figure 8	Time to Event of Hospitalization for Heart Failure (First and Recurrent)

The results of the primary composite were generally consistent across the pre-specified subgroups (see Figure 9).

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) — dapagliflozin and empagliflozin — in heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 40% showed a significant decrease in hospitalization for heart failure (HF) in both trials, and a meta-analysis suggests reduction in cardiovascular death in HFmrEF/HFpEF (HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.77–1.00). Improvements in health status with SGLT2is were observed in both trials, with the greatest benefit in those with baseline symptomatic impairment, and additional evidence for improvement in health status and quality of life in HFpEF was seen in PRESERVED-HF. A meta-analysis found a consistent reduction in the composite of hospitalization for HF and cardiovascular death in HFmrEF and HFpEF (HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.73–0.87), with benefit additive to mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs). Empagliflozin use was associated with reduced discontinuation of MRAs, possibly due to less risk for hyperkalemia, and no unexpected safety events were identified in either the EMPEROR-Preserved or DELIVER trials; the use of SGLT2is appears to be safe and effective when initiated in the context of hospitalization for acutely decompensated HF.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and diabetes — antihyperglycemic therapy selection and avoidance: Sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) "should be first-line therapy for individuals with HFpEF and T2DM and add-on or alternate therapy in those already on other agents", and clinicians "should consider stopping or adjusting the dose of other hypoglycemic agents in order to accommodate an SGLT2i". Metformin "is recommended as first-line therapy for glycemic control in individuals with T2DM and HF, including HFpEF, with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2", with observational data "suggesting a 20% relative risk reduction in mortality in individuals with HF, including HFpEF". Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) trials "included 10% to 23% of individuals with HF in the study population", and these drugs "should be considered in individuals with HFpEF with coexisting T2DM and high risk for ASCVD or with pre-existing ASCVD". Agents to avoid include the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor saxagliptin, which "was associated with an increased risk of HF hospitalization (3.5% vs 2.8%; HR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.07–1.51)", and the FDA "contraindicates the use of saxagliptin and alogliptin in individuals with HF". Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are linked to "increased incidence of fluid retention, weight gain, and HF events", the risk rises with insulin coadministration and "this combination should be avoided", and "TZDs are relatively contraindicated in individuals with HFpEF".

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — definition, risk, assessment, and therapy thresholds are summarized. CKD is defined as reduced kidney function for at least 3 months duration, with markers including albuminuria (albumin to creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g) or other markers of kidney damage. CKD and HFpEF often coexist, and CKD is a risk factor for incident HFpEF, with a prevalence of ~50% in individuals with HF, and CKD is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and up to a 3-fold increase in mortality in HFpEF. Concentrations of natriuretic peptides are usually higher in individuals with CKD as compared with those without, making usual cutoffs less specific for the diagnosis of HF. Assessment notes serum creatinine may be falsely reduced due to loss of muscle mass or volume expansion/hemodilution, resulting in a falsely increased eGFR, and other useful markers include the presence of albuminuria, evidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, and increasing creatinine with diuresis as a result of hemoconcentration to identify the true degree of CKD. Collaboration and comanagement by nephrology and cardiology should be considered, and agents that reduce the risk of progression to kidney failure in individuals with diabetic kidney disease include ACE inhibitors, ARBs, SGLT2is, and the nonsteroidal, selective MRAs, finerenone; trials have included individuals with eGFRs as low as 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for ACE inhibitors and ARBs, 25 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for finerenone, and 20 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for SGLT2is. In HFpEF, the PARAGON-HF trial demonstrated less decline in renal function with the ARNI compared with the ARB, and EMPEROR-Preserved also noted less decline in renal function with the SGLT2i empagliflozin vs placebo. Based on these findings, the use of an SGLT2i (eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m^2) is beneficial in slowing the decline of kidney function in individuals with HFpEF and CKD above and beyond other therapies, and when using RAAS blockers and/or SGLT2is, monitoring kidney function and serum potassium is useful 1 to 2 weeks after initiation.

14.3 Cardiovascular Outcomes in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease

The effect of JARDIANCE on cardiovascular (CV) risk in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established, stable, atherosclerotic CV disease was evaluated in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, a multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind parallel group trial. The trial compared the risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) between JARDIANCE and placebo when these were added to and used concomitantly with standard of care treatments for diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic CV disease. Concomitant antidiabetic medications were to be kept stable for the first 12 weeks of the trial. Thereafter, antidiabetic and atherosclerotic therapies could be adjusted, at the discretion of investigators, to ensure participants were treated according to the standard care for these diseases.

A total of 7,020 patients were treated (JARDIANCE 10 mg = 2,345; JARDIANCE 25 mg = 2,342; placebo = 2,333) and followed for a median of 3.1 years. Approximately 72% of the trial population was White, 22% was Asian, and 5% was Black. The mean age was 63 years and approximately 72% were male.

All patients in the trial had inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus at baseline (HbA1c greater than or equal to 7%). The mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.1% and 57% of participants had diabetes mellitus for more than 10 years. Approximately 31%, 22% and 20% reported a past history of neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy to investigators, respectively and the mean eGFR was 74 mL/min/1.73 m2. At baseline, patients were treated with one (~30%) or more (~70%) antidiabetic medications including metformin (74%), insulin (48%), and sulfonylurea (43%).

Results

In EMPEROR-Reduced, empagliflozin 10 mg, compared with placebo, reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) mostly through a reduction in HHF (HR 0.75 [95% CI 0.65, 0.86]). Empagliflozin reduced the risk of first and recurrent HHF, a key secondary endpoint. Because of the metformin HCl component, SYNJARDY and SYNJARDY XR are not indicated for use in patients with heart failure without type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Indications and Usage (1)].

The effect of empagliflozin in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint was consistent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (HR 0.73 [95% CI 0.60, 0.87]), and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metformin HCl as background therapy (HR 0.65 [95% CI 0.49, 0.86]).

EMPEROR-Preserved Trial (Chronic Heart Failure with Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction > 40%)

EMPEROR-Preserved (NCT03057951) was a double-blind trial conducted in patients with chronic heart failure NYHA Class II-IV with LVEF > 40% to evaluate the efficacy of empagliflozin as adjunct to standard of care therapy. Of 5,988 patients, 2,997 patients were randomized to empagliflozin 10 mg once daily and 2,991 patients to placebo once daily and were followed for a median of 26 months.

### Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride (Synjardy) [^114vbHmd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of first occurrence of primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.99). The treatment effect was due to a significant reduction in the risk of CV death in subjects randomized to empagliflozin (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.77), with no change in the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (see Table 13 and Figures 4 and 5). Results for the 10 mg and 25 mg empagliflozin dosages were consistent with results for the combined dosage groups.

Figure 4	Estimated Cumulative Incidence of First MACE

Figure 5	Estimated Cumulative Incidence of CV Death

The efficacy of empagliflozin on CV death was generally consistent across major demographic and disease subgroups.

Vital status was obtained for 99.2% of subjects in the trial. A total of 463 deaths were recorded during the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. Most of these deaths were categorized as CV deaths. The non-CV deaths were only a small proportion of deaths and were balanced between the treatment groups (2.1% in patients treated with empagliflozin, and 2.4% of patients treated with placebo).

EMPEROR-Reduced Trial (Chronic Heart Failure with Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ≤ 40%)

EMPEROR-Reduced (NCT03057977) was a double-blind trial conducted in adults with chronic heart failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-IV] with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% to evaluate the efficacy of empagliflozin as adjunct to standard of care heart failure therapy. Of 3,730 patients, 1,863 were randomized to empagliflozin 10 mg once daily and 1,867 to placebo once daily and were followed for a median of 16 months.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — hypertension management emphasizes diuretics, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi), and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), with limited beta-blocker (BB) use. Hypertension "is a major risk factor for developing heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and an important target for HF management to reduce hospitalization, CVD events, and mortality". Diuretics are pivotal and "should be used for signs and/or symptoms of volume overload". "RAASi are indicated for management of HFpEF to attain an SBP of < 130 mm Hg, especially with an MRA or ARNI, or ARB when ARNI is not feasible". Conversely, "BB are not recommended for hypertension management with HFpEF… and should be restricted to specific comorbid conditions". "SGLT2i are used frequently… to reduce the risk of hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality", and because "SGLT2i may lower BP", dose "adjustment in other antihypertensive medications may be indicated if signs or symptoms of hypotension are present".

5.12 Heart Failure

An association between DPP-4 inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Consider the risks and benefits of GLYXAMBI prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of GLYXAMBI.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on clinical assessment, management, and trajectory of patients hospitalized with heart Failure focused update: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^117AQkVA]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

ACC 2024 heart failure hospitalization focused update — executive summary highlights that heart failure (HF) affects nearly 6.7 million Americans and that patients admitted with HF have a 20% to 30% risk of death within 1 year, with goals of hospitalization including assessment and optimization of therapy to address the long-term trajectory after discharge. The update harmonizes with the 2022 ACC/AHA/HFSA HF Guideline and ECDP documents concerning optimization of therapy in chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and Figure 1 places increased emphasis on establishing all 4 pillars of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HFrEF in the hospital, when possible, along with ensuring appropriate follow-up to monitor tolerance and continue titration. The figure also now includes sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibition; given the robust evidence for safety and efficacy of SGLT inhibitors, their use can be considered earlier than or concomitant with neurohormonal antagonists such as beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs)/angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs). For initiation strategies, patients may have a new HFrEF diagnosis, in which case initiation of all 4 pillars of GDMT should be attempted; patients with chronic HF on partial GDMT should receive personalized therapy to fill in gaps, considering a switch from an ACE inhibitor/ARB to ARNI, if appropriate, and caution is required for patients with chronic Class IV HF with decompensated HF, some of whom may not tolerate neurohormonal antagonists, even in low doses.

### Empagliflozin, metformin hydrochloride (Synjardy) [^114YUNwz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In EMPEROR-Preserved, history of type 2 diabetes mellitus was present in 49% of the patients, and 54% of these patients were treated with metformin HCl (773 patients in the empagliflozin group and 803 in the placebo group) and 29% were treated with insulin. In the type 2 diabetes mellitus subpopulation, the mean age was 71 years, 57% were males, 75% White, 13% Asian and 5% Black or African American. In the type 2 diabetes mellitus subpopulation, at baseline, 79% of patients were classified as NYHA class II, 20% class III and 0.2% class IV; the trial also included type 2 diabetics with LVEF < 50% (35%), with a LVEF 50 to < 60% (34%) and a LVEF ≥ 60% (31%). For this subpopulation, the mean baseline eGFR was 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; and at baseline, 83% of patients were treated with ACE inhibitors, ARB, or ARNI, 88% with beta-blockers, 39% with MRA, and 89% with diuretics.

Results

In EMPEROR-Preserved, empagliflozin 10 mg, compared with placebo, reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint (time to first event of either CV death or HHF) mostly through a reduction in hospitalization for heart failure (HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.69, 0.90]). Empagliflozin reduced the risk of first and recurrent HHF, a key secondary endpoint. Because of the metformin HCl component, SYNJARDY and SYNJARDY XR are not indicated for use in patients with heart failure without type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Indications and Usage (1)].

The effect of empagliflozin in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint was consistent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (HR 0.80 [95% CI 0.67, 0.95]), and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metformin HCl as background therapy (HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.61, 1.02]).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115o2419]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus with heart failure — SGLT-2 inhibitors to prevent hospitalization: For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure, we recommend a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor to prevent hospital admissions for heart failure. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation, categorized it as Reviewed, New-added, stated that the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was high, and found that the benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors in reducing hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) for patients with T2DM and HF outweighed the potential harm. Guideline-directed medical therapy includes SGLT-2 inhibitors as part of an initial "four pillar" approach for patients with heart failure along with angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors, beta blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and adding an SGLT-2 inhibitor to a regimen in a patient already achieving glycemic goals might require de-escalation of other medications to limit the risk of hypoglycemia. Evidence cited notes empagliflozin has been shown effective in patients with reduced and preserved ejection fraction and that dapagliflozin similarly reduced the rate of heart failure outcomes, while some systematic reviews suggest that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) might also reduce HHF but the overall impact on HHF is likely minimal without albiglutide, which is no longer marketed in the U.S. Implementation should consider patient factors and tolerability described here, including urinary frequency (especially with coexisting bladder or prostate conditions), a history of recurrent or severe genitourinary infections, and in older patients on other antihypertensives or diuretics or those with systolic heart failure the possibility of symptomatic hypotension or volume depletion that might require de-escalation or discontinuation of therapy.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors — heart failure outcomes in diabetes — reduce the incidence of heart failure and improve heart failure–related outcomes in people with diabetes with preserved or reduced ejection fraction; in EMPA-REG OUTCOME, empagliflozin led to a significant 35% reduction in hospitalization for heart failure versus placebo, and in CANVAS and DECLARE-TIMI 58 the reductions were 33% and 27%, respectively. In DAPA-HF, adults with New York Heart Association class II–IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40% or less had lower risks with dapagliflozin for the primary composite (HR 0.74 [95% CI 0.65–0.85]), first worsening heart failure (HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.59–0.83]), and cardiovascular death (HR 0.82 [95% CI 0.69–0.98]), with the primary outcome effect consistent regardless of the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes. EMPEROR-Reduced showed reduction of the primary outcome in adults with NYHA class II–IV chronic HFrEF (LVEF < 40%), and a similar benefit for heart failure outcomes was seen in DELIVER for dapagliflozin in people with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. A large meta-analysis including EMPEROR-Reduced, EMPEROR-Preserved, DAPA-HF, DELIVER, and SOLOIST-WHF included 21,947 individuals and demonstrated reduced risk for cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, cardiovascular death, first hospitalization for heart failure, and all-cause mortality.

The efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin 10 mg were assessed independently in two Phase 3 trials in adult patients with heart failure.

Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA-HF, NCT03036124) was an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with heart failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-IV] with reduced ejection fraction [left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 40% or less] to determine whether dapagliflozin reduces the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure. Of 4744 patients, 2373 were randomized to dapagliflozin 10 mg and 2371 to placebo and were followed for a median of 18 months.

Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the LIVEs of Patients with PReserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure (DELIVER, NCT03619213) was an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients aged ≥ 40 years with heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) with LVEF > 40% and evidence of structural heart disease to determine whether dapagliflozin reduces the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure or urgent heart failure visits. Of 6263 patients, 3131 were randomized to dapagliflozin 10 mg and 3132 to placebo and were followed for a median of 28 months. The trial included 654 (10%) heart failure patients who were randomized during hospitalization for heart failure or within 30 days of discharge.

Sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in chronic coronary disease (CCD) and heart failure — clinical effects and value: Among patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization and improve quality of life (QOL), and they "should be avoided or used with caution" in type 1 diabetes or advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). For reduced ejection fraction, projected value is intermediate ($50 000 to < $150 000 per QALY gained), with modeling assuming dapagliflozin cost $4192 annually and projecting 0.63 QALYs gained (95% uncertainty interval, 0.25–1.15), an incremental lifetime cost of $42 800 (95% uncertainty interval, $37 100–$50 300), and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $68 300 per QALY gained (95% uncertainty interval, $54 600–$117 600), being cost-effective in 94% of simulations at a threshold of $100 000 per QALY gained. In HF with preserved ejection fraction, SGLT2 inhibitors improved functional capacity and QOL; CCD prevalence was 35% in EMPEROR-PRESERVED and 20% in PRESERVED-HF, with the CCD rate not reported in DELIVER. For preserved ejection fraction, assuming no reduction in cardiovascular mortality and minimal QOL improvement, empagliflozin yields low value (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $437 000), whereas assuming a 9% reduction in cardiovascular mortality lowers the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to $174 000.

Diabetes in HFpEF — Diabetes mellitus (DM) and heart failure (HF) often coexist and each independently increases risk for the other, with the prevalence of DM in HFpEF varying from 28% to over 40%. Individuals with HFpEF and DM tend to be younger, have higher BMIs, greater volume overload, worse functional capacity and quality of life, and more hypertension, vascular disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The presence of DM is associated with a 20% to 100% increased relative risk of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization and a 48% to 84% increased relative risk of all-cause mortality, and CKD and DM commonly co-occur in HFpEF, further increasing the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Diabetes — symptomatic heart failure therapy and metformin use: In individuals with diabetes, guideline-directed medical therapy for myocardial infarction and symptomatic stage C heart failure is recommended with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, MRAs, angiotensin receptor or neprilysin inhibitor, β-blockers, and SGLT2 inhibitors, similar to guideline-directed medical therapy for people without diabetes. In individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and symptomatic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, therapy with a GLP-1 RA with demonstrated benefit for reduction of heart failure–related symptoms, physical limitations, and exercise function is recommended. In people with type 2 diabetes with stable heart failure, metformin may be continued for glucose lowering if estimated glomerular filtration rate remains > 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 but should be avoided in unstable or hospitalized individuals with heart failure.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in type 2 diabetes — semaglutide (glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist [GLP-1 RA]) improved symptoms and weight in STEP-HFpEF, and the committee recommends treatment with a GLP-1 RA with demonstrated benefit in individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and symptomatic HFpEF for the reduction of HF-related symptoms, physical limitations, and exercise function in this population. Approximately 45% of people admitted for HFpEF have diabetes, and most people with HFpEF have obesity. In the trial, 616 people with type 2 diabetes and a BMI of 30 or greater with HFpEF were assigned to receive once-weekly semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg or placebo, and the primary end point was the change in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) clinical summary score (range from 0 to 100) and the change in body weight. After 1 year of treatment, the KCCQ clinical summary score had increased by 9.7 points and mean body weight was reduced by 9.8% with semaglutide compared with 3.4% with placebo; semaglutide also improved 6-min walk distance and favored a hierarchical composite of death, heart failure events, KCCQ change, and C-reactive protein levels.

Obesity and HFpEF — In heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), increasing severity of obesity is associated with an increased risk for HF hospitalization, and there is a U-shaped relationship between body mass index (BMI) and all-cause mortality with the lowest event rate at a BMI of 32 to 34 kg/m2. Weight loss is beneficial in individuals with obesity. In the STEP-1 trial, semaglutide plus lifestyle resulted in a sustained weight loss of over 15 kg over a 68-week period, and in SURMOUNT-1 tirzepatide demonstrated up to 20% reduction in weight loss sustained over the 72-week trial, although semaglutide and tirzepatide have not yet been rigorously evaluated in individuals with HF and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists may result in loss of not only adipose weight but also lean muscle mass. To improve symptoms and alleviate shared obesity-associated comorbidities with HFpEF, those with BMIs ≥ 35 kg/m2 would benefit from referral to a multidisciplinary team of medical, surgical, and nutritional experts in obesity, when available.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation of sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA): We recommend initiating a patient-clinician discussion about SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1RA therapy at a follow-up visit for patients with T2D who have or who are at very high risk for clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), and/or diabetic kidney disease (DKD). An SGLT2 inhibitor with demonstrated cardiovascular (CV) benefit is recommended for patients with T2D and HF, especially heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), or who are at high risk of developing HF, DKD, clinically evident ASCVD, or combinations of these. A GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit is recommended for patients with established or at very high risk for ASCVD. Patients with T2D may become eligible for these therapies if they are subsequently hospitalized or diagnosed with ASCVD, HF, and/or DKD, although hospitalized patients were not included in most CV outcome trials and inpatient formularies may not include these agents. Outpatient adherence after an acute CV event can be favorably influenced by initiation at discharge. CV specialists should consider periodic screening for T2D by measuring HbA1c at guideline-recommended intervals (e.g., annually in patients with prediabetes). Patients with ASCVD or at high risk of ASCVD and/or HF should consider initiation of an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit irrespective of HbA1c levels. Although canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin have differences in FDA-approved CV indications, they appear to have broadly similar CV and renal benefits, and the choice of an individual agent should be made after appropriate patient-clinician discussion of benefits and potential risks.

Effects on fatal or nonfatal MI were more modest (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.09) and there was no significant difference for fatal or nonfatal stroke (HR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.56). Hospitalization for heart failure was reduced by 35% (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.85), and empagliflozin is specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to reduce the risk of CV death in adults with T2D and established CV disease.

Diabetes pharmacotherapy and heart failure outcomes — Incretin-based therapies (glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 [DPP-4] inhibitors), insulin, and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are described with heart failure (HF) endpoints. The safety and efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists have "not been studied extensively in patients with established HF", and although "there were no significant changes with the use of DPP-4 inhibitors in cardiovascular outcomes in large-scale clinical studies", the SAVOR–TIMI 53 trial "showed a 27% increase in hospitalization for HF" with saxagliptin versus placebo; "12.8% of patients had a history of HF at baseline", and the composite risk with saxagliptin was "similar for patients with history of HF compared with patients without a history of HF". A meta-analysis "suggests that DPP-4 inhibitor use is associated with an increased risk of HF". In a randomized trial of "12537 patients" assigned to insulin glargine versus standard care, "rates of cardiovascular outcomes (including HF events) were similar". For sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition, empagliflozin added to standard care "was shown to reduce cardiovascular death, all-cause mortality, and HF hospitalizations"; "Hospitalization for HF was reduced by 35%; 10% of the patients had pre-existing HF", but "among patients with HF, improvement in clinical outcomes including reductions in mortality, cardiovascular death, or HF hospitalizations did not reach significance", and "There was no measure of LVEF or natriuretic peptides in the trial".

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) sacubitril/valsartan: In PARAGON-HF, 4,822 participants with LVEF ≥ 45% were randomized to sacubitril/valsartan (target dose of 97/103 mg twice daily) or valsartan (target dose of 160 mg twice daily); the primary composite of total hospitalizations for HF and cardiovascular death was numerically lower with sacubitril/valsartan but not statistically significant (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.75–1.01). Subgroup analyses observed potential benefit with LVEF between 45% and 57% (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.64–0.95) and greater benefit in women (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.59–0.90) compared with men (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.84–1.25); recently hospitalized participants showed substantially greater risk reduction with an ARNI versus valsartan. Sacubitril/valsartan provides modest additional benefit compared with valsartan in HFpEF, with hypotension and angioedema, albeit rare, more frequent with ARNIs and serum creatinine elevations and hyperkalemia less frequent; in February 2021 the FDA granted an expanded HF indication and noted that the "benefits are most clearly evident in patients with LVEF below normal".

Summary assessment — heart failure stages by ejection fraction definitions are as follows: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is "also referred to as systolic HF or cardiomyopathy" and is HF "in a patient with documented LVEF of ≤ 40%". Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is HF "in a patient with documented LVEF of ≥ 50%". Heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF) is HF "in a patient with documented LVEF > 40% and ≤ 50%".

Hypertension in HFpEF — prevalence and management context: The role of blood pressure control is well established for the prevention of heart failure (HF), and for reduction of other cardiovascular events and mortality in individuals without HF. Hypertension is the most important identified cause of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), with a prevalence of 60% to 89% in the HFpEF population, and cardiac structural and functional abnormalities with hypertension, such as left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, form the substrate for HFpEF most commonly seen in older adults, especially women. Although blood pressure-lowering has not been associated with improved outcomes in trials of individuals with HFpEF, uncontrolled blood pressure may precipitate acute HF decompensation, and individuals with HFpEF can have an exaggerated hypertensive response to exercise. Appropriate management of HFpEF-associated comorbidities is extrapolated from relevant guidelines, and the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline for the management of hypertension offers a Class 1 recommendation that adults with HFpEF should have blood pressure medications.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography and for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction diagnosis: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^1165Skcq]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — clinical diagnosis requires the presence of signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (HF) and an echocardiographic determination of normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) generally accepted to be ≥ 50% in the absence of other cardiac or noncardiac causes for the patient's symptoms. The recognition of the clinical HF syndrome is the first step in diagnosing HFpEF; although the Framingham criteria demonstrate excellent specificity for the diagnosis of HF, they lack sensitivity, particularly in elderly patients who may have not had acute HF decompensation, and therefore a patient may have HFpEF even in the absence of satisfying specific clinical criteria for HF. Early presenting symptoms of HFpEF may be relatively nonspecific, including exertional dyspnea, exercise intolerance, or fatigue, and clinical suspicion should be further raised if these symptoms occur with one or more commonly associated risk factors, including history of hypertension, elderly age (> 60 years), obesity (body mass index > 30 kg/m2), history of diabetes mellitus, or history of atrial fibrillation.

Antiobesity medications (AOM) in heart failure with preserved/reduced ejection fraction (HFpEF/HFrEF) — the benefit of AOM in HFpEF is not clear, and potential gastrointestinal intolerances with possible effects on blood pressure and volume status indicate a need for better understanding of safety and efficacy in individuals with recently decompensated heart failure. In HFrEF, the potential effects of some AOM are of specific importance; concerns have been raised about the safety of GLP-1 receptor agonist use with liraglutide and exenatide, possibly related to increased heart rate, whereas larger cardiovascular outcomes trials did not identify risk for worse outcomes with liraglutide or semaglutide. Accordingly, the safety and efficacy of AOM in those with obesity and HFrEF requires further investigation.

### Empagliflozin and linagliptin (Glyxambi) [^111y1yM2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Empagliflozin

Increases in Serum Creatinine and Decreases in eGFR: Initiation of empagliflozin causes an increase in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR within weeks of starting therapy and then these changes stabilize. In a trial of patients with moderate renal impairment, larger mean changes were observed. In a long-term cardiovascular outcomes trial, the increase in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR generally did not exceed 0.1 mg/dL and -9.0 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively, at Week 4, and reversed after treatment discontinuation, suggesting acute hemodynamic changes may play a role in the renal function changes observed with empagliflozin.

Increase in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C): Dose-related increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were observed in patients treated with empagliflozin. LDL-C increased by 2.3%, 4.6%, and 6.5% in patients treated with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively. The range of mean baseline LDL-C levels was 90.3 to 90.6 mg/dL across treatment groups.

Increase in Hematocrit: Median hematocrit decreased by 1.3% in placebo and increased by 2.8% in empagliflozin 10 mg and 2.8% in empagliflozin 25 mg treated patients. At the end of treatment, 0.6%, 2.7%, and 3.5% of patients with hematocrits initially within the reference range had values above the upper limit of the reference range with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^115JdpUi]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation and titration of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) should follow trial-tested dosing. SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials (e.g., 100 mg for canagliflozin, 10 mg for dapagliflozin, 10 mg for empagliflozin), and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. Among GLP-1RAs, dulaglutide, liraglutide, or injectable semaglutide have demonstrated CV benefit to reduce the risk of MACE, and a GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose and up-titrated stepwise to the doses used in the trials or the otherwise maximal tolerated dose. Prior to initiating T2D therapies aimed at CV disease risk reduction, a detailed patient-clinician risk discussion is recommended, including risks, benefits, drug-drug interactions, safety, patient preferences, and cost considerations.

XIGDUO XR

No XIGDUO XR dosage change is recommended based on age. More frequent assessment of renal function is recommended in elderly patients.

Dapagliflozin

A total of 1424 (24%) of the 5936 dapagliflozin-treated patients were 65 years and older and 207 (3.5%) patients were 75 years and older in a pool of 21 double-blind, controlled, clinical trials assessing the efficacy of dapagliflozin in improving glycemic control. After controlling for level of renal function (eGFR), efficacy was similar for patients under age 65 years and those 65 years and older. In patients ≥ 65 years of age, a higher proportion of patients treated with dapagliflozin for glycemic control had adverse reactions of hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In the DAPA-HF, DELIVER and DAPA-CKD trials, safety and efficacy were similar for patients aged 65 years and younger and those older than 65 in both the overall population and in the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the DAPA HF trial, 2714 (57%) out of 4744 patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) were older than 65 years. Out of 2139 patients with HFrEF and type 2 diabetes mellitus, 1211 (57%) were older than 65 years. In the DELIVER trial, 4759 (76%) out of 6263 patients with heart failure (LVEF > 40%) were older than 65 years. Out of 2806 patients with LVEF > 40% and type 2 diabetes mellitus, 2072 (74%) were older than 65 years. In the DAPA-CKD trial, 1818 (42%) out of 4304 patients with chronic kidney disease were older than 65 years. Out of 2906 patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus, 1399 (48%) were older than 65 years.

Metformin HCl

Controlled clinical trials of metformin did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. In general, dosage selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — a de novo angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) approach is now preferred with close follow-up and serial assessments, and for those with contraindications to even low-dose ARNI (e.g., systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg), consideration should be given for an ACE inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) at very low doses; when initiating ARNI, the Writing Committee recommends that the decision occurs within a framework of shared decision-making, and if ARNI is not accessible because of cost, an ACE inhibitor/ARB should be used to reduce morbidity and mortality, with patients who later find ARNI cost-prohibitive transitioned to an ACE inhibitor/ARB.

### Enalapril maleate (Vasotec) [^112xxffo]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Heart Failure

VASOTEC is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic heart failure, usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. In the placebo-controlled studies that demonstrated improved survival, patients were titrated as tolerated up to 40 mg, administered in two divided doses.

The recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg. The recommended dosing range is 2.5 to 20 mg given twice a day. Doses should be titrated upward, as tolerated, over a period of a few days or weeks. The maximum daily dose administered in clinical trials was 40 mg in divided doses.

After the initial dose of VASOTEC, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). If possible, the dose of any concomitant diuretic should be reduced which may diminish the likelihood of hypotension. The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of VASOTEC does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective management of the hypotension.

Asymptomatic Left Ventricular Dysfunction

In the trial that demonstrated efficacy, patients were started on 2.5 mg twice daily and were titrated as tolerated to the targeted daily dose of 20 mg (in divided doses).

After the initial dose of VASOTEC, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). If possible, the dose of any concomitant diuretic should be reduced which may diminish the likelihood of hypotension. The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of VASOTEC does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective management of the hypotension.

Dosage Adjustment in Patients with Heart Failure and Renal Impairment or Hyponatremia

In patients with heart failure who have hyponatremia (serum sodium less than 130 mEq/L) or with serum creatinine greater than 1.6 mg/dL, therapy should be initiated at 2.5 mg daily under close medical supervision (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Heart Failure, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). The dose may be increased to 2.5 mg b.i.d., then 5 mg b.i.d. and higher as needed, usually at intervals of four days or more if at the time of dosage adjustment there is not excessive hypotension or significant deterioration of renal function. The maximum daily dose is 40 mg.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) in HFpEF — prevalence, risk, and management approach: "The prevalence of AF is higher in individuals with HFpEF compared with HFrEF", and in Framingham data "prevalent AF was more strongly associated with incident HFpEF and prevalent HF was associated with a 2-fold increase in incident AF". AF is "a common contributing factor to worse functional status and an increased risk of hospitalization and mortality in individuals with HF", and therefore "the presence of AF should denote a possible higher-risk HFpEF phenotype that may require more frequent monitoring and management strategies, such as implantable hemodynamic monitoring and/or tricuspid valve repair". "Due to the lack of clinical trial data in persons with HFpEF, the comprehensive care of AF can be extrapolated from the ACC/AHA guidelines for AF", and "no significant benefit on cardiovascular outcomes has been noted with a rate vs a pharmacological rhythm control strategy, including in those with HFpEF", so "an individualized approach to symptomatic individuals with HFpEF and AF may be needed". For persistent symptoms or inadequate rate control, "a trial of pharmacological rhythm control to assess symptomatic response with sinus rhythm is reasonable". "Dronedarone may be used for pharmacological rhythm control", supported by post hoc ATHENA findings, and EAST subgroup data "suggested benefit of the early, predominantly pharmacological rhythm control strategy compared with rate control in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events".

In CANVAS, canagliflozin reduced the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke (26.9 vs 31.5 participants per 1,000 person-years; HR 0.86 [95% CI 0.75–0.97]) but was associated with increased lower limb amputation (6.3 vs 3.4 participants per 1,000 person-years; HR 1.97 [95% CI 1.41–2.75]); other trials did not show a significant increase in lower-limb amputations, fractures, AKI, or hyperkalemia relative to placebo. In DECLARE–TIMI 58, dapagliflozin met criteria for noninferiority for MACE and lowered hospitalization for heart failure (4.9% vs 5.8%; HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.73–0.95; P = 0.005]; HR for hospitalization for heart failure 0.73 [95% CI 0.61–0.88]) without a difference in cardiovascular death. In VERTIS CV, ertugliflozin met prespecified noninferiority for major adverse cardiovascular events (11.9% vs 11.9%; HR 0.97 [95% CI 0.85–1.11]; P < 0.001) but was not superior to placebo for key secondary outcomes.

14.2 SCORED Study

The SCORED (Effects of Sotagliflozin on Cardiovascular and Renal Events in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Moderately Impaired Renal Function) study (NCT03315143) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (A1C > 7%), chronic kidney disease (eGFR 25 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), and additional cardiovascular risk factors, such as a history of heart failure, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, or elevated cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers, to determine if INPEFA reduces the risk of total occurrence of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent heart failure visit. Of the 10,584 randomized patients, 5,292 were randomized to INPEFA and 5,292 to placebo.

The dose of study drug was to be up-titrated from 200 mg to 400 mg sotagliflozin or matching placebo as soon as 4 weeks or up until 6 months after initiation of treatment. The dose was increased to 400 mg once daily for 3,934 patients (74%) in the INPEFA group and for 3,987 patients (75%) in the placebo group. The median time to up-titration was 29 days. Up-titration was to be performed based on the judgment of the investigator, who considered whether the patient's clinical condition was satisfactory, whether the drug was well tolerated, and whether AEs typical of SGLT2 inhibitors had occurred, such as those associated with volume depletion.

### Dapagliflozin (Farxiga) [^114Fd7d3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

FARXIGA (dapagliflozin) is indicated:

To reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression.

To reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent heart failure visit in adults with heart failure.
To reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and either established cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors.
As an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Limitations of Use

FARXIGA is not recommended for use to improve glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
FARXIGA is not recommended for use to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with an eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. FARXIGA is likely to be ineffective in this setting based upon its mechanism of action.
FARXIGA is not recommended for the treatment of chronic kidney disease in patients with polycystic kidney disease or patients requiring or with a recent history of immunosuppressive therapy for kidney disease. FARXIGA is not expected to be effective in these populations.

### Metoprolol succinate (Toprol) [^114tU4gP]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.1 Hypertension

Adults: The usual initial dosage is 25 to 100 mg daily in a single dose. Adjust dosage at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied.

Pediatric Hypertensive Patients ≥ 6 Years of age: The recommended starting dose of TOPROL-XL is 1 mg/kg once daily, but the maximum initial dose should not exceed 50 mg once daily. Adjust dosage according to blood pressure response. Doses above 2 mg/kg (or in excess of 200 mg) once daily have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

TOPROL-XL has not been studied in pediatric patients < 6 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

2.2 Angina Pectoris

Individualize the dosage of TOPROL-XL. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, given in a single dose. Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is a pronounced slowing of the heart rate. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1–2 weeks [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

2.3 Heart Failure

Dosage must be individualized and closely monitored during up-titration. Prior to initiation of TOPROL-XL, stabilize the dose of other heart failure drug therapy. The recommended starting dose of TOPROL-XL is 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA Class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. Double the dose every two weeks to the highest dosage level tolerated by the patient or up to 200 mg of TOPROL-XL. Initial difficulty with titration should not preclude later attempts to introduce TOPROL-XL. If patients experience symptomatic bradycardia, reduce the dose of TOPROL-XL. If transient worsening of heart failure occurs, consider treating with increased doses of diuretics, lowering the dose of TOPROL-XL, or temporarily discontinuing it. The dose of TOPROL-XL should not be increased until symptoms of worsening heart failure have been stabilized.

2.4 Administration

TOPROL-XL tablets are scored and can be divided; however, do not crush or chew the whole or half tablet.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) — in some patients with diastolic dysfunction and normal ejection fraction (EF), including those with and without HFpEF, LV global longitudinal function is reduced; abnormal LV longitudinal systolic function can be detected by speckle‑tracking measurement of GLS; although not an index of LV diastolic function, reduced LV GLS is one of the criteria used for HFpEF evaluation and is associated with worse outcomes in cardiovascular diseases associated with diastolic dysfunction.

14.2 Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease

EMPA-REG OUTCOME was a multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind parallel group trial that compared the risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) between empagliflozin and placebo when these were added to and used concomitantly with standard of care treatments for diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic CV disease. Concomitant antidiabetic medications were kept stable for the first 12 weeks of the trial. Thereafter, antidiabetic and atherosclerotic therapies could be adjusted, at the discretion of investigators, to ensure participants were treated according to the standard care for these diseases.

A total of 7,020 patients were treated (empagliflozin 10 mg = 2,345; empagliflozin 25 mg = 2,342; placebo = 2,333) and followed for a median of 3.1 years. Approximately 72% of the trial population was White, 22% was Asian, and 5% was Black or African American. The mean age was 63 years and approximately 72% were male.

All patients in the trial had inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus at baseline (HbA1c greater than or equal to 7%). The mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.1% and 57% of participants had diabetes mellitus for more than 10 years. Approximately 31%, 22% and 20% reported a past history of neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy to investigators, respectively and the mean eGFR was 74 mL/min/1.73 m2. At baseline, patients were treated with one (~30%) or more (~70%) antidiabetic medications including metformin (74%), insulin (48%), sulfonylurea (43%) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (11%).

Empagliflozin lowered progression of kidney disease and death from cardiovascular causes (HR 0.72 [95% CI 0.64–0.82]; P < 0.001). Notably, while glucose-lowering effects are blunted with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2, renal and cardiovascular benefits were still seen at eGFR levels as low as < 20 mL/min/1.73 m^2 with no significant change in long-term eGFR decline compared with standard of care.

### 2024 update to the 2020 ACC / AHA clinical performance and quality measures for adults with heart failure: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on performance measures [^115mdt1U]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2024). High credibility.

Top 10 take-home messages for adults with heart failure — scope and key additions to measures: This document describes performance measures for heart failure that are appropriate for public reporting or pay-for-performance programs and the performance measures are taken from the "2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure" and are selected from the strongest recommendations (Class 1 or 3). Quality measures are also provided that are not yet ready for public reporting or pay-for-performance but might be useful to clinicians and health care organizations for quality improvement. For all measures, if the clinician determines the care is not appropriate for the patient based on objective evidence or if the patient declines treatment, that patient is excluded; patients after heart transplantation or left ventricular assist device placement are excluded. Additions include blood pressure control in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction as a performance measure and the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors added as a performance measure for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and as a quality measure for heart failure with mildly reduced and preserved ejection fraction. To optimize medical therapy, a performance measure is added for initiation of optimal guideline-directed medical therapy in hospitalized patients, and quality measures are added for optimization prior to intervention for chronic secondary severe mitral regurgitation and for continuation of therapy for patients with heart failure with improved ejection fraction. Additional quality measures emphasize targeting both known risks for cardiovascular disease and social determinants of health plus patient-centered counseling regarding contraception and pregnancy risks for individuals with cardiomyopathy, and a performance measure is added for a monoclonal protein screen to exclude light chain amyloidosis when interpreting a bone scintigraphy scan assessing for transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis.

### Finerenone (Kerendia) [^111jkF7D]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Heart Failure (LVEF ≥ 40%)

FINEARTS-HF (NCT: 04435626) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in adult patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II–IV) with documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 40%. Patients were required to have an eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73m2and serum potassium ≤ 5.0 mEq/L at screening and randomization and were receiving background heart failure medical treatment, including diuretics. The primary endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular (CV) death and total (first and recurrent) heart failure events comprised of hospitalization for heart failure and urgent heart failure visits.

In FINEARTS-HF, 6001 patients were analyzed; 3003 were randomized to Kerendia and 2998 were randomized to placebo and were followed for a median of 2.7 years. The study included 3247 (54%) patients with a heart failure event in the past 3 months, including 1219 (20%) patients randomized during the hospitalization or within 7 days from the heart failure event. Patients with eGFR ≥ 25 to < 60 mL/min/1.73m2initiated Kerendia 10 mg and patients with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2initiated Kerendia 20 mg, and both groups were titrated up to a target dose of Kerendia 20 mg and 40 mg, respectively. At month 6, approximately 65% of the patients reached their target dose. The trial population was 79% White, 17% Asian, and 1.5% Black. The mean age at enrollment was 72 years and 46% of patients were female. At baseline, the mean LVEF was 53%, with 64% of patients having an LVEF ≥ 50%, and 69% and 30% of patients were NYHA class II and III, respectively. Mean blood pressure was 129/75 mmHg and mean body mass index (BMI) was 30 kg/m2. The median NT-proBNP was 1041 pg/mL, the mean eGFR was 62 mL/min/1.73m2with 48% of patients having an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m2. Atrial fibrillation was present on screening/baseline ECG for 38% of patients and 41% had diabetes mellitus. The majority of patients were on loop diuretics (87%), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (79%), or an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) (9%), and 14% were on sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.

### Enalapril maleate [^114Zmf1T]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart Failure

Enalapril maleate tablets are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic heart failure, usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. In the placebo-controlled studies that demonstrated improved survival, patients were titrated as tolerated up to 40 mg, administered in two divided doses.

The recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg. The recommended dosing range is 2.5 to 20 mg given twice a day. Doses should be titrated upward, as tolerated, over a period of a few days or weeks. The maximum daily dose administered in clinical trials was 40 mg in divided doses.

After the initial dose of enalapril maleate tablets, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). If possible, the dose of any concomitant diuretic should be reduced which may diminish the likelihood of hypotension. The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of enalapril maleate tablets does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective management of the hypotension.

Asymptomatic Left Ventricular Dysfunction

In the trial that demonstrated efficacy, patients were started on 2.5 mg twice daily and were titrated as tolerated to the targeted daily dose of 20 mg (in divided doses).

After the initial dose of enalapril maleate tablets, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). If possible, the dose of any concomitant diuretic should be reduced which may diminish the likelihood of hypotension. The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of enalapril maleate tablets does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective management of the hypotension.

Dosage Adjustment in Patients with Heart Failure and Renal Impairment or Hyponatremia

In patients with heart failure who have hyponatremia (serum sodium less than 130 mEq/L) or with serum creatinine greater than 1.6 mg/dL, therapy should be initiated at 2.5 mg daily under close medical supervision (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Heart Failure, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). The dose may be increased to 2.5 mg b.i.d., then 5 mg b.i.d. and higher as needed, usually at intervals of four days or more if at the time of dosage adjustment there is not excessive hypotension or significant deterioration of renal function. The maximum daily dose is 40 mg.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2024). High credibility.

ACC/AHA heart failure performance measures — six new quality measures focus on sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors across the spectrum of ejection fraction, assessment of social determinants of health, patient-centered counseling regarding contraception and risks of pregnancy in individuals with cardiomyopathy, continuation of guideline-directed medical therapy in patients with heart failure with improved ejection fraction, optimization of guideline-directed medical therapy in patients with left ventricular dysfunction prior to any intervention for chronic secondary severe mitral regurgitation, and bone scintigraphy in suspected cardiac amyloidosis interpreted only in the context of a monoclonal protein screen. The use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in mildly reduced and preserved ejection fraction is included as a quality measure even though it is a Class 2a recommendation in the 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA heart failure guideline, and this Class 2a recommendation was based on a single randomized controlled trial available at the time, with a subsequent second randomized controlled trial confirming benefit and a resulting Class 1 recommendation in the European Society of Cardiology heart failure guideline. An update to the 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA heart failure guideline would be needed to determine if this measure could be upgraded to a performance measure, and readers are directed to Appendix A for specifications.

Pulmonary artery pressure monitoring in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — CardioMEMS evidence and use: In the CHAMPION trial, care guided by the CardioMEMS device significantly reduced heart failure (HF) hospitalizations, including in a prespecified subgroup with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 40%, whereas in the blinded GUIDE-HF trial, hemodynamic-guided management did not lower the composite endpoint of mortality and total HF events overall, despite a pre-COVID-19 analysis showing a nearly 20% reduction in HF hospitalizations or urgent visits in the intervention group. The GUIDE-HF cohort included symptomatic HF with either a prior hospitalization or elevated natriuretic peptides, and 31% had an LVEF of 50% or higher. The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA HF guidelines state that PA-sensor monitoring has a Class 2b recommendation for remote pulmonary artery (PA) monitoring. Given associations with reduced HF hospitalizations, this therapy may be most useful for HFpEF subsets who experience ≥ 1 hospitalization with persistent New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), have significant lability in volume status despite close ambulatory monitoring, have cardiorenal syndrome, or have comorbidities such as obesity or chronic lung disease that complicate dyspnea assessment. Placement of the CardioMEMS device should be performed in a center with the ability to regularly monitor remotely transmitted data, and other device procedures should be considered only within the context of clinical trials.

### 2017 AHA / ACC / HRS guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^112citmq]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk and testing: Nearly half of patients with heart failure have preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), these patients tend to be older with more comorbidities than those with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and although SCD rates are lower than in HFrEF, nearly a quarter of deaths in HFpEF are sudden. Studies exploring noninvasive risk factors for SCD in HFpEF do not identify consistent predictors except ischemic heart disease, and consequently there is no accepted noninvasive test to identify high-risk HFpEF patients; invasive risk stratification with an electrophysiological study shows promise. Evidence was deemed insufficient to support a formal recommendation, but the pros and cons of an electrophysiological study can reasonably be considered in select HFpEF patients with ischemic heart disease who have symptoms suggestive of a ventricular arrhythmia (VA).

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1173egCy]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes and heart failure — epidemiology and phenotypes are highlighted as follows: Diabetes is an important risk factor for incident heart failure, which is at least twofold more prevalent in people with diabetes compared with those without diabetes and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. People with diabetes may present with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF), or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Combined conditions including excess body weight and hypertension often precede the development of HFpEF and have been implicated in its pathophysiology. Coronary artery disease and prior MI are major risk factors and a cause of myocardial injury leading to HFrEF, and people with diabetes are also at risk for structural heart disease and HFrEF in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^116eWX18]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Nevirapine (NVP) infant dosing approvals and modeling caution — The NVP dose for infants ≥ 32 to < 37 weeks' gestation at birth and infants < 37 weeks' gestation at birth are not yet approved by the FDA, and the FDA has also not approved a dose of NVP for infants aged < 1 month; the doses for infants ≥ 32 to < 34 weeks' gestational age at birth are based on modeling and might underestimate potential toxicity because the doses used to develop the model were lower than the doses now recommended.

### Empagliflozin reduces hospitalization for heart failure with… [^112TUDXJ]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Does empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, safely improve outcomes for patients who have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Bottom Line In patients who have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, empagliflozin, 10 mg once daily, reduces the likelihood of hospitalization for heart failure. There is no effect on cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. The drug costs $529 per month in the United States and $82 per month in Canada. In the United States, the drug is not cost-effective, and would require $375, 000 to prevent one hospitalization; in Canada, that cost is $58, 000.

Synopsis This industry-sponsored trial identified patients with New York Heart Association Class II through IV heart failure, an ejection fraction of at least 40%, and an N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level of more than 300 pg per mL. Groups were balanced at the beginning of the study, with a mean age of 72 years. Approximately one-third of patients in each group had ejection fractions of 40% to 50%, 50% to 60%, and 60% or higher, and 82% had Class II heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Analysis was by intention to treat, with 77% of patients completing the trial and a median follow-up of 26 months. For the remainder of the patients, the trial medication was stopped for a reason other than death, presumably because of adverse events, although this was not specified by the authors. In an exploratory subgroup analysis, benefit was greater for those with lower ejection fractions.

There was no significant difference in the likelihood of cardiovascular death or all-cause mortality, and no significant differences in renal outcomes or hospitalization for any cause.

### Empagliflozin and diuretic use in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction… [^116GmPPE]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

In the EMPEROR-Preserved trial, approximately 80% of the patients were treated with diuretics at baseline, which is similar to other contemporary HFpEF and HF with reduced ejection fraction cohorts. 7–11 To our knowledge, the current study is the first to delineate characteristics of diuretic use in patients with HFpEF. The most common furosemide-equivalent dose of diuretics in EMPEROR-Preserved was 40 mg, similar to patients with HFrEF in the DAPA-HF trial. 7 Patients who were not treated with diuretics at baseline had the most favorable clinical profile and better outcomes. Higher baseline doses of diuretics were associated with more severe HF, poorer HRQoL, greater burden of comorbidities, and a higher risk of adverse outcomes. However, the benefit of empagliflozin on the primary outcome, first HHF, total HHF, eGFR slope, and HRQoL was consistent regardless of baseline diuretic status or dose.

This is in line with findings from HFrEF patients in the DAPA-HF trial, 7 where baseline diuretic therapy did not modify the benefit of dapagliflozin on these outcomes. The results of this analysis have important clinical implications. In patients who are not taking diuretics, SGLT2 inhibitors should not be withheld due to concerns of destabilizing the euvolemic status, as empagliflozin improved clinical outcomes without increasing volume depletion events in this population. At the time an SGLT2 inhibitor is initiated, most patients with HFpEF would not require a change in diuretic dose. In this analysis, empagliflozin use was associated with improvement in HHF or CV death, first HHF, total HHF, eGFR slope, and KCCQ scores in patients with HFpEF, regardless of background diuretics use or dose. Empagliflozin was associated with a slightly increased risk of volume depletion in patients taking diuretics.

Empagliflozin also reduced the likelihood of diuretic initiation and dose escalation and increased the likelihood of diuretic de-escalation and permanent discontinuation.
