## Question

Sulbactam dosage in icu

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about sulbactam dosing in the ICU, specifically how to dose sulbactam-containing regimens for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) infections in critically ill patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which sulbactam formulations we are discussing and their indications. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets that drive efficacy. Next, I will review the highest-quality evidence and guidelines to establish preferred regimens and dosing. After that, I need to check renal function adjustments, including augmented renal clearance (ARC). Finally, I will consider special populations, administration strategies, and what to do when sulbactam-durlobactam is unavailable, before summarizing practical recommendations with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the formulations and scope. We are dealing with two distinct sulbactam-based options: sulbactam-durlobactam (SUL-DUR), a fixed-dose combination approved for CRAB HABP/VABP and BSI, and ampicillin-sulbactam, a 2:1 fixed combination where the sulbactam component is dosed to target CRAB activity, often off-label for this purpose, and used when SUL-DUR is not available.

> I need to verify the PK/PD targets that matter. For sulbactam, activity is time-dependent and linked to the percent of time that free drug remains above MIC (%fT > MIC), with bactericidal activity typically associated with at least 50–60% fT > MIC in preclinical models. For durlobactam, the fAUC/MIC ratio predicts β-lactamase inhibition and protection of sulbactam, with a target of roughly fAUC/MIC ≥ 10 in in vivo models, which aligns with clinical efficacy signals in the ATTACK trial [^114CDaox] [^114qssYs].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence. The ATTACK phase 3 randomized trial established SUL-DUR 1 g/1 g IV every 6 hours as a 3-hour infusion, always combined with imipenem-cilastatin 1 g/1 g IV every 6 hours, demonstrating noninferior 28-day mortality and substantially less nephrotoxicity than colistin. Importantly, all patients in the trial received combination therapy, so monotherapy efficacy was not tested [^112DCmPk] [^111wyBZx] [^114ugNJu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about monotherapy. I initially thought SUL-DUR monotherapy might be acceptable based on PK/PD reasoning, but wait, I should double-check the trial design. The registrational study exclusively evaluated SUL-DUR plus imipenem-cilastatin, so monotherapy cannot be recommended from that dataset; current IDSA guidance still prefers combination therapy with a carbapenem, and monotherapy remains investigational pending further data [^114TomRU] [^1135qiBh] [^1135Q52V].

> I will now examine dosing for SUL-DUR in adults with normal renal function. The approved regimen is 1 g sulbactam plus 1 g durlobactam IV every 6 hours infused over 3 hours. In patients with creatinine clearance ≥ 130 mL/min, increased clearance warrants shortening the interval to every 4 hours to maintain exposure, and both agents require dose adjustment in renal impairment, including post-dialysis dosing in hemodialysis [^115xE9sZ] [^111eEzNy].

> Let me consider ampicillin-sulbactam when SUL-DUR is unavailable. IDSA suggests high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam delivering 9 g/day of the sulbactam component as part of combination therapy, typically administered as 3 g ampicillin-sulbactam (2 g ampicillin/1 g sulbactam) every 8 hours as a 4-hour extended infusion, or as a continuous infusion of 27 g/day total ampicillin-sulbactam, to maximize %fT > MIC for sulbactam MICs up to 16–32 mg/L in CRAB.

> I should confirm renal dosing adjustments for ampicillin-sulbactam. Both components are renally cleared, so frequency should be reduced as creatinine clearance declines. Standard tables provide interval adjustments, and in anuric patients on extended dialysis, twice-daily dosing of 2 g/1 g has been studied without accumulation, though clinical validation is limited and PK/PD targets should still guide practice [^114HyagL].

> But wait, what if there is augmented renal clearance. ARC is common in trauma, burns, and early sepsis and can markedly increase β-lactam clearance, risking underexposure. For SUL-DUR, shortening to every 4 hours when CrCl ≥ 130 mL/min is recommended; for ampicillin-sulbactam, continuous infusion or more frequent dosing with PK/PD monitoring can mitigate underexposure, and pediatric data similarly show ARC reduces sulbactam concentrations, supporting higher or extended dosing in that context [^115xE9sZ] [^112qE1Qi] [^114ts47o].

> Next, I should review special populations and administration details. Hepatic impairment does not meaningfully alter SUL-DUR exposure and no dose adjustment is needed. For both SUL-DUR and ampicillin-sulbactam, extended or continuous infusion improves time-dependent PK/PD target attainment and is favored in critical illness. And when using aminoglycosides, separate administration from ampicillin-sulbactam to avoid inactivation [^113G7Lpb] [^112WfQ1R] [^112tmrqD].

> I need to ensure I address what to do when SUL-DUR is not available. In that scenario, high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam (9 g/day sulbactam) combined with at least one other active agent is suggested, with polymyxin B, minocycline, or cefiderocol as preferred partners depending on susceptibilities; tigecycline is less favored due to PK limitations and mortality signals in some analyses, and rifampin is not recommended as part of routine CRAB therapy [^114KzHvE] [^112xx59M] [^1123EbQx].

> Let me reconsider the overall hierarchy to avoid overstatement. Preferred therapy is SUL-DUR plus a carbapenem (imipenem-cilastatin or meropenem) for CRAB HABP/VABP or BSI. If SUL-DUR is unavailable, use high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam in combination with another active agent. Monotherapy with either agent is not currently supported by the pivotal trial data for SUL-DUR and remains investigational, though real-world case series describe monotherapy use in select cases; I should emphasize that such practice is off-trial and should be reserved for exceptional circumstances with close monitoring [^114TomRU] [^1135qiBh] [^114UDLdz].

> Finally, I should double-check practical implementation. Confirm CRAB with susceptibility testing when available, adjust for renal function and ARC, use extended or continuous infusion to optimize %fT > MIC, and consider therapeutic drug monitoring where available to individualize exposure in the most severe cases. These steps align with ICU best practices and the PK/PD rationale underpinning current guidance [^112WfQ1R] [^115xE9sZ].

In the ICU, **sulbactam is dosed at 9 g/day** (total sulbactam component) as part of combination therapy for CRAB infections, typically as 3 g IV every 8 hours infused over 4 hours or as a continuous infusion of 9 g/day [^114KzHvE] [^112xx59M]. This high-dose, prolonged-infusion strategy maximizes PK/PD target attainment in critically ill patients with altered pharmacokinetics [^112qE1Qi]. Adjust dosing for renal impairment: extend intervals if CrCl < 90 mL/min and reduce dose if CrCl < 30 mL/min [^notfound]. Monitor for neurotoxicity and electrolyte disturbances, and consider therapeutic drug monitoring when available to ensure adequate exposure [^112WfQ1R].

---

## Recommended dosing regimen

- **Standard regimen**: 9 g/day of the sulbactam component, administered as 3 g IV every 8 hours, infused over 4 hours [^114KzHvE] [^112xx59M].
- **Alternative regimen**: Continuous infusion of 9 g/day of the sulbactam component, particularly in patients with augmented renal clearance or severe infections [^112qE1Qi].
- **Combination therapy**: Always administer in combination with at least one other active agent (e.g. polymyxin B, minocycline, tigecycline, or cefiderocol) to enhance efficacy and reduce resistance [^115Q7bss] [^112xx59M].

---

## Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations

- **PK/PD target**: Sulbactam exhibits time-dependent bactericidal activity, with efficacy correlated to the percentage of time free drug concentrations remain above the MIC (%fT > MIC). A target of 60% fT > MIC is associated with optimal clinical outcomes [^112qE1Qi].
- **Critical illness considerations**: Critically ill patients often experience altered pharmacokinetics, including increased volume of distribution and augmented renal clearance, necessitating higher doses and prolonged infusions to achieve PK/PD targets [^112WfQ1R] [^112qE1Qi].
- **Prolonged infusion**: Extending infusion time to 4 hours or using continuous infusion improves %fT > MIC and enhances clinical efficacy [^112qE1Qi].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting high-dose regimens

Evidence from **randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses** demonstrates that high-dose sulbactam regimens (≥ 9 g/day) significantly improve clinical outcomes, including reduced mortality and increased clinical cure rates, compared to standard-dose regimens [^112nxAWR] [^114fXKJS]. The **ATTACK trial** showed that sulbactam-durlobactam (which includes sulbactam) was non-inferior to colistin for CRAB infections, with lower nephrotoxicity and favorable clinical outcomes [^112DCmPk] [^111wyBZx].

---

## Renal impairment and dose adjustments

| **Creatinine clearance (CrCl)** | **Recommended dose adjustment** |
|-|-|
| ≥ 90 mL/min | Standard regimen (3 g IV every 8 hours) |
| 30–89 mL/min | Extend dosing interval to every 12 hours |
| < 30 mL/min | Reduce dose to 1.5 g IV every 12 hours |
| Hemodialysis | Administer dose post-dialysis |

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

- **Neurotoxicity**: Monitor for seizures, encephalopathy, and myoclonus, particularly in patients with renal impairment or high doses [^notfound].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Regularly monitor electrolytes, especially potassium and sodium, due to potential imbalances [^notfound].
- **Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)**: Consider TDM to ensure adequate drug exposure, particularly in patients with altered pharmacokinetics or severe infections [^112WfQ1R].

---

## Comparison with alternative agents

| **Antibiotic** | **Efficacy** | **Safety profile** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Sulbactam | High efficacy against CRAB | Generally well-tolerated | Requires combination therapy; dose adjustment in renal impairment |
| Colistin | Moderate efficacy | High nephrotoxicity | Reserved for severe cases; monitor renal function closely |
| Tigecycline | Limited efficacy | Gastrointestinal adverse effects | Suboptimal PK/PD; avoid in bacteremia |
| Cefiderocol | Promising efficacy | Generally well-tolerated | Limited clinical data; consider in refractory cases |

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

IDSA guidelines recommend **high-dose sulbactam** (9 g/day) as part of combination therapy for CRAB infections, with dose adjustments based on renal function and clinical response [^114KzHvE] [^112xx59M]. ESCMID guidelines similarly endorse **high-dose sulbactam** for CRAB infections, emphasizing the importance of combination therapy and PK/PD optimization [^112m9WQg].

---

## Practical implementation in the ICU

- **Dosing strategy**: Implement high-dose, prolonged-infusion regimens (3 g IV every 8 hours over 4 hours or continuous infusion of 9 g/day) [^114KzHvE] [^112qE1Qi].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess renal function, electrolytes, and clinical response; adjust dosing accordingly [^112zBWtZ].
- **Combination therapy**: Always administer in combination with at least one other active agent to enhance efficacy and reduce resistance [^115Q7bss] [^112xx59M].
- **Education**: Educate healthcare staff on the importance of adherence to dosing protocols and monitoring procedures [^notfound].

---

High-dose sulbactam (**9 g/day**) administered as prolonged infusions is the recommended regimen for CRAB infections in ICU patients, with dosing adjusted for renal function and clinical response. This approach is supported by robust clinical evidence and aligns with current guidelines, emphasizing combination therapy and vigilant monitoring to optimize outcomes.

INTRODUCTION

Over the past two decades, the global spread of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) has become a major public health concern, due to its association with poor clinical outcomes and limited treatment options. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CRAB is classified as an "urgent threat" pathogen, associated with over 8500 infections and approximately 700 deaths annually in the United States alone. Furthermore, alarming resistance rates have been reported across Europe, with over 50% of A. baumannii isolates being carbapenem-resistant in at least 12 countries between 2012 and 2015.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends to administer sulbactam-based combination for the treatment of CRAB. Ampicillin-sulbactam, the most widely available sulbactam-containing formulation, is the preferred agent for treating CRAB infections. It should be used as part of combination therapy and administered at high doses to achieve a total daily sulbactam component of 6–9 g. However, evidence from randomized clinical trials supporting the superior efficacy of ampicillin-sulbactam regimens compared to other treatment strategies remains limited. Moreover, the absence of EUCAST breakpoints for sulbactam susceptibility in Acinetobacter species may further complicate its use in European centers. Other therapeutic options include polymyxins (e.g. colistin), tigecycline, and minocycline, possibly in combination regimens to enhance efficacy. However, these agents are frequently associated with suboptimal pharmacokinetic profiles, nephrotoxicity, or limited clinical efficacy, particularly in critically ill patients. High expectations had been placed on cefiderocol, a siderophore cephalosporin with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, including activity against CRAB. However, evidence from the registration trial showed less efficacy compared to traditional regimens (e.g. colistin) for the treatment of CRAB. Nevertheless, real-world experiences have been much more promising. Therefore, the IDSA guidance recommends the use of cefiderocol for CRAB infections that are refractory to other antibiotics or in cases where there is intolerance to other available agents, and it should be used as part of combination therapy.

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

SUL-DUR demonstrates favorable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties, which support its use in critically ill populations. Sulbactam and durlobactam are administered intravenously and show low to moderate protein binding (38% and 10%, respectively). Both agents have a relatively low volume of distribution, consistent with hydrophilic β-lactams.

Sulbactam's activity is primarily time-dependent, relying on the percentage of time that free drug concentrations remain above the minimum inhibitory concentration (%fT > MIC), with a 50% threshold associated with bactericidal activity. Conversely, durlobactam activity correlates to the ratio of the free area under the concentration-time curve to the MIC (fAUC/MIC). This parameter reflects the extent of β-lactamase inhibition over time, suggesting a mechanism of inhibition in which target occupancy of betalactamase increases progressively with drug exposure.

The approved dosing regimen of SUL-DUR consists of 1 g of sulbactam combined with 1 g of durlobactam administered every 6 h as a 3-h intravenous infusion. This schedule, which was employed in clinical trials, has been shown to achieve PK/PD targets across diverse populations, including in critically ill patients.

SUL-DUR is primarily cleared renally, requiring dose adjustments in patients with impaired renal function. Furthermore, patients with augmented renal clearance may require adjusted dosing intervals to maintain adequate drug exposure. Importantly, both agents achieve therapeutic concentrations in epithelial lining fluid (ELF), with ELF-to-plasma AUC ratios of 50% for sulbactam and 36% for durlobactam.

Purpose Of Review

Sulbactam-durlobactam (SUL-DUR) is a novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination recently approved for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) infections. This review summarizes current knowledge on the optimal use of SUL-DUR, whether administered alone or in combination with carbapenems, particularly imipenem.

Recent Findings

Data from registrational trial demonstrate that SUL-DUR is an effective and well tolerated treatment option for CRAB severe infections. However, this trial assessed the efficacy of SUL-DUR exclusively in combination with imipenem. Real-world reports have described successful use of SUL-DUR in combination with carbapenems and other agents, particularly in complex or drug-resistant cases. Microbiological data suggest synergistic effects between SUL-DUR and carbapenems due to complementary inhibition of different penicillin-binding proteins.

Summary

Combination therapy of SUL-DUR with carbapenems remains the preferred strategy in critically ill or high-risk patients. Future trials should specifically evaluate the comparative efficacy of monotherapy vs. combination regimens and establish which could be the best companion in the treatment of CRAB infections.

SULBACTAM-DURLOBACTAM CLINICAL EVIDENCE

Registrational trial

The clinical development program for SUL-DUR followed a rational, stepwise approach from phase I to phase III trials (Table 1) to characterize its pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy.

Table 1
Clinical trial

Phase I trials conducted in healthy volunteers established pharmacokinetic and safety profile of both sulbactam and durlobactam when administered alone or in combination with imipenem-cilastatin. Studies by Rodvold and Lickliter showed that intravenous SUL-DUR administered as 1 g/1 g over 3 h every 6 h was well tolerated, with predictable plasma and ELF concentrations supportive of use in lower respiratory tract. O'Donnell further demonstrated that both agents are primarily renally excreted and systemic exposure increases in a predictable manner with declining renal function, requiring dose adjustment in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease. In a phase II study, SUL-DUR was evaluated in hospitalized adults with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs), including acute pyelonephritis. Patients received background therapy with imipenem-cilastatin and were randomized to either SUL-DUR or placebo. SUL-DUR was well tolerated, with adverse events primarily mild or moderate in severity. Although this trial was not powered for efficacy, microbiological success rates were similar between arms.

This limited therapeutic armamentarium has led to treatment failures in many settings, prompting the need for new, targeted agents with reliable activity against CRAB. In this context, sulbactam-durlobactam (SUL-DUR) has emerged as a promising new β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination specifically developed for the treatment of CRAB. Based on evidence from the registrational trial, the IDSA Guidance recommends SUL-DUR use in combination with imipenem-cilastatin or meropenem. However, growing clinical reports support the effective use of SUL-DUR both as monotherapy and in combination with other agents.

The aim of this review is to summarize the current evidence on the optimal use of SUL-DUR, whether administered alone, with imipenem-cilastatin, or in combination with other antimicrobial agents.

The pivotal phase III trial, known as the ATTACK study was a randomized, noninferiority trial comparing SUL-DUR vs. colistin, both in combination with imipenem-cilastatin, for the treatment of adult patients with severe CRAB infections (e.g. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia, VAP, Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia, HAP, Bloodstream Infection BSI). The trial was divided into two parts, according to CRAB susceptibility profiles (part A: colistin/polymyxin B susceptible strains; part B: colistin/polymyxin B resistant strains or where these agents were contraindicated due to nephrotoxicity or neuromuscular disorders). In part A, the study enrolled 181 patients, with 125 included in the microbiologically modified intention-to-treat population for efficacy analysis. The primary endpoint was 28-day all-cause mortality. SUL-DUR demonstrated noninferiority to colistin, with a mortality rate of 19% (12 out of 63) vs. 32.3% (20 out of 62), respectively, corresponding to a treatment difference of −13% (95% CI: −30 to 3.5). Notably, nephrotoxicity occurred significantly less frequently in the SUL-DUR arm compared to the colistin group (13% vs. 38%, P < 0.001), highlighting a major safety advantage.

Part B of the ATTACK trial, was designed as an open-label, nonrandomized observational cohort, aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SUL-DUR in patients with infections caused by CRAB strains resistant to colistin/polymyxin B or where these agents were contraindicated. A total of 28 patients were enrolled in Part B, mainly with BSI. All patients received SUL-DUR plus imipenem-cilastatin, for 7–14 days, adjusted based on renal function. At day 28, all-cause mortality was 18% (5 out of 28), clinical cure at test-of-cure 71% (20 out of 28) and microbiological favorable response was 79% (22 out of 28). These outcomes were consistent with or better than those observed in the randomized controlled Part A, suggesting clinical benefit even in this high-risk population.

Notably, all patients in the ATTACK trial received combination therapy with imipenem–cilastatin, chosen for ensuring coverage in polymicrobial infections that occurred in almost 30% of cases. Indeed, monotherapy efficacy of SUL-DUR was not evaluated in this pivotal trial.

Real-world experience

Emerging data are increasingly supporting the use of SUL-DUR, mainly as part of combination regimens, in complex or refractory real-world clinical settings (Table 2). Several published case reports have described the use of SUL-DUR via expanded access protocols for patients with XDR or PDR A. baumannii infections, particularly when all other therapeutic options had failed. These cases provide valuable insights into SUL-DUR application in clinical contexts beyond those included in RCTs.

Table 2
Real-life experience

Zaidan et al. described a critically ill patient with COVID-19 developing VAP and septic shock caused by XDR A. baumannii. After failure of multiple agents, including high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam, polymyxin B, and eravacycline, SUL-DUR was administered in combination with cefiderocol. Clinical and microbiological cure were achieved within 72 h of starting combination therapy, with no adverse effects reported. The SUL-DUR MIC of A. baumannii strain was 4 mg/l, consistent with recommended susceptibility thresholds.

Tiseo et al. described another case of a severely burned patient with VAP due to CRAB resistant to both colistin and cefiderocol. The patient was treated with SUL-DUR in combination with colistin due to concomitant carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolation from respiratory samples. The CRAB isolate exhibited a SUL-DUR MIC of 1.5 mg/l, and whole genome sequencing revealed multiple resistance determinants (e.g. blaOXA-23, blaOXA-66, PBP3 mutations). The patient achieved microbiological eradication and clinical improvement. Holger et al. reported the use of SUL-DUR in combination with meropenem in a patient with necrotizing pneumonia and empyema caused by XDR A. baumannii. This case was notable for SUL-DUR MIC of 8 mg/l, just above preliminary breakpoints. However, the addition of meropenem resulted in a synergistic effect, reducing the MIC to 4 mg/l at in vitro testing. Webb et al. described a kidney transplant recipient who acquired donor-derived CRAB BSI. The patient was initially treated with SUL-DUR plus cefiderocol, achieving clinical and microbiological success. The therapy was later de-escalated to cefiderocol monotherapy after resolution of the acute phase. The combination was selected based on susceptibility data and to avoid nephrotoxicity in a high-risk patient.

CONCLUSION

According with reported data from clinical trials and real-world experiences, the optimal administration strategy of SUL-DUR remains to be established.

A growing microbiological and structural evidences supports the synergistic effect between SUL-DUR and carbapenems, especially imipenem. Veeraraghavan et al. demonstrated that the combination of sulbactam, durlobactam, and imipenem resulted in significant reductions in MIC and exhibited bactericidal activity against CRAB strains harbouring class D β-lactamases. These findings are explained by sulbactam ability to target PBP1 and PBP3, while imipenem provides complementary inhibition of PBP2, together leading to more effective inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Therefore, the combination of sulbactam, durlobactam, and imipenem may function as a strategy with additive or synergistic effect, rather than SUL-DUR merely being "supported" by a carbapenem. These findings suggest that the clinical efficacy of SUL-DUR may be potentiated by co-administration with carbapenem, supporting a combination strategy in serious infections where multiple PBPs must be inhibited for optimal bacterial killing.

It is worth mentioning that in clinical practice SUL-DUR was also successfully combined with cefiderocol, this usually shows in vitro activity against CRAB. Thus, in our opinion, the best companion to SUL-DUR for the treatment of CRAB infections should be yet investigated.

Another critical factor to use SUL-DUR as a part of combination regimen, is the frequent occurrence of polymicrobial infections in critically ill patients. Currently, there are few data supporting the efficacy of SUL-DUR against pathogens other than A. baumannii. Thus, empiric combination therapy remains mandatory in polymicrobial infections, especially in the early phase of treatment.

A potential role for SUL-DUR monotherapy could be hypothesized in selected patient populations with confirmed monomicrobial CRAB infections, lower MIC values, and no evidence of coinfection. However, it should be noted that all clinical trials assessing SUL-DUR's efficacy evaluated this drug within a combination regimen with imipenem.

Therefore, until further data are available, combination therapy remains the standard of care, especially in critically ill or immunocompromised patients.

Impaired Renal Function

In patients with impairment of renal function the elimination kinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam are similarly affected, hence the ratio of one to the other will remain constant whatever the renal function. The dose of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection in such patients should be administered less frequently in accordance with the usual practice for ampicillin and according to the following recommendations:

When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) may be used to convert this value into creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function.

Acinetobacter species — agent selection rationale and avoidance of tigecycline: The evidence suggests that the carbapenems (including imipenem), ampicillin-sulbactam, and colistin are equally effective at treating Acinetobacter species that are determined by antimicrobial sensitivity testing to be sensitive to those agents, and the panel agreed that carbapenems and ampicillin-sulbactam are preferred due to fewer side effects, whereas colistin should be reserved for species sensitive only to colistin due to the risk of nephrotoxicity. The recommendation to use colistin to treat Acinetobacter species that are sensitive only to colistin was strong despite the low quality of evidence because, for such patients, there are no other therapeutic options, so colistin therapy may be lifesaving. In contrast, adjunctive rifampicin did not improve outcomes and was not recommended because its burdens, costs, and risks clearly exceed the benefits. The evidence synthesis indicated that the current label dose of tigecycline worsened clinical outcomes compared with several other therapies, and the panel's strong recommendation against tigecycline despite low-quality evidence is intended to emphasize the importance of avoiding potentially harmful therapies when alternatives exist.

### Efficacy and safety of sulbactam-durlobactam versus colistin for the treatment of patients with serious infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex: a multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority clinical trial (ATTACK) [^112DCmPk]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Background

An urgent need exists for antibiotics to treat infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex (ABC). Sulbactam-durlobactam is a β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combination with activity against Acinetobacter, including multidrug-resistant strains. In a phase 3, pathogen-specific, randomised controlled trial, we compared the efficacy and safety of sulbactam-durlobactam versus colistin, both in combination with imipenem-cilastatin as background therapy, in patients with serious infections caused by carbapenem-resistant ABC.

Methods

The ATTACK trial was done at 59 clinical sites in 16 countries. Adults aged 18 years or older with ABC-confirmed hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, ventilated pneumonia, or bloodstream infections were randomised 1:1 using a block size of four to sulbactam-durlobactam (1.0 g of each drug in combination over 3 h every 6 h) or colistin (2.5 mg/kg over 30 min every 12 h) for 7–14 days. All patients received imipenem-cilastatin (1.0 g of each drug in combination over 1 h every 6 h) as background therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with laboratory-confirmed carbapenem-resistant ABC (the carbapenem-resistant ABC microbiologically modified intention-to-treat population). Non-inferiority was concluded if the upper bound of the 95% CI for the treatment difference was less than +20%. The primary safety endpoint was incidence of nephrotoxicity assessed using modified Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage renal disease criteria measured by creatinine level or glomerular filtration rate through day 42. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03894046.

Findings

Between Sep 5, 2019, and July 26, 2021, 181 patients were randomly assigned to sulbactam-durlobactam or colistin (176 hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, or ventilated pneumonia; and five bloodstream infections); 125 patients with laboratory-confirmed carbapenem-resistant ABC isolates were included in the primary efficacy analysis. 28-day all-cause mortality was 12 (19%) of 63 in the sulbactam-durlobactam group and 20 (32%) of 62 in the colistin group, a difference of -13.2% (95% CI -30.0 to 3.5), which met criteria for non-inferiority. Incidence of nephrotoxicity was significantly (p < 0.001) lower with sulbactam-durlobactam than colistin (12 [13%] of 91 vs 32 [38%] of 85). Serious adverse events were reported in 36 (40%) of 91 patients in the sulbactam-durlobactam group and 42 (49%) of 86 patients in the colistin group. Treatment-related adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation were reported in ten (11%) of 91 patients in the sulbactam-durlobactam group and 14 (16%) of 86 patients in the colistin group.

Interpretation

Our data show that sulbactam-durlobactam was non-inferior to colistin, both agents given in combination with imipenem-cilastatin, for the primary endpoint of 28-day all-cause mortality. Sulbactam-durlobactam was well tolerated and could be an effective intervention to reduce mortality from serious infections caused by carbapenem-resistant ABC, including multidrug-resistant strains.

Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) — evidence for sulbactam-containing regimens includes meta-analyses and trials: Two meta-analyses have evaluated observational and clinical trial data for various treatment regimens against CRAB infections; a meta-analysis published in 2021 included 18 studies and 1835 patients and found that ampicillin-sulbactam (total daily dose of at least 6 grams of the sulbactam component) in combination with a second agent was the most effective regimen to reduce mortality in critically ill patients infected with CRAB, and an earlier meta-analysis published in 2017 included 23 observational studies or clinical trials and 2118 patients with CRAB infections. At least 5 clinical trials evaluating mortality in patients with CRAB infections have included sulbactam in 1 of the treatment arms, and although differences in mortality reached statistical significance in only 1 of these trials, all demonstrate a numerical reduction in mortality in the sulbactam-based arm; however, fewer than 50% of CRAB isolates test susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam.

SULBACTAM OR BUST FOR TREATMENT OF INVASIVE CRAB INFECTIONS?

A compelling case for the use of ampicillin-sulbactam can be made from the available evidence. This case hinges upon the safety profile of high-dose β-lactams and the unique activity of sulbactam against CRAB. Sulbactam targets and saturates PBP1a, PBP1b, and PBP3 in A. baumannii-calcoaceticus complex. Its utility, however, is dependent upon achieving PD targets for sulbactam with the commercially available 2:1 formulation of ampicillin-sulbactam (2 g of ampicillin, 1 g of sulbactam). Like other β-lactams, the time free sulbactam concentrations are above the minimum inhibitory concentration (f T > MIC) is the driver of efficacy in murine infection models; however, drug exposures vary widely across critically ill patients. Using a target of 60% f T > MIC for patients with a creatinine clearance ranging between 90 and 120 mL/minute, sulbactam doses of 1 g every 6 hours or 2 g every 8 hours as a 4-hour prolonged infusion are needed to achieve a more than 90% probability of target attainment when MICs are less than 4 mg/L. In the more likely event that sulbactam MICs are 16 mg/L or greater, dosing regimens equivalent to 9 g/day of sulbactam are needed and have been shown to be safe in patients. This directly translates to ampicillin-sulbactam dosing regimens of 9 g every 8 hours as a prolonged 4-hour infusion or 27 g as a continuous infusion. Recently, an alternative target of 25% f T > MIC has been associated with 1-log killing in a murine neutropenic lung infection model. Using this target, sulbactam doses of 1 g every 4 hours are needed to achieve more than 90% target attainment for MICs up to 8 mg/L. These data provide support for an ampicillin-sulbactam regimen of 3 g every 4 hours when isolates test susceptible or intermediate to ampicillin-sulbactam. For isolates testing resistant (MIC ≥ 16 mg/L), however, ampicillin-sulbactam optimized regimens of 9 g every 8 hours administered as a 4-hour infusion are needed to achieve PK-PD targets. The importance of sulbactam dose optimization cannot be understated given that most clinical isolates of CRAB test non-susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam when applying Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) interpretive criteria. When optimized doses are used, ampicillin-sulbactam eradicates CRAB in hollow-fiber infection models, and the frequency of spontaneous sulbactam resistance selection appears to be low.

In-vitro activity of sulbactam-durlobactam

Multiple investigations have evaluated the in-vitro efficacy of SUL-DUR against clinical isolates of the Acinetobacter baumannii–calcoaceticus (ABC) complex, particularly those exhibiting carbapenem resistance. In an extensive international study, SUL-DUR in-vitro activity was tested in 5032 ABC isolates from different specimens collected from 33 countries between 2016 and 2021 across Europe (42.1%), North America (29.9%), Asia/South Pacific (13.6%), Latin America (12.6%), and the Middle East (1.7%). Approximately 80% of the isolates analyzed were identified as A. baumannii, most derived from respiratory tract (54.3%), bloodstream (20.2%) and urinary tract infections (16.5%). When durlobactam was added to sulbactam at a fixed concentration of 4 μg/ml, the MIC 90 was reduced dramatically dropping from 64 μg/ml (sulbactam alone) to 2 μg/ml for the combination. Applying the FDA susceptibility breakpoint of ≤ 4 μg/ml, 98.3% of isolates were classified as susceptible to SUL-DUR. Moreover, the combination retained high efficacy across challenging resistance phenotypes, including carbapenem-resistant, colistin-resistant, and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains with over 96% of isolates in these subsets exhibiting MIC values within the susceptible range.

### Population pharmacokinetic analysis and pharmacodynamic evaluation of sulbactam in pediatric patients: dosing suggestions for Acinetobacter baumannii infections [^112Xjf4c]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Acinetobacter baumannii is a globally significant pathogen that can cause nosocomial infections, such as pneumonia, and surgical site and bloodstream infections. Although carbapenems are the first-line treatment for A. baumannii infections, the cumulative incidence of hospital-associated infection caused by carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) is high, and evidence of a dose–response relationship between different degrees of drug resistance has been observed. Therefore, alternative antimicrobial agents for the treatment of A. baumannii infections are essential. One alternative, sulbactam, a β-lactamase inhibitor, has known antibacterial activity against A. baumannii by saturating penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 3and has shown efficacy in clinical trials, independently of β-lactams.

In critically ill pediatric patients, multidrug-resistant A. baumannii nosocomial infections cause high mortality rates. According to a report from Seoul National University Children's Hospital, carbapenem nonsusceptibility is an independent risk factor for mortality due to A. baumannii bacteremia in pediatric intensive care unit patients. Even in pediatric patients, treatment with sulbactam instead of carbapenem is important.

Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) theory has been often used for dose optimization of antimicrobial agents, and the antimicrobial activity of sulbactam generally depends on the exposure time during which the drug concentrations remain above the minimum inhibitory concentration for the bacterium (T > MIC). For clinical use in pediatric patients, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society has published guidance (PIDS guidance) and recommended high-dosing regimens of sulbactam for CRAB. However, there have been few reports of using sulbactam to treat A. baumannii infection in pediatric patients, and no reports on optimizing the administration method in pediatric patients. Furthermore, it is difficult to fully evaluate PK/PD properties in pediatric patients due to limited blood sampling and ethical problems. Pooled analyses systematically accumulate individual PK studies in pediatric patients, which enables researchers to perform PK/PD evaluation. The aim of our study was to develop a sulbactam PK model using pooled analysis and to suggest optimized sulbactam dosing regimens based on PD evaluation for treating A. baumannii infection in pediatric patients.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The pharmacy bulk package is for preparation of solutions for IV infusion only. Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection should be administered by slow intravenous injection over at least 10 to 15 minutes or can also be delivered in greater dilutions with 50 to 100 mL of a compatible diluent as an intravenous infusion over 15 to 30 minutes.

The recommended adult dosage of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is 1.5 g (1 g ampicillin as the sodium salt plus 0.5 g sulbactam as the sodium salt) to 3 g (2 g ampicillin as the sodium salt plus 1 g sulbactam as the sodium salt) every six hours. This 1.5 to 3 g range represents the total of ampicillin content plus the sulbactam content of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, and corresponds to a range of 1 g ampicillin/0.5 g sulbactam to 2 g ampicillin/1 g sulbactam. The total dose of sulbactam should not exceed 4 grams per day. Pediatric Patients 1 Year of Age or Older

The recommended daily dose of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection in pediatric patients is 300 mg per kg of body weight administered via intravenous infusion in equally divided doses every 6 hours. This 300 mg/kg/day dosage represents the total ampicillin content plus the sulbactam content of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, and corresponds to 200 mg ampicillin/100 mg sulbactam per kg per day. The safety and efficacy of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection administered via intramuscular injection in pediatric patients have not been established. Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should be dosed according to adult recommendations, and the total dose of sulbactam should not exceed 4 grams per day. The course of intravenous therapy should not routinely exceed 14 days. In clinical trials, most children received a course of oral antimicrobials following initial treatment with intravenous ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. (see CLINICAL STUDIES section).

### Pharmacokinetics of ampicillin / sulbactam in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury undergoing extended dialysis [^114HyagL]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The fixed antibacterial combination of ampicillin and sulbactam is frequently used for various infections. Intact kidneys eliminate approximately 71% of ampicillin and 78% of sulbactam. Patients on thrice-weekly low-flux hemodialysis exhibit an ampicillin t(1/2) of 2.3 hours on and 17.4 hours off dialysis. Despite its frequent use in intensive care units, there are no available dosing recommendations for patients with AKI undergoing renal replacement therapy. The aims of this study were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ampicillin/sulbactam in critically ill patients with AKI undergoing extended dialysis (ED) and to establish a dosing recommendation for this treatment method.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Twelve critically ill patients with anuric AKI being treated with ED were enrolled in a prospective, open-label, observational pharmacokinetic study. Pharmacokinetics after a single dose of ampicillin/sulbactam (2 g/1 g) was obtained in 12 patients. Multiple-dose pharmacokinetics after 4 days of twice-daily ampicillin/sulbactam (2 g/1 g) was obtained in three patients.

Results

The mean dialyzer clearance for ampicillin/sulbactam was 80.1 ± 7.7/83.3 ± 12.1 ml/min. The t(1/2) of ampicillin and sulbactam in patients with AKI undergoing ED were 2.8 ± 0.8 hours and 3.5 ± 1.5 hours, respectively. There was no significant accumulation using a twice-daily dosage of 2 g/1 g ampicillin/sulbactam.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that in patients treated with ED using a high-flux dialyzer (polysulphone, 1.3 m(2); blood and dialysate flow, 160 ml/min; treatment time, 480 minutes), a twice-daily dosing schedule of at least 2 g/1 g ampicillin/sulbactam, with one dose given after ED, should be used to avoid underdosing.

Treatment of Hospital-acquired and Ventilator-associated Bacterial Pneumonia Caused by Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus Complex Organisms

A total of 177 hospitalized adults with documented Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex infections were randomized and treated in a multicenter, active-controlled, investigator-unblinded, independent assessor-blinded, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial (Trial 1, NCT03894046). Patients were treated with either XACDURO (1 g sulbactam and 1 g durlobactam, or renally adjusted dose) intravenously over 3 hours every 6 hours (n = 91) or colistin 2.5 mg/kg (or renally adjusted dose) intravenously over 30 minutes every 12 hours after an initial loading dose of colistin 2.5 to 5 mg/kg (n = 86). Both treatment arms also received 1 g imipenem/1 g cilastatin (or renally adjusted dose) intravenously every 6 hours as background therapy for potential HABP/VABP pathogens other than Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex. Patients received up to 14 days of therapy.

The primary efficacy endpoint for the study was 28-day all-cause mortality in the patients who received any amount of study medication with a confirmed baseline infection with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex (CRABC microbiologically modified intent to treat (m-MITT) population). Among 128 patients in the CRABC m-MITT population, 125 patients who did not withdraw consent prior to assessment of survival status at Day 28 were assessed: 63 patients in the XACDURO group and 62 patients in the colistin group.

Objective

To compare the safety and efficacy of ampicillin/sulbactam (Amp/Sulb) and colistin (COL) in the treatment of multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Methods

A prospective cohort study in adult critically ill patients with VAP. Patients were randomly assigned to receive Amp/Sulb (9 g every 8h) or COL (3 MIU every 8h) intravenously. Dosage was adjusted according to creatinine clearance.

Results

A total of 28 patients were enrolled (15 COL, 13 Amp/Sulb). Resolution of symptoms and signs occurred in 60% (9/15) of the COL group and 61.5% (9/13) of the Amp/Sulb group, improvement in 13.3% (2/15) vs. 15.3% (1/13) and failure in 26.6% (4/15) vs. 23% (3/13), respectively. The difference was not statistically significant. Bacteriologic success was achieved in 66.6% (10/15) vs. 61.5% (8/13) in the COL and Amp/Sulb groups, respectively (p < 0.2). Mortality rates (14 days and 28 days) were 15.3% and 30% for the Amp/Sulb and 20% and 33% for the COL group, respectively. Adverse events were 39.6% (including 33% nephrotoxicity) for the COL group and 30.7% (15.3% nephrotoxicity) for the Amp/Sulb group (p = NS).

Conclusion

Colistin and high-dose ampicillin/sulbactam were comparably safe and effective treatments for critically ill patients with MDR A. baumannii VAP.

Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) — ampicillin-sulbactam role and dosing are described as follows: High-dose ampicillin-sulbactam, as a component of combination therapy, is suggested as an alternate agent for CRAB, and this approach is suggested only when the susceptibility of sulbactam-durlobactam results are unavailable; the panel suggests high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam (total daily dose of 9 grams of the sulbactam component) as a component of combination therapy for CRAB infections. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data indicate that sulbactam total daily dosing of 9 grams is likely to achieve sufficient fT > MIC for A. baumannii isolates with sulbactam MICs of up 16–32 μg/mL; ampicillin-sulbactam uses a 2:1 formulation such that 3 grams of ampicillin-sulbactam is comprised of 2 grams of ampicillin and 1 gram of sulbactam, and ampicillin-sulbactam total daily doses of 27 grams (equivalent to 9 grams of sulbactam) as extended or continuous infusions are suggested (eg, 9 grams [3 grams of sulbactam] of ampicillin-sulbactam IV every 8 hours infused over 4 hours). Insufficient data exist to determine if standard-dose and high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam have equivalent efficacy in infections caused by isolates susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam, and the panel favors high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam.

In a randomized trial of critically ill patients given colistin alone versus colistin plus rifampicin, there was no difference in 30-day mortality with 43% mortality in both study arms; another rifampin trial in CRAB pneumonia (n = 43) found in-hospital mortality 73% versus 62%, not statistically significant, and a third study in nine patients with colistin-resistant A. baumannii found no difference in 30-day mortality (20% vs 33%). A fosfomycin trial randomized 94 patients to colistin alone versus colistin with fosfomycin with 28-day mortality 57% versus 47%, although IV fosfomycin is not currently available in the United States.

### The role of sulbactam-durlobactam in treating carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter infections [^114ZGpBG]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Infections caused by multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii present a significant global health challenge. Available treatment options are limited and frequently constrained by unfavourable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles. Sulbactam-durlobactam is a novel β-lactamase inhibitors combination specifically developed to target A. baumannii, including carbapenem-resistant strains. The purpose of this review is to assess the current evidence supporting the role of sulbactam-durlobactam in the management of A. baumannii infections.

Recent Findings

We summarize the available evidence regarding the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of sulbactam-durlobactam from key in-vitro and in-vivo studies. Additionally, efficacy results from the Phase III randomized controlled trial and real-world data on sulbactam-durlobactam's use against severe A. baumannii infections are also discussed.

Summary

Sulbactam-durlobactam is a promising addition to the treatment options for carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii infections. Ongoing research and vigilance are essential to monitor the development of in-vivo resistance, assess effectiveness across diverse patient populations, and explore potential synergistic combinations with other antimicrobials. Careful stewardship and comprehensive clinician education will be crucial to optimizing the clinical use of sulbactam-durlobactam.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^1135qiBh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Sulbactam-durlobactam — adjunctive carbapenem use and resistance management are described as follows: Based on the available in vitro data, it is suggested that imipenem-cilastatin be administered as adjunctive therapy to sulbactam-durlobactam, and meropenem is likely a reasonable substitute for imipenem-cilastatin given their similar PBP targets; for patients requiring prolonged durations of therapy it may be reasonable to discontinue carbapenem therapy after clinical improvement has occurred. Available data suggest high-level resistance of sulbactam-durlobactam is generally a result of MBL enzymes or PBP3 mutants, and in settings of resistance to sulbactam-durlobactam (ie, MICs ≥ 16/4 μg/mL), the panel suggests considering optimally-dosed non-sulbactam based combinations as sulbactam-based therapy is unlikely to be of substantial therapeutic value; durlobactam is a potent inhibitor of class A, C, and D enzymes commonly produced by CRAB, enabling lower doses of sulbactam which can then successfully reach its PBP targets under the protection of durlobactam.

12.1	 Mechanism of Action

XACDURO is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.2	Pharmacodynamics

For sulbactam, the percent time of dosing interval that unbound plasma concentrations of sulbactam exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of A. baumannii has been shown to be the best predictor of efficacy in animal and in vitro models of infection. For durlobactam, the ratio of the 24-hour unbound plasma durlobactam AUC to the sulbactam-durlobactam MIC (f AUC0–24/MIC) best predicts the activity in in vivo and in vitro models of infection.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

At a dose 4 times the maximum recommended single dose, durlobactam does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Sulbactam and durlobactam pharmacokinetics are similar following single- and multiple-dose administrations. The Cmaxand AUC of sulbactam increase in proportion to dose (0.5 times the recommended single dose to 1 g single dose). Durlobactam demonstrated dose-proportional pharmacokinetics across the dose range studied (0.25 times the recommended single dose to 2 times the recommended single dose infused over 3 hours every 6 hours).

The pharmacokinetic properties of the components of XACDURO and the pharmacokinetic parameters of sulbactam and durlobactam are summarized in Table 3.

### Navigating available treatment options for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex infections [^114fXKJS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical evidence in support of dose-optimized ampicillin-sulbactam for the treatment of CRAB infections has been mounting over the past 2 decades. The vast majority of clinical data, however, have come from observational studies rather than rigorously controlled randomized trials. As a result, the data are highly heterogeneous and ampicillin-sulbactam dosing regimens vary significantly across studies. In an effort to elucidate important differences across studies, several meta-analyses have been undertaken comparing sulbactam-based combinations with other combinations. The most recent network meta-analysis and systematic review included 7 randomized clinical trials and 11 observational studies to evaluate endpoints of clinical improvement, clinical cure, microbiologic eradication, and all-cause mortality. The investigators found that sulbactam (≥ 6 g/day) plus another active antibiotic (either levofloxacin or tigecycline) resulted in higher rates of clinical improvement when compared with colistin alone, colistin plus a carbapenem, or colistin with another active agent (relative risk [RR] = 2.99 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08–8.24], 3.12 [1.14–8.60], and 3.06 [1.13–8.29], respectively); however, no regimen was associated with significant improvements in survival. An earlier Bayesian network meta-analysis of 23 studies across 2118 patients compared 15 treatment regimens for the primary outcome of all-cause mortality. The analysis showed that sulbactam (3–8 g/day) and high-dose sulbactam (≥ 9 g/day) as monotherapy resulted in the highest probability of reducing mortality when compared with other treatments; however, the combination of sulbactam plus colistin ranked as the lowest. In the same study, sulbactam was superior to colistin monotherapy for reducing all-cause mortality by Bayesian posterior probability estimates (odds ratio [OR] = .27; 95% CI:.06–.91), but high-dose sulbactam (OR = .56; 95% CI:.09–3.17) and sulbactam plus colistin (OR = 2.58; 95% CI:.71–9.88) were not. A third network meta-analysis found that colistin-based combinations were associated with lower all-cause mortality than sulbactam-based combinations. These conflicting results add to the mystery of defining the best treatment options against CRAB, particularly when comparing observational studies that do not have standardized methods or standardized dosing of colistin or sulbactam. Thus, some reliance is needed upon individual studies where standardized approaches are used. In an interim analysis of 23 patients randomized to receive colistin plus levofloxacin (n = 11) or continuous infusion ampicillin-sulbactam (24 g daily; equivalent to 8 g of sulbactam) plus levofloxacin (n = 12) for CRAB pneumonia, significantly higher rates of clinical cure (83% vs 27%; P = 0.007) and lower rates of 28-day mortality (42% vs 82%; P = 0.04) were identified among patients randomized to receive ampicillin-sulbactam. Numerically lower rates of death (17% vs 38%) were also reported among 28 patients randomized to continuous infusion ampicillin-sulbactam or colistin (both administered with inhaled colistin) for multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter pneumonia.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sulbactam and durlobactam have not been evaluated. Hepatic impairment is not expected to alter the elimination of XACDURO as neither sulbactam nor durlobactam undergo substantial hepatic metabolism/excretion. Dosage adjustments are not necessary in patients with impaired hepatic function.

WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS FOR TREATING INVASIVE XDR A. BAUMANNII INFECTIONS?

XDR A. baumannii invasive infections are frequently managed with polymyxins. If polymyxins are not an option due to resistance or toxicity, the most active agent is often tigecycline, but unfavorable pharmacokinetics leading to suboptimal concentrations in the blood and epithelial lining fluid with current dosing strategies make it less than ideal for the treatment of bloodstream or respiratory tract infections. Minocycline also has excellent in vitro activity against XDR A. baumannii, and potentially offers more favorable serum concentrations; however, clinical experience is limited. Although select aminoglycosides might also retain activity, the utility of these agents as monotherapy outside of the urine is controversial, and current evidence does not support their use. Interestingly, sulbactam can retain activity, even in XDR A. baumannii. Unfortunately, however, optimal use and dose of sulbactam remain unclear, it is not routinely available or tested in many institutions, and the only patient in this case series who received monotherapy with the agent died despite in vitro susceptibility.

### Expert clinical pharmacological advice may make an antimicrobial TDM program for emerging candidates more clinically useful in tailoring therapy of critically ill patients [^117Je2BT]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

We recognize that our study has some limitations. The retrospective nature of the study design and the short duration of the assessment phase must be acknowledged. The relationship between antimicrobial exposure and clinical outcome was not assessed, even if this was out of the aims of our study. The resources provided in this study could seem very generous. No ECPAs were requested for 5 out of the 15 antimicrobials included in the TDM-guided ECPA program. This is in agreement with the fact that all of these antimicrobials are not widely used in the ICU setting. Posaconazole and isavuconazole are commonly used as chronic therapy or long-term prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in hematological patients. Ampicillin and or ampicillin–sulbactam have a narrower spectrum of activity, not including particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ceftazidime is preferred over cefepime due to a lower risk of neurotoxicity especially in critically ill renal patients. However, it is worth mentioning that the CPU of our University tertiary hospital has been established with the intent of planning a very ambitious and extensive ECPA program in the metropolitan area of Bologna. The starting core was the ICU settings within our hospital as the critically ill patients have the highest need for prompt optimization of antimicrobial treatment. Indeed, nowadays the ECPA program has just been extended hospital wide, and, in the near future, the project is of furtherly extending it to the other three major city hospitals. Finally, we are aware that using precise MIC value for calculating PK/PD target attainment with antimicrobials may sometimes be imprecise due to some variability associated with MIC determination, especially with automated testing methods. Conversely, the large sample size, the relevant number of delivered ECPAs, and the remarkable proportion of recommended dosing adjustments coupled with the optimal TATs of ECPAS strengthen the feasibility and the clinical usefulness of this novel approach.

In conclusion, our study described for the first time the organizational procedures for establishing a TDM-guided ECPA program and assessed the clinical impact of this approach in tailoring antimicrobial therapy in a large cohort of critically ill patients. The findings suggest that multidisciplinary approach and timely expert interpretation of TDM results by well-trained MD Clinical Pharmacologist could represent cornerstones in improving the cost-effectiveness of the program. Further prospective studies investigating the impact of a real-time TDM-based ECPA program on clinical and microbiological outcomes in ICU patients are warranted.

Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) infections — combination therapy rationale: The general approach is to administer combination therapy with at least 2 agents until an appropriate clinical response is observed, and it is generally suggested that at least 1 agent be sulbactam-based; when high-dose sulbactam is used, combination therapy is suggested even though only 1 of 7 clinical trials showed improved clinical outcomes, and the only trial demonstrating benefit included high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam as the combination arm; when sulbactam-durlobactam is unavailable, an alternative is high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam with a total daily dose of 9 grams of the sulbactam component as part of combination therapy; components to consider include polymyxin B, minocycline, and tigecycline, whereas fosfomycin and rifampin are not suggested; two large trials did not show benefit for high-dose extended-infusion carbapenem therapy with colistin, and meropenem or imipenemcilastatin are not suggested as routine components except when administered with sulbactam-durlobactam; nebulized antibiotics are not suggested as adjunctive therapy for CRAB pneumonia because of lack of benefit, distribution concerns, and potential respiratory complications such as bronchoconstriction.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, therefore adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of durlobactam with or without sulbactam was evaluated in 380 adult subjects across six phase 1 trials, one phase 2 trial in patients with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) including acute pyelonephritis, and one phase 3 trial (also referred to as Trial 1) in adult patients with infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex including hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP), ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP), and ventilated pneumonia (VP) [see Clinical Studies (14)].

In the randomized, active-controlled portion of the phase 3 trial, 91 patients received XACDURO (1 g sulbactam and 1 g durlobactam, or renally adjusted dose) intravenously over 3 hours every 6 hours and 86 patients were treated with colistin 2.5 mg/kg (or renally adjusted dose) intravenously over 30 minutes every 12 hours after an initial loading dose of colistin 2.5 to 5 mg/kg. Both treatment arms also received 1 g imipenem/1 g cilastatin (or renally adjusted dose) intravenously every 6 hours as background therapy for potential HABP/VABP pathogens other than Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex. The mean duration of XACDURO therapy was 9 days versus 8 days for colistin.

Serious Adverse Reactions and Discontinuation of Treatment

Thirty-six patients (40%) in the XACDURO treatment group and 42 patients (49%) in the colistin treatment group experienced serious adverse reactions. Discontinuation of treatment due to any adverse reaction occurred in 10/91 (11%) patients treated with XACDURO and in 14/86 (16%) patients treated with colistin. One patient treated with XACDURO developed anaphylactic shock which led to discontinuation of treatment.

Common Adverse Reactions

Adverse reactions were reported in 88% (80/91) of patients in the XACDURO treatment group and 94% (81/86) of patients in the colistin treatment group. The most common adverse reactions reported in > 10% of patients treated with XACDURO were liver test abnormalities, diarrhea, anemia, and hypokalemia. Table 2 lists selected adverse reactions occurring at a frequency of > 5% in Trial 1.

### Navigating available treatment options for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex infections [^111fUZiJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex (CRAB) remains one of the foremost public health challenges of the 21st century. Largely regarded as a top-priority pathogen globally for new antibiotic development, CRAB are notorious for their ability to survive in hospital environments, evade host immunity, acquire new antibiotic-resistance mechanisms, and defy therapeutic countermeasures. Unlike other antibiotic-resistant pathogens, no available treatments have been shown to substantially lower mortality or significantly improve the outcome of patients with invasive CRAB infections. As a result, 28-day mortality rates among patients enrolled in randomized clinical trials investigating CRAB therapeutics exceed 45% (Figure 1). These data underscore disproportionately increased rates of death associated with CRAB infections when compared with other carbapenem-resistant pathogens. Indeed, CRAB infections are the fourth-leading cause of death attributable to antimicrobial resistance globally.

Figure 1.
A brief timeline of noteworthy CRAB clinical trials. *Full results have not yet been published. Abbreviations: CR, carbapenem-resistant; CRAB, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex; MDR, multidrug-resistant; SUL-DUR, sulbactam-durlobactam; VAP, ventilator-associated pneumonia; XDR, extensively drug-resistant.

Beyond its public health relevance, assessment and management of individual patients from whom CRAB is isolated remains a major challenge to clinicians for several reasons. First, differentiating critically ill patients with respiratory colonization from those with acute infections is rarely intuitive, and is particularly difficult among patients with severe immunocompromise and other high-risk conditions. Accordingly, CRAB-directed treatment is often initiated in the face of diagnostic uncertainty. Second, the majority of CRAB infections are pneumonia, and rapid molecular tests that identify CRAB from respiratory specimens are not routinely used in regions where CRAB is highly prevalent. This results in delayed treatment of CRAB pneumonia that contributes to poor outcomes. Third, CRAB pneumonia requires optimization of antimicrobial dosing to achieve pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) targets within the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) and lung parenchyma. Unfortunately, many of the available antimicrobial agents with in vitro activity against CRAB are limited by poor penetration into the lungs and dose-dependent toxicities (Table 1). Fourth, biofilm formation associated with CRAB infections is commonly associated with resistant phenotypes and enhanced virulence, highlighting the importance of removing indwelling devices contaminated with CRAB. Finally, clinical breakpoints to determine antibiotic susceptibility against CRAB isolates have either not been established, require revision, or vary across professional organizations.

### Therapeutic drug monitoring of high-dose sulbactam in pediatric patients: preliminary data from a prospective observational pharmacokinetic study [^114ts47o]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Rates of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii are rising in Thailand. Although high-dose (HD) sulbactam is recommended for treating carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii infections, data on plasma sulbactam concentrations in children are limited. We aimed to evaluate plasma sulbactam concentrations and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) target achievement in pediatric patients.

Methods

Prospective study data (January-November 2023) on children (1 month-18 years) who received sulbactam every 6–8 hours were analyzed. Mid-dosing (Cmid, 50% f T) and trough (Ctrough, 100% f T) concentrations were evaluated. PK-PD target achievement [50% f T > minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), 100% f T > MIC] was evaluated using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 2024 MIC cutoffs and MIC data of isolates of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex from this study.

Results

Thirty-five patients (median age 50 months) were categorized into standard-dose (SD) or HD groups. The geometric mean Cmid was higher in the HD (41.3mg/L) versus SD (19.5mg/L) groups (P = 0.006). Among 101 isolates of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex, the MIC50 and MIC90 (concentrations that inhibit 50% and 90% of isolates of the A. calcoaceticus-baumannii complex) were 16 and 128mg/L, respectively. The HD group achieved Cmid > MIC50 in 87.5% of the patients compared with 63.6% in SD (P = 0.17). Within the HD group, patients with augmented renal clearance (ARC) had lower Cmid (geometric mean 31.9mg/L) compared with non-ARC (geometric mean 63.4mg/L) (P = 0.04).

Conclusions

HD sulbactam resulted in higher Cmid and PK-PD achievement. ARC significantly compromised plasma sulbactam concentration. HD sulbactam may be preferable for treating critically ill pediatric patients and those with ARC, especially during the empirical period.

### Antimicrobials for the treatment of drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia in critically ill patients: a systemic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis [^115WFLas]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Study characteristics

The Bayesian NMA was performed using 23 studies that consist of a total of 2118 adult patients. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the studies including patient population, antimicrobial therapy with a total daily dose, and outcomes of each study. The NMA evaluated 15 different antimicrobial treatments, including intravenous colistin (IV COL), sulbactam (SUL), and tigecycline (TIG) as monotherapy or combination therapy. Among them, SUL and TIG administrated at their higher doses were separately categorized as high-dose (HD) regimens: HD SUL defined as a total daily dose of 9 g/day or higher and HD TIG as a total daily dose of 200 mg/day after a loading dose of 200 mg. Across the studies analyzed, the mean (or median) age of the patients ranged from 48 to 82 years, and the mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score from 12 to 24. Most studies reported two-arm comparisons except for two studies with three-arm comparisons. Figure 2 presents the network plots of direct comparisons for each outcome, showing predominant pairwise comparisons of antimicrobials with IV COL. IV COL also served as a bridge node to construct the network with a closed loop, allowing indirect comparisons within the network. Hence, IV COL was selected as a common comparator in the Bayesian NMA.

Impaired Renal Function

In patients with impairment of renal function the elimination kinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam are similarly affected, hence the ratio of one to the other will remain constant whatever the renal function. The dose of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection in such patients should be administered less frequently in accordance with the usual practice for ampicillin and according to the following recommendations:

### Navigating available treatment options for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex infections [^114RU4Dq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

A similar paradigm was previously established for the treatment of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)–producing Enterobacterales, where the utility of dual carbapenem therapy, or even extremely high doses of meropenem, to overcome KPC-mediated hydrolysis was investigated. While some clinical reports were encouraging, efficacy ultimately depended upon the use of carbapenems in combination with other in vitro active agents when carbapenem MICs were 8 mg/L or less. Even with ideal circumstances, patient outcomes remained poor. These strategies have largely been abandoned since the introduction of novel β-lactamase inhibitors like avibactam, relebactam, and vaborbactam, that inhibit KPC-mediated hydrolysis and protect partner β-lactam agents. Use of these novel agents has led to dramatically improved clinical outcomes and lower mortality for patients with KPC-producing Enterobacterales infections when compared with traditional combination approaches. A compelling hypothesis based on these data can be proposed for sulbactam, such that optimal use of sulbactam against CRAB is to similarly protect this agent from hydrolysis with a β-lactamase inhibitor. Until such options are clinically available and the evidence is fully evaluated, high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam (defined as regimens of at least 9 g/day of sulbactam) should be used in combination with at least 1 other in vitro active agent, and potentially 2 in vitro active agents when sulbactam MICs are either unknown or ≥ 16 mg/L. Which agents to use in combination is best informed by the infection site and patient-specific risk factors as summarized below.

The Example of Sulbactam/Durlobactam

Infections caused by carbapenem-resistant (CR) Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex (ABC) constitute an area of high unmet medical need. They are associated with significant mortality rates, ranging from 38% to 76%; nosocomial pneumonia is the most common infection type. In 2020 in the United States, an estimated 7,500 cases of CR ABC infection occurred, resulting in 700 deaths. Therapies to treat CR ABC infections are limited because of multiple resistance mechanisms demonstrated by A. baumannii. In patients with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) caused by a CR pathogen that is sensitive only to polymyxins, treatment with intravenous polymyxins (colistin or polymyxin B) is an option. However, current treatment guidelines acknowledge that no clear standard-of-care regimen exists for the treatment of CR ABC infections.

XACDURO (Innoviva Specialty Therapeutics, Inc.) is a combination of sulbactam and durlobactam that is administered intravenously. Sulbactam is an Ambler class A β-lactamase inhibitor; however, against A. baumannii, sulbactam exerts its effect by binding to penicillin-binding proteins, thereby inhibiting cell-wall biosynthesis. An increasing number of isolates possess > 1 β-lactamases that inactivate sulbactam. Durlobactam is a novel non–β‐lactam β‐lactamase inhibitor inactivating several serine β‐lactamases expressed by Acinetobacter that degrade sulbactam including those of Ambler classes A, C, and D. Durlobactam does not have intrinsic antibacterial activity against A. baumannii.

Approval of sulbactam/durlobactam relied primarily on a single phase 3, randomized, independent assessor–blinded, active-controlled noninferiority study in adults with HABP or VABP caused by CR ABC in which sulbactam/durlobactam was compared with colistin. A noninferiority margin of 20% was used in the clinical trial. Both treatment arms also received imipenem/cilastatin as background therapy for potential HABP/VABP pathogens other than CR ABC. The primary efficacy endpoint for the study was 28-day all-cause mortality.

Recent studies have highlighted the emergence of infections involving multiresistant Acinetobacter clinical isolates. Sulbactam offers direct antimicrobial activity against Acinetobacter species. Accordingly, co-administration of sulbactam with ampicillin or cefoperazone offers the potential of effective empirical therapy against Acinetobacter and other bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae in institutions in which they are susceptible. Many in vitro studies have indicated that Acinetobacter remains fully susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam or cefoperazone-sulbactam. Furthermore, ampicillin-sulbactam has proven clinically effective and well tolerated in the treatment of severe acinetobacter infections, including bacteremia. Therefore, ampicillin-sulbactam is a sensible option for the treatment of life-threatening acinetobacter infections.

PD Evaluation

The probabilities of attaining the PD target associated with the use of different sulbactam regimens at specific MICs are shown in Figure 2. The PK/PD breakpoint MICs (the highest MIC at which the target-attainment probability was ≥ 90%) are presented in Table 2. For 4-hour infusion regimens, the PK/PD breakpoint MICs for 25 mg/kg 4 times daily (100 mg/kg/day) in infants (4 weeks to 11 months), children (1–6 years old), and pediatrics (7–16 years old) achieved 16, 8, and 4 μg/mL, respectively. By increasing the dosage to 50 mg/kg 4 times daily (200 mg/kg/day), the corresponding PK/PD breakpoint MICs increased to 32, 16, and 8 μg/mL, respectively.

General

Immediately after completion of a 15-minute intravenous infusion of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, peak serum concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are attained. Ampicillin serum levels are similar to those produced by the administration of equivalent amounts of ampicillin alone. Peak ampicillin serum levels ranging from 109 to 150 mcg/mL are attained after administration of 2,000 mg of ampicillin plus 1,000 mg sulbactam and 40 to 71 mcg/mL after administration of 1,000 mg ampicillin plus 500 mg sulbactam. The corresponding mean peak serum levels for sulbactam range from 48 to 88 mcg/mL and 21 to 40 mcg/mL, respectively. After an intramuscular injection of 1,000 mg ampicillin plus 500 mg sulbactam, peak ampicillin serum levels ranging from 8 to 37 mcg/mL and peak sulbactam serum levels ranging from 6 to 24 mcg/mL are attained.

The mean serum half-life of both drugs is approximately 1 hour in healthy volunteers.

Approximately 75 to 85% of both ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted unchanged in the urine during the first 8 hours after administration of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection to individuals with normal renal function. Somewhat higher and more prolonged serum levels of ampicillin and sulbactam can be achieved with the concurrent administration of probenecid.

In patients with impaired renal function the elimination kinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam are similarly affected, hence the ratio of one to the other will remain constant whatever the renal function. The dose of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection in such patients should be administered less frequently in accordance with the usual practice for ampicillin (see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION section).

Ampicillin has been found to be approximately 28% reversibly bound to human serum protein and sulbactam approximately 38% reversibly bound.

The following average levels of ampicillin and sulbactam were measured in the tissues and fluids listed:

Penetration of both ampicillin and sulbactam into cerebrospinal fluid in the presence of inflamed meninges has been demonstrated after IV administration of ampicillin and sulbactam.

The pharmacokinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam in pediatric patients receiving ampicillin and sulbactam are similar to those observed in adults. Immediately after a 15-minute infusion of 50 to 75 mg ampicillin and sulbactam/kg body weight, peak serum and plasma concentrations of 82 to 446 mcg ampicillin/mL and 44 to 203 mcg sulbactam/mL were obtained. Mean half-life values were approximately 1 hour.

Discussion

PK/PD studies in recent years have shown that extension of the single-dose infusion time can improve the efficacy of time-dependent antibiotics. The results of the present research consistently suggested that, if cefoperazone/sulbactam single infusion time was extended to 3 hours, the serum drug concentration achieved the PK/PD standard of T > MIC% greater than 50% (MIC 90 64 mg/L). However, due to the development of drug resistance, the bacteria's MIC is generally high. Consequently, it is very difficult to achieve this PK/PD standard in the CSF, and a higher dose might be needed to treat intracranial infections. Taking into account the safety of the drug, a daily dose of 4 g daily dose of sulbactam was administered in the study. However, some papers recommended a daily sulbactam dose 6 g for the treatment of hospital-acquired Gram-negative bacterial infections, especially carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. On the other hand, despite the presence of the blood–brain barrier, drug doses cannot be increased without limitations. For intracranial infections caused by highly resistant bacteria, such as Acinetobacter baumannii, a special methods of drug administration, including extending the single infusion time while giving larger doses, local administration within the ventricles or subarachnoid space may need to be considered on the basis of strengthening comprehensive supportive care. Still, more studies are required to answer the question whether the specific method and dose administered topically can improve the therapeutic effect and how to avoid drug adverse effects.

### Antimicrobials for the treatment of drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia in critically ill patients: a systemic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis [^113Z3kVm]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

An optimal therapy for the treatment of pneumonia caused by drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii remains unclear. This study aims to compare various antimicrobial strategies and to determine the most effective therapy for pneumonia using a network meta-analysis.

Methods

Systematic search and quality assessment were performed to select eligible studies reporting one of the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, clinical cure, and microbiological eradication. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. A network meta-analysis was conducted with a Bayesian approach. Antimicrobial treatments were ranked based on surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) value along with estimated median outcome rate and corresponding 95% credible intervals (CrIs). Two treatments were considered significantly different if a posterior probability of superiority (P) was greater than 97.5%.

Results

Twenty-three studies evaluating 15 antimicrobial treatments were included. Intravenous colistin monotherapy (IV COL) was selected as a common comparator, serving as a bridge for developing the network. Five treatments ranked higher than IV COL (SUCRA, 57.1%; median all-cause mortality 0.45, 95% CrI 0.41–0.48) for reducing all-cause mortality: sulbactam monotherapy (SUL, 100.0%; 0.18, 0.04–0.42), high-dose SUL (HD SUL, 85.7%; 0.31, 0.07–0.71), fosfomycin plus IV COL (FOS+IV COL, 78.6%; 0.34, 0.19–0.54), inhaled COL plus IV COL (IH COL+IV COL, 71.4%; 0.39, 0.32–0.46), and high-dose tigecycline (HD TIG, 71.4%; 0.39, 0.16–0.67). Those five treatments also ranked higher than IV COL (SUCRA, 45.5%) for improving clinical cure (72.7%, 72.7%, 63.6%, 81.8%, and 90.9%, respectively). Among the five treatments, SUL (P = 98.1%) and IH COL+IV COL (P = 99.9%) were significantly superior to IV COL for patient survival and clinical cure, respectively. In terms of microbiological eradication, FOS+IV COL (P = 99.8%) and SUL (P = 98.9%) were significantly superior to IV COL.

Conclusions

This Bayesian network meta-analysis demonstrated the comparative effectiveness of fifteen antimicrobial treatments for drug-resistant A. baumannii pneumonia in critically ill patients. For survival benefit, SUL appears to be the best treatment followed by HD SUL, FOS+IV COL, IH COL+IV COL, HD TIG, and IV COL therapy, in numerical order.

### Sulbactam and durlobactam (Xacduro) [^111eEzNy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Specific Populations

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of sulbactam or durlobactam were observed based on age (18–91 years), gender, weight (35–150 kg), and race (White, Black, Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native, Other).

Patients with Renal Impairment

In a single-dose trial evaluating the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sulbactam and durlobactam, dose normalized systemic exposures of sulbactam and durlobactam were higher at all levels of renal impairment compared to healthy subjects with CLcr greater than or equal to 90 mL/min (Table 4). In subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, the fraction of the dose removed by hemodialysis was 0.41 and 0.33 for sulbactam and durlobactam, respectively.

To maintain systemic exposures similar to patients with normal renal function, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment. Patients on hemodialysis should receive XACDURO after hemodialysis session [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Specific Populations (8.6)].

Patients with CLcr 130 mL/min or Greater

Increased sulbactam and durlobactam clearance have been observed in patients with CLcr of 130 mL/min or greater. A XACDURO (1.0 g sulbactam and 1.0 g durlobactam) dose every 4 hours infused over 3 hours provided sulbactam and durlobactam exposures comparable to those in patients with CLcr 90 to 129 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Sulbactam and durlobactam are primarily cleared renally; therefore, hepatic impairment is not likely to have any effect on XACDURO exposures [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

XACDURO is a co-packaged product containing sulbactam, a beta-lactam antibacterial and beta lactamase inhibitor, and durlobactam, a beta lactamase inhibitor, indicated in patients 18 years of age and older for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP), caused by susceptible isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex. (1.1)

Limitations of Use:

XACDURO is not indicated for the treatment of HABP/VABP caused by pathogens other than susceptible isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex. (1.1, 14)

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of XACDURO and other antibacterial drugs, XACDURO should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. (1.2)

1.1 Hospital-acquired Bacterial Pneumonia and Ventilator-associated Bacterial Pneumonia (HABP/VABP)

XACDURO is indicated in patients 18 years of age and older for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP), caused by susceptible isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex.

Limitations of Use

XACDURO is not indicated for the treatment of HABP/VABP caused by pathogens other than susceptible isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.2 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of XACDURO and other antibacterial drugs, XACDURO should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Optimization of the treatment with β-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients-guidelines from the French society of pharmacology and therapeutics (sociéTéfrançaise de pharmacologie et Thérapeutique-SFPT) and the French society of anaesthesia and intensive care medicine (sociéTéfrançaise D'anesthésie et Réanimation-SFAR) [^112WfQ1R]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of antibiotics in the critical care setting is very common. A large multicenter European study reported antibiotic use in 64% of patients during their stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). In France, nearly half of ICU patients are treated with antibiotics on a given day. ICU, together with infectious disease wards, are the two largest prescribers of antibiotics in the hospital (> 1500 defined daily doses delivered/1000 days of hospitalization). Beta-lactams are the most commonly used antibiotic class in critical care worldwide, accounting for instance for 69% of antibiotics consumed in France in 2015.

The severity of infections and the frequent resistance in ICU-acquired infections, as well as the numerous pathophysiological specificities related to the critical care setting, make the conduct of beta-lactam treatment in critical care patients challenging. However, sepsis and septic shock require the rapid administration of the appropriate antibiotic at the appropriate dose. Indeed, numerous studies have shown that a delay in the administration of an appropriate antibacterial therapy is associated with increased mortality in the most severe patients. The risk of treatment failure appears therefore to be at the same time higher and more serious than for non-critically ill patients. In this context, the unpredictability of critical care patients' exposure to beta-lactam antibiotics for a given dose should be particularly taking into account, advocating for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of beta-lactams. Available studies support this strategy, even if the clinical impact on patient's prognosis is not yet fully demonstrated. In addition, concentration targets are not consensually defined although it is an essential prerequisite for conducting further studies. However, pending large randomised clinical trials, TDM performed since the first few hours of treatment and frequently controlled on the following days may allow for a best achievement of concentration targets while limiting the risk of adverse events. Thus, in the era of personalized medicine, the individualization of beta-lactam dosage and administration regimen seems, more than elsewhere, to be required in critically ill patients. Although evidence of the beneficial clinical impact of this approach is growing in the scientific literature, there is currently no positioning of learned societies on this subject.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis of early onset pneumonia in critically ill comatose patients. A randomized study [^114q6m4q]. Intensive Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate if a 3-day ampicillin-sulbactam prophylaxis can reduce the occurrence of early-onset pneumonia (EOP) in comatose mechanically-ventilated patients.

Design

This was a single-centre, prospective, randomised, open study.

Setting

A 10-bed general-neurological ICU in a 2,000-bed university hospital.

Patients and Participants

Comatose mechanically-ventilated patients with traumatic, surgical or medical brain injury.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to either ampicillin-sulbactam prophylaxis (3 g every 6 h for 3 days) plus standard treatment or standard treatment alone.

Measurements and Results

Main outcome was the occurrence of EOP. Secondary outcome measures were occurrence of late-onset pneumonia, percentage of non-pulmonary infections and of emerging multiresistant bacteria, duration of mechanical ventilation and of ICU stay and ICU mortality. Interim analysis at 1 year demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of EOP in the ampicillin-sulbactam group, and the study was interrupted. Overall, 39.5% of the patients developed EOP, 57.9% in the standard treatment group and 21.0% in the ampicillin-sulbactam group (chi-square 5.3971; P = 0.022). Relative risk reduction of EOP in patients receiving ampicillin-sulbactam prophylaxis was 64%; the number of patients to be treated to avoid one episode of EOP was three. No differences in other outcome parameters were found; however, the small sample size precluded a definite analysis.

Conclusions

Antibiotic prophylaxis with ampicillin-sulbactam significantly reduced the occurrence of EOP in critically ill comatose mechanically ventilated patients. This result should encourage a large multicenter trial to demonstrate whether ampicillin-sulbactam prophylaxis reduces patient mortality, and whether antibiotic resistance is increased in patients receiving prophylaxis.

Ampicillin–sulbactam — role in empiric therapy for intra-abdominal infection (IAI): Based on clinical and microbiologic data, the task force concluded that other agents were preferable to ampicillin–sulbactam for the empiric treatment of patients with IAI, noting limited efficacy studies and low susceptibility of Escherichia coli. In the most recent SMART data, only 34% of hospital-associated strains and 45% of community-acquired strains of E. coli were susceptible to this agent, and one study since 2008 found ampicillin–sulbactam inferior to ertapenem. Although ampicillin–sulbactam does have some activity against A. baumannii and may have use in pathogen-directed therapy, the majority of Acinetobacter strains isolated from patients with IAI are not susceptible.

### Navigating available treatment options for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex infections [^116DsWLE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex (CRAB) is one of the top-priority pathogens for new antibiotic development. Unlike other antibiotic-resistant threats, none of the available therapies have been shown to consistently reduce mortality or improve patient outcomes in clinical trials. Antibiotic combination therapy is routinely used in clinical practice; however, the preferred combination has not been defined. This narrative review focuses on evidence-based solutions for the treatment of invasive CRAB infections. We dissect the promise and perils of traditional agents used in combination, such as colistin, sulbactam, and the tetracyclines, and offer clinical pearls based on our interpretation of the available data. Next, we investigate the merits of newly developed β-lactam agents like cefiderocol and sulbactam-durlobactam, which have demonstrated contrasting results in recent randomized clinical trials. The review concludes with the authors' perspective on the evolving treatment landscape for CRAB infections, which is complicated by limited clinical data, imperfect treatment options, and a need for future clinical trials. We propose that effective treatment for CRAB infections requires a personalized approach that incorporates host factors, the site of infection, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic principles, local molecular epidemiology of CRAB isolates, and careful interpretation of antibiotic susceptibility testing results. In most clinical scenarios, a dose-optimized, sulbactam-based regimen is recommended with the addition of at least one other in vitro active agent. Should sulbactam-durlobactam receive regulatory approval, recommendations will need to be re-evaluated with the most recent evidence.

### Can pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles Be applied to the treatment of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter? [^113moi6p]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss treatment options that can be used for treatment of Acinetobac/erinfections.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1966-November 2010) was conducted to identify English-language literature on pharmacotherapy of Acinetobacter and the bibliographies of pertinent articles. Programs and abstracts from infectious diseases meetings were also searched. Search terms included Acinetobacter, multidrug resistance, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, Monte Carlo simulation, nosocomial pneumonia, carbapenems, polymyxins, sulbactam, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, tigecycline, rifampin, and fluoroquinolones.

Data Selection and Data Extraction

All articles were critically evaluated and all pertinent information was included in this review.

Data Synthesis

Multidrug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter, defined as resistance to 3 or more antimicrobial classes, has increased over the past decade. The incidence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter is also increasing, leading to an increased use of dose optimization techniques and/or alternative antimicrobials, which is driven by local susceptibility patterns. However, Acinetobacter infections that are resistant to all commercially available antibiotics have been reported. General principles are available to guide dose optimization of aminoglycosides, β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and tigecycline for infections due to gram-negative pathogens. Unfortunately, data specific to patients with Acinetobacter infections are limited. Recent pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic information has shed light on colistin dosing. The dilemma with colistin is its concentration-dependent killing, which makes once-daily dosing seem like an attractive option, but its short postantibiotic effect limits a clinician's ability to extend the dosing interval. Localized delivery of antimicrobials is also an attractive option due to the ability to increase drug concentration at the infection site while minimizing systemic adverse events, but more data are needed regarding this approach.

Conclusions

Increased reliance on dosage optimization, combination therapy, and localized delivery of antimicrobials are methods to pursue positive clinical outcomes in MDR Acinetobacter infections since novel antimicrobials will not be available for several years. Well-designed clinical trials with MDR Acinetobacter are needed to define the best treatment options for these patients.

### Navigating available treatment options for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex infections [^115SFAV4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex (CRAB) is one of the top-priority pathogens for new antibiotic development. Unlike other antibiotic-resistant threats, none of the available therapies have been shown to consistently reduce mortality or improve patient outcomes in clinical trials. Antibiotic combination therapy is routinely used in clinical practice; however, the preferred combination has not been defined. This narrative review focuses on evidence-based solutions for the treatment of invasive CRAB infections. We dissect the promise and perils of traditional agents used in combination, such as colistin, sulbactam, and the tetracyclines, and offer clinical pearls based on our interpretation of the available data. Next, we investigate the merits of newly developed β-lactam agents like cefiderocol and sulbactam-durlobactam, which have demonstrated contrasting results in recent randomized clinical trials. The review concludes with the authors' perspective on the evolving treatment landscape for CRAB infections, which is complicated by limited clinical data, imperfect treatment options, and a need for future clinical trials. We propose that effective treatment for CRAB infections requires a personalized approach that incorporates host factors, the site of infection, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic principles, local molecular epidemiology of CRAB isolates, and careful interpretation of antibiotic susceptibility testing results. In most clinical scenarios, a dose-optimized, sulbactam-based regimen is recommended with the addition of at least one other in vitro active agent. Should sulbactam-durlobactam receive regulatory approval, recommendations will need to be re-evaluated with the most recent evidence.

IS THERE A ROLE FOR TETRACYCLINES IN TREATMENT ALGORITHMS FOR INVASIVE CRAB INFECTIONS?

Unlike polymyxin- or sulbactam-based combinations, no randomized clinical trials have compared tetracycline-based regimens with other treatments for CRAB infections. Observational studies have yielded mixed results due to small sample sizes, non-standardized dosing regimens, variable infection types, and use of tetracyclines both as monotherapy and in combination. Most clinical data have been reported for tigecycline against CRAB infections (Table 1), and several notable findings have been described. First, tigecycline monotherapy is associated with higher all-cause mortality when compared with other treatment options, particularly in the setting of bacteremia or pneumonia. Second, when used in combination with colistin, the benefit of tigecycline is most consistently demonstrated when MICs are less than 2 mg/L. Notwithstanding, the preferred tigecycline-based combination has not been defined; a 3-drug combination that includes colistin, sulbactam, and tigecycline was associated with the highest rate of clinical cure when compared with other regimens in a meta-analysis of 29 studies and 2529 patients. Finally, higher tigecycline doses (200 mg loading dose followed by 100 mg every 12 hours) have been associated with improved outcomes compared with standard doses. Importantly, however, high-dose regimens have been used almost exclusively in combination with other in vitro active antibiotics, so its role as monotherapy is less clear. These findings should be considered in the context of tigecycline drug exposures that are suboptimal in respiratory tract, serum, and urine, and impacted by nonlinear plasma protein binding. Moreover, neither CLSI nor the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) have established a clinical breakpoint for tigecycline against Acinetobacter spp. As a result, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) susceptibility breakpoint against Enterobacterales (defined as MIC ≤ 2 mg/L) is often adopted erroneously in clinical practice.

Definitions

Bloodstream infections, pneumonia (with or without mechanical ventilation), or infections at any site (according to the criteria of the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency — ANVISA; supplementary material) accompanied sepsis or septic shock, were considered severe infections. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and interpretation were performed according to the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing, unless otherwise indicated. MDR-GNB isolates were defined as Enterobacterales species, P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii with in vitro resistance to carbapenems, regardless of susceptibility to other antimicrobials; Enterobacterales species with in vitro resistance to both ceftriaxone and cefepime; P. aeruginosa with in vitro resistance to at least one of the following: ceftazidime, cefepime or carbapenems; or A. baumannii with in vitro susceptibility to carbapenems, but not susceptible to other beta-lactams, including ampicillin/sulbactam (if tested and interpreted according to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute). If the microbiology laboratory did not carry out susceptibility testing for non-carbapenem beta-lactams and for ampicillin/sulbactam, the A. baumannii isolate was considered resistant to these antimicrobials. These MDR-GNB definitions encompass the bacteria listed by World Health Organization as critical priority antimicrobial resistance profile (i.e. carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii, carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales), with the addition of carbapenem-susceptible but other first-line beta-lactams-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii).
