## Question

Immunotherapy for cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about cancer immunotherapy, including its mechanisms, modalities, biomarkers, resistance, combinations, special populations, and future directions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principles and historical context. Then, I should categorize the major immunotherapy modalities and their mechanisms. Next, I will examine predictive biomarkers and resistance, followed by combination strategies and trial design. After that, I should review disease-specific applications and special populations. Finally, I will consider toxicity management, duration of therapy, and future directions, making sure to verify claims against high-credibility guidelines and reviews at each step.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: cancer immunotherapy harnesses the immune system to recognize and eliminate malignant cells, leveraging specificity, clonal expansion, and memory that can confer durable control, which contrasts with the cytotoxic logic of chemotherapy and radiation. I should verify that this durable benefit is indeed a hallmark of immunotherapy and not overstated, and yes, contemporary reviews emphasize these adaptive immune features and their clinical implications for long-term tumor control [^116Prh7H].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about uniform efficacy; I need to check the historical arc and current limitations. After decades of incremental progress, the modern era began with approvals like sipuleucel-T and checkpoint inhibitors, yet most patients still do not derive durable benefit, so the field's challenge is to expand responders and deepen responses through better selection and combinations, which is repeatedly emphasized in consensus statements and expert reviews [^1179KGco] [^114titjo].

> Next, I should review the major modalities and mechanisms. Let me think about checkpoint inhibitors first. CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 blockade disinhibit T-cell activation and restore effector function, with nonredundant roles that underpin the rationale for combination therapy; I should confirm that dual blockade increases response rates at the cost of higher toxicity, which is consistent across melanoma and NSCLC literature and mechanistic summaries [^11476qs9].

> I will now examine adoptive cell therapy. CAR T cells redirect specificity to tumor antigens and have produced high response rates in B-cell malignancies, but I need to ensure I distinguish this from TIL therapy, which expands tumor-reactive lymphocytes and has recent approval in melanoma. Both carry unique toxicities like CRS and neurotoxicity, and manufacturing logistics remain a bottleneck, which is well documented in clinical introductions and regulatory summaries [^115mSMih] [^116yqqhM].

> Let me consider cancer vaccines and oncolytic viruses. Vaccines aim to prime antigen-specific T cells, while oncolytic viruses both lyse tumors and release antigens to amplify cross-priming. Wait, I should verify the clinical impact to date: vaccines have shown signals like antigen spread and survival benefits in some settings, but broad efficacy remains limited outside select indications, reinforcing the need for combination strategies and better adjuvanticity [^111HDCZG] [^114zByM2].

> I should confirm the role of cytokines and other immunomodulators. Interferon and IL-2 have long histories with meaningful but toxic activity in subsets, and newer agents like IL-15 superagonists and TGF-β blockade are being explored to enhance NK and T-cell function, though I need to be cautious not to overstate current approvals beyond historical cytokine therapy and selected contexts [^116S6zKi].

> Now, biomarkers. PD-L1 expression is an imperfect but practical predictor in several tumor types, and I should double-check that companion diagnostics vary by indication and assay, which is emphasized in disease-specific guidelines. Beyond PD-L1, TMB, MSI-H/dMMR, and TILs enrich for response, while peripheral immune signatures and microbiome features are promising but not yet standardized, so I must avoid implying universal applicability [^113FXFdn] [^116YH8tL] [^1171AsPX].

> But wait, what if the tumor lacks antigen presentation or has JAK1/2 or B2M defects? I need to check how antigen processing and presentation machinery shapes resistance. Genomic alterations in HLA, β2-microglobulin, and interferon-γ signaling can blunt T-cell recognition, and these APM defects are increasingly recognized as clinical resistance mechanisms, which argues for integrated genomic and transcriptomic profiling in selection and combination design [^114zNbQv].

> Next, I should review resistance taxonomy. Primary resistance manifests as nonresponse within roughly 6 months, whereas secondary resistance follows an initial response and often reflects immunoediting, upregulation of alternative checkpoints, or T-cell exhaustion. I should confirm that SITC has formalized these definitions to harmonize clinical research and trial design, which is correct and guides endpoint interpretation [^116wfMGY] [^112TF9LY].

> I will now examine combination strategies. Dual checkpoint blockade increases response rates but also toxicity, so I need to ensure dose and schedule optimization are prioritized. Chemotherapy can induce immunogenic cell death and lymphodepletion, radiation can prime in situ vaccination, targeted agents can modulate antigenicity and the TME, and epigenetic therapy can upregulate antigen presentation; these synergies are mechanistically compelling but require careful sequencing and biomarker-guided selection to avoid additive toxicity without benefit [^1113bCK6] [^112tufun] [^1134JP5p].

> Hold on, I should verify trial design principles. Given the combinatorial explosion, rational selection, adaptive designs, and early biomarker integration are essential. SITC and other groups caution against empiric combinations and emphasize flexible dosing, milestone endpoints, and real-world evidence to accelerate learning while maintaining safety, which I should keep front-of-mind when interpreting early-phase data [^114Y63Hb] [^113NLkbS].

> Let me consider disease-specific applications. In melanoma, ICIs are standard with durable survival in a subset, and SITC advises that even patients with altered baseline immunity should not be automatically excluded, favoring referral to experienced centers for shared decision-making. In NSCLC, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are foundational in biomarker-selected populations. In breast cancer, PD-1 blockade combined with chemotherapy improves outcomes in PD-L1–positive TNBC, though many patients remain ineligible and optimal partners are still being defined. In colorectal cancer, MSI-H/dMMR predicts marked sensitivity to PD-1 blockade, with neoadjuvant-only regimens achieving high pathologic complete response rates in select cohorts. In prostate cancer, sipuleucel-T remains the only approved immunotherapy in mCRPC, and checkpoint monotherapy has largely failed, prompting vaccine–checkpoint combinations. In hematologic malignancies, CAR T cells have transformed outcomes in B-ALL and DLBCL, with antigen loss and manufacturing constraints as key challenges [^116mochN] [^114zAZJb] [^113FXFdn] [^114mbyLH] [^115BCgfM] [^112h1Foc].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. Patients with autoimmune disease can experience flares on ICIs, yet SITC advises individualized risk–benefit assessment rather than blanket exclusion, and baseline immunosuppression may blunt efficacy, which complicates selection and monitoring. Elderly patients generally tolerate ICIs reasonably well, but frailty and comorbidities require tailored dosing and vigilant toxicity surveillance [^116mochN] [^11612dxV].

> Next, I should review toxicity. Immune-related adverse events are distinct from cytotoxic chemotherapy and can affect any organ, so early recognition, corticosteroids, and specialty input are critical. SITC provides graded recommendations for irAE management, and I should confirm that multidisciplinary care pathways improve outcomes, which is consistently emphasized in guideline documents [^11612dxV] [^112EKc3x].

> Hmm, wait a minute, how long should we treat with PD-1 blockade? I initially thought continuous therapy until progression was standard, but I should double-check evolving data. Long-term melanoma cohorts suggest many complete responders maintain remission after stopping at 2 years, and some even after earlier cessation, prompting reevaluation of treatment duration to balance durability, toxicity, and cost; this is an active debate and should be individualized with biomarker and response-context considerations [^114rbuja].

> I will now examine future directions. Next-generation checkpoints like TIGIT, LAG-3, and TIM-3 are in trials, but I need to be cautious because several have underperformed, underscoring the dominance of PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 and the need for biologically informed combinations. Personalized neoantigen vaccines, in vivo CAR T cells, and bispecific T-cell engagers are advancing, and digital biomarkers, spatial transcriptomics, and single-cell profiling promise to refine selection and monitoring. Finally, modifiable host factors like the microbiome and diet are being actively studied, with early signals that antibiotic exposure and low microbiome diversity impair response, though prospective interventional trials are needed before routine clinical integration [^117DaaUX] [^1113bCK6] [^1171AsPX].

> In summary, I should confirm the core message: immunotherapy has transformed oncology by enabling durable responses in subsets, but most patients still do not benefit. Progress depends on rigorous biomarker-driven selection, rational combinations that address resistance mechanisms, optimized trial design, and vigilant toxicity management, all aligned with disease-specific guidelines and evolving standards of care [^1163pbVj] [^112US4zg].

Immunotherapy harnesses the immune system to fight cancer [^1163pbVj], with **checkpoint inhibitors** (PD-1/PD-L1, CTLA-4) [^112fX9rn] and **CAR T-cell therapy** [^115mSMih] achieving durable responses across multiple malignancies. It offers **distinct advantages** — including durable control and potential cure in some patients [^113ZSFDd] — but is limited by low response rates, primary and acquired resistance [^116wfMGY], and immune-related toxicities [^11612dxV]. Combination strategies (with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or radiation) [^1113bCK6] and biomarker-guided selection (PD-L1, MSI-H/dMMR, TMB) [^116wQzZL] are key to expanding benefit and overcoming resistance [^112tufun]. Ongoing research targets new checkpoints, cellular therapies, and personalized approaches to broaden efficacy and improve safety [^117DaaUX].

---

## Mechanisms of action

Immunotherapy works through **several mechanisms**, including:

- **Immune checkpoint inhibitors**: Block inhibitory pathways (PD-1/PD-L1, CTLA-4) [^112fX9rn] to restore T-cell activity against tumors [^112fX9rn].

- **Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy**: Genetically modifies T cells to target tumor antigens, enabling potent, specific cytotoxicity [^notfound].

- **Cancer vaccines**: Stimulate antigen-specific immune responses against tumor-associated antigens [^116jHwie].

- **Oncolytic viruses**: Infect and lyse tumor cells, releasing antigens that enhance immune recognition [^notfound].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Immunotherapy has demonstrated **significant clinical efficacy** across multiple cancer types:

| **Cancer type** | **Immunotherapy agent** | **Clinical outcomes** |
|-|-|-|
| Melanoma | Pembrolizumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab | - Durable responses <br/> - Improved overall survival [^notfound] |
| Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) | Pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab | - Improved progression-free and overall survival [^notfound] |
| Hodgkin lymphoma | Pembrolizumab, nivolumab | High response rates and durable remissions [^notfound] |
| Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) | CAR T-cell therapy (tisagenlecleucel) | High remission rates and potential cure [^notfound] |
| Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) | Atezolizumab, pembrolizumab | - Improved progression-free survival <br/> - Extended survival in selected patients [^113FXFdn] |

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite its successes, immunotherapy faces **several limitations**:

- **Low response rates**: Many patients do not respond, often due to tumor immune evasion or immunosuppressive microenvironments [^1127FePm].

- **Primary and acquired resistance**: Tumors develop resistance through various mechanisms, including antigen loss, upregulation of alternative checkpoints, and T-cell exhaustion [^116wfMGY].

- **Immune-related adverse events (irAEs)**: Autoimmune toxicities can affect multiple organs, requiring careful management [^11612dxV].

- **High cost and accessibility**: Financial and logistical barriers limit widespread access [^114rbuja].

---

## Combination therapies

Combination strategies aim to **enhance efficacy** and overcome resistance [^1113bCK6]. Examples include:

- **Checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy**: Improves response rates and survival in NSCLC, TNBC, and other solid tumors [^notfound].

- **Checkpoint inhibitors with targeted therapy**: Rational combinations based on tumor biology and immune modulation [^1147xxc8].

- **Checkpoint inhibitors with radiation therapy**: Enhances antigen presentation and immune priming [^114eUSmo].

---

## Biomarkers and personalized medicine

Biomarkers are critical for **patient selection** and optimizing outcomes [^116wQzZL]:

- **PD-L1 expression**: Predicts response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in several cancers [^111tzYFM].

- **Microsatellite instability (MSI-H)/mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR)**: Strong predictors of response to checkpoint inhibitors [^114mbyLH].

- **Tumor mutational burden (TMB)**: Higher TMB correlates with improved immunotherapy response [^notfound].

- **Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)**: Indicate pre-existing immune activation and predict better outcomes [^115sTA64].

---

## Future directions

The field is rapidly evolving, with **key future directions** including:

- **Next-generation checkpoint inhibitors**: Targeting novel immune checkpoints (e.g. TIGIT, LAG-3, TIM-3) [^117DaaUX].

- **Advanced CAR T-cell therapies**: Including allogeneic CAR T cells and CAR NK cells [^notfound].

- **Personalized immunotherapy**: Tailoring treatments based on individual tumor and immune profiles [^117PHFVy].

- **Improved biomarker discovery**: Identifying new predictive and prognostic markers [^116YH8tL].

---

Immunotherapy represents a **paradigm shift** in oncology, offering durable responses and potential cures in some cancers. Continued research, combination strategies, and biomarker-driven personalization are essential to broaden its impact and overcome current limitations [^112US4zg].

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are the standard of care for the treatment of several cancers. While these immunotherapies have improved patient outcomes in many clinical settings, they bring accompanying risks of toxicity, specifically immune-related adverse events (irAEs). There is a need for clear, effective guidelines for the management of irAEs during ICI treatment, motivating the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) to convene an expert panel to develop a clinical practice guideline. The panel discussed the recognition and management of single and combination ICI irAEs and ultimately developed evidence- and consensus-based recommendations to assist medical professionals in clinical decision-making and to improve outcomes for patients.

### Using preclinical data to design combination clinical trials of radiation therapy and immunotherapy [^116eYhui]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Immunotherapies are rapidly entering the clinic as approved treatments for diverse cancer pathologies. Radiation therapy is an integral partner in cancer therapy, commonly as part of complicated multimodality approaches that optimize patient outcomes. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the success of radiation therapy in tumor control is due in part to immune mechanisms, and that outcomes following radiation therapy can be improved through combination with a range of immunotherapies. However, preclinical models of cancer are very different from patient tumors, and the way these preclinical tumors are treated is often very different from standard of care treatment of patients. This review examines the preclinical and clinical data for the role of the immune system in radiation therapy outcomes, and how to integrate preclinical findings into clinical trials, using ongoing studies as examples.

### Why has immune "checkpoint" therapy failed in most clinical trials? [^117DaaUX]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Cancer immunotherapy targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has demonstrated efficacy across a range of common solid tumors and some hematopoietic malignancies. Despite these groundbreaking successes, the clinical development of other 'checkpoint inhibitors' targeting molecules like TIM-3, TIGIT, ICOS and others, has largely fallen short, often showing minimal clinical benefit even in combination with anti-PD therapy. This article explores three key hypotheses that help explain the disparity in therapeutic success: (1) the absence of tumor- specific immunosuppressive logic in many checkpoint targets, (2) the dominance — but not redundancy — of immune evasion mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME), and (3) the emergence of therapy-induced resistance. This is not intended as a comprehensive review of the literature. Instead, it highlights select evidence to explain past failures and to illuminate a more strategic, biologically informed path forward.

### The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer consensus statement on immunotherapy for the treatment of prostate carcinoma [^111rXRKB]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

How do you determine that it is time to start another treatment after having used sipuleucel-T?

Consensus recommendations

The next treatment may be triggered by an event or initiated earlier. Patients must be aware that immunologic therapy may take time and that typical measures of response, as determined by decreases in serum PSA or size of lesions on radiographic studies, are not likely to be affected. To address the issues involved with the atypical response measured with immunotherapy, the FDA has drafted guidance for industry concerning treatment past progression when using therapeutic cancer vaccines. Moreover, in measuring treatment response, immune-related response criteria have been developed to more accurately measure the response patterns observed with immunotherapy. Managing patient expectations with a therapy such as this is consequently important and complex. These outcomes are based on results from phase III trials and on clinical experience, and hence are considered Level A evidence.

Are there other considerations for repeat dosing or changes in the dosing schedule of sipuleucel-T?

Consensus recommendations

There are clinical situations in which there may be increased intervals between doses. There are no immunological hypotheses that would preclude continuing infusions, even with a delay. Currently the data that exist are observations during the randomized clinical trials.

Literature review and analysis

The recommendations from this discussion were based on the results and data from the phase III trials and meta-analyses. Essentially they reflect the methodology in the literature and the pharmaceutical guidelines. At this time, there are no data to recommend moving the frequency from every 2 weeks to every 4 weeks. However, there is no recognized harm from a delay if it occurs.

### Role of antigen spread and distinctive characteristics of immunotherapy in cancer treatment [^114zByM2]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2017). Low credibility.

Immunotherapy is an important breakthrough in cancer. US Food and Drug Administration-approved immunotherapies for cancer treatment (including, but not limited to, sipuleucel-T, ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab) substantially improve overall survival across multiple malignancies. One mechanism of action of these treatments is to induce an immune response against antigen-bearing tumor cells; the resultant cell death releases secondary (nontargeted) tumor antigens. Secondary antigens prime subsequent immune responses (antigen spread). Immunotherapy-induced antigen spread has been shown in clinical studies. For example, in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients, sipuleucel-T induced early immune responses to the immunizing antigen (PA2024) and/or the target antigen (prostatic acid phosphatase). Thereafter, most patients developed increased antibody responses to numerous secondary proteins, several of which are expressed in prostate cancer with functional relevance in cancer. The ipilimumab-induced antibody profile in melanoma patients shows that antigen spread also occurs with immune checkpoint blockade. In contrast to chemotherapy, immunotherapy often does not result in short-term changes in conventional disease progression end points (eg, progression-free survival, tumor size), which may be explained, in part, by the time taken for antigen spread to occur. Thus, immune-related response criteria need to be identified to better monitor the effectiveness of immunotherapy. As immunotherapy antitumor effects take time to evolve, immunotherapy in patients with less advanced cancer may have greater clinical benefit vs those with more advanced disease. This concept is supported by prostate cancer clinical studies with sipuleucel-T, PSA-TRICOM, and ipilimumab. We discuss antigen spread with cancer immunotherapy and its implications for clinical outcomes.

### Combination immunotherapy: a road map [^112tufun]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The number of cancer patients who benefit from immunotherapy has increased due to a better understanding of the immune response to cancer along with recent advances in biomarker development. The goal of combination approaches is to expand the spectrum of patients who respond to cancer immunotherapy (more responding patients in tumors that are sensitive to monotherapy and the identification of new sensitive tumor types that do not respond to monotherapy alone) and to improve the quality of clinical responses (i.e. extension of response duration, PFS, and OS) beyond what can be achieved with monotherapy alone. With research to further elucidate the mechanisms of action behind these agents as well as increased understanding of the resistant counter defense employed by tumors, the development of rational combination approaches is now extending even beyond doublets. Novel triplet regimens of synergistic combinations of immunotherapy agents as well as immunotherapy with conventional or targeted therapies are being investigated in a variety of disease settings. There is tremendous potential for these approaches to extend the clinical success of immunotherapies. However, the added benefit of each additional drug must be properly evaluated against the added toxicities as well as economic impact of the cost of these strategies (the "value proposition"). Previous experience also demonstrates that combination approaches should not be developed solely on the standard dosing and regimens of single agents. Instead, there is a need to investigate the dose and schedule of combination immunotherapies thoroughly and with added flexibility to optimize the dose, schedule, and configuration of each agent. Moreover, the optimal dose and schedule for a given combination may differ across disease indications. Although pre-clinical animal models have limitations, they can be useful for assessing the therapeutic potential of specific combination regimens, interrogating the mechanism of action, and providing insight into the underlying biology of various therapeutic strategies. Progress in combination immunotherapy will also depend on thorough clinical testing, with proper clinical trial design and endpoints. The SITC Combination Therapies Taskforce has summarized the critical issues currently facing the clinical development of combination immunotherapy (Table 2). These issues should help focus further development and promote discussion among academic, industry, and regulatory partners to more fully realize the potential of combination immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer.

### Hallmarks of response to immune checkpoint blockade [^111FFDBD]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The treatment of cancer has been arduous, marked by just as much heterogeneity in cancer treatment modality and outcome as is now known to exist at a cellular and molecular level within tumours themselves. Cancer burden, morbidity, and mortality have a wide reaching impact globally, but recent advancements in precision medicine have given the field of oncology an opportunity to greatly improve therapeutic strategies. As the relative 'new kid on the block', cancer immunotherapy differs from conventional chemotherapeutic agents in that its mechanism of action employs, engages, or enhances a functional immune response to tumour cells, rather than aiming principally to physically remove or destroy cancer cells through inherent radio- or chemical toxicity. Importantly, although immunotherapy is commonly thought of as a new treatment modality, the first immunotherapy approaches in fact predate the discovery and development of cytotoxic agents for the treatment of cancer, or even the discovery of X-rays, let alone the therapeutic use of non-ionising radiation. Furthermore, immunotherapy encompasses several subtypes of treatment modality, including vaccination strategies, cell-based therapies using the patient's own immune cells with or without ex vivo modification, and immunomodulatory agents, of which checkpoint inhibitor therapies have been the most broadly successful to date.

### From famine to feast: developing early-phase combination immunotherapy trials wisely [^114Y63Hb]. Clinical Cancer Research (2017). Low credibility.

Not until the turn of this century has immunotherapy become a fundamental component of cancer treatment. While monotherapy with immune modulators, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, provides a subset of patients with durable clinical benefit and possible cure, combination therapy offers the potential for antitumor activity in a greater number of patients. The field of immunology has provided us with a plethora of potential molecules and pathways to target. This abundance makes it impractical to empirically test all possible combinations efficiently. We recommend that potential immunotherapy combinations be chosen based on sound rationale and available data to address the mechanisms of primary and acquired immune resistance. Novel trial designs may increase the proportion of patients receiving potentially efficacious treatments and, at the same time, better define the balance of clinical activity and safety. We believe that implementing a strategic approach in the early development of immunotherapy combinations will expedite the delivery of more effective therapies with improved safety and durable outcomes.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer [^117PQ2oc]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Both earlier detection and treatment based on identification of three major clinically relevant subtypes of breast cancer (ie, hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive and triple-negative) have improved outcomes for patients with breast cancer. Although breast cancer mortality has decreased by 40% since 1989, prognosis remains poor for patients who develop metastatic disease. For example, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is associated with earlier age of onset and is more aggressive than other subtypes with a median survival of only 12–18 months in the metastatic setting. Historically, the therapeutic options for metastatic TNBC have been limited to standard chemotherapy, a strategy that typically results in the rapid emergence of chemotherapy-refractory disease.

In recent years, immunotherapy has emerged as a novel option for many difficult-to-treat cancers. In contrast to other solid tumors for which the role of immunotherapy is well-established, breast cancer has long been considered to be an immunologically 'cold' tumor, with relatively lower levels of T cell infiltration and lower mutational burdens compared to melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and other malignancies. More recently, the role of the immune system in both breast cancer progression and treatment response and resistance has come under critical re-evaluation, opening the door toward immunotherapeutic treatment. Retrospective analyses of tissue samples from clinical trials in breast cancer have revealed associations between lymphocytic infiltration into tumors and survival outcomes. Furthermore, expression of the immune checkpoint proteins programmed cell death protein 1 and its ligand (PD-1 and PD-L1) within the tumor microenvironmentsupports a role for breast cancer immunoediting. This is the three-phase process by which anti-cancer immune responses evolve to immune escape and disease progression.

### Combination immunotherapy: a road map [^112onBeu]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

We are entering an exciting era for combination immunotherapy that offers the prospect to build upon the powerful proof-of-principle established by the clinical experience with combination checkpoint blockade. Several key considerations may play an important role in enabling future progress with this approach. These include: a) rigorous assessment of the optimal dose, sequence, and schedule of agents in both preclinical models and the clinical setting; b) flexible approaches to decision-making in the selection of dose and schedule, and application of this decision-making across multiple indications; c) recognition that some agents may have limited monotherapy clinical activity, yet have high potential for clinical activity in the setting of an immunotherapy combination; d) careful attention to supportive care, including education of both patients and all members of the health-care team regarding the importance of early recognition and intervention for the management of irAEs; and e) the use of properly designed trials that enable efficient testing of the safety and clinical activity of combination immunotherapy regimens.

### Cancer immunotherapy beyond checkpoint blockade: state-of-the-art review [^1157fVDA]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Although predicted as a potential antitumor treatment modality more than 50 years ago, clinically tractable cancer immunotherapies have become a reality only in the past decade. This achievement is based on many decades of research advances elucidating basic mechanisms of both immunity and tumorigenesis. With the identification of new targets and novel combinations, use of immunotherapy in oncology is likely to grow in the coming decades because of its distinct advantages over more traditional anticancer drugs in terms of both depth and durability of potential responses. Rapid expansion of the therapeutic arsenal has presented challenges to clinicians, regulators, and the health care system, as mechanisms of action, response patterns, toxicities, and costs of these therapies diverge significantly from prior generations of cancer treatments. However, a few hallmarks of immune-based therapies have emerged from their widespread clinical adoption, including marked and durable survival benefits despite a low initial responding fraction of patients, as well as loss of immunotherapy sensitivity in some treated patients. These response patterns highlight future directions for research and development, which must continue to address issues of immune priming as well as both primary and secondary immune resistance, to achieve durable cancer control and cures.

### Cancer immunotherapy: the beginning of the end of cancer? [^111MErHJ]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

These are exciting times for cancer immunotherapy. After many years of disappointing results, the tide has finally changed and immunotherapy has become a clinically validated treatment for many cancers. Immunotherapeutic strategies include cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, adoptive transfer of ex vivo activated T and natural killer cells, and administration of antibodies or recombinant proteins that either costimulate cells or block the so-called immune checkpoint pathways. The recent success of several immunotherapeutic regimes, such as monoclonal antibody blocking of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), has boosted the development of this treatment modality, with the consequence that new therapeutic targets and schemes which combine various immunological agents are now being described at a breathtaking pace. In this review, we outline some of the main strategies in cancer immunotherapy (cancer vaccines, adoptive cellular immunotherapy, immune checkpoint blockade, and oncolytic viruses) and discuss the progress in the synergistic design of immune-targeting combination therapies.

### The role of adaptive immunity in the efficacy of targeted cancer therapies [^117A8qfX]. Trends in Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Accumulating evidence indicates that the efficacy of tumor-targeted therapies relies on the host immune response, including targeted small-molecule and antibody approaches that were not previously thought to have an immune component. Here, we review the current understanding of how targeted therapies on tumor cells could have a major impact on the immune response, and how this relates to the therapeutic efficacy of these approaches. In this context, we evaluate different strategies that combine targeted therapies with immunotherapy approaches, and discuss past and ongoing clinical trials. We highlight gaps in knowledge, and argue that significant progress for combined therapies will require a better understanding of the complex interactions between immune cells, the tumor, and the tumor microenvironment (TME) in different cancer settings.

### The evolving role of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer treatment [^111swvKc]. The Oncologist (2015). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Traditional treatment modalities for advanced cancer (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or targeted agents) act directly on tumors to inhibit or destroy them. Along with surgery, these modalities are predominantly palliative, with toxicity and only modest improvements in survival in patients with advanced solid tumors. Accordingly, long-term survival rates for most patients with advanced cancer remain low, thus there is a need for cancer treatments with favorable benefit and toxicity profiles that can potentially result in long-term survival. The immune system plays a critical role in the recognition and eradication of tumor cells ("immune surveillance"), and immunotherapies based on this concept have been used for decades with some success against a few tumor types; however, most immunotherapies were limited by a lack of either substantial efficacy or specificity, resulting in toxicity. We now have a greater understanding of the complex interactions between the immune system and tumors and have identified key molecules that govern these interactions. This information has revitalized the interest in immunotherapy as an evolving treatment modality using immunotherapeutics designed to overcome the mechanisms exploited by tumors to evade immune destruction. Immunotherapies have potentially complementary mechanisms of action that may allow them to be combined with other immunotherapeutics, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or other traditional therapies. This review discusses the concepts and data behind immunotherapies, with a focus on the checkpoint inhibitors and their responses, toxicities, and potential for long-term survival, and explores promising single-agent and combination therapies in development.

Implications For Practice

Immunotherapy is an evolving treatment approach based on the role of the immune system in eradicating cancer. An example of an immunotherapeutic is ipilimumab, an antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) to augment antitumor immune responses. Ipilimumab is approved for advanced melanoma and induced long-term survival in a proportion of patients. The programmed death-1 (PD-1) checkpoint inhibitors are promising immunotherapies with demonstrated sustained antitumor responses in several tumors. Because they harness the patient's own immune system, immunotherapies have the potential to be a powerful weapon against cancer.

### Cancer immunotherapy: the beginning of the end of cancer? [^116jHwie]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The ideal vaccine will be one able to trigger the maturation of DCs to a state where they can promote the production of tumor-reactive, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. It is possible that conditions for immunization will finally be optimized; however, the efficacy of a tumor-specific T cell population may still be compromised by the numerous mechanisms of immunoevasion exploited by tumors to defend against T cell attack. These are not reasons to exclude vaccines from consideration as part of an immunotherapy, but rather to call attention to some of the limitations in assessing success in the absence of other immunological regimes. Work on vaccines should continue in a methodical fashion with human studies, since animal models are unlikely to illuminate the best path forward. In addition, similar to all forms of targeted therapy in cancer, the discovery and application of predictive biomarkers or diagnostics, for the identification of those patients most likely to profit from a given vaccine, will be an important challenge for future development.

### Immunotherapy for metastatic prostate cancer: immuno-cold or the tip of the iceberg? [^113mWX69]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer is in critical need of new and innovative treatment strategies. Since the approval of sipuleucel-T, the investigatory climate of prostate cancer immunotherapy has been rapidly evolving with promising developments in vaccine and immune checkpoint therapies.

Recent Findings

Sipuleucel-T remains the first and only therapeutic cancer vaccine approved for its survival benefit in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Additional cancer vaccines are currently being evaluated, with the most promising being a peptide vaccine encoding prostate-specific antigen, known as prostate-specific antigen-TRICOM. Emerging data supports combinatorial strategies for vaccine therapy and a potential role for implementation in earlier stages of advanced disease. Immune checkpoint therapies have demonstrated limited success in prostate cancer with negative late phase trials for ipilimumab monotherapy and discouraging early phase results for programmed cell death protein 1 blockade. Novel immune-modulatory targets and rational combination strategies aim to produce more favorable results. Recent progress has been made to determine biologic predictors for response and toxicity in prostate cancer immunotherapy aiming to improve patient selection and safety.

Summary

Steady progress is anticipated in the field of prostate cancer immunotherapy including ongoing development of novel cancer vaccines, immune checkpoint therapies, and combinatorial strategies.

### The importance of correctly timing cancer immunotherapy [^113mhTzh]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The treatment options for cancer-surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy-are now supplemented with immunotherapy. Previously underappreciated but now gaining strong interest are the immune modulatory properties of the three conventional modalities. Moreover, there is a better understanding of the needs and potential of the different immune therapeutic platforms. Key to improved treatment will be the combinations of modalities that complete each other's shortcomings. Area covered: Tumor-specific T-cells are required for optimal immunotherapy. In this review, the authors focus on the correct timing of different types of chemotherapeutic agents or immune modulators and immunotherapeutic drugs, not only for the activation and expansion of tumor-specific T-cells but also to support and enhance their anti-tumor efficacy. Expert opinion: At an early phase of disease, clinical success can be obtained using single treatment modalities but at later disease stages, combinations of several modalities are required. The gain in success is determined by a thorough understanding of the direct and indirect immune effects of the modalities used. Profound knowledge of these effects requires optimal tuning of immunomonitoring. This will guide the appropriate combination of treatments and allow for correct sequencing the order and interval of the different therapeutic modalities.

### Cancer immunotherapy – revisited [^115jdZDD]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2011). Medium credibility.

Our insight into antitumour immune responses has increased considerably during the past decades, yet the development of immunotherapy as a treatment modality for cancer has been hampered by several factors. These include difficulties in the selection of the optimal dose and schedule, the methods of evaluation, and financial support. Although durable clinical remissions have been observed with various immunotherapeutic strategies, the percentage of patients who benefited from these interventions has remained too small to justify the general use of such strategies. However, the recent positive results of clinical trials with novel immunoactive drugs as well as the unexpected finding of a positive interaction between immunotherapy and chemotherapy may herald a new era for the immunotherapy of cancer.

### Immunotherapy of cancer in 2012 [^116S6zKi]. CA (2012). Low credibility.

The immunotherapy of cancer has made significant strides in the past few years due to improved understanding of the underlying principles of tumor biology and immunology. These principles have been critical in the development of immunotherapy in the laboratory and in the implementation of immunotherapy in the clinic. This improved understanding of immunotherapy, enhanced by increased insights into the mechanism of tumor immune response and its evasion by tumors, now permits manipulation of this interaction and elucidates the therapeutic role of immunity in cancer. Also important, this improved understanding of immunotherapy and the mechanisms underlying immunity in cancer has fueled an expanding array of new therapeutic agents for a variety of cancers. Pegylated interferon-α2b as an adjuvant therapy and ipilimumab as therapy for advanced disease, both of which were approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for melanoma in March 2011, are 2 prime examples of how an increased understanding of the principles of tumor biology and immunology have been translated successfully from the laboratory to the clinical setting. Principles that guide the development and application of immunotherapy include antibodies, cytokines, vaccines, and cellular therapies. The identification and further elucidation of the role of immunotherapy in different tumor types, and the development of strategies for combining immunotherapy with cytotoxic and molecularly targeted agents for future multimodal therapy for cancer will enable even greater progress and ultimately lead to improved outcomes for patients receiving cancer immunotherapy.

### Combination immunotherapy: a road map [^117H5vHC]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

The availability of numerous murine models that allow establishment of human tumors and immune system components provides an important resource for more rapidly testing rational combinations of immunotherapy agents. The large number of models further promotes more relevant systems to assess both therapeutic response and propensity for irAEs. While all models have limitations (see Table 1), the range of models allows selection of systems that most closely resemble the particular cancer, immunologic targets, and genetic factors that most closely mirror the human host and permit more rapid development of novel combination treatment strategies for clinical trials.

There has been considerable controversy regarding limitations, both real and perceived, in the utility of preclinical tumor models as tools to inform the clinical development of new oncology agents. While some limitations are certainly clear, in other instances, concerns may be driven by mouse models being used inappropriately or unrealistically, as opposed to intrinsic flaws in the models themselves. For several reasons, preclinical models may be particularly useful for cancer immunotherapy and in the development of new combination immunotherapy regimens. Optimizing the dose, schedule, and configuration of immunotherapeutic combinations may be complex, yet as discussed above, is critical to additively or synergistically engage immunoregulatory mechanisms and maximize the risk-benefit profile of a given regimen. This may necessitate the comparison of a range of distinct schedules and configurations for combinations to maximize both their pharmacodynamic activity and their antitumor efficacy with acceptable tolerability. While the need for additional clinical optimization of dose and schedule is often inevitable, the assessment of new regimens in rigorous preclinical models may help to substantially focus the scope and cost of these efforts, and also may enable the interrogation of candidate clinical biomarkers to monitor the biologic activity of these combinations. Preclinical models may also enable more thorough understanding of the interaction between tumor and the host immune system in vivo, and may be utilized to enable rational, hypothesis-driven identification of mechanism-based combinations for clinical testing. In tandem with more rigorous early clinical development of combination regimens, preclinical models may play an important role in identifying and optimizing the safety, clinical activity, and overall risk-benefit profile of immunotherapeutic combinations.

### Integrating immunotherapy and targeted therapy in cancer treatment: mechanistic insights and clinical implications [^1147xxc8]. Clinical Cancer Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Small-molecule targeted therapies have demonstrated outstanding potential in the clinic. These drugs are designed to minimize adverse effects by selectively attacking cancer cells while exerting minimal damage to normal cells. Although initial response to targeted therapies may be high, yielding positive response rates and often improving survival for an important percentage of patients, resistance often limits long-term effectiveness. On the other hand, immunotherapy has demonstrated durable results, yet for a limited number of patients. Growing evidence indicates that some targeted agents can modulate different components of the antitumor immune response. These include immune sensitization by inhibiting tumor cell-intrinsic immune evasion programs or enhancing antigenicity, as well as direct effects on immune effector and immunosuppressive cells. The combination of these two approaches, therefore, has the potential to result in synergistic and durable outcomes for patients. In this review, we focus on the latest advances on integrating immunotherapy with small-molecule targeted inhibitors. In particular, we discuss how specific oncogenic events differentially affect immune response, and the implications of these findings on the rational design of effective combinations of immunotherapy and targeted therapies.

### Cancer immunotherapy: the beginning of the end of cancer? [^116w2KpA]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The idea of exploiting the host's immune system to treat cancer dates back decades and relies on the insight that the immune system can eliminate malignant cells during initial transformation in a process termed immune surveillance. Individual human tumors arise through a combination of genetic and epigenetic changes that facilitate immortality, but at the same time create foreign antigens, the so-called neo-antigens, which should render neoplastic cells detectable by the immune system and target them for destruction. Nevertheless, although the immune system is capable of noticing differences in protein structure at the atomic level, cancer cells manage to escape immune recognition and subsequent destruction. To achieve this, tumors develop multiple resistance mechanisms, including local immune evasion, induction of tolerance, and systemic disruption of T cell signaling. Moreover, in a process termed immune editing, immune recognition of malignant cells imposes a selective pressure on developing neoplasms, resulting in the outgrowth of less immunogenic and more apoptosis-resistant neoplastic cells.

Scientists have known for decades that cancer cells are particularly efficient at suppressing the body's natural immune response, which is why most treatments exploit other means, such as surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, to eliminate neoplastic cells. It is now established that various components of the immune system play pivotal roles in protecting humans from cancer. Following numerous disappointing efforts and unequivocal clinical failures, the field of cancer immunotherapy has recently received a significant boost, encouraged primarily by the approval of the autologous cellular immunotherapy, sipuleucel-T, for the treatment of prostate cancer in 2010 and the approval of the anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) antibody, ipilimumab, and of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) antibodies for the treatment of melanoma in 2011 and 2014, respectively. These successes have revitalized the field and brought attention to the opportunities that immunotherapeutic approaches can offer.

### Harnessing the immune system as a therapeutic tool in virus-associated cancers [^113f1gu4]. JAMA Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

There are at least 7 viruses implicated in the pathogenesis of 10% to 15% of all human cancers worldwide. Despite a high prevalence of infection with these viruses, only a minority of infected individuals develop a subsequent malignant tumor, underscoring the important role that host and environmental factors have in cancer development. This article reviews the mechanisms of viral carcinogenesis, with an emphasis on the viral evasion of the host immune system, and discusses how to harness the immune system effectively as a therapeutic tool in select cancers.

Observations

Immune evasion mechanisms of these viral infections have an important role in carcinogenesis. Increased understanding of these mechanisms has paved the way for using immunotherapy to treat virus-associated cancers. This study summarizes the use of adoptive cell therapy, tumor vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and combination immunotherapies in the treatment of select virus-associated cancers.

Conclusions and Relevance

Immunotherapy is proving to be a useful strategy in the treatment of virus-associated cancers. A greater understanding of the processes of immune evasion in chronic infections and malignant tumors will continue to help in the goal of optimizing immunotherapy, which will in turn translate into remission and long-term survival in this patient population.

### The promise of immuno-oncology: implications for defining the value of cancer treatment [^111qHuZ2]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Future strategies for I-O analyses

While the field of I-O has advanced significantly in the past several decades, much more knowledge is needed to achieve a future where the potential benefit of these therapies can be maximized for the greatest number of patients. Key questions remain about how to select those patients who are most likely to respond to I-O therapy, how to combine I-O therapies with one another and with other treatment modalities, how to predict limit and mitigate I-O treatment related toxicities, how to reduce resistance to I-O therapies, how to use these therapies in newly defined standards of care and when to stop treatment.

Answers to these important questions – and addressing the important questions surrounding access to these therapies — will help define and realize a promising vision for the future of cancer treatment, one that maximizes the potential of I-O therapy and further enhances its value to patients, their families, and society.

We envision a time when:
Many more cancer patients will receive some form of I-O therapy during their treatment journey;
We leverage patient reported outcomes, real world evidence and other tools to expand the knowledge base and continuously improve patient outcomes from I-O therapies;
Careful patient selection ensures that treatments are provided only to those patients most likely to benefit;
The numbers and cancer profiles of patients who are likely to benefit has expanded;
Potential resistance to I-O therapy is reduced and we succeed in turning previously non-immunogenic cancers into ones that can respond to I-O therapy;
The benefits are established for I-O therapy in the adjuvant and neo-adjuvant settings, thereby reducing the incidence of late-stage cancers; and
Cancer can become a treatable and even curable set of diseases with combination approaches that include I-O leading to maximized therapeutic equations for every cancer and a resulting favorable economic impact for patients, their families and society.

### Charting roadmaps towards novel and safe synergistic immunotherapy combinations [^111bpg5T]. Nature Cancer (2022). High credibility.

Checkpoint inhibitor-based cancer immunotherapy is often combined in the clinic with other immunotherapy strategies, targeted therapies, chemotherapy or standard-of-care treatments to achieve superior therapeutic efficacy. The large number of immunotherapy combinations that are currently undergoing clinical testing necessitate the establishment of faithful criteria to prioritize optimal combinations with evidence of synergy, to determine their safety and optimal sequence of administration and to identify biomarkers of therapy resistance and response. In this review, we focus on recent developments in immunotherapy combinations and reflect on how combinations should be optimized to maximize the impact of immunotherapy in clinical oncology.

### The surgeon's role in immunotherapy [^115Pg1aZ]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Immunotherapy in the multidisciplinary care of the cancer patient will play an increasingly important role in cancer therapy for solid tumors. Strategies to optimize surgical management for an effective immune response against tumors should be acknowledged and promoted by the surgical community. Immunotherapy can serve as a beneficial adjunct to surgical excision for high-risk and recurrent tumors, with the attraction of decreased toxicity and disability over current adjuvant treatment methods. It is important that surgeons recognize immunotherapy's potential and play an active role in developing immunotherapy treatment regimens, for without surgical involvement many of these therapies may never come to fruition. This article reviews the key roles that surgeons play in immunotherapy treatment and research.

### Role of the immunosuppressive microenvironment in immunotherapy [^1127FePm]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Immunotherapy is reshaping cancer treatment paradigms; however, response rates to immune therapies are low and depend on the host's pre-existing antitumor immunity. The tumor microenvironment is comprised of malignant cells, stroma, and extracellular molecules and can hinder immune control of tumors. Herein, we review how anti-tumor immune responses are formed and how tumors avoid immune destruction. We also outline potential therapeutic targets in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to promote immune control of tumors.

### Role of antigen spread and distinctive characteristics of immunotherapy in cancer treatment [^111HDCZG]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Antigen spread following treatment with immunotherapy can evoke robust, durable, and adaptable immune responses against tumors over an extended time period. Understanding the process of antigen spread, and thus the mode of action of immunotherapies, may help explain the greater improvements in efficacy observed in longer-term clinical study outcomes compared with short-term studies (eg, OS vs PFS). Although immunotherapy has led to major clinical advances in the past several years, we continue to learn more about antigen spread and the mechanism of these treatments. In addition, we are exploring how to fully integrate and optimize their use with our current and emerging armory against cancer. Thus, the coming years promise to accelerate our understanding of how to further optimize patient outcomes.

By boosting the immune system, immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has altered the management of patients with various cancers including those with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As a result of immune system activation, ICIs are associated with unique response patterns (that are not addressed by traditional response criteria) and inflammatory side effects termed immune-related adverse events. In this article, we will review the role of immunotherapy in cancer treatment, specifically ICIs used in NSCLC treatment, radiological response criteria of immunotherapy, and the imaging spectrum of immune-related adverse events.

### Prospects for combining targeted and conventional cancer therapy with immunotherapy [^111Y8m7V]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2017). Medium credibility.

Over the past 25 years, research in cancer therapeutics has largely focused on two distinct lines of enquiry. In one approach, efforts to understand the underlying cell-autonomous, genetic drivers of tumorigenesis have led to the development of clinically important targeted agents that result in profound, but often not durable, tumour responses in genetically defined patient populations. In the second parallel approach, exploration of the mechanisms of protective tumour immunity has provided several therapeutic strategies - most notably the 'immune checkpoint' antibodies that reverse the negative regulators of T cell function - that accomplish durable clinical responses in subsets of patients with various tumour types. The integration of these potentially complementary research fields provides new opportunities to improve cancer treatments. Targeted and immune-based therapies have already transformed the standard-of-care for several malignancies. However, additional insights into the effects of targeted therapies, along with conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy, on the induction of antitumour immunity will help to advance the design of combination strategies that increase the rate of complete and durable clinical response in patients.

### Toward a comprehensive view of cancer immune responsiveness: a synopsis from the SITC workshop [^112ndtXJ]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Tumor immunotherapy has changed the therapeutic landscape for patients with cancer. While several classes of drugs are demonstrating clinical benefit, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy in particular has received considerable attention because these agents improve overall survival and are effective in a wide range of tumor types. Why some patients respond initially to ICI therapy and not other immuno-oncology (IO) regimens is not clearly understood. Indeed, many cancer patients do not benefit from IO treatments even when the tumors display favorable immune characteristics and the reason(s) for their resistance to these approaches remain(s) uncertain. To date, established experimental systems have been flawed in answering this critical question because they cannot adequately replicate the complicated evolutionary processes inherently impacting human cancers in immune competent hosts. While current models are useful for hypothesis generation, they need to be realigned and reinterpreted within the framework of human biology. Thus, a cohesive blueprint is needed to generate definitive information relevant to human cancer. This is why the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) organized a Task Force on Cancer Immune Responsiveness (CIR) to stimulate interactions among multiple disciplines and outline salient open questions and define new priorities for research in tumor immunology and immunotherapy.

### Top 10 challenges in cancer immunotherapy [^114titjo]. Immunity (2020). Medium credibility.

Cancer immunotherapy is a validated and critically important approach for treating patients with cancer. Given the vast research and clinical investigation efforts dedicated to advancing both endogenous and synthetic immunotherapy approaches, there is a need to focus on crucial questions and define roadblocks to the basic understanding and clinical progress. Here, we define ten key challenges facing cancer immunotherapy, which range from lack of confidence in translating pre-clinical findings to identifying optimal combinations of immune-based therapies for any given patient. Addressing these challenges will require the combined efforts of basic researchers and clinicians, and the focusing of resources to accelerate understanding of the complex interactions between cancer and the immune system and the development of improved treatment options for patients with cancer.

### T-cell transfer therapy-immunotherapy-national cancer institute… [^116yqqhM]. NCI (2019). Medium credibility.

How does T-cell transfer therapy work against cancer. T-cell transfer therapy is a type of immunotherapy that makes your own immune cells better able to attack cancer. There are two main types of T-cell transfer therapy: tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes therapy and CAR T-cell therapy. Both involve collecting your own immune cells, growing large numbers of these cells in the lab, and then giving the cells back to you through a needle in your vein. T-cell transfer therapy is also called adoptive cell therapy, adoptive immunotherapy, and immune cell therapy. TIL therapyuses T cells called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes that are found in your tumor. Doctors test these lymphocytes in the lab to find out which ones best recognize your tumor cells. Then, these selected lymphocytes are treated with substances that make them grow to large numbers quickly.
- The idea behind this approach is that the lymphocytes that are in or near the tumor have already shown the ability to recognize your tumor cells. But there may not be enough of them to kill the tumor or to overcome the signals that the tumor is releasing to suppress the immune system. Giving you large numbers of the lymphocytes that react best with the tumor can help to overcome these barriers. What cancers are treated with T-cell transfer therapy. A TIL therapy called lifileucel has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat melanoma. And it has produced promising findings in other cancers, such as cervical squamous cell carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. However, this treatment is still experimental for those cancers. CAR T-cell therapy has also been studied for the treatment of solid tumors, including breast and brain cancers, but use in such cancers is still experimental. What are the side effects of T-cell transfer therapy.

T-cell transfer therapy can cause side effects, which people experience in different ways. The side effects you may have and how serious they are will depend on how healthy you are before treatment, your type of cancer, how advanced it is, the type of T-cell transfer therapy you are receiving, and the dose. Cytokines are immune substances that have many different functions in the body. A sudden increase in their levels can cause:

- fever
- nausea
- headache
- rash
- rapid heartbeat
- low blood pressure
- trouble breathing Most people have a mild form of cytokine release syndrome. But in some people, it may be severe or life-threatening.

Cancer immunotherapy-including immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) and adoptive cell therapy (ACT)-has become a standard, potentially curative treatment for a subset of advanced solid and liquid tumors. However, most patients with cancer do not benefit from the rapidly evolving improvements in the understanding of principal mechanisms determining cancer immune responsiveness (CIR); including patient-specific genetically determined and acquired factors, as well as intrinsic cancer cell biology. Though CIR is multifactorial, fundamental concepts are emerging that should be considered for the design of novel therapeutic strategies and related clinical studies. Recent advancements as well as novel approaches to address the limitations of current treatments are discussed here, with a specific focus on ICI and ACT.

### Immunotherapy… [^115sTA64]. NCI (2015). Low credibility.

How does immunotherapy work against cancer. As part of its normal function, the immune system detects and destroys abnormal cells and most likely prevents or curbs the growth of many cancers. For instance, immune cells are sometimes found in and around tumors. These cells, called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or TILs, are a sign that the immune system is responding to the tumor. People whose tumors contain TILs often do better than people whose tumors don't contain them. Even though the immune system can prevent or slow cancer growth, cancer cells have ways to avoid destruction by the immune system. For example, cancer cells may:

- Have genetic changes that make them less visible to the immune system.
- Have proteins on their surface that turn off immune cells.
- Change the normal cells around the tumor so they interfere with how the immune system responds to the cancer cells. Immunotherapy helps the immune system to better act against cancer. What are the types of immunotherapy.

Several types of immunotherapy are used to treat cancer. These include: Immune checkpoint inhibitors, which are drugs that block immune checkpoints. These checkpoints are a normal part of the immune system and keep immune responses from being too strong. By blocking them, these drugs allow immune cells to respond more strongly to cancer. Learn more about immune checkpoint inhibitors. T-cell transfer therapy, which is a treatment that boosts the natural ability of your T cells to fight cancer. In this treatment, immune cells are taken from your tumor. Those that are most active against your cancer are selected or changed in the lab to better attack your cancer cells, grown in large batches, and put back into your body through a needle in a vein. What is the current research in immunotherapy. Researchers are focusing on several major areas to improve immunotherapy, including: Finding solutions for resistance.

Researchers are testing combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors and other types of immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and radiation therapy to overcome resistance to immunotherapy. Finding ways to predict responses to immunotherapy. Only a small portion of people who receive immunotherapy will respond to the treatment. Finding ways to predict which people will respond to treatment is a major area of research. Learning more about how cancer cells evade or suppress immune responses against them. A better understanding of how cancer cells get around the immune system could lead to the development of new drugs that block those processes.

### Revisiting the role of CD4T cells in cancer immunotherapy-new insights into old paradigms [^113mriGc]. Cancer Gene Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Cancer immunotherapy has revolutionised cancer treatment, with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy and adoptive cell therapy (ACT) increasingly becoming standard of care across a growing number of cancer indications. While the majority of cancer immunotherapies focus on harnessing the anti-tumour CD8 + cytotoxic T cell response, the potential role of CD4 + 'helper' T cells has largely remained in the background. In this review, we give an overview of the multifaceted role of CD4 + T cells in the anti-tumour immune response, with an emphasis on recent evidence that CD4 + T cells play a bigger role than previously thought. We illustrate their direct anti-tumour potency and their role in directing a sustained immune response against tumours. We further highlight the emerging observation that CD4 + T cell responses against tumours tend to be against self-derived epitopes. These recent trends raise vital questions and considerations that will profoundly affect the rational design of immunotherapies to leverage on the full potential of the immune system against cancer.

### Cancer immunotherapy beyond checkpoint blockade: state-of-the-art review [^116Prh7H]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

A fundamental challenge for cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and targeted therapies is that cancers undergo natural selection. Genetic and epigenetic modifications accumulate in cancer subclones during treatment, and those that provide a selective advantage enable tumor growth or recurrence despite continued drug therapy. The power of immune therapy over other forms of treatment therefore rests on several fundamental features of the adaptive immune system: 1) antigen specificity: immune receptors are competitively tuned to produce exquisite specificity for particular antigens; 2) clonal selection: cells that obtain positive signaling via these receptors expand and mature to become more adept at eliminating foreign antigens; and 3) memory: antigen-specific clones persist over the lifetime of the host, serving as a long-term reservoir to control foreign antigens. The combination of specificity, adaptation, and durability offered by immune-based therapies thus combats cancer clonal evolution through natural selection and offers the potential for long-term control without prohibitive off-target toxicities.

A basic principle of cancer immunotherapy is that oncogenesis requires escape from immune surveillance. Because of immune ignorance (de novo absence of mutation-specific immune recognition), tolerance (acquired absence of mutation-specific immune recognition), or suppression (development of counter-regulatory mechanisms that prevent immune recognition), cancers that progress from precancerous lesions toward growth and metastasis are de facto insensitive to normal mechanisms of immunologic pressure against non-self-antigens. This process is known as cancer immunoediting. Successful cancer immunotherapies must overcome cancer immunoediting, either by provoking a de novo antitumor immune response or by reactivating an existing immune response that has become ineffective. In this review we provide an overview of approved and emerging antitumor immune therapies as they fit within these 2 broad mechanisms of action, discussing both cell-based and noncellular therapies, their mechanisms of action, and toxicities (Central Illustration). We emphasize the most recent and clinically advanced approaches apart from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4, which are amply covered in numerous other dedicated reviews.

### The emerging role of epigenetic therapeutics in immuno-oncology [^1134JP5p]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

The past decade has seen the emergence of immunotherapy as a prime approach to cancer treatment, revolutionizing the management of many types of cancer. Despite the promise of immunotherapy, most patients do not have a response or become resistant to treatment. Thus, identifying combinations that potentiate current immunotherapeutic approaches will be crucial. The combination of immune-checkpoint inhibition with epigenetic therapy is one such strategy that is being tested in clinical trials, encompassing a variety of cancer types. Studies have revealed key roles of epigenetic processes in regulating immune cell function and mediating antitumour immunity. These interactions make combined epigenetic therapy and immunotherapy an attractive approach to circumvent the limitations of immunotherapy alone. In this Review, we highlight the basic dynamic mechanisms underlying the synergy between immunotherapy and epigenetic therapies and detail current efforts to translate this knowledge into clinical benefit for patients.

B. Recommendations

Avoid duplication in partner targets in unselected patients, particularly in cancers for which single-agent immunotherapy has no activity.
In the design of a combination, consider whether other monotherapy arms are required when trial designs are conceived.
Consider if randomized arms of monotherapy are ethical; for example, if based on the mechanism of action, no clinical activity of monotherapy is expected.
Consider use of milestone survival or response endpoints to more efficiently generate early evidence.
Consider the incorporation of real-world evidence and novel hybrid designs, including in regulatory decision making.
Consider using (historical) data on single-agent efficacy, ideally to be obtained from multiple datasets and for all agents within the combination.
Consider introducing experimental therapies, including novel–novel combinations, into the trial at any time, allowing for rational combinations based on new biological or clinical insights.
Consider innovative but sound statistical methods, including use of historical or external data sources to support combination approaches.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) consensus definitions for resistance to combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors [^112TF9LY]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Immunotherapy is the standard of care for several cancers and the field continues to advance at a rapid pace, with novel combinations leading to indications in an increasing number of disease settings. Durable responses and long-term survival with immunotherapy have been demonstrated in some patients, though lack of initial benefit and recurrence after extended disease control remain major hurdles for the field. Many new combination regimens are in development for patients whose disease progressed on initial immunotherapy. To guide clinical trial design and support analyses of emerging molecular and cellular data surrounding mechanisms of resistance, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) previously generated consensus clinical definitions for resistance to single-agent anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in three distinct scenarios: primary resistance, secondary resistance, and progression after treatment discontinuation. An unmet need still exists, however, for definitions of resistance to ICI-based combinations, which represent an expanding frontier in the immunotherapy treatment landscape. In 2021, SITC convened a workshop including stakeholders from academia, industry, and government to develop consensus definitions for resistance to ICI-based combination regimens for improved outcome assessment, trial design and drug development. This manuscript reports the minimum drug exposure requirements and time frame for progression that define resistance in both the metastatic setting and the perioperative setting, as well as key caveats and areas for future research with ICI/ICI combinations. Definitions for resistance to ICIs in combination with chemotherapy and targeted therapy will be published in companion volumes to this paper.

### Role of immunotherapy in advanced gastroesophageal cancer [^115FVxcR]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Immunotherapy and tumor microenvironment have been at the forefront of cancer research over the past several decades. Here, we will review the role of immunotherapy in advanced gastroesophageal cancers including targeted antibodies, immunomodulating agents, vaccines, oncolytic virus therapy, and adoptive immunotherapy, and discuss the future direction for immunotherapy in this population.

Recent Findings

Targeted antibodies are already standard-of-care. An anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody is currently FDA approved for second-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic ESCC, as well as beyond second-line treatment of advanced G/GEJ cancers, and recent data suggests it may be considered in first-line treatment of advanced G/GEJ cancers. Combination therapies such as immunotherapy plus chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, vaccines, oncolytic viral therapy, and adoptive immunotherapy in varying combinations are currently under active investigation. Several trials are ongoing and are hoped to reach more efficacious and individualized treatment options in advanced gastroesophageal cancer, where novel treatment options are desperately needed.

### Role of the microbiome and diet for response to cancer checkpoint immunotherapy: a narrative review of clinical trials [^1171AsPX]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The microbiome and its metabolites seem to play a role in the response to cancer checkpoint immunotherapy. Certain bacteria and metabolites can predict treatment response, especially Akkermansia mucinifila, Ruminococcaceae, Faecalibacterium, and Lachnospiraceae; this knowledge may be used to improve outcomes for future patients. The Mediterranean diet is a promising option for enhancing the effect of checkpoint immunotherapy, providing many of the components needed for a diverse microbiome rich in butyrate-producing bacteria. Additionally, the Mediterranean diet is non-restrictive, palatable, affordable, accessible, and patients are often willing to make the changes to their diet, if encouraged by health care professionals.

Factors suspected to decrease the response to therapy should be minimized, except as clinically indicated. This includes co-medications like antibiotics and PPIs before and during initiation of therapy.

Prospective clinical trials in different cancer types, disease stages, and medical treatments, including combination treatments, are needed to determine if diet can be used as part of a treatment regimen and not just as a predictive marker of response, as current studies have shown.

### The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer consensus statement on immunotherapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma [^113M9Lgb]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). High credibility.

Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) consensus on multiple myeloma immunotherapy — outcomes in multiple myeloma (MM) have improved dramatically in the last two decades with the advent of novel therapies including immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs), proteasome inhibitors (PIs) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), yet MM remains largely incurable, with the vast majority of patients experiencing relapse. Multiple myeloma is the second most commonly diagnosed hematological malignancy, with nearly 160 000 new cases worldwide in 2018. In recent years, immunotherapy for the treatment of MM has advanced rapidly, with the approval of new targeted agents and monoclonal antibodies directed against myeloma cell-surface antigens, as well as maturing data from late stage trials of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, and the ability to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) with a high degree of sensitivity using multicolor flow cytometry (MFC) or next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies may further enhance the selection of treatment strategies both at initial diagnosis and relapse. In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved two mAbs for the treatment of MM, daratumumab and elotuzumab, blazing a trail for the development of numerous other immunotherapies in this disease setting, including chimeric-antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs) and cancer vaccines. Immunotherapy is currently playing a pivotal role in MM treatment, necessitating clinical practice guidelines with detailed recommendations, and the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer convened an expert panel which met to consider the current role of approved and emerging immunotherapy agents in MM and provide guidance to the oncology community by developing consensus recommendations, with SITC having previously published the first-ever consensus statement for the use of immunotherapy to treat haematological malignancies in 2016.

### Role of the microbiome and diet for response to cancer checkpoint immunotherapy: a narrative review of clinical trials [^112dd7Xo]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic treatments reduce the effectiveness of immunotherapy in cancer patients, indicating the importance of the microbiome for response to immunotherapy. Many studies have searched for specific bacteria that could predict responses to immunotherapy, and efforts are ongoing to improve the microbiome of cancer patients undergoing such treatments. Some studies explore fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT). Other untargeted methods include exercise, diet, or supplements with prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics. Targeted therapies include bioengineered commensals, targeted antibiotics, phage therapy, or Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR).

This review examines the scientific literature on clinical trials involving cancer patients treated with checkpoint immunotherapy. It will specifically focus on the role of the microbiome and diet in influencing the response.

### Role of the immunosuppressive microenvironment in immunotherapy [^114eUSmo]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical trials combining radiation with immune therapy targeting the TME

Targeting the immunosuppressive TME can promote adaptive immune priming and improve the efficacy of effector cell killing and cytotoxic therapies. Radiation is a logical choice to synergize with immune therapies because it may induce immunogenic cell death intratumorally to prime an adaptive immune response and increase the homing of effector cells into tumors. Clinical success with ICIs has demonstrated the potential for targeting the TME to promote immune control of tumors. Hundreds of active phase 2 and 3 clinical trials are evaluating novel immune therapies and concurrent immune therapy combinations targeting the immunosuppressive TME. A comprehensive listing of active trials is beyond the scope of this review, and readers are directed to serial publications aimed at reviewing such trials for further edification. The results from these trials will guide future studies of novel targeted immune therapies and immune therapy combinations.

Therapeutic inventions

Immune checkpoint inhibitors:New generation of ICI and stimulatory approaches based on the emerging scientific insights summarized above are now in various phases of clinical development and will likely play a pivotal role in combatting resistance mechanisms to current ICI (table 2).

Table 2

Primary versus secondary resistance

As the majority of tumors are resistant to ICIthere has been considerable effort focused on identifying mechanisms of ICI resistance and developing subsequent therapeutic solutions. In 2019, SITC developed definitions for both primary and secondary (or adaptive) resistance to PD-1 pathway blockade to promote semantic consistency in both clinical and research endeavors. The taskforce defined primary resistance as disease progression after at least 6 weeks but no more than 6 months of anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. Secondary resistance was defined as disease progression following an objective or prolonged (> 6 months) response to PD-(L)1 blockade. Primary resistance mechanisms include certain oncogene-driving mutations, both lack of quantity and/or quality of neoantigen presentation, and the metabolically hostile and toxic TME that impedes T-cell function. Secondary resistance can be attributed to the upregulation of coinhibitory signaling, selective loss of antigenic tumor populations via immunoediting, and T-cell exhaustion. However, given the large degree of overlap between primary and secondary resistance mechanisms, further description could be more clearly grouped into tumor intrinsic versus extrinsic factors.

### Advances in the understanding and therapeutic manipulation of cancer immune responsiveness: a Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) review [^114DSFsi]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Cancer immunotherapy — including immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) and adoptive cell therapy (ACT) — has become a standard, potentially curative treatment for a subset of advanced solid and liquid tumors. However, most patients with cancer do not benefit from the rapidly evolving improvements in the understanding of principal mechanisms determining cancer immune responsiveness (CIR); including patient-specific genetically determined and acquired factors, as well as intrinsic cancer cell biology. Though CIR is multifactorial, fundamental concepts are emerging that should be considered for the design of novel therapeutic strategies and related clinical studies. Recent advancements as well as novel approaches to address the limitations of current treatments are discussed here, with a specific focus on ICI and ACT.

Clinical considerations for trial evaluation

The number of clinical trials exploring use of RT with immunotherapy is rapidly increasing. It is evident that RT can expose tumor antigens to the immune system, but the optimal partnering with immunotherapies to maximize this effect remains unclear. As we move forward, there are several questions that remain unanswered, warranting discussion of relevant considerations in appropriate trial design and evaluation.

Future perspectives

What is the potential use of sipuleucel-T in combination with other agents?

The panel discussed the potential of combining sipuleucel-T with other agents. Agents discussed included androgen pathway targeted agents (e.g. bicalutamide, nilutamide, enzalutamide, and abiraterone acetate), zoledronic acid, and denosumab. The majority of the panel (58%) reported having ever combined sipuleucel-T with other agents. However, the panel was in agreement (100%) that they do not routinely use a combination approach with sipuleucel-T. The consensus discussion continued with considering whether sipuleucel-T should be used in combination, and concluded that all of these therapies were reasonable to investigate in combination with sipuleucel-T. In fact, a number of phase I and phase II trials are active or in development (Table 2). This assessment is considered Level B evidence, based on numerous ongoing prospective clinical trials.

The panel also discussed these issues in the context of immunotherapy agents that are in very advanced stages of clinical evaluation. PSA-TRICOM is a therapeutic vaccine associated with a 44% reduction of risk of death in a randomized phase II trial. A subsequent phase III study completed enrollment with 1297 patients in 2015, with overall survival expected to be reported in 2017. Recent reports describe the outcome of two cooperative group clinical trials with combinations of PSA-TRICOM vaccine with docetaxel or with sequential androgen ablation therapy. Immunotherapy trials combining vaccines and checkpoint inhibitors to further activate the immune response are also of interest and ongoing. In addition, the use of other agents to enhance antigen presentation is being explored. Many different combination approaches, with sipuleucel-T and with other immunotherapy agents, are ongoing. Phase III trials of vaccines and immune modulators are ongoing (Table 3). Immune monitoring continues to be a major component of evaluating the effects of immunotherapy.

### What is CAR T-cell therapy? [^115mSMih]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2021). Medium credibility.

The emergence of targeted and precision therapies has increased treatment options for people living with cancer. Of particular note is the development and approval of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies that involve the use of a patient's own immune system to treat cancers that have proven resistant to other approaches. Keeping abreast of treatment changes and practice guidelines is a challenge for all healthcare professionals, and the pressure of doing so becomes most acute with innovations in cancer therapeutics that have the potential to extend or save lives. Though uncommon, step changes like CAR T-cell therapy pose a challenge, often requiring completely new ways of thinking about efficacy evidence, basic science, ethics and service delivery. At a time when patients are able and empowered to readily access information about novel and exploratory treatments, healthcare professionals need to feel informed enough to help patients with life-changing or life-limiting cancers who approach them for advice. This article gives an overview of the basic principles of CAR T-cell therapy including how it is delivered, who is eligible to receive it in the UK, and a brief outline of current evidence of its efficacy and safety. The information is intended to provide healthcare professionals with an introduction to CAR T-cell therapy to help them advise potentially eligible patients or those already undergoing treatment about what to expect.

### Role of clinical pharmacology in the development and approval of immunotherapies targeting immune checkpoints [^114GoMFQ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Immune surveillance plays a critical role in preventing the development and progression of cancer. Immune modulators, such as interferon-gamma or interleukin-2, have been a part of the cancer treatment armament over the past few decades. However, new understandings regarding the role of the costimulatory and coinhibitory molecules associated with T-cells and antigen-presenting cells as well as tumor necrosis factor receptors and ligands have ushered the new era of immunotherapy for cancer treatment. We now know that primary cancer cells evade screening by the innate immune system, proliferate, and form metastases by upregulating immune inhibitory pathways referred to as immune checkpoints. The recent development of therapies that target immune checkpoints, such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4, programmed cell death 1, programmed cell death ligand 1, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3, and lymphocyte activation gene 3 precisely target the immune system and give new hope for treating various types of cancer. In select marker-enriched populations, immunotherapies provide high response rates as well as durable responses in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival. Numerous factors, such as patient's immune system, the expression of targets on both immune and cancer cells, maintenance of an effective drug exposure, and tolerability to these agents may play a role in this unique observation.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitors… [^112fX9rn]. NCI (2019). Medium credibility.

How do immune checkpoint inhibitors work against cancer. Immune checkpoints are a normal part of the immune system. Their role is to prevent an immune response from being so strong that it destroys healthy cells in the body. Immune checkpoints engage when proteins on the surface of immune cells called T cells recognize and bind to partner proteins on other cells, such as some tumor cells. These proteins are called immune checkpoint proteins. When the checkpoint and partner proteins bind together, they send an "off" signal to the T cells. This can prevent the immune system from destroying the cancer. Immunotherapy drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors work by blocking checkpoint proteins from binding with their partner proteins. This prevents the "off" signal from being sent, allowing the T cells to kill cancer cells. One such drug acts against a checkpoint protein called CTLA-4.

Other immune checkpoint inhibitors act against a checkpoint protein called PD-1 or its partner protein PD-L1. Some tumors turn down the T cell response by producing lots of PD-L1. Which cancers are treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are approved to treat some people with a variety of cancer types, including:

- breast cancer
- bladder cancer
- cervical cancer
- colon cancer
- head and neck cancer
- Hodgkin lymphoma
- liver cancer
- lung cancer
- renal cell cancer
- skin cancer, including melanoma
- stomach cancer
- rectal cancer
- any solid tumor that is not able to repair errors in its DNA that occur when the DNA is copied. What side effects are caused by immune checkpoint inhibitors. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can cause side effects that affect people in different ways.

The side effects you may have and how they make you feel will depend on how healthy you are before treatment, your type of cancer, how advanced it is, the type of immune checkpoint inhibitor you are receiving, and the dose. Doctors and nurses cannot know for sure when or if side effects will occur or how serious they will be. So, it is important to know which signs to look for and what to do if they occur. Common side effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors include: Rarer side effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors can include widespread inflammation. Depending on the organ of your body that is affected, inflammation can lead to:

### Novel technologies and emerging biomarkers for personalized cancer immunotherapy [^113ZSFDd]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions and recomendations

As a result of over a century's efforts to understand the role of the immune system in controlling cancer, immunomodulation by checkpoint inhibitors (targeting both CTLA-4 and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis) induced a durable tumor response in a wide range of malignancies. In addition to the FDA approvals of single immune checkpoint blockades for cancer immunotherapy, the FDA has granted accelerated approval to the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab to treat advanced melanoma, the first approval of any immunotherapy combination to treat cancer. These therapies are revolutionizing therapeutic concepts and changing the standard of care for cancer treatment. Immunotherapy is now widely accepted as a key component of the therapeutic strategies to control and potentially cure cancer. Moreover, immunotherapy has the potential to cure or convert cancer from a fatal disease into a non-life threatening or chronic disease. The concept of a "clinical cure" is emerging as a description of long-term tumor control. The broad potential for a clinical cure is now being extensively explored by both mono and combination cancer immunotherapy.

Consensus recommendations

Immunotherapy for non-mCRPC

Is there a role for the use of FDA-approved immunotherapy in patients with prostate cancer with non-metastatic, non-castrate disease?

There was uniformity of opinion that there is no FDA-approved immunotherapy agent for patients with prostate cancer without metastases, whether castration-sensitive or castration-resistant. Similarly, there was uniformity of opinion that the only immunotherapy agent currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of prostate cancer is sipuleucel-T, which is indicated for patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC. Considerable discussion ensued, however, regarding the potential for immunotherapy in an earlier patient disease setting in which immune responsiveness may be greater. It was generally believed that clinical trials of immunotherapy should be pursued in earlier disease states with appropriate immune monitoring.

### Toxicities associated with checkpoint inhibitors-an overview [^112EKc3x]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Immunotherapy has an increasing role in the management of cancer, both in metastatic disease and as an adjuvant therapy. However, sensitization of the immune system with checkpoint inhibitors comes with a unique side effect profile. Full appreciation of this can take some time to emerge as some adverse events are rare, or can be subtle and potentially overlooked. Clinician awareness of these side effects can be particularly important in patients with pre-existing autoimmune conditions. Here we describe common symptoms and diagnostic strategies for organ-specific side effects of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy agents.

### Antigen presentation in cancer-mechanisms and clinical implications for immunotherapy [^116wQzZL]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Over the past decade, the emergence of effective immunotherapies has revolutionized the clinical management of many types of cancers. However, long-term durable tumour control is only achieved in a fraction of patients who receive these therapies. Understanding the mechanisms underlying clinical response and resistance to treatment is therefore essential to expanding the level of clinical benefit obtained from immunotherapies. In this Review, we describe the molecular mechanisms of antigen processing and presentation in tumours and their clinical consequences. We examine how various aspects of the antigen-presentation machinery (APM) shape tumour immunity. In particular, we discuss genomic variants in HLA alleles and other APM components, highlighting their influence on the immunopeptidomes of both malignant cells and immune cells. Understanding the APM, how it is regulated and how it changes in tumour cells is crucial for determining which patients will respond to immunotherapy and why some patients develop resistance. We focus on recently discovered molecular and genomic alterations that drive the clinical outcomes of patients receiving immune-checkpoint inhibitors. An improved understanding of how these variables mediate tumour-immune interactions is expected to guide the more precise administration of immunotherapies and reveal potentially promising directions for the development of new immunotherapeutic approaches.

### Cancer immunotherapy beyond checkpoint blockade: state-of-the-art review [^1168yUmW]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Avoidance of immune destruction is recognized as one of the hallmarks of cancer development. Although first predicted as a potential antitumor treatment modality more than 50 years ago, the widespread clinical use of cancer immunotherapies has only recently become a reality. Cancer immunotherapy works by reactivation of a stalled pre-existing immune response or by eliciting a de novo immune response, and its toolkit comprises antibodies, vaccines, cytokines, and cell-based therapies. The treatment paradigm in some malignancies has completely changed over the past 10 to 15 years. Massive efforts in preclinical development have led to a surge of clinical trials testing innovative therapeutic approaches as monotherapy and, increasingly, in combination. Here we provide an overview of approved and emerging antitumor immune therapies, focusing on the rich landscape of therapeutic approaches beyond those that block the canonical PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 axes and placing them in the context of the latest understanding of tumor immunology.

### Why has immune "checkpoint" therapy failed in most clinical trials? [^1168uQwS]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Therapy-induced resistance

Therapy-induced resistance is conceptually related to evolutionary dominance; however, the selective pressure in this case is artificial, driven by cancer therapies themselves. Before receiving new immune checkpoint therapies, most patients undergo extensive treatment with standard-of-care modalities, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapies. These interventions exert complex and multifaceted effects on the immune system, including direct cytotoxicity to immune and host cells, modulation of immune responses, induction of cellular and molecular adaptations, and the selection of therapy-resistant tumor variants. As a result, the TME becomes highly heterogeneous. Furthermore, with the widespread adoption of anti-PD therapy as a new standard of care, tumors may evolve additional mechanisms of immune evasion. Consequently, both the TME and the host immune system display substantial diversity and heterogeneity. It is likely that, alongside pre-existing resistance mechanisms, new adaptive responses may emerge under continued therapeutic pressure.

Recent advances in single-cell analysis and spatial profiling of tumor tissues have revealed that tumors previously exposed to standard therapies, including anti-PD therapy, exhibit profound genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic heterogeneity. These prior treatments impose additional selective pressures on the TME and exert systemic effects on the immune system, further shaping the course of tumor evolution. In this context, previously subdominant immune checkpoints or novel immune evasion pathways may become functionally significant. These alternative mechanisms can compensate for the disruption of primary immunosuppressive pathways targeted by therapy, allowing tumors to adapt, survive, and ultimately resist new immune checkpoint interventions.

Recognizing the role of therapy-induced resistance is essential for designing effective immunotherapy strategies in the future. It highlights the importance of considering a patient's treatment history and the dynamic, evolving nature of the TME. The sequencing, timing, and combination of therapies should be informed by a deep understanding of how prior interventions reprogram tumor–immune interactions and foster resistance.

### Update on the role of pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer [^113xCi1J]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer type in both men and women in the USA. Most patients with CRC are diagnosed as local or regional disease. However, the survival rate for those diagnosed with metastatic disease remains disappointing, despite multiple treatment options. Cancer therapies for patients with unresectable or metastatic CRC are increasingly being driven by particular biomarkers. The development of various immune checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized cancer therapy over the last decade by harnessing the immune system in the treatment of cancer, and the role of immunotherapy continues to expand and evolve. Pembrolizumab is an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor and has become an essential part of the standard of care in the treatment regimens for multiple cancer types. This paper reviews the increasing evidence supporting and defining the role of pembrolizumab in the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic CRC.

### Is immunotherapy the only treatment some people need? [^114mbyLH]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

The leaders of those trials and other experts stressed that much more research is needed before this treatment approach becomes part of everyday cancer care. But they agreed that the findings so far are highly encouraging. The most recent results come from a 35-patient clinical trial conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Most patients in the trial had locally advanced colorectal cancer. Perhaps most important, however, was that all participants' tumors had specific genetic changes — known as MSI-high or dMMR — that make them particularly good candidates for immunotherapy. About half of the trial participants received the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab for up to 6 months and then chose to have surgery to remove whatever tumor tissue remained after the immunotherapy treatment. More than half of these patients had no evidence of cancer in the tissue removed during surgery, called a pathologic complete response.

Of particular interest to researchers is using immunotherapy before surgery in people with locally advanced cancers, known as neoadjuvant treatment. Neoadjuvant therapy with ICIs is not new. For example, pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a neoadjuvant therapy for some women with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer. And nivolumab combined with chemotherapy is approved as neoadjuvant therapy for early-stage lung cancer. The findings, Dr. Ludford and the team wrote, suggest that a short course of immunotherapy could be a "definitive approach" for people with locally advanced MSI-high or dMMR tumors — that is, it could be their sole treatment. Last year, even more impressive results were reported from a similar but smaller trial conducted at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

That trial included 12 people with rectal cancer whose tumors were MSI-high or dMMR. Patients in the trial received a single dose of the ICI ipilimumab and two doses of the ICI nivolumab over 4 weeks. After completing that treatment, all patients had surgery to remove any remaining tumor. During a presentation of the trial's results at the ESMO meeting, the lead investigator, Myriam Chalabi, M.

### Emerging opportunities and challenges in cancer immunotherapy [^1154AzE5]. Clinical Cancer Research (2016). Low credibility.

Immunotherapy strategies against cancer are emerging as powerful weapons for treatment of this disease. The success of checkpoint inhibitors against metastatic melanoma and adoptive T-cell therapy with chimeric antigen receptor T cells against B-cell-derived leukemias and lymphomas are only two examples of developments that are changing the paradigms of clinical cancer management. These changes are a result of many years of intense research into complex and interrelated cellular and molecular mechanisms controling immune responses. Promising advances come from the discovery of cancer mutation-encoded neoantigens, improvements in vaccine development, progress in delivery of cellular therapies, and impressive achievements in biotechnology. As a result, radical transformation of cancer treatment is taking place in which conventional cancer treatments are being integrated with immunotherapeutic agents. Many clinical trials are in progress testing potential synergistic effects of treatments combining immunotherapy with other therapies. Much remains to be learned about the selection, delivery, and off-target effects of immunotherapy used alone or in combination. The existence of numerous escape mechanisms from the host immune system that human tumors have evolved still is a barrier to success. Efforts to understand the rules of immune cell dysfunction and of cancer-associated local and systemic immune suppression are providing new insights and fuel the enthusiasm for new therapeutic strategies. In the future, it might be possible to tailor immune therapy for each cancer patient. The use of new immune biomarkers and the ability to assess responses to therapy by noninvasive monitoring promise to improve early cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Personalized immunotherapy based on individual genetic, molecular, and immune profiling is a potentially achievable future goal. The current excitement for immunotherapy is justified in view of many existing opportunities for harnessing the immune system to treat cancer.

### Cancer immunotherapy: the beginning of the end of cancer? [^1178siAF]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Cancer therapy has long depended on strategies that directly attack tumor cells to treat patients. Cancer immunotherapy, the treatment that harnesses the patient's immune system to fight cancer, is now emerging as an important addition to conventional therapies. Immune checkpoint blockade therapy, in particular, has undoubtedly been one of the most impressive advancements made in cancer therapeutics in recent years. The impact of this scientific achievement is reflected by the fact that James P. Allison has been recently awarded the 2015 Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award for the discovery and development of an anti-CTLA-4 mAb that releases the brakes of the immune system to combat cancer. Blockade of CTLA-4 with the mAb ipilimumab has already benefited thousands of people with advanced melanoma, a disease that typically used to kill people in less than a year. Most importantly, the clinical success of anti-CTLA-4 created a new field, termed immune checkpoint therapy, and now, not only have additional immune inhibitory checkpoints been released, such as PD1 and its ligand PD-L1, but these are being used in combination with each other or with conventional therapies for the induction of robust and sustained antitumor responses in a wide variety of tumors. While optimal combinations of regimes still need to be determined and extensive efforts must be made in the identification and validation of predictive biomarkers, checkpoint blockade immunotherapy and its combination with other (immune) therapeutic modalities are the leading path to increased therapeutic success across a whole range of tumor types.

### Immunotherapy combination approaches: mechanisms, biomarkers and clinical observations [^1113bCK6]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2024). High credibility.

The approval of the first immune checkpoint inhibitors provided a paradigm shift for the treatment of malignancies across a broad range of indications. Whereas initially, single-agent immune checkpoint inhibition was used, increasing numbers of patients are now treated with combination immune checkpoint blockade, where non-redundant mechanisms of action of the individual agents generally lead to higher response rates. Furthermore, immune checkpoint therapy has been combined with various other therapeutic modalities, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other immunotherapeutics such as vaccines, adoptive cellular therapies, cytokines and others, in an effort to maximize clinical efficacy. Currently, a large number of clinical trials test combination therapies with an immune checkpoint inhibitor as a backbone. However, proceeding without inclusion of broad, if initially exploratory, biomarker investigations may ultimately slow progress, as so far, few combinations have yielded clinical successes based on clinical data alone. Here, we present the rationale for combination therapies and discuss clinical data from clinical trials across the immuno-oncology spectrum. Moreover, we discuss the evolution of biomarker approaches and highlight the potential new directions that comprehensive biomarker studies can yield.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer [^112DAQ4h]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). High credibility.

Breast cancer immunotherapy rationale — introduction: Breast cancer is categorized into "hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive and triple-negative", and although mortality has "decreased by 40% since 1989", prognosis for metastatic disease remains poor, with TNBC having "a median survival of only 12–18 months in the metastatic setting". Breast cancer has been considered an immunologically "cold" tumor with "relatively low levels of T cell infiltration and lower mutation burdens compared to melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and other malignancies", while retrospective clinical-trial tissue analyses show "associations between lymphocytic infiltration into tumors and survival outcomes". Expression of immune checkpoint proteins "programmed cell death protein 1 and its ligand (PD-1 and PD-L1) within the tumor microenvironment supports a role for breast cancer immunoediting", described as "the three-phase process by which anti-cancer immune responses evolve to immune escape and disease progression".

### Peripheral immune-based biomarkers in cancer immunotherapy: can we realize their predictive potential? [^116YH8tL]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

The immunologic landscape of the host and tumor play key roles in determining how patients will benefit from immunotherapy, and a better understanding of these factors could help inform how well a tumor responds to treatment. Recent advances in immunotherapy and in our understanding of the immune system have revolutionized the treatment landscape for many advanced cancers. Notably, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors has demonstrated durable responses in various malignancies. However, the response to such treatments is variable and currently unpredictable, the availability of predictive biomarkers is limited, and a substantial proportion of patients do not respond to immune checkpoint therapy. Identification and investigation of potential biomarkers that may predict sensitivity to immunotherapy is an area of active research. It is envisaged that a deeper understanding of immunity will aid in harnessing the full potential of immunotherapy, and allow appropriate patients to receive the most appropriate treatments. In addition to the identification of new biomarkers, the platforms and assays required to accurately and reproducibly measure biomarkers play a key role in ensuring consistency of measurement both within and between patients. In this review we discuss the current knowledge in the area of peripheral immune-based biomarkers, drawing information from the results of recent clinical studies of a number of different immunotherapy modalities in the treatment of cancer, including checkpoint inhibitors, bispecific antibodies, chimeric antigen receptor T cells, and anti-cancer vaccines. We also discuss the various technologies and approaches used in detecting and measuring circulatory biomarkers and the ongoing need for harmonization.

### Targeted therapy and immunotherapy in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer [^114zAZJb]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The treatment strategy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has evolved from empirical chemotherapy to a personalized approach based on histology and molecular markers of primary tumors. Targeted therapies are directed at the products of oncogenic driver mutations. Immunotherapy facilitates the recognition of cancer as foreign by the host immune system, stimulates the immune system, and alleviates the inhibition that allows the growth and spread of cancer cells. The authors describes the role of targeted therapy and immunotherapy in the treatment of NSCLC, patterns of disease present on imaging studies, and immune-related adverse events encountered with immunotherapy.

### The future of cancer treatment: will it include immunotherapy? [^111tzYFM]. Cancer Cell (2012). Low credibility.

Negative immune regulatory pathways inhibit anti-cancer T cell responses, preventing effective immune surveillance. Two clinical trials using monoclonal antibodies that antagonize the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway recently reported regression in several tumor types. In one of these trials, efficacy was linked to the expression of the PD-L1 biomarker on tumor cells.

Role of immunotherapy post–CAR T cell therapy — persistence of benefit and reasons for failure: CAR T cell therapies have offered significant survival benefits for patients with ALL, and data suggest that responses are durable. In some cases, however, CAR T cell therapy is ineffective due to either lack of the targetable antigen or loss of the target antigen after initial therapy. Therefore, many novel CAR T cell therapies are under investigation to provide secondary options for these patients.

Main

Anti-PD-1 antibodies (pembrolizumab and nivolumab) are licensed to be administered to metastatic melanoma patients until disease progression. Multiple anti-PD(L)-1 antibodies are being licensed to treat various different cancer types, all with prolonged durations of treatment to 2 years or more for responding patients. The question of whether anti-PD(L)-1 therapy needs administering continuously to generate an immune response is taxing the global oncology community. Chronic administration generates a significant burden for patients and healthcare systems, entailing multiple clinic visits and the risk of chronic, life changing and sometimes life-threatening immune-mediated toxicities. The health-economic impact is substantial, which not all healthcare systems can absorb.

The first checkpoint inhibitor to enter the clinic was the anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab. In contrast to anti-PD(L)-1 antibodies, ipilimumab is administered over 12 weeks only, and around 20% of patients will sustain durable remissions in the absence of ongoing infusions. CTLA-4 and PD-1 differ in their T-cell receptor role and function, yet there is no biological evidence justifying continuous therapy with anti-PD(L)-1 antibodies. Indeed, contrary evidence is now accumulating.

Long-term follow-up of metastatic melanoma patients treated in the first prospective trials evaluating anti-PD-1 suggests treatment to progression may not be justified. – In the Keynote-001 pembrolizumab trial, 105 of 655 (17%) recruited patients had a complete response and 67 of 105 stopped pembrolizumab while still in complete response, mostly due to patient choice. The 2-year disease-free survival rate from the time of complete response was 90% for all, whether or not they stopped treatment. In the Keynote-006 trial comparing pembrolizumab with ipilimumab as first line immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the planned treatment with pembrolizumab was 2 years. A total of 104 of 556 (19%) patients completed the planned course. After following the 104 patients for a median of 9 months, their progression-free survival (PFS) was 91%: 95% for complete responders, 91% for partial responders, and 83% for those with stable disease. A total of 17% of patients experienced severe (grade 3/4) toxicity during treatment. Based on these data, many clinicians and patients are electing to stop treatment at 2 years.

Panel recommendations — patients with melanoma who have altered immune systems at baseline should not be automatically excluded from receiving ICI therapy; given that immunotherapy is potentially curative for melanoma, these patients should be referred to an experienced cancer center for consideration of treatment, and shared decision-making between patient, provider, and collaborative care team to initiate ICI therapy is essential when discussing risks versus benefits of ICIs.

### Advances in immunotherapy for colorectal cancer: a review [^116t5pgZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Immunotherapy is a new and exciting modality of cancer treatments. Its role in gastrointestinal malignancies has been promising, especially in advanced disease. Although various therapies are available for treatment of advanced colorectal cancer, survival rates for these patients remain very poor. The application of immunotherapy in colorectal cancer has shown remarkable results for a subset of patients with mismatch-repair-deficient mutations or microsatellite instability in their tumors. This literature review evaluates the current role of immunotherapy in advanced colorectal cancer, potential challenges clinicians face with immunotherapy-based regimens, and the possible future approach of combined modality immunotherapy.

### Acquired resistance to immunotherapy and future challenges [^113gtVM3]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2016). Medium credibility.

Advances in immunotherapy have resulted in remarkable clinical responses in some patients. However, one of the biggest challenges in cancer therapeutics is the development of resistant disease and disease progression on or after therapy. Given that many patients have now received various types of immunotherapy, we asked three scientists to give their views on the current evidence for whether acquired resistance to immunotherapy exists in patients and the future challenges posed by immunotherapy.

### Innate myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment [^115smSvy]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Cancer immunotherapies are receiving increasing approval in the clinic, but still only a fraction of patients benefit long-term. Understanding the most important mechanisms of immunotherapeutic resistance is critical for broader utility and benefit of cancer immunotherapy. While the tumor microenvironment (TME) is made up of many cell types, immunosuppressive monocytes/macrophages, granulocytes and myeloid derived suppressor cells interact with, and play a critical role in regulating the anti-tumor lymphocyte effector cells that mediate effective immunotherapies. Herein, we discuss the latest research that has identified and compared the importance of pro-tumor and immunosuppressive mechanisms that tumor infiltrating myeloid cells employ. Exploiting this new information may help to develop totally novel therapies to boost contemporary cancer immunotherapy.

### The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer consensus statement on immunotherapy for the treatment of prostate carcinoma [^1125zSCj]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction — prostate cancer epidemiology and therapies: In the United States, approximately 180,890 new cases were estimated for 2016, accounting for 21% of newly diagnosed cancer in men, with approximately 27,540 deaths in 2015. Five-year survival is approaching 100% for newly diagnosed localized (stage I and II) or regional (stage III) disease, but approximately one-third of early stage patients develop recurrence, and for metastatic (stage IV) disease 5-year survival decreases to 28%. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the mainstay of initial therapy for metastatic disease; however, resistance develops in nearly all men leading to mCRPC, and in the past 6 years therapies approved for mCRPC include enzalutamide, abiraterone acetate, cabazitaxel, radium-223, and sipuleucel-T.

### A guide to cancer immunotherapy: from T cell basic science to clinical practice [^1163pbVj]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2020). High credibility.

The T lymphocyte, especially its capacity for antigen-directed cytotoxicity, has become a central focus for engaging the immune system in the fight against cancer. Basic science discoveries elucidating the molecular and cellular biology of the T cell have led to new strategies in this fight, including checkpoint blockade, adoptive cellular therapy and cancer vaccinology. This area of immunological research has been highly active for the past 50 years and is now enjoying unprecedented bench-to-bedside clinical success. Here, we provide a comprehensive historical and biological perspective regarding the advent and clinical implementation of cancer immunotherapeutics, with an emphasis on the fundamental importance of T lymphocyte regulation. We highlight clinical trials that demonstrate therapeutic efficacy and toxicities associated with each class of drug. Finally, we summarize emerging therapies and emphasize the yet to be elucidated questions and future promise within the field of cancer immunotherapy.

### Current landscape and future of dual anti-CTLA4 and PD-1 / PD-L1 blockade immunotherapy in cancer; lessons learned from clinical trials with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [^11476qs9]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

In this review, we describe the rationale for combined immunotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 plus CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitors. Building on what we have learned through studies of combination checkpoint inhibition in patients with melanoma and NSCLC, we shall also critically assess the current landscape and future prospects for the development of an ideal combination checkpoint inhibition regimen.

Role of PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 in modulation of anti-tumor T-cell activity

The process of T cell activation requires two signals. The primary signal comes from the binding of the T cell receptor (TCR) to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule presented by an antigen presenting cell (APC). The costimulatory signal may arise from one of several distinct T cell-APC interactions. One such pathway is the engagement of CD28 on T cells with CD80 (B7–1) or CD86 (B7–2) on APCs (Fig. 1). T-cell activity can be modulated by regulating the generation of costimulatory signals through various mechanisms.

Fig. 1
Mechanism of CTLA 4 and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition. The activation of T cells is mediated by the interaction of T cell receptor and the CD28 receptor with class II major histocompatibility complex and B7 co-stimulatory molecule located on the antigen presenting cells. The interaction of CTLA-4 with the B7 molecule delivers an inhibitory signal, effectively checked by CTLA-4 inhibitors. On the other hand, the negative regulation of T cells resulting from PD-1/PD-L1 interaction between T cells and tumor cells is prevented by PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Abbreviations: APC, antigen presenting cell; PD-1, programmed death receptor-1; PD-L1, programmed cell death receptor ligand-1; TCR, T cell receptor; MHC I, major histocompatibility complex class I; MHC II, major histocompatibility complex class II

### Immunotherapy for recurrent ovarian cancer: a further piece of the puzzle or a striking strategy? [^113SZ8LX]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Treatment of ovarian cancer has been long standardized with the inclusion of surgery and chemotherapy based on platinum and taxanes, this strategy reaching high remission rates. However, when this treatment fails, further options are available with little benefit. Since ovarian cancer has specific immunologic features, actually immunotherapy is under evaluation to overcome treatment failure in patients experiencing recurrence.

Areas Covered

Immunogenicity of ovarian cancer and its relationship with clinical outcomes is briefly reviewed. The kinds of immunotherapeutic strategies are summarized. The clinical trials investigating immunotherapy in recurrent ovarian cancer patients are reported.

Expert Opinion

The results of these clinical trials about immunotherapy are interesting, but little clinical benefit has been achieved until now. For this reason, we could conclude that immunotherapy is quite different from other treatment options and it could change the global approach for recurrent ovarian cancer treatment. However, to date only fragmentary findings are available to define the real role of immunotherapy in this setting.

### The next age of immunotherapy: optimisation, stratification and therapeutic synergies [^1179KGco]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Main

Ten to fifteen years ago, clinical tumour immunology was mainly regarded as an esoteric scientific playground for enthusiasts. Clinical developments in the ensuing years have progressed so dramatically that immunological therapies have become the standard of care for many advanced types of cancer. This change from an area driven by fundamental research into a translational arena with a plethora of new therapies, side effects, and needs for novel biomarkers is truly a transformative one for the field of oncology. Despite these developments, clinical translation is often limited by our understanding of the tight network and regulation of immune responses in all parts of the human body. Our knowledge of the key pathways and counter-mechanisms involved in immune responses needs to be improved to harness the full potential of immunotherapy. The question is no longer 'Can the immune system be used as a potential tool in the fight against cancer?' but, instead, 'What are the key regulators required to achieve prolonged success with immunotherapies for specific cancers?'. This special issue on immunotherapy aims to address these fundamental questions, with articles providing valuable insight into immunotherapy design, stratification and toxicity management.
