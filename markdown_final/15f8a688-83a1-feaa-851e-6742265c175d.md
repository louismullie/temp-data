## Question

Conservative treatment for rectal prolapse

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about conservative treatment for rectal prolapse. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining rectal prolapse and clarifying the scope of "conservative" care. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about whether conservative therapy can correct prolapse versus palliate symptoms. Next, I will examine specific conservative modalities and their evidence base. After that, I need to distinguish adult from pediatric contexts and emergency from elective scenarios. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and highlight limitations and follow-up needs, making sure I anchor each point to appropriate sources.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and scope. Rectal prolapse is a full-thickness intussusception of the rectum through the anus, with high rates of fecal incontinence and constipation, and it is primarily managed surgically in adults, though symptoms can be palliated nonoperatively while the anatomic defect persists [^8660d988] [^c4e74a3d].

> Wait, let me verify the core principle before listing treatments. The ASCRS guideline explicitly states that rectal prolapse cannot be corrected nonoperatively, so conservative management is for symptom relief, not cure; this is a weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, but it is consistent across guideline statements and reviews [^38d909ef] [^3bd54639] [^0e1e6399].

> I will now examine specific conservative strategies and their evidence. For constipation, fiber and stool softeners are reasonable to mitigate straining; for fecal incontinence, pelvic floor muscle training with or without biofeedback can modestly improve symptoms; for incarcerated prolapse, gentle manual reduction with sugar to reduce edema is a temporizing measure; and meticulous skin care prevents maceration and irritation; none of these correct the prolapse itself, but they can improve quality of life while definitive care is planned [^38d909ef] [^734c2d6b] [^ea0392d4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about emergencies. In incarcerated or irreducible prolapse without ischemia, guidelines support attempting conservative reduction with sedation and sugar to facilitate manual reduction, but this is a bridge to definitive surgery rather than definitive therapy; if there is ischemia, perforation, or hemodynamic instability, immediate operative management is indicated and should not be delayed for conservative attempts [^44218a1c] [^b9a2bd3c] [^a52071e1].

> Let me consider the pediatric context separately, because I need to ensure I don't conflate adult and child pathways. In children, rectal prolapse is often self-limited and responds to conservative management with stool softeners and observation; adjuncts like sclerotherapy or, in small series, faradic stimulation have been reported, but high-quality evidence is limited and these are not standard adult strategies; surgery is reserved for persistent cases after a trial of conservative care [^3bc0b444] [^99a63f05] [^7ca0267b].

> Next, I should review the consequences of relying on conservative therapy long term. Allowing untreated prolapse beyond approximately four years is associated with irreversible fecal incontinence and may increase recurrence risk after eventual repair, reinforcing that conservative care should be framed as palliative and time-limited while arranging definitive surgical correction when feasible [^d9a907a5].

> I need to ensure the practical plan is explicit. For stable adults with symptomatic full-thickness prolapse, conservative measures can be used to control symptoms, but patients should be counseled that surgery is the only durable correction; for high-risk patients who are not surgical candidates, conservative therapy and occasional use of barrier or supportive devices may be reasonable temporizing strategies, acknowledging limited evidence and the need for close follow-up [^38d909ef] [^9a6632b9].

> But wait, what if the presentation is an emergency? I should double-check that I'm not overextending conservative therapy. In irreducible or strangulated prolapse without ischemia, attempt gentle reduction with sugar and sedation; in the presence of ischemia, gangrene, perforation, or instability, proceed to urgent surgery rather than delaying for conservative measures; empiric antibiotics are reasonable when strangulation is suspected due to bacterial translocation risk [^44218a1c] [^b986519d] [^4c970b7b].

> Let me reconsider the overall evidentiary strength so I don't overstate benefits. The recommendation that prolapse cannot be corrected nonoperatively is weak and based on low-quality evidence, yet it aligns with pathophysiology and is consistent across contemporary guidelines; conservative therapies for incontinence and constipation have modest, variable benefit and should be individualized, with shared decision-making about goals and timelines [^38d909ef] [^734c2d6b].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Conservative treatment for rectal prolapse is symptomatic and palliative; it can mitigate constipation, incontinence, and skin complications, and it can facilitate reduction in incarcerated cases, but it does not correct the anatomic defect; definitive management is surgical, and prolonged reliance on conservative therapy risks irreversible functional decline, so conservative care should be coordinated with timely surgical planning whenever feasible [^38d909ef] [^d9a907a5] [^c4e74a3d].

---

Conservative management of rectal prolapse focuses on **symptom control** and **reduction of recurrence** because it does not correct the underlying anatomic defect [^38d909ef]. The mainstays are **manual reduction** with sugar or glycerin to reduce edema, stool softeners and fiber to limit straining, and pelvic floor exercises with biofeedback to improve sphincter function [^38d909ef] [^734c2d6b]. Conservative therapy is appropriate for **high-risk or elderly patients**, those declining surgery, or as a bridge to definitive repair; it is not curative and carries risks of progression, incontinence, and recurrence, so patients require close follow-up and counseling on when to escalate care [^d9a907a5] [^0e1e6399].

---

## Indications for conservative management

Conservative management is **not curative** but may be appropriate in specific scenarios:

- **High-risk patients**: Elderly or comorbid patients with significant surgical risk [^6563e92e].
- **Patient preference**: Patients declining surgery or opting for symptom control [^0e1e6399].
- **Bridge to surgery**: Temporizing measure while optimizing for definitive repair [^b9a2bd3c].
- **Pediatric patients**: Many cases resolve spontaneously; conservative care is first-line [^3bc0b444].

---

## Conservative management strategies

| **Intervention** | **Description** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Manual reduction | Gentle reduction with sugar or glycerin to reduce edema; Trendelenburg position; sedation if needed [^38d909ef] [^44218a1c] | High |
| Stool softeners and fiber | Limit straining and constipation; reduce recurrence risk [^38d909ef] | Moderate |
| Pelvic floor exercises and biofeedback | Improve sphincter tone and continence; reduce incontinence episodes [^734c2d6b] | Moderate |
| Skin care | Meticulous hygiene, barrier creams, moisture control to prevent maceration and excoriation [^38d909ef] | Low |
| Patient education | Teach recognition of recurrence, when to seek care, and home reduction techniques [^notfound] | Low |

---

## Effectiveness and limitations

Conservative management can **improve symptoms** — such as incontinence, pain, and constipation — but does not correct the prolapse [^38d909ef]. Long-term risks include **persistent symptoms**, **progression of prolapse**, and **irreversible incontinence** if definitive surgery is delayed beyond ~4 years [^d9a907a5]. Recurrence is common without surgical fixation, and conservative care should be framed as palliative or a bridge to surgery [^0e1e6399].

---

## Patient selection criteria

Conservative management is best suited to:

- **High surgical risk**: Elderly, frail, or significant comorbidities [^6563e92e].
- **Mild symptoms**: Minimal prolapse, manageable incontinence, or constipation [^notfound].
- **Patient preference**: Declining surgery or prioritizing symptom control [^0e1e6399].
- **Pediatric patients**: Most cases resolve with conservative care [^3bc0b444].

---

## Potential complications and risks

Conservative care carries risks that must be discussed:

- **Progression**: Worsening prolapse and irreversible incontinence [^d9a907a5].
- **Recurrence**: High recurrence without surgical fixation [^notfound].
- **Complications**: Incarceration, strangulation, ulceration, and bleeding [^b9a2bd3c].
- **Quality of life**: Persistent symptoms and psychosocial burden [^142cbc1f].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to detect progression and reassess candidacy for surgery. Visits should include **symptom assessment** for prolapse, incontinence, and constipation; **physical examination** to document prolapse severity and complications; and **patient education** on warning signs and when to seek urgent care [^c955657d].

---

## Comparison with surgical management

Surgery is the **only definitive treatment** for rectal prolapse, with lower recurrence and better functional outcomes than conservative care [^32e200e4]. Conservative management is appropriate when surgery is contraindicated or declined, but patients should be counseled that it is not curative and may lead to progression if prolonged [^38d909ef] [^d9a907a5].

---

Conservative management of rectal prolapse centers on **symptom control** and **recurrence reduction** through manual reduction, bowel regimen optimization, and pelvic floor rehabilitation. It is best for high-risk or declining patients, or as a bridge to surgery, with explicit counseling on limitations and the need for ongoing monitoring.

Rectal prolapse — timing of surgery and consequences of delay: In the long term, patients with rectal prolapse who do not undergo surgery and are only managed medically will develop irreversible fecal incontinence, and allowing prolapse to continue untreated beyond 4 years may lead to higher rates of subsequent rectal prolapse recurrence, presumably secondary to a secondarily weakened pelvic floor.

### Comparison of efficacy and safety between surgical and conservative treatments for hemorrhoids: a meta-analysis [^e585013d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hemorrhoids is one of the most prevalent anorectal conditions globally, significantly affecting the quality of life of millions of patients due to symptoms such as pain, bleeding, and prolapse. the prevalence of hemorrhoids varies significantly, with factors such as obesity, abdominal obesity, depression, and prior pregnancy identified as significant risk factors These physical symptoms can lead to discomfort during daily activities and reduced quality of life, emphasizing the importance of effective management strategies.

Management strategies for hemorrhoidal disease primarily include surgical and conservative treatments. Surgical interventions, such as hemorrhoidectomy, are highly effective for alleviating severe symptoms in the short term. Hemorrhoidectomy remains the gold standard for advanced disease due to its definitive symptom relief; however, it is associated with considerable postoperative pain, urinary retention, and complications such as anal stenosis. On the other hand, conservative management encompasses pharmacological interventions, dietary modifications, and completely non-invasive therapies, offering a less invasive alternative for mild to moderate cases. Dietary and lifestyle modifications, including increased fiber intake, are often the first therapeutic steps for improving symptoms such as bleeding and prolapse. Although some reviews and meta-analyses have classified office-based procedures like rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, and infrared coagulation as part of conservative management, the 2024 guidelines from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons exclude these modalities from the definition of conservative treatment. Consequently, our study did not included the office-based procedures to ensure a clearer evaluation of conservative management options.

Despite the widespread use of these surgical and conservative interventions, there remains a lack of comprehensive, comparative evidence synthesizing their relative efficacy and safety. This study aims to address these gaps by conducting a rigorous meta-analysis to evaluate and compare the outcomes of surgical versus conservative treatments for hemorrhoids. By systematically analyzing data on key outcomes such as symptom relief, recurrence rates, and complication occurence, this research would provide evidence-based insights to guide clinical decision-making and optimize individualized treatment strategies.

### Rectal prolapse [^ef396507]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Optimal management of rectal prolapse requires multiple clinical considerations with respect to treatment options, particularly for surgeons who must counsel and give realistic expectations to rectal prolapse patients. Rectal prolapse outcomes are good with respect to recurrence. Although posterior rectopexy remains most popular in the United States, increasingly surgeons perform ventral rectopexy to repair rectal prolapse. Functional outcomes vary and are fair after rectal prolapse repair. Although incarceration with rectal prolapse is rare, it is potentially life threatening and requires immediate and effective measures to adequately address in the acute setting.

### Evaluation and management of rectal prolapse [^c4e74a3d]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Rectal prolapse, or procidentia, is a common pathology for the practicing colorectal surgeon. It is associated with lifestyle limiting symptoms for the patient and frequently co-exists with other types of pelvic prolapse making multidisciplinary management key. It is primarily managed with surgical reconstruction. A number of operative approaches exist, and the optimum procedure is varied dependent upon patient characteristics.

### Surgical interventions and the use of device-aided therapy for the treatment of fecal incontinence and defecatory disorders [^6563e92e]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Surgery for rectal prolapse — management guidance states that asymptomatic grades 1 to 2 rectal prolapse do not require surgery and should be managed conservatively and/or with biofeedback, whereas symptomatic grades 3 to 4 prolapse require surgery via abdominal (resection, rectopexy, or both) or perineal approaches. A Cochrane review including 12 randomized trials with 380 patients concluded insufficient data to favor abdominal vs perineal approaches; division of lateral ligaments reduced recurrence but increased postoperative constipation; laparoscopic rectopexy had fewer postoperative complications and shorter hospital stay than open rectopexy; and bowel resection during rectopexy lowered constipation rates but should be avoided in patients with pre-existing diarrhea and/or incontinence. In practice, perineal approaches are used more often with lower perioperative morbidity but higher recurrence, and elderly or high-risk patients are often best suited to a perineal proctosigmoidectomy (Altemeier procedure), potentially combined with transperineal levatoroplasty to reduce recurrence risk.

### An update of a former FIGO working group report on management of posterior compartment prolapse [^8fec0b5f]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The FIGO Working Group (FWG) in Pelvic Floor Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery (2012–2015) established a consensus among international opinion leaders in evaluating current evidence and providing practice recommendations.

Objectives

To provide an update of the previous clinical opinion report on conservative and surgical treatment of posterior compartment prolapse.

Search Strategy

Search of evidence was performed using Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases up to August 2018.

Selection Criteria

Controlled trials on posterior colporrhaphy, site-specific defect, transanal, abdominal, laparoscopic, and mesh repair.

Data Collection and Analysis

Collective consensus on surgical outcomes was based on a decision-making process during meetings and multiple group consultations.

Main Results

Basic evaluation and conservative treatment precede surgical management. Surgical techniques are performed by vaginal, transperineal, transanal, abdominal, or laparoscopic approach. The transvaginal surgical route without mesh appears superior to the transanal route. No conclusions can be drawn based on clinical studies or randomized controlled trials of posterior colporrhaphy and laparoscopic rectopexy.

Conclusions

Management of rectocele should include patients' history, quality of life questionnaires, and, in case of complex anorectal symptoms, imaging and functional studies. Evidence on the best type of posterior vaginal wall repair is still scarce. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the best approach to achieve safe, effective, and long-term anatomical and functional outcomes.

### Surgery for faecal incontinence in adults [^0b0172e4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Faecal incontinence is a debilitating problem with significant medical, social and economic implications. Treatment options include conservative, non-operative interventions (for example pelvic floor muscle training, biofeedback, drugs) and surgical procedures. A surgical procedure may be aimed at correcting an obvious mechanical defect, or augmenting a functionally deficient but structurally intact sphincter complex.

Objectives

To assess the effects of surgical techniques for the treatment of faecal incontinence in adults who do not have rectal prolapse. Our aim was firstly to compare surgical management with non-surgical management and secondly, to compare the various surgical techniques.

Search Methods

Electronic searches of the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register (searched 6 March 2013), the Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group Specialised Register (searched 6 March 2013), CENTRAL (2013, issue 1) and EMBASE (1 January 1998 to 6 March 2013) were undertaken. The British Journal of Surgery (1 January 1995 to 6 March 2013), Colorectal Diseases (1 January 2000 to 6 March 2013) and the Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (1 January 1995 to 6 March 2013) were specifically handsearched. The proceedings of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland annual meetings held from 1999 to 2012 were perused. Reference lists of all relevant articles were searched for further trials.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised trials of surgery in the management of adult faecal incontinence (other than surgery for rectal prolapse).

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently selected studies from the literature, assessed the methodological quality of eligible trials and extracted data. The three primary outcome measures were change or deterioration in incontinence, failure to achieve full continence, and the presence of faecal urgency.

Main Results

Nine trials were included with a total sample size of 264 participants. Two trials included a group managed non-surgically. One trial compared levatorplasty with anal plug electrostimulation and one compared an artificial bowel sphincter with best supportive care. The artificial bowel sphincter resulted in significant improvements in at least one primary outcome but the numbers were small. The other trial showed no difference in the primary outcome measures. Seven trials compared different surgical interventions. These included anterior levatorplasty versus postanal repair, anterior levatorplasty versus total pelvic floor repair, total pelvic floor versus postanal repair, end to end versus overlap sphincter repair, overlap repair with or without a defunctioning stoma or with or without biofeedback, and total pelvic floor repair versus repair plus internal sphincter plication and neosphincter formation versus total pelvic floor repair. Sacral nerve stimulation and injectables are considered in separate Cochrane reviews. Only one comparison had more than one trial (total pelvic floor versus postanal repair, 44 participants) and no trial showed any difference in primary outcome measures.

Authors' Conclusions

The review is striking for the lack of high quality randomised controlled trials on faecal incontinence surgery that have been carried out in the last 10 years. Those trials that have been carried out have focused on sacral neuromodulation and injectable bulking agents, both reported in separate reviews. The continued small number of relevant trials identified together with their small sample sizes and other methodological weaknesses limit the usefulness of this review for guiding practice. It was impossible to identify or refute clinically important differences between the alternative surgical procedures. Larger rigorous trials are still needed. However, it should be recognised that the optimal treatment regime may be a complex combination of various surgical and non-surgical therapies.

### Surgery for faecal incontinence in adults [^460eb755]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Faecal incontinence is a debilitating problem with significant medical, social and economic implications. Treatment options include conservative, non-surgical interventions (e.g. pelvic floor muscle training, biofeedback, drugs, sacral nerve stimulation) and surgical procedures. A surgical procedure may be aimed at correcting an obvious mechanical defect, or augmenting a functionally deficient but structurally intact sphincter complex or replace an absent/non-functioning sphincter.

Objectives

To assess the effects of surgical techniques for the treatment of faecal incontinence in adults who do not have rectal prolapse. Our aim was firstly to compare surgical management with non-surgical management and secondly, to compare the various surgical techniques.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (31 January 2006), the Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group trials register (31 January 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2006, Issue 1), PubMed (1 January 1950 to 31 January 2006) and EMBASE (1 January 1998 to 31 January 2006) were undertaken. The British Journal of Surgery (January 1995 to May 2006) Colorectal Diseases (January 2000-May 2006) and the Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (January 1995 to May 2006) were specifically handsearched. The proceedings of the Association of Coloproctology meeting held from 1999 to 2006 were perused. Reference lists of all relevant articles were searched for further trials.

One trial compared levatorplasty with anal plug stimulation, one compared artificial bowel sphincter with best supportive care; numbers were small in both trials. The artificial bowel sphincter insertion was followed by significant improvements in at least one primary outcome but with high rates of significant morbidity. Seven studies compared different surgical interventions. These included anterior levatorplasty versus postanal repair, anterior levatorplasty versus total pelvic floor repair, total pelvic floor versus postanal repair, end to end versus overlap sphincter repair, overlap repair with or without a defunctioning stoma or with or without biofeedback, total pelvic floor repair versus repair plus internal sphincter plication and neosphincter formation versus total pelvic floor repair. Only one comparison had more that one trial (total pelvic floor versus postanal repair-44 participants) and no comparison showed any statistically significant difference in primary outcome measures, with wide confidence intervals.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite more studies being included in this update, the continued small number of relevant trials identified together with their small sample sizes and other methodological weaknesses continue to limit the usefulness of this review for guiding practice. It was impossible to identify or refute clinically important differences between the alternative surgical procedures. Larger rigorous trials are still needed.

### Rectal prolapse [^495c49b6]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2026). Medium credibility.

Rectal prolapse is a complex, multifactorial condition with significant functional and psychosocial impact. This review outlines current understanding of its pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and evidence-based management. Emphasis is placed on a patient-centered approach that incorporates anatomic and functional factors, as well as multidisciplinary correction of coexisting pelvic organ prolapse. Both perineal and abdominal surgical approaches offer effective treatment. Recent data support individualized operative planning based on patient characteristics, surgical risk, and surgeon expertise. Minimally invasive techniques, including laparoscopic and robotic approaches, provide favorable outcomes in appropriately selected patients and should be employed when feasible.

### Evaluation and surgical treatment of rectal prolapse: an international survey [^89fbc530]. Colorectal Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

Validated guidelines for the surgical and non-surgical treatment of rectal prolapse (RP) do not exist. The aim of this international questionnaire survey was to provide an overview of the evaluation, follow-up and treatment of patients with an internal or external RP.

Method

A 36-question questionnaire in English about the evaluation, treatment and follow-up of patients with RP was distributed amongst surgeons attending the congresses of the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery and the European Society of Coloproctology in 2010. It was subsequently sent to all the members of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons and the European Society of Coloproctology by e-mail.

Results

In all, 391 surgeons in 50 different countries completed the questionnaire. Evaluation, surgical treatment and follow-up of patients with RP differed considerably. For healthy patients with an external RP, laparoscopic ventral rectopexy was the most popular treatment in Europe, whereas laparoscopic resection rectopexy was favoured in North America. There was consensus only on frail and/or elderly patients with an external prolapse, with a preference for a perineal technique. After failure of conservative therapy, internal RP was mostly treated by laparoscopic resection rectopexy in North America. In Europe, laparoscopic ventral rectopexy and stapled transanal rectal resection were the most popular techniques for these patients.

Conclusion

The treatment of RP differs between surgeons, countries and regions. Guidelines are lacking. Prospective comparative studies are warranted that may result in universally accepted protocols.

### Management of rectal prolapse in children [^3bc0b444]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Rectal prolapse in children is not uncommon and usually is a self-limiting condition in infancy. Most cases respond to conservative management; however, surgery is occasionally required in cases that are intractable to conservative treatment. This study was designed to analyze the outcomes of rectal prolapse in children and to propose a pathway for the management of these cases in children.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of all cases of rectal prolapse referred to our surgical unit during a period of five years was performed. End point was recurrence of prolapse requiring manual reduction under sedation or an anesthetic. Results are presented as median (range) and statistical analysis was performed using chi-squared test; P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results

A total of 49 children (25 males) presented with symptoms of rectal prolapse at a median age of 2.6 years (range, 4 months -10.6 years). All children received an initial period of conservative treatment with watchful expectancy and/or laxatives. Twenty-five patients were managed conservatively without any additional procedures (Group A), and 24 patients had one or more interventions, such as injection sclerotherapy, Thiersch procedure, anal stretch, banding of prolapse, and rectopexy (Group B). Management of rectal prolapse was successful with no recurrences in 24 patients (96 percent) in Group A vs. 15 patients (63 percent) in Group B at a median follow-up period of 14 (range, 2–96) months. An underlying condition was found in 84 percent of patients in Group A vs. 54 percent in Group B (P = 0.024). The age at presentation was younger than four years in 88 percent of patients in Group A vs. 58 percent in Group B (P = 0.019).

Conclusions

Rectal prolapse in children does respond to conservative management. A decision to operate is based on age of patient, duration of conservative management, and frequency of recurrent prolapse (> 2 episodes requiring manual reduction) along with symptoms of pain, rectal bleeding, and perianal excoriation because of recurrent prolapse. Those cases presenting younger than four years of age and with an associated condition have a better prognosis. The authors propose an algorithm for the management of rectal prolapse in children.

The findings of the CT scan can guide the choice between NOM and surgery and of the best surgical approach (perineal vs. abdominal), thus reducing the risk of leaving a possible complication undetected and untreated. On the other hand, CT scan may not be promptly available in every facility, and a timely management of strangulated rectal prolapse is of utmost importance. For these reasons, the decision whether to perform a CT scan should be made based on patient clinical condition and on the available resources and should not delay the appropriate management of complicated rectal prolapse.

5.C - in patients with complicated rectal prolapse, what which is the role of non-operative management?

In patients with incarcerated rectal prolapse without signs of ischemia or perforation, we suggest to attempt conservative measures and gentle manual reduction under mild sedation or anesthesia (weak recommendation based on moderate quality evidence, 2B).

In hemodynamically unstable patients with complicated rectal prolapse, we suggest against delaying surgical management to attempt a conservative management (weak recommendation based on low quality evidence, 2C).

Non-operative management (NOM) in incarcerated RP aims the following:
­ Reduce the edema;
­ Allow manual reduction;
­ Plan an elective definitive surgery in optimal patient's conditions.

For irreducible RP without signs of ischemia, gentle manipulation and reduction with patient in Trendelenburg position and under intravenous sedation and analgesia is an attempt of deferring surgery to an elective setting. Every effort should be made to manually reduce an incarcerated RP in order to avoid complications such as strangulation, ulceration, bleeding, and perforation. NOM is not indicated in case of strangulated RP with signs of gangrene or perforation and in a hemodynamically unstable patient.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of rectal prolapse [^8660d988]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2017). Medium credibility.

Rectal prolapse — epidemiology, symptoms, and surgical goals are summarized as follows: Rectal prolapse is a disorder characterized by a full-thickness intussusception of the rectal wall that protrudes externally through the anus. It is rare and estimated to occur in ≈0.5% of the general population overall, with frequency higher in females and the elderly. Although commonly thought to result from multiparity, approximately one third of female patients are nulliparous. The peak age of incidence is the seventh decade in women, whereas in men the age of incidence is generally ≤ 40 years. Approximately 50% to 75% of patients with rectal prolapse report fecal incontinence, and 25% to 50% report constipation; up to one half of patients with prolapse demonstrate pudendal neuropathy. The goals of surgery to correct rectal prolapse are 3-fold: to eliminate the prolapse through either resection or restoration of normal anatomy, to correct associated functional abnormalities of constipation or incontinence, and to avoid the creation of de novo bowel dysfunction.

Evaluation of rectal prolapse — initial assessment "should include a complete history and physical examination with focus on the prolapse, on anal sphincter structure and function, and on concomitant symptoms and underlying conditions," with "Recommendation: strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C." The document adds that "A careful history and physical examination should be performed before considering any operative intervention," and if prolapse is not seen, the patient "can be asked to reproduce the prolapse by straining while on a toilet with or without the use of an enema or a rectal balloon." The perineum "can then be inspected with the patient in the sitting or squatting position," and clinicians "should be careful, however, to avoid confusing rectal prolapse with prolapsing internal hemorrhoids or rectal mucosal prolapse."

### Surgical management of rectal prolapse [^b6bff32b]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Medium credibility.

This article reviews the pathogenesis, clinical presentation and surgical management of rectal prolapse. Full-thickness prolapse of the rectum causes significant discomfort because of the sensation of the prolapse itself, the mucus that it secretes, and because it tends to stretch the anal sphincters and cause incontinence. Treatment of rectal prolapse is primarily surgical. Perineal surgical repairs are well tolerated, but are generally associated with higher recurrence rates. Abdominal repairs involve fixing the rectum to the sacrum by using either mesh or sutures, and tend to have the lowest recurrence rates. If significant preoperative constipation is present, a sigmoid resection can be performed at the time of rectopexy. For many patients, diarrhea and incontinence improve after surgery. Laparoscopic repair of rectal prolapse has similar morbidity and recurrence rates to open surgery, with attendant benefits of reduced length of hospital stay, postoperative pain and wound complications.

### The international variability of surgery for rectal prolapse [^3f5f0f60]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Although rectal prolapse is relatively uncommon, with an estimated overall prevalence of 0.5% in the general population, it leads to significant detriment to patient quality of life. Over 60 different operations have been described, owing to the lack of a clearly superior operation with low recurrence and minimal morbidity. Performing any surgical randomized control trial is a major challenge and this has proved to be particularly difficult for trials comparing different approaches to the surgical treatment of rectal prolapse. Both the PROSPER and Swedish multicenter trials failed to recruit adequate patients and were subsequently underpowered for their primary end points. More recent attempts to commence large-scale trials in the United Kingdom (UK) and Europe have been abandoned. However, these trials clearly demonstrated the recurrence rates were much higher than anticipated. While there is no clear international consensus, many experts agree that procedures done via a perineal approach have higher recurrence rates compared with those done via an abdominal approach.

Given the heterogeneity of operative techniques it is challenging to compare different studies. Newer techniques continue to emerge without a clear comparison to past results. Survey data from pediatric surgeons and colorectal surgeons in the UK have attempted to clarify which procedures are currently being undertaken in Europe, but no such data exist elsewhere. Guidelines published by national societies, such as the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons, are unable to recommend a superior repair. To provide future education and resources to improve the care of rectal prolapse, it is necessary to understand how surgeons are currently caring for patients with rectal prolapse. The aim of this study is to characterize the practice patterns for surgical management of rectal prolapse internationally.

### Surgery for complete (full-thickness) rectal prolapse in adults [^1c88a12e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Complete (full-thickness) rectal prolapse is a lifestyle-altering disability that commonly affects older people. The range of surgical methods available to correct the underlying pelvic floor defects in full-thickness rectal prolapse reflects the lack of consensus regarding the best operation.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different surgical repairs for complete (full-thickness) rectal prolapse.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register up to 3 February 2015; it contains trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) as well as trials identified through handsearches of journals and conference proceedings. We also searched EMBASE and EMBASE Classic (1947 to February 2015) and PubMed (January 1950 to December 2014), and we specifically handsearched theBritish Journal of Surgery (January 1995 to June 2014), Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (January 1995 to June 2014) and Colorectal Diseases (January 2000 to June 2014), as well as the proceedings of the Association of Coloproctology meetings (January 2000 to December 2014). Finally, we handsearched reference lists of all relevant articles to identify additional trials.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of surgery for managing full-thickness rectal prolapse in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected studies from the literature searches, assessed the methodological quality of eligible trials and extracted data. The four primary outcome measures were the number of patients with recurrent rectal prolapse, number of patients with residual mucosal prolapse, number of patients with faecal incontinence and number of patients with constipation.

Main Results

We included 15 RCTs involving 1007 participants in this third review update. One trial compared abdominal with perineal approaches to surgery, three trials compared fixation methods, three trials looked at the effects of lateral ligament division, one trial compared techniques of rectosigmoidectomy, two trials compared laparoscopic with open surgery, and two trials compared resection with no resection rectopexy. One new trial compared rectopexy versus rectal mobilisation only (no rectopexy), performed with either open or laparoscopic surgery. One new trial compared different techniques used in perineal surgery, and another included three comparisons: abdominal versus perineal surgery, resection versus no resection rectopexy in abdominal surgery and different techniques used in perineal surgery. The heterogeneity of the trial objectives, interventions and outcomes made analysis difficult. Many review objectives were covered by only one or two studies with small numbers of participants. Given these caveats, there is insufficient data to say which of the abdominal and perineal approaches are most effective. There were no detectable differences between the methods used for fixation during rectopexy. Division, rather than preservation, of the lateral ligaments was associated with less recurrent prolapse but more postoperative constipation. Laparoscopic rectopexy was associated with fewer postoperative complications and shorter hospital stay than open rectopexy. Bowel resection during rectopexy was associated with lower rates of constipation. Recurrence of full-thickness prolapse was greater for mobilisation of the rectum only compared with rectopexy. There were no differences in quality of life for patients who underwent the different kinds of prolapse surgery.

Authors' Conclusions

The lack of high quality evidence on different techniques, together with the small sample size of included trials and their methodological weaknesses, severely limit the usefulness of this review for guiding practice. It is impossible to identify or refute clinically important differences between the alternative surgical operations. Longer follow-up with current studies and larger rigorous trials are needed to improve the evidence base and to define the optimum surgical treatment for full-thickness rectal prolapse.

### The surged faradic stimulation to the pelvic floor muscles as an adjunct to the medical management in children with rectal prolapse [^16d27696]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Rectal prolapse is benign condition that causes great concern to the patient and the parents. An adequate trial of conservative management, along with faradic stimulation of pelvic floor can totally cure most of these children, if proper heed is paid to the compliance for the treatment regime and to the pelvic floor and abdominal muscles exercises. Our study does point to the fact that pelvic floor weakness does significantly contribute in the pathogenesis/pathology of rectal prolapse in children as well.

### A systematic review of the literature on the surgical management of recurrent rectal prolapse [^d3ba9c99]. Colorectal Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

There are no available guidelines to support surgical decision-making in recurrent rectal prolapse. This systematic review evaluated the results of abdominal or perineal surgery for recurrent rectal prolapse, with the aim of developing an evidence-based treatment algorithm.

Method

PubMed and MEDLINE databases were searched for all clinical studies involving patients who underwent surgery for recurrent rectal prolapse between 1950 and 2014. The primary outcome measure was the recurrence rate after abdominal or perineal surgery for recurrent rectal prolapse. Secondary outcomes included morbidity, mortality and quality of life data where available.

Results

There were no randomized controlled studies comparing the success rates of abdominal or perineal surgery for recurrent rectal prolapse. Most studies were heterogeneous, of low quality (level IV) and involved small numbers of patients. The follow-up of 144 patients included in the studies undergoing perineal surgery ranged from 8.8 to 81 months, with recurrence rates varying from 0% to 50%. Morbidity ranged from 0% to 17% with no mortality reported. Limited data on quality of life following the Altemeier procedure were available. The follow-up for 158 patients included in the studies who underwent abdominal surgery ranged from 0 to 23 years, during which recurrence rates varied from 0% to 15%. Morbidity rates ranged from 0% to 32% with 4% mortality. No quality of life data were available for patients undergoing abdominal surgery.

Conclusion

This systematic review was unable to develop a treatment algorithm for recurrent rectal prolapse due to the variety of surgical techniques described and the low level of evidence within heterogeneous studies. Larger high-quality studies are necessary to guide practice in this difficult area.

### Surgical options for full-thickness rectal prolapse: current status and institutional choice [^108ee68f]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Current status

No differences in quality of life were found in patients undergoing different types of prolapse surgery. Therapeutic decisions must be individualized and must consider each patient's disease characteristics as well as the surgeon's experience. The lack of high-quality evidence comparing the different techniques, together with the small sample sizes in included trials and their methodological weaknesses, severely limit the usefulness of this review for guiding practice. It is impossible to identify or refute clinically important differences between the alternative surgical operations. Long-term follow up with current studies and larger rigorous trials are needed to improve the evidence base and to define the optimum surgical treatment for FTRP.

### Surgery for complete rectal prolapse in adults [^87b28866]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Complete rectal prolapse is a life-style altering disability that commonly affects older people. The range of surgical methods available to correct the underlying pelvic floor defects in complete rectal prolapse suggests that there is no agreement about the choice of the best operation.

Objectives

To determine the effects of surgery on the treatment of rectal prolapse in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register (searched 10 January 2008), the Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group Trials Register (searched 10 January 2008), CENTRAL (Issue 1, 2008), PubMed (1 January 1950 to 10 January 2008) and EMBASE (1 January 1998 to 10 January 2008). The British Journal of Surgery (January 1995 to January 2008) and the Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (January 1995 to January 2008) were specifically hand searched. The proceedings of the Association of Coloproctology meetings held from 1999 to 2007 were perused. Reference lists of all relevant articles were searched for further trials.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised trials of surgery in the management of adult rectal prolapse.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three reviewers independently selected studies from the literature searches, assessed the methodological quality of eligible trials and extracted data. The four primary outcome measures were: number of patients with recurrent rectal prolapse, number of patients with residual mucosal prolapse, and number of patients with faecal incontinence or constipation.

Main Results

Twelve randomised controlled trials including 380 participants were identified and included in this review. One trial compared abdominal with perineal approaches to surgery, three trials compared fixation methods, three trials looked at the effects of lateral ligament division, one trial compared techniques of rectosigmoidectomy, two trials compared laparoscopic with open surgery and two trials compared resection with no resection rectopexy. The heterogeneity of the trial objectives, interventions and outcomes made analysis difficult. Many review objectives were covered by only one or two studies with small numbers of participants. With these caveats in mind there is insufficient data to say which of the abdominal and perineal approaches has a better outcome. There were no detectable differences between the methods used for fixation during rectopexy. Division, rather than preservation, of the lateral ligaments was associated with less recurrent prolapse but more post-operative constipation. Laparoscopic rectopexy was associated with fewer post-operative complications and shorter hospital stay than open rectopexy. Bowel resection during rectopexy was associated with lower rates of constipation.

Authors' Conclusions

The small sample size of included trials together with their methodological weaknesses severely limit the usefulness of this review for guiding practice. It is impossible to identify or refute clinically important differences between the alternative surgical operations. Larger rigorous trials are needed to improve the evidence with which to define optimum surgical treatment for rectal prolapse: the results of one such trial are awaited.

Rectal prolapse

Question 9.12

In the emergency setting how should rectal prolapse be managed?

Recommendation: Initial treatment should be non‐operative. A prolapse can usually be reduced and if appropriate an early expedited procedure can be planned.

Level of evidence: IV

Grade of recommendation: D

Consensus: 100% (SA 66.7%, A 33.3%)

Rectal prolapse rarely presents as an emergency. Simple manual manipulation will often reduce a prolapse. If the prolapse has been 'out' for some time, however, then application of an osmotic substance, for example sugar, can help reduce swelling and aid the reduction of an incarcerated prolapse. Other substances frequently used include honey or caster sugar. Occasionally, these simple manoeuvres will result in resolution of the prolapse. However, in the majority of cases these are only temporizing and, in order to avoid frequent readmission, it is often pragmatic to expedite the prolapse repair within days of the presentation to the emergency surgical service.

Question 9.13

If emergency surgery for an acute rectal prolapse is necessary, what operation should be performed?

Recommendation: If emergency surgery is unavoidable, both abdominal and perineal approaches are appropriate. The operative approach should be tailored to the individual patient after a full risk assessment and discussion.

Level of evidence: IV

Grade of recommendation: D

Consensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)

The operative approach will need to tailored to the individual patient, taking into account the patient's comorbidities, pre‐existing bowel dysfunction and wishes. Laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy has been reported to be feasible and safe for emergency repair, although in all cases in this series the prolapse was always reducible and there were no cases of ischaemic or incarcerated bowel.

Perineal rectosigmoidectomy has also been reported for incarcerated prolapse. All of the series reporting ES for rectal prolapse are small and so it is difficult to make a strong recommendation for one approach over the other.

Haemorrhoids are common and often asymptomatic, but 30 000 interventions are nevertheless undertaken annually in the UK. Prolapsing haemorrhoids are those which are likely to present acutely with pain, usually caused by strangulation or thrombosis. Management is usually conservative.

Rectal prolapse or procidentia is an intussusception of the rectum externally through the anal sphincter complex. It should be distinguished from an internal rectal intussusception and solitary rectal ulcer syndrome. Whether internal rectal intussusception and rectal prolapse form a spectrum of conditions or are two separate conditions is still widely debated.

Although it is a benign condition, rectal prolapse can be debilitating, mainly due to the discomfort associated with the physical presence of the prolapse, passage of mucous and blood, together with the symptoms of faecal leakage and incontinence and on occasions constipation.

Rectal prolapse is most commonly seen at the extremes of age. In children it usually presents under the age of 4 years and is seen equally in boys and girls. The peak incidence in adults is in the seventh decade of life with in excess of 90% of cases occurring in women. Although it is seen less commonly in men, its age of incidence in men is under 40 years of age. It rarely presents as an emergency.

Anal fistula/abscess

Question 9.1

Which patients with perianal abscess/infection are at a higher risk of necrotizing soft tissue infections and should undergo expedited surgery?

Recommendation: Patients with diabetes, steroid use, immunocompromised, chronic renal failure, obesity, liver disease, peripheral vascular disease and intravenous drug abuse who have evidence of systemic sepsis should undergo surgery as soon as possible after institution of a Sepsis Six bundle including broad‐spectrum antibiotic administration.

Level of evidence: III

Grade of recommendation: D

Consensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)

Recommendation: Patients with perianal abscess/infection who are at risk of necrotizing soft tissue infections but without systemic sepsis should undergo surgery at the earliest opportunity once appropriately starved and prepared for theatre; this should include overnight.

Rectal prolapse — abdominal versus perineal approach outcomes and evidence: According to numerous retrospective reports, recurrence rates after abdominal surgery for rectal prolapse are approximately one fourth those after perineal surgery, and the abdominal approach is associated with better functional outcomes; however, a 2000 Cochrane review comparing 274 patients in 8 randomized or quasirandomized trials reported no significant differences in recurrent prolapse between abdominal and perineal approaches, a 2008 update including 12 randomized controlled trials involving 380 participants reached a similar conclusion, and a third 2015 review of 15 randomized controlled trials involving 1007 patients was also unable to demonstrate a difference in recurrence rates between the 2 approaches.

### Surgical options for full-thickness rectal prolapse: current status and institutional choice [^ca1c09c7]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rectal prolapse is defined as a protrusion of the rectal wall outside the anus resulting from a pelvic floor disorder. Full-thickness rectal prolapse (FTRP) refers to prolapse of all layers of the bowel wall; a hemorrhoidal/partial prolapse involves only the mucosa. FTRP has a characteristic circular mucosal fold appearance, whereas hemorrhoidal/partial prolapse shows radial folds. FTRP is distinct from hemorrhoidal/partial prolapse, and symptoms related to FTRP are often refractory to treatment and intractable.

Surgery is the only definitive treatment for FTRP, although the ideal therapeutic approach is a matter of debate. Concomitant bladder or vaginal prolapse will complicate surgical options; therefore, we will focus on possible alternatives for surgical treatment in patients with only FTRP. In this article, we review previously documented surgeries for FTRP and discuss the best surgical options.

Posterior versus anterior rectal prolapse repairs — comparative evidence — indicates there is insufficient evidence to argue that posterior rectal prolapse repairs are better or worse than anterior rectal prolapse repairs; Recommendation: strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Retrospective reviews suggest equivalent recurrence rates for posterior versus anterior repairs with both < 10% at 10-year follow-up, and small comparative series report similar functional outcomes but potentially higher postoperative complications with resection rectopexy. Technique selection needs to be driven by surgical expertise and patient surgical history, comorbidities, and preference.

Rectal prolapse is best diagnosed by physical examination and by having the patient strain as if to defecate; a laparoscopic rectopexy is the preferred treatment approach. Intussusception is more an epiphenomena than a defecatory disorder and should be managed conservatively. Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is a consequence of chronic straining and therapy should be aimed at restoring a normal bowel habit with behavioral approaches including biofeedback therapy. Rectocele correction may be considered if it can be definitively established that it is a cause of defecation disorder and only after conservative measures have failed. An enterocele should only be operated when pain and heaviness are predominant symptoms and it is refractory to conservative therapy.

### Surgical interventions and the use of device-aided therapy for the treatment of fecal incontinence and defecatory disorders [^f9f9727a]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Fecal incontinence (FI) and defecatory disorders (DDs) — conclusions on surgery and devices: Surgical options may be considered in patients with FI and DDs who have failed conservative therapy. Our experience suggests that many patients undergo surgical therapy without a rigorous trial of conservative therapy. Among surgical procedures, SNS is a safe and effective option for FI, and there is less evidence to support the routine use of other surgical procedures sans a colonic stoma for FI. Surgery is necessary in a small fraction, perhaps less than 5% of patients with DD, generally those with severe obliterative pelvic organ and/or rectal prolapse, and there is a critical need for clinical trials comparing various surgical procedures and conservative therapies.

### An alternative management for high-risk patients with rectal prolapse [^9a6632b9]. Colorectal Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Indication

The management of rectal prolapse in presence of high-risk comorbidities can be challenging. We report the use of an anal plug as a noninvasive alternative in patients with contraindication of surgery.

Method

This small device opens up in about 30 s to fit the contour of the lower rectum avoiding faecal leakage or in our case, the rectal prolapse. Although the plug is poorly tolerated in some cases, this device may be used up to 12 h per day and no adverse effects have been reported. COMPARISON WITH OTHER METHODS: Nonsurgical alternatives described in the literature, such as sclerotherpy in children, are not routinely used in the adult population. The main advantage of the anal plug is its simplicity and safety as in the series published for the treatment of faecal incontinence no adverse events were described.

Conclusion

An anal plug for rectal prolapse is an alternative in high-risk patients or during the time before surgical treatment.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of rectal prolapse [^a0d5590a]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2017). Medium credibility.

Additional abdominal surgery considerations — minimally invasive approaches to rectal prolapse are endorsed and compared: A minimally invasive approach by experienced surgeons "should be considered when technically feasible" (strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B). Laparoscopic versus open repair shows equivalent recurrence rates (4%–8%) and morbidity (10%–33%) with benefits in pain control, length of stay, and return of bowel function. Robotic rectal prolapse surgery seems to produce outcomes comparable with laparoscopy without well-powered randomized trials for long-term recurrence, a randomized trial of ventral rectopexy by expert surgeons failed to show differences in the length of procedure or outcomes, and a meta-analysis showed no strong benefit of robotics over laparoscopy.

### IUGA opinion paper on obstructed defecation: management of clinical and proctographic rectoceles [^cfa266bc]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS) is a defecatory abnormality with a sensation of incomplete evacuation, the need to strain at stool, the need for digitation in the vagina, the anus, or the perineum. Anterior rectocele and rectal intussusception are the frequent pathologies behind ODS. The review focuses on the assessment and treatment of obstructed defecation in women with rectocele, recto-enterocele and rectal intussusception in the remit of a urogynecologist.

Methods

A working subcommittee from the International Urogynecology Association (IUGA) Research and Development (R&D) Committee was formed with colorectal surgeons from the American Society of Colon & Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS). An initial document was drafted based on a literature review. The review focused on the treatment options of women with presenting with obstructed defecation and posterior compartment prolapse either on clinical examination or on imaging. After evaluation by the entire IUGA R&D Committee revisions were made. The quality of the evidence was graded and used to form consensus recommendations.

Results

Ultrasound and dynamic MRI are helpful imaging modalities in triaging patients. A defecating proctogram to evaluate the size of rectal intussusception and enterocele is the standard investigation. Conservative therapies are effective first-line management options. The transvaginal native tissue rectocele repair is a safe and effective first-line surgical treatment in women with obstructed defecation.

Conclusions

When evaluating patients with obstructive defecation, it is important to address anatomy as well as function. In the absence of a clinically significant rectocele or enterocele during vaginal examination, in women with obstructed defecation, referral to a gastroenterologist or colorectal surgeon for further evaluation and management is recommended.

### Sclerotherapy for the management of rectal prolapse in children [^99a63f05]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Rectal prolapse is a commonly occurring and usually self-limited process in children. Surgical management is indicated for failures of conservative management. However, the optimal approach is unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of sclerotherapy for the management of rectal prolapse.

Methods

This was a retrospective review of children < 18years with rectal prolapse who underwent sclerotherapy, predominantly with peanut oil (91%), between 1998 and 2015. Patients with imperforate anus or cloaca abnormalities, Hirschprung disease, or prior pull-through procedures were excluded.

Results

Fifty-seven patients were included with a median age of 4.9years (interquartile range (IQR) 3.2–9.2) and median follow-up of 52months (IQR 8–91). Twenty patients (n = 20/57; 35%) recurred at a median of 1.6months (IQR 0.8–3.6). Only 3 patients experienced recurrence after 4months. Nine of the patients who recurred (n = 9/20; 45%) were re-treated with sclerotherapy. This was successful in 5 patients (n = 5/9; 56%). Two patients (n = 2/20; 10%) experienced a mucosal recurrence which resolved with conservative management. Forty-four patients were thus cured with sclerotherapy alone (n = 44/57; 77%). No patients undergoing sclerotherapy had an adverse event. Thirteen patients (n = 13/20; 65%) underwent rectopexy after failing at least one treatment of sclerotherapy. Three of these patients (n = 3/13; 23%) recurred following rectopexy and required an additional operation.

Conclusions

Injection sclerotherapy for children with rectal prolapse resulted in a durable cure of prolapse in most children. Patients who recur following sclerotherapy tend to recur within 4months. Another attempt at sclerotherapy following recurrence is reasonable and was successful half of the time. Sclerotherapy should be the preferred initial treatment for rectal prolapse in children and for the initial treatment of recurrence.

### The surged faradic stimulation to the pelvic floor muscles as an adjunct to the medical management in children with rectal prolapse [^7ca0267b]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Rectal prolapse is a common condition in children in the underdeveloped nations, albeit with unclear etiology. The commonest predisposing factors are the diseases leading to malnutrition (e.g. amebiasis, giardiasis, worms) leading to disappearance of the ischio-rectal fat and causing lack of rectal support. A persistently increased intra -abdominal pressure e.g. due to constipation, frequent cough, has also been implicated. Among the anatomical factors that had to the development of rectal prolapse in children are the vertical course of rectum, a low-position of rectum in relation to other pelvic organs and lack of levator support. There are other authors who believe that the rectal prolapse in children mainly involves the mucosa; and the muscle coats are either not involved or are involved at a later stage. This reason is forwarded to explain the noted higher frequency of rectal prolapse in infants. It is, therefore, on this ground that the prolapse in children is supposedly different from the adults (as in adults the weakness of the pelvic floor is the predominant etiological factor).

Based on these principles, the conservative treatment has remained the initial cornerstone of the rectal prolapse management in children and the interventional therapies (injection treatment and surgical operations) have been reserved for the non-responders. By and large, the conservative treatment includes use of stools softeners, strapping of the buttocks to prevent recurrence of prolapse and defecation in lateral position.

In the present study, we added one more component to the prevalent conservative treatment and that is, the use of surged faradic current for stimulating external anal sphincter and the pubo-rectalis sling. This was contemplated seeing the fair results of using this current in our patients where the fecal incontinence had resulted due to poorly developed or neurologically weak pelvic floor muscles. Similar observations had been earlier reported by various workers also. The surged faradic stimulus was given with the help of rectal probe that was designed so as stimulate the external anal sphincter and the weak pelvic floor muscles (when introduced passed intraluminally). The rationale of the therapy is that the strengthened external anal sphincter and pelvic floor muscles would support the rectum adequately causing amelioration of the rectal prolapse. Though initially employed in the children presenting with failed conservative management, the therapy was subsequently added as adjunct to the conservative management for every case with rectal prolapse, so as to expedite the relief. To the best of our knowledge, no similar study has been reported in the English literature till date.

### Surgical options for full-thickness rectal prolapse: current status and institutional choice [^458849bb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Recurrent prolapse

Because of a significant recurrence rate, choosing the ideal therapeutic strategy to avoid recurrent prolapse is important, and surgeons must be aware of each patient's details prior to surgery. In particular, the most important determinant of secondary or additional surgery is the remaining blood supply, and patients who have previously undergone resection or who require two anastomoses are at risk for ischemia.

Repeated colorectal resection via the perineal approach can be chosen for recurrent prolapse after initial perineal colorectal resection. Perineal rectosigmoidectomy is indicated for patients who suffer early recurrence of prolapse after another perineal repair, especially older or high-risk patients. Fixation and suspension of the rectum via the abdominal approach is considered a reasonable alternative therapy for recurrent prolapse. However, perineal rectosigmoidectomy should be avoided in patients who have previously undergone rectopexy via the abdominal approach, though this method may be available in patients after only a rectopexy.

### Controversy in the treatment of symptomatic internal rectal prolapse: suspension or resection? [^71ac070c]. Surgical Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Surgical decision-making for OD remains difficult and complex. Even more important than surgical technical skills is the surgeon's experience and the understanding of pelvic anatomy and pathophysiology. Preoperative functional investigation and the use of an objective scoring system should improve selection of patients who would benefit from surgery. Furthermore, assessment of the functional outcome (and new onset functional sequelae) is more important than the evaluation of the anatomic result. The success of surgery is not dictated only by choosing between a transabdominal and a transanal route. To be able to offer these patients a tailored approach, a colorectal surgeon who is specialized in pelvic floor pathology should be able to perform both techniques.

### The surged faradic stimulation to the pelvic floor muscles as an adjunct to the medical management in children with rectal prolapse [^71069d28]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Methods

Forty seven consecutive children with symptomatic rectal prolapse from July 2005 to June 2006 were included in the study. A detailed history was obtained from the parents and was adjudged to be reliable for all patients. Thereafter they were examined by the members of pediatric surgical team having more than 10 years of experience in specialty of Pediatric Surgery. Most study subjects had long standing prolapse and were awaiting their turn for the definitive surgical treatment while the surged faradic stimulation as was added as an adjunct to conservative management. The data was collected on their sex, age, duration and extent of prolapse (length and the coats of rectum involved), anal tone, the preceding illness, if any, family history, duration of conservative management and the extent of relief obtained thereby. Prior conservative management was said to have been given if the child had taken this treatment at a stretch at least for four weeks. All the early presenters (n = 12) in the study (those presenting within 2 weeks of initiation of symptoms), that is, with conservative management of lesser than 4 weeks, were considered to have taken no prior conservative management. The extent of prolapse was adjudged mainly on the subjective assessment of the reporting parent. However, an objective assessment was also done by the physiotherapist while child was being subjected to faradic stimulation. It was rated as complete if all rectal coats could be visualized through the entire circumference of the prolapsed segment. The assessment of anal tone was done subjectively at the initial examination by experienced pediatric surgeons. Only gross deviation from normal could be picked up in this manner in the outpatient setting. as invariably the children were apprehensive and tending to contract the entire pelvic floor musculature in an attempt to resist anal examination. The children were given surged faradic stimuli to the external anal sphincter and the pelvic floor muscles while continuing with the conservative management (stool softeners, high protein high caloric diet). A good reassurance and a mild sedative for more apprehensive child were enough to derive co-operation from them. The older children (5 years or more) were taught the abdominal and pelvic floor muscle exercises; whereas, for the younger children, the mothers were taught the passive maneuvers to achieve the same goal. They subjects and their parents were instructed to strictly adhere to this regime of treatment or face failure or relapse. No fixed period for this adjunct treatment was contemplated and the final response was adjudged as the one present at the 'exit point' of the patient from the study.

### Examining pessary use and satisfaction in managing pelvic organ prolapse: results from a cross-sectional multicentre patient survey [^76f15573]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a common clinical condition characterized by the downward descent of female pelvic organs into or through the vaginal canal, typically occurring due to weakened pelvic floor muscles. Common risk factors for POP include any conditions that increase the risk of global pelvic floor dysfunction, such as high vaginal parity, advanced age, obesity, previous pelvic surgeries and chronic constipation. Given that POP can involve a host of organs such as the bladder (cystocele), uterus (uterine prolapse) or rectum (rectocele), symptoms can vary widely from patient to patient. The most common symptoms include pelvic pressure or heaviness, the sensation of something coming out of the vagina, urinary or bowel incontinence, and incomplete emptying/evacuation. The prevalence of individuals with POP is expected to increase drastically given the aging population, warranting a more targeted approach towards managing and treating this condition.

Current guidelines outlining the management and treatment of POP highlight the use of conservative methods such as weight loss, dietary measures, physical activity and pelvic floor physiotherapy to address weakened muscles. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Urogynecologic Society (AUGS) suggest that all women who are considering treatment for POP should be offered pessaries for symptom relief. As a conservative option, pessaries allow patients the option to maintain further fertility, and successfully improve overall quality of life. Up to 92% of women with varying stages of prolapse can be successfully fitted with a pessary and offering these before surgery could drastically improve patient outcomes.

Despite these positive qualities, many patients choose to discontinue pessary use and proceed with surgery for a number of different reasons. This study will explore (1) how pessaries are used in treating POP based on personal experience, (2) how we can improve pessary continuation in patients, and (3) what women with POP consider to be ideal pessary characteristics.

### Surgical management of rectal prolapse… [^32e200e4]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Abdominal operations offer not only lower recurrence but also greater chance for functional improvements. Suture and mesh rectopexy produce equivalent results. However, the polyvinyl alcohol sponge rectopexy is associated with an increased risk of infectious complications and has largely been abandoned. The advantage of adding a resection to the rectopexy seems to be related to less constipation. Laparoscopic rectopexy has similar results to open rectopexy but has all of the advantages related to laparoscopy. Perineal procedures are better suited to frail elderly patients with extensive comorbidity. The aim of treatment is to control the prolapse, restore continence, and prevent constipation or impaired evacuation. 5, 7 This goal can be achieved by resection or plication of the redundant bowel and/or fixation of the rectum to the sacrum. 5, 7 A strong and functional pelvic floor may be restored by plicating the puborectalis anterior to the rectum.

5 The rationale for rectal fixation is to keep the rectum attached in the desired elevated position until it becomes fixed by scar tissue. Brazzelli et al79 performed a meta-analysis of articles reporting on surgery for rectal prolapse. They concluded that division, rather than preservation, of the lateral ligaments was associated with less recurrent prolapse but more postoperative constipation, although these findings were found in small numbers. The major limitation of this meta-analysis was that only 2 studies addressing lateral ligament division or preservation were included in the meta-analysis. In summary, it would appear that preservation of ligaments is associated with an improvement in continence and a reduction of constipation. The advantage of perineal procedures is that they avoid laparotomy, which makes them well suited for high-risk patients.

There are 2 widely used perineal procedures: the Delorme procedure and perineal rectosigmoidectomy. alone. 85 When comparing the various perineal options, the perineal rectosigmoidectomy with levatorplasty has the largest recurrence-free interval, the lowest recurrence rate, and the most salutary effects on constipation and incontinence. Perineal rectosigmoidectomy is therefore next best and the Delorme procedure is the worst of the 3 perineal options.

### Conservative management of pelvic organ prolapse in women [^cde32d79]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Pelvic organ prolapse is common, and some degree of prolapse is seen in 50% of parous women. Women with prolapse can experience a variety of pelvic floor symptoms. Treatments include surgery, mechanical devices and conservative management. Conservative management approaches, such as giving lifestyle advice and delivering pelvic floor muscle training, are often used in cases of mild to moderate prolapse.

Objectives

To determine the effects of conservative management (physical interventions, such as pelvic floor muscle training and lifestyle interventions) for women with pelvic organ prolapse in comparison with no treatment or other treatment options (such as mechanical devices or surgery).

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group trials register (February 2004), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2003), PREMEDLINE (15 January 2003), EMBASE (January 1996 to January 2003), CINAHL (January 1982 to February 2003), PEDro (October 2003), the UK National Research Register (Issue 3, 2003), Controlled Clinical Trials (April 2003) and ZETOC (April 2003). We searched the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials in women with pelvic organ prolapse that included a physical or lifestyle intervention in at least one arm of the trial.

Data Collection and Analysis

No eligible completed, published or unpublished, randomised controlled trials were found; therefore no data collection or analysis were undertaken.

Main Results

No published reports of randomised controlled trials relevant to the review objectives were found. Three ongoing randomised controlled trials of physiotherapy interventions which include some women with prolapse were identified.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Currently there is no rigorous evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding the use of conservative interventions in the management of pelvic organ prolapse.

### Surgical interventions and the use of device-aided therapy for the treatment of fecal incontinence and defecatory disorders [^0ba8981a]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this clinical practice update expert review is to describe the key principles in the use of surgical interventions and device-aided therapy for managing fecal incontinence (FI) and defecatory disorders. The best practices outlined in this review are based on relevant publications, including systematic reviews and expert opinion (when applicable). Best Practice Advice 1: A stepwise approach should be followed for management of FI. Conservative therapies (diet, fluids, techniques to improve evacuation, a bowel training program, management of diarrhea and constipation with diet and medications if necessary) will benefit approximately 25% of patients and should be tried first. Best Practice Advice 2: Pelvic floor retraining with biofeedback therapy is recommended for patients with FI who do not respond to the conservative measures indicated above. Best Practice Advice 3: Perianal bulking agents such as intra-anal injection of dextranomer may be considered when conservative measures and biofeedback therapy fail. Best Practice Advice 4: Sacral nerve stimulation should be considered for patients with moderate or severe FI in whom symptoms have not responded after a 3-month or longer trial of conservative measures and biofeedback therapy and who do not have contraindications to these procedures. Best Practice Advice 5: Until further evidence is available, percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation should not be used for managing FI in clinical practice. Best Practice Advice 6: Barrier devices should be offered to patients who have failed conservative or surgical therapy, or in those who have failed conservative therapy who do not want or are not eligible for more invasive interventions. Best Practice Advice 7: Anal sphincter repair (sphincteroplasty) should be considered in postpartum women with FI and in patients with recent sphincter injuries. In patients who present later with symptoms of FI unresponsive to conservative and biofeedback therapy and evidence of sphincter damage, sphincteroplasty may be considered when perianal bulking injection and sacral nerve stimulation are not available or have proven unsuccessful. Best Practice Advice 8: The artificial anal sphincter, dynamic graciloplasty, may be considered for patients with medically refractory severe FI who have failed treatment or are not candidates for barrier devices, sacral nerve stimulation, perianal bulking injection, sphincteroplasty and a colostomy. Best Practice Advice 9: Major anatomic defects (eg, rectovaginal fistula, full-thickness rectal prolapse, fistula in ano, or cloaca-like deformity) should be rectified with surgery. Best Practice Advice 10: A colostomy should be considered in patients with severe FI who have failed conservative treatment and have failed or are not candidates for barrier devices, minimally invasive surgical interventions, and sphincteroplasty. Best Practice Advice 11: A magnetic anal sphincter device may be considered for patients with medically refractory severe FI who have failed or are not candidates for barrier devices, perianal bulking injection, sacral nerve stimulation, sphincteroplasty, or a colostomy. Data regarding efficacy are limited and 40% of patients had moderate or severe complications. Best Practice Advice 12: For defecatory disorders, biofeedback therapy is the treatment of choice. Best Practice Advice 13: Based on limited evidence, sacral nerve stimulation should not be used for managing defecatory disorders in clinical practice. Best Practice Advice 14: Anterograde colonic enemas are not effective in the long term for management of defecatory disorders. Best Practice Advice 15: The stapled transanal rectal resection and related procedures should not be routinely performed for correction of structural abnormalities in patients with defecatory disorders.

### Rectal prolapse, rectal intussusception, rectocele, and solitary rectal ulcer syndrome [^7d037193]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Rectal prolapse can be diagnosed easily by having the patient strain as if to defecate. A laparoscopic rectopexy should be recommended. Intussusception is more an epiphenomenon than a cause of defecatory disorder and should be managed conservatively. Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is a consequence of chronic straining, and therapy should include restoring a normal defecation habit. Rectocele should be left alone; an operation may be considered if it is larger than 3 cm and is causing profound symptoms despite maximizing medical therapy for the associated defecation disorder.

### Management of recurrent rectal prolapse: surgical approach influences outcome [^019979d4]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Recurrent rectal prolapse is an unresolved problem and the optimal treatment is debated. This study was designed to review patterns of care and outcomes in a large cohort of patients after surgery for recurrent prolapse.

Methods

From 685 patients who underwent operative repair for full-thickness external rectal prolapse, we identified 78 patients (70 females; mean age, 66.9 years) who underwent surgery for recurrence. We reviewed the subsequent management and outcomes for these 78 patients.

Results

Mean interval to their first recurrence was 33 (range, 1–168) months. There were significantly more re-recurrences after reoperation using a perineal procedure (19/51) compared with an abdominal procedure (4/27) for their recurrent rectal prolapse (P = 0.03) at a mean follow-up of nine (range, 1–82) months. Patients undergoing abdominal repair of recurrence were significantly younger than those who underwent perineal repair (mean age, 58.5 vs. 71.5 years; P < 0.01); however, there was nosignificant difference between the two groups with regard to the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification (P = 0.89). Eighteen patients had surgery for a second recurrence, with perineal repairs associated with higher failure rates (50 vs. 8 percent; P = 0.07). Finally, when combining all repairs, the abdominal approach continued to have significantly lower recurrence rates (39 vs. 13 percent; P < 0.01).

Conclusions

The re-recurrence rate after surgery for recurrent rectal prolapse is high, even at a relatively short follow-up interval. Our data suggest that abdominal repair of recurrent rectal prolapse should be undertaken if the patient's risk profile permits this approach.

Posterior suture rectopexy — role, recurrence, and constipation — states that rectopexy is a key component in the abdominal approach to rectal prolapse; Recommendation: strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A. Reported recurrence rates for suture rectopexy range from 3% to 9% at 2 years, with a possible 10-year recurrence of 29%. A randomized trial comparing 116 no-rectopexy versus 136 rectopexy patients showed an 8-fold increase in recurrence with mobilization alone. Constipation can be produced or worsened, with at least 50% of patients with preoperative constipation reporting worsening and ≈15% without preoperative constipation developing constipation after the procedure.

### The surged faradic stimulation to the pelvic floor muscles as an adjunct to the medical management in children with rectal prolapse [^3bdb3046]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

The surged faradic current has found wide application to improving the strength and vascularity of various groups of muscles including external anal sphincter. In the present study, besides stimulating and strengthening the external anal sphincter, an improvision was done to stimulate the pelvic floor muscle as well. This was to take care of the causative factor of poor pelvic floor muscle support in rectal prolapse in children. As we noted that most children presented to us had average health, long duration of rectal prolapse of 9.3 month (average) that had involved all coats of rectum. Therefore, our study supports time conclusion of Fowler that the common form of rectal prolapse involve all coats of rectum. However, another reason could be that the initial mucosal prolapse, over the time, involved all the layers of rectum as only 17% (n = 2 out of 12) of those early presenters (within days) had total rectal prolapse. On a wider perspective, it can be deduced that the chronically present rectal prolapse leads to weakness/atony of the pelvic floor muscles that required to be improved by their stimulation and/or exercise. Hence, inclusion of faradic stimulation of the pelvic floor muscles should form an integral part of the conservative therapy for the rectal prolapse.

We could cure 28 (64%) children fully using this strategy; of which 21 (70%) whom had received the conventional conservative management for rectal prolapse for longer than 3 months and would have required some form of interventional therapy. This shows that the judicious application of a simple non-invasive technique of faradic stimulation can cure long standing rectal prolapse and obviates any need of any other form of intervention. As expected, the cure rate was poor in the non complaint children. On the other hand, results were gratifying in those with long standing prolapse of over 1 year duration (Table 1). These subjects were found to be most compliant for this therapy as well. Perhaps chronic suffering and a failure to respond to the conventional conservative management acted as a motivational force for compliance to the regime of pelvic floor muscle stimulation/exercise in these children. The other factor for a comparatively lesser degree of response in those with shorter duration of rectal prolapse could be a lesser role of pelvic floor weakness in these subjects.

### An unusual pediatric case of chronic constipation and rectosigmoid prolapse diagnosed by video defecography [^59ea66ed]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Rectal prolapse is a relatively common, benign condition in the pediatric population. Conservative management usually results in resolution of the problem. Persistent rectal prolapse with chronic constipation suggests more serious underlying pathologic condition that may be challenging to diagnose. We present a case of severe recurrent rectal prolapse with chronic constipation in a 13-year-old boy. Using video defecography, an unusual radiographic modality in children, a functional sigmoid obstruction was observed that was not found on more routine imaging studies. Laparoscopic sigmoidectomy provided an excellent outcome in this patient who previously had a lifestyle-limiting, chronic condition.

### The surged faradic stimulation to the pelvic floor muscles as an adjunct to the medical management in children with rectal prolapse [^da149b3e]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

To assess the role of the surged faradic stimulation to the pelvic floor muscles as an adjunct to the conservative management in the children of idiopathic rectal prolapse

Methods

Study design: Prospective

Setting: Pediatric Surgery Department, Pt BD Sharma, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak

Subjects: 47 consecutive children with idiopathic rectal prolapse attending the Pediatric Surgery out patient department from July 2005 to June 2006

Methodology: The information pertaining to duration and the extent of rectal prolapse, predisposing or associated medical conditions, results of local clinical examination were noted. Surged faradic stimulation using modified intraluminal rectal probe, was given on the alternate days. The conventional conservative medical management was also continued. The extent of relief and the number of the sittings of faradic stimulation required were noted at various stages of follow-ups

Statistical Methods: Mean values between those completely cured and others; poor responders and others were compared with t-test and proportions were compared with Chi square test. The p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

The mean number of sittings in the completely cured group (n = 28 (64%)) was (12.4 ± 7.8) and was comparable with very poor responder (n = 6(13%). There was higher percentage of relief (76%) at the first follow up (at 15 days) in completely cured Vs other (37%) and also the poor responders showed (20%) Vs other (68%) and was statistically significant.

Conclusion

With use of faradic stimulation, even the long-standing rectal prolapse can be fully cured. The follow up visit at 2 weeks is very important to gauge the likely success of this modality in treatment of the patients with rectal prolapse. Those showing poor response at this stage may require alternative treatment or take a long time to get cured

### Multimedia article. external pelvic rectal suspension (the express procedure) for internal rectal prolapse, with or without concomitant rectocele repair: a video demonstration [^37b2d771]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Internal rectal prolapse has been proposed as a cause of symptomatic rectal evacuatory dysfunction. Abdominal rectopexy, the standard surgical approach, has significant attendant risk and does not address any concomitant rectocele. This video was designed to demonstrate a novel surgical method that uses porcine collagen implants (Permacol), designed to correct internal rectal prolapse, with or without rectocele.

Inclusion Criteria

severe rectal evacuatory dysfunction refractory to maximal conservative therapy and full-thickness internal rectal prolapse impeding rectal emptying on defecography with or without associated functional rectocoele; normal colonic transit. Patients undergo comprehensive preoperative and postoperative symptomatic assessment and anorectal physiologic testing, including defecography. A crescenteric perineal skin incision allows development of the rectovaginal/rectoprostatic plane to Denonvilliers fascia, with rectal mobilization. A curved tunneller inserted via the perineal wound is guided retropubically to emerge through suprapubic wounds created on each side. Permacol T-strips are sutured to the anterolateral rectal wall bilaterally, upward traction exerted, and the stem of each T-strip is sutured to the suprapubic periosteum, suspending the rectum. Concomitant rectocele is repaired using a Permacol patch in the rectovaginal plane.

Results

Short-term results for the "Express" are encouraging with improvement in evacuatory and prolapse symptoms and concomitant anatomic improvement at defecography.

Conclusions

This procedure promises to be an effective technique for managing patients with refractory evacuatory dysfunction secondary to internal rectal prolapse, with or without rectocele.

Mortality and morbidity

When the transabdominal approach is chosen in patients older than 50 years, concurrent colorectal cancer should be ruled out to avoid unexpected postoperative complications and/or poor outcomes. If mesh-related postoperative infection, erosion, dislocation, or pain occurs, removal of the infected foreign body, i.e. the implanted mesh, is the initial management.

Historically, many surgical procedures have been described for FTRP treatment. The morbidity and mortality rates for each procedure are summarized in Table 1.

Although surgical management of symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is common and often necessary, conservative treatments such as pessaries, pelvic floor muscle training, or both can usually result in symptomatic improvement. When treating patients with POP, health care practitioners should focus primarily on identification and alleviation of POP-related symptoms. It is appropriate to offer nonsurgical management to most people with POP. This article reviews the objective and subjective evaluation and nonsurgical management of POP, emphasizing a simple, practical approach to pessary fitting and management.

Rectal prolapse is common in infants and children. It should initially be managed conservatively, as prolapse often resolves with the growth of the child. We encountered an 8-month-old infant with complete rectal prolapse associated with pararectal herniation of ileum between the 2 walls of the prolapsed rectum. This rare event led to strangulation of the ileal segment within the prolapsed rectal walls. We present this extremely uncommon case with a brief review of the relevant literature.

### Dynamic MRI (dMRI) as a guide to therapy in children and adolescents with persistent full thickness rectal prolapse: a single centre review [^d1c9cda7]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Full thickness rectal prolapse (FTRP) tends to be self-limiting in children and is usually managed expectantly. However, it may persist and therefore requires surgical correction. There is no consensus upon operative management, and no one procedure has uniformly good outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine whether pre-operative diagnostic dMRI findings might help identify the operative approach best suited to the anatomical abnormality of the individual child.

Methods

A retrospective review of ten children with persistent FTRP who had been evaluated pre-operatively with dMRI between 2002 and 2010 was performed. In this preliminary work, MRI findings were not used to direct surgical management. Data collected included: age at presentation, underlying medical conditions, timing and findings of dMRI (specifically, descent of rectum from pubococcygeal (PC) line on straining), timing and type of surgery, surgical outcomes, and length of follow-up.

Results

Ten children (two female) with a median age of 11 years 2 months (range 8–15 years) with FTRP refractory to conservative treatment underwent diagnostic pre-operative dMRI. Median perineal descent from PC line on straining during dMRI was 3.5 cm (range 1–4 cm). Three of the seven children with severe descent initially underwent a Delorme's procedure, and all required surgical revision. Five with severe descent and one with moderate descent achieved a cure following rectopexy. Two patients with mild descent underwent a Delorme's procedure. One achieved a cure, and the other developed recurrence. Of the ten patients, seven had no prolapse at the last clinic review, and three have persisting symptoms. Median follow-up was 3.5 years (range 1–6).

Conclusion

The findings from this small study favour rectal suspension techniques for surgical management of moderate to severe perineal descent on dMRI. Delorme's procedure should only be applied to those with mild descent. Pre-operative dMRI assessment may have a potential role in guiding surgical intervention for children. However, future prospective studies will be required to confirm this assertion.

### Outcome and management of patients with large rectoanal intussusception [^22ec9cbf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Rectoanal intussusception is the funnel-shaped infolding of the rectum, which occurs during evacuation. The aims of this study were to evaluate the risk of full thickness rectal prolapse during follow-up of patients with large rectoanal intussusception, and whether therapy improved functional outcome.

Methods

Between September 1988 and July 1997, patients diagnosed with a large rectoanal intussusception by cinedefecography (intussusception ≥ 10 mm, extending into the anal canal) were retrospectively evaluated. Patients with full thickness rectal prolapse on physical examination or cinedefecography were excluded, as were patients with colonic inertia or a history of surgery for rectal prolapse. The patients were divided into three groups according to the treatment received: group I, conservative dietary therapy; group II, biofeedback; and group III, surgery. Outcomes were obtained by postal questionnaires or telephone interviews. Parameters included age, gender, past medical and surgical history, change of bowel habits, fecal incontinence score, and development of full thickness rectal prolapse.

Results

Of the 63 patients, 18 were excluded (seven patients had confirmed full thickness rectal prolapse, four had previous surgery for rectal prolapse, three had colonic inertia, and four died). Follow-up data were obtained in 36 (80%) of the remaining 45 patients. The mean follow-up of this group was 45 months (range, 12–118 months). There were 34 women and two men, with a mean age of 72.4 yr (range, 37–91 yr). The mean size of the intussusception was 2.2 cm (range, 1.0–5.0 cm). The patients were classified as follows: group I, 13 patients (36.1%); group II, 13 patients (36.1%); and group III, 10 patients (27.8%). Subjectively, symptoms improved in five (38.5%), four (30.8%), and six (60.0%) patients in the three groups (p > 0.05). Among the patients with constipation, the decrease in numbers of assisted bowel movements per week (time of diagnosis to present) was significantly greater in group II compared to group 1 (8.1 ± 2.8 vs 0.8 ± 0.5, respectively, p = 0.004). Among the patients with incontinence, incontinence scores improved more in group II as compared to either group I or group III (time of diagnosis to present, 3.7 ± 4.2 to 1.1 ± 5.4 vs 1.4 ± 2.2, respectively, p > 0.05). Six patients (two in group I, three in group II, and one in group III) had the sensation of rectal prolapse on evacuation; however, only one patient in group I developed full thickness rectal prolapse.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated that the risk of full thickness rectal prolapse developing in patients medically treated for large intussusception is very small (1/26, 3.8%). Moreover, biofeedback is beneficial to improve the symptoms of both constipation and incontinence in these patients. Therefore, biofeedback should be considered as the initial therapy of choice for large rectoanal intussusception.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of rectal prolapse [^518ca420]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2017). Medium credibility.

Rectal prolapse — constipation and fecal incontinence considerations for surgical planning: Constipation is common and severe constipation requires special consideration; patients with constipation and/or pelvic dyssynergia on testing may not be ideal candidates for maneuvers known to exacerbate constipation (posterior rectal mobilization, transection of the lateral ligaments during suture rectopexy, or levatorplasty during a perineal proctectomy). Because many patients with fecal incontinence secondary to prolapse improve once prolapse is treated, rectal prolapse should be corrected as a first step in patients reporting rectal prolapse and fecal incontinence; decreased pudendal nerve terminal motor latencies may have postoperative prognostic significance with higher rates of incontinence after correction, and constipation-inducing maneuvers such as transection of the lateral ligaments during suture rectopexy may be beneficial in these situations.
