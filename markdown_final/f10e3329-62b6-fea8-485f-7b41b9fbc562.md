## Question

What is macrobid uti regimen

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the Macrobid (nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals) regimen for urinary tract infection, including dose, duration, indications, special populations, and stewardship considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug identity and formulation. Then, I should verify the labeled indication and scope. Next, I will confirm the standard adult dosing and duration, and whether a 5-day course is acceptable. After that, I need to check pediatric use, pregnancy considerations, and renal function thresholds. I will then review administration instructions, drug interactions, and expected efficacy. Finally, I should align this with guideline-based stewardship and summarize a practical regimen with caveats and alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the drug and formulation. Macrobid is nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals, a macrocrystalline formulation designed to improve gastrointestinal tolerability compared with older formulations, and it is indicated for acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (acute cystitis) in adults and children aged 12 years and older [^77c4f744] [^b6757566].

> I need to verify the labeled indication and scope. Macrobid is indicated only for acute uncomplicated cystitis due to susceptible Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus saprophyticus; it is not indicated for pyelonephritis, perinephric abscess, or prostatitis because it lacks adequate tissue penetration beyond the lower urinary tract, so I should be careful not to overextend its use [^77c4f744] [^1c43c883].

> Next, I should confirm the standard adult regimen. The FDA labeling specifies 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, and controlled trials summarized in the label show approximately 75% microbiologic eradication of susceptible pathogens with this regimen, which aligns with clinical experience of high efficacy when the organism is susceptible [^2369acfe] [^bcd104fe].

> Wait, let me verify whether a 5-day course is acceptable. Contemporary guidelines and high-quality evidence support a 5-day nitrofurantoin regimen as an effective alternative, with randomized data showing comparable outcomes to 7 days and guideline endorsements listing 5 days as a valid option; thus, 100 mg twice daily for 5 days is reasonable in many nonpregnant adult women with uncomplicated cystitis, though I should still anchor to 7 days when clinical judgment favors a longer course or when patient-specific factors warrant it [^f16cf599] [^1cb36793] [^4f91305f].

> I will now examine pediatric use. The FDA labeling allows use in children aged 12 years and older at the same 100 mg twice daily for 7 days regimen; for children under 12 years, macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin) is dosed at 5–7 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours, but I should confirm that Macrobid itself is not labeled for children under 12, so I should not substitute Macrobid dosing in younger children [^d2d08961] [^570b99b1] [^b6757566].

> Hold on, I should verify pregnancy considerations. Nitrofurantoin is commonly used in pregnancy for lower-tract UTIs, and observational implementation data show adoption of Macrobid 100 mg twice daily for 7 days as first-line in pregnant patients with adjustments based on susceptibilities and test-of-cure, which supports its use in pregnancy when appropriate, though I need to ensure no concern for pyelonephritis or systemic involvement before choosing it [^fd128b1d].

> Next, I should review renal function thresholds. I initially thought the contraindication was creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min, but wait, let me verify the evidence base. The FDA labeling has long cautioned against use with significant renal impairment, yet the best available evidence suggests the concern is largely theoretical and driven by reduced urinary concentrations; a careful review concludes that data supporting a hard cutoff of 60 mL/min are weak, and many clinicians accept use down to about 40 mL/min for short courses, balancing efficacy and safety, so I should individualize and avoid prolonged therapy in reduced renal function rather than apply a rigid cutoff [^a0240734].

> I need to ensure proper administration and interactions. Macrobid should be taken with food to improve absorption and tolerability, and patients should avoid antacids containing magnesium trisilicate because they reduce absorption; uricosuric agents like probenecid can increase serum levels and toxicity while decreasing urinary levels, so they should generally be avoided with nitrofurantoin [^1ca6fc2a] [^d63a048e].

> Let me consider expected efficacy and resistance. Macrobid achieves roughly 75% microbiologic eradication in controlled trials, and real-world data show low and stable resistance rates to nitrofurantoin despite widespread use, which supports its role as a first-line empiric option in many communities; however, I should confirm local resistance patterns and prior isolate histories before choosing it empirically [^bcd104fe] [^b93136a9] [^204d9e22].

> I should double-check stewardship alignment. IDSA and contemporary guidance endorse nitrofurantoin as a first-line agent for uncomplicated cystitis, with 5–7 day courses reasonable, and emphasize avoiding agents with high local resistance or excessive collateral damage; this reinforces choosing Macrobid when susceptibility is likely and avoiding it when there is suspicion for upper-tract disease or in settings of high local resistance to this agent [^4fa57258] [^4f91305f] [^e3a44ad6].

> But wait, what if the patient has recurrent UTI or atypical features. In women with recurrent UTI, short-course nitrofurantoin remains appropriate for acute cystitis episodes, and guidelines advise treating for as short a duration as reasonable, generally no more than 7 days; for patients with treatment failure, prior resistant isolates, or atypical presentations, I should obtain a urine culture before treating and tailor therapy accordingly rather than repeatedly empiric treating [^faf97b34] [^4f91305f].

> Let me synthesize a practical regimen. For a nonpregnant adult woman with acute uncomplicated cystitis and no contraindications, prescribe Macrobid 100 mg orally twice daily for 5–7 days, preferably with food, avoid magnesium trisilicate antacids, and counsel on completing the full course; if symptoms persist beyond 48–72 hours or worsen, reassess for resistant organisms, alternative diagnoses, or progression to upper-tract disease and obtain a urine culture to guide therapy [^2369acfe] [^1cb36793] [^4f91305f].

> Finally, I should confirm alternatives and when to avoid Macrobid. If there is suspicion for pyelonephritis, prostatitis, or systemic involvement, or if the patient has significant renal impairment where urinary concentrations may be inadequate, choose an agent with broader tissue distribution and adjust based on culture results; fosfomycin or TMP-SMX are reasonable first-line alternatives depending on local resistance and patient factors, and fluoroquinolones are generally reserved due to resistance and adverse effect concerns unless guided by susceptibility or intolerance to preferred agents [^4fa57258] [^4f91305f] [^e3a44ad6].

---

The standard Macrobid regimen for uncomplicated UTIs is **100 mg orally twice daily for 5–7 days** [^2369acfe] [^1cb36793], with 5 days favored for most patients to balance efficacy and tolerability [^f16cf599]. Take each dose with food to improve absorption and reduce GI upset [^1ca6fc2a]; avoid use if creatinine clearance is < 30 mL/min [^notfound] or if there is suspected pyelonephritis [^77c4f744]. Monitor for pulmonary, hepatic, and hematologic adverse effects, and obtain urine culture if symptoms persist or recur [^4f91305f].

---

## Indications

Macrobid is indicated for **acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs)** — also known as acute cystitis — caused by susceptible strains of Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus saprophyticus [^77c4f744]. It is not indicated for treatment of pyelonephritis, perinephric abscesses, or other complicated UTIs [^1c43c883].

---

## Standard dosing regimen

The **recommended dosing regimen** for Macrobid is:

| **Patient population** | **Dosage** | **Frequency** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Adults (including adolescents ≥ 12 years) | 100 mg | Every 12 hours (twice daily) | 5–7 days [^1cb36793] [^e3a44ad6] |
| Children < 12 years | Not recommended | Not recommended | Not recommended |

---

The **5-day regimen is generally preferred** for its favorable balance of efficacy and tolerability, although a 7-day regimen may be considered in certain clinical scenarios [^f16cf599] [^1cb36793].

---

## Administration instructions

- **With food**: Macrobid should be taken with food to enhance absorption and reduce gastrointestinal side effects [^1ca6fc2a].
- **Swallow whole**: Capsules should be swallowed whole and not crushed or chewed.
- **Complete course**: Patients should complete the full course of therapy even if symptoms improve before completion [^1ca6fc2a].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Macrobid demonstrates high clinical and microbiological cure rates for uncomplicated UTIs. Clinical trials report **microbiological eradication rates of approximately 75%** for susceptible pathogens [^bcd104fe]. Comparative studies have shown that a 5-day regimen of nitrofurantoin is as effective as a 3-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for acute uncomplicated cystitis [^f16cf599].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Macrobid is generally well tolerated. Common adverse effects include gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), headache, and mild hypersensitivity reactions. Serious adverse effects — such as pulmonary toxicity, hepatotoxicity, and hematologic abnormalities — are rare but require monitoring [^notfound].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

- **Renal impairment**: Macrobid is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 30 mL/min due to reduced urinary concentrations and increased risk of toxicity [^notfound].
- **Pregnancy**: Macrobid is generally considered safe during pregnancy, except near term (labor and delivery) due to the risk of neonatal hemolytic anemia.
- **Hypersensitivity**: Patients with known hypersensitivity to nitrofurantoin should not receive Macrobid.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Routine laboratory monitoring is not required for uncomplicated UTIs treated with Macrobid. However, patients should be advised to return if symptoms persist beyond 48–72 hours or recur shortly after treatment, in which case **urine culture and susceptibility testing** should be performed [^4f91305f].

---

## Comparison with alternative therapies

Macrobid is one of the **first-line agents** for uncomplicated UTIs, alongside TMP-SMX and fosfomycin [^4f91305f]. Its advantages include low resistance rates, minimal impact on normal flora, and a favorable safety profile. However, it is not suitable for patients with renal impairment or suspected pyelonephritis [^77c4f744].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **Standard regimen**: 100 mg orally twice daily for 5–7 days (preferably 5 days) [^1cb36793] [^e3a44ad6].
- **Administration**: Take with food to enhance absorption and reduce GI side effects [^1ca6fc2a].
- **Contraindications**: Avoid in patients with CrCl < 30 mL/min or suspected pyelonephritis [^77c4f744].
- **Monitoring**: No routine labs required; obtain urine culture if symptoms persist or recur [^4f91305f].

---

The Macrobid UTI regimen is **100 mg orally twice daily for 5–7 days** (preferably 5 days), taken with food, and is effective and well tolerated for uncomplicated cystitis caused by susceptible E. coli or S. saprophyticus [^1cb36793] [^e3a44ad6]. Avoid use in renal impairment or suspected pyelonephritis, and monitor for rare serious adverse effects [^77c4f744].

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Macrobid is indicated only for the treatment of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) caused by susceptible strains of Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus saprophyticus.

Nitrofurantoin is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscesses.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Macrobid and other antibacterial drugs, Macrobid should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Nitrofurantoins lack the broader tissue distribution of other therapeutic agents approved for urinary tract infections. Consequently, many patients who are treated with Macrobid are predisposed to persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria. (See CLINICAL STUDIES). Urine specimens for culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained before and after completion of therapy. If persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria occurs after treatment with Macrobid, other therapeutic agents with broader tissue distribution should be selected. In considering the use of Macrobid, lower eradication rates should be balanced against the increased potential for systemic toxicity and for the development of antimicrobial resistance when agents with broader tissue distribution are utilized.

Interventions

AF: The first page of the confidential personalised prescribing tool shows 2019–2020 first-line prescribing patterns for oral antibiotics used to treat uncomplicated lower UTI and the current recommendations for BC. The primary recommendation is to choose nitrofurantoin for empiric treatment of uncomplicated UTI. A second message recommends choosing fosfomycin as first-line therapy for patients who cannot tolerate nitrofurantoin due to allergy or have impaired renal function. A final recommendation advises against prescribing ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and other antibiotics as first-line empiric therapy due to bacterial resistance rates in BC and adverse effects associated with fluoroquinolones. Each message is accompanied by a bar chart depicting the physicians' individual prescribing compared with the average BC FP. The second page of the AF provides supporting evidence for why nitrofurantoin is recommended for empiric treatment of uncomplicated UTI including a graph of 10-year history of E. coli isolates resistance rates by an antibiotic agent from the BC Centre for Disease Control Antimicrobial Resistance Dashboard. It shows escalating resistance to cephalexin over 50%, relative stability of∼40% resistance to amoxicillin, ∼20% resistance to ciprofloxacin and TMP-SMX and low or declining < 10% resistance to nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin. This makes it visually obvious which antibiotic is least likely to be resisted.

The evidence summary describes antimicrobial best practices for the treatment of symptomatic, uncomplicated lower UTI in BC. It recommends diagnosing uncomplicated UTI based on patient symptoms and against routine use of a urine dipstick/urinalysis or urine culture for diagnosing as testing abnormalities increase with age. Empiric treatment with nitrofurantoin (Macrobid 100 mg two times a day or Macrodantin 50 mg four times a day) for 5–7 days is recommended with fosfomycin recommended as an alternative when there is an allergy or intolerance to nitrofurantoin. TMP-SMX, fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams are unsuitable for empiric therapy (unguided by susceptibility profile) in BC due to bacterial resistance. See onlinesupplemental files 1 2 for the sample AF and ES.

IDSA AMR Treatment Guidance — oral and IV/PO options in adults with normal renal and hepatic function — lists dosing for fluoroquinolones and other agents. Ciprofloxacin for uncomplicated cystitis is 400 milligrams IV every 12 h or 500 milligrams PO (enterally) every 12 h, and for all other infections is 400 milligrams IV every 8 h or 750 milligrams PO every 12 h. Levofloxacin for all infections is 750 milligrams IV/PO every 24 h. Nitrofurantoin is macrocrystal/monohydrate (Macrobid) 100 mg PO every 12 h or oral suspension 50 milligrams PO every 6 h. Fosfomycin for uncomplicated cystitis is 3 grams PO as a single dose. Minocycline is 200 milligrams IV/PO every 12 h, and eravacycline is 1 mg/kg per dose IV every 12 h. Tigecycline is 200 mg IV as a single dose, then 100 mg IV every 12 h. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for uncomplicated cystitis is 160 mg (trimethoprim component) IV/PO every 12 h, and for other infections is 10–15 mg/kg/day (trimethoprim component) IV/PO divided every 8 to 12 h.

UTI treatment

The MIST treatment algorithm for positive urine cultures is shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1. UTI was treated in pregnant women with high burden growth (> 10 5 CFU/mL of a uro-pathogen), as well as among women with intermediate growth who had UTI symptoms, as per ACOG recommendations. From January to October 2012, the first line antibiotic treatment was cefixime 400 mg po once daily for 3 days. After observing that only two-thirds of E. coli were susceptible to cefixime, the first-line treatment was then changed to nitrofurantoin (Macrobid) 100 mg po bid for 7 days. All symptomatic women were also referred to the sub-district hospital for further evaluation and management.

A test of cure was obtained 1 week after antibiotic completion for all pregnant women with positive cultures. If the second urine culture remained positive, the supervising field physician prescribed an antibiotic based on the antimicrobial sensitivity pattern. Persistent UTI after twice-repeated treatment was referred to Sylhet Osmani Medical College Hospital for further evaluation and management.

Data analysis

Simple descriptive statistics were used to describe the distribution of uro-pathogens and antibiotic sensitivity patterns.

For the risk factor analysis, the primary outcome was UTI requiring antibiotic treatment, as defined in Table 1. We included a number of socio-demographic characteristics, nutrition, behavior, and reproductive history variables as potential risk factors. Socio-demographic characteristics included household wealth, household size, religion, woman's age at enrollment, parity, and educational attainment of both the woman and her husband. All variables were categorized. A wealth index indicative of relative economic status of the household within the study population was constructed using household facilities and assets weighted with principal component analysis; the households were categorized into quintiles. Comparisons of proportions between groups were analyzed by chi-squared statistic.

Risk factors with p < 0.05 in bivariate analysis were included in multivariate analysis. Logistic regression was performed to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals using STATA version 14.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).

### Medical treatment for urinary tract infections [^72f58a6d]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

### Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals (macrodantin) [^14557fc2]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Macrodantin should be given with food to improve drug absorption and, in some patients, tolerance.

Adults: 50 mg to 100 mg four times a day — the lower dosage level is recommended for uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

Pediatric Patients: 5 mg/kg to 7 mg/kg of body weight per 24 hours, given in four divided doses (contraindicated under one month of age).

Therapy should be continued for one week or for at least 3 days after sterility of the urine is obtained. Continued infection indicates the need for reevaluation.

For long-term suppressive therapy in adults, a reduction of dosage to 50 mg to 100 mg at bedtime may be adequate. For long-term suppressive therapy in pediatric patients, doses as low as 1 mg/kg per 24 hours, given in a single dose or in two divided doses, may be adequate. SEE WARNINGS SECTION REGARDING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-TERM THERAPY.

### Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals (macrodantin) [^a03ea562]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Macrodantin is specifically indicated for the treatment of urinary tract infections when due to susceptible strains of Escherichia coli, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and certain susceptible strains of Klebsiella and Enterobacter species.

Nitrofurantoin is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscesses.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Macrodantin and other antibacterial drugs, Macrodantin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Nitrofurantoins lack the broader tissue distribution of other therapeutic agents approved for urinary tract infections. Consequently, many patients who are treated with Macrodantin are predisposed to persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria. Urine specimens for culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained before and after completion of therapy. If persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria occurs after treatment with Macrodantin, other therapeutic agents with broader tissue distribution should be selected. In considering the use of Macrodantin, lower eradication rates should be balanced against the increased potential for systemic toxicity and for the development of antimicrobial resistance when agents with broader tissue distribution are utilized.

### Nitrofurantoin monohydrate / macrocrystalline (macrobid) [^1ca6fc2a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Information for Patients:

Patients should be advised to take Macrobid with food (ideally breakfast and dinner) to further enhance tolerance and improve drug absorption. Patients should be instructed to complete the full course of therapy; however, they should be advised to contact their physician if any unusual symptoms occur during therapy.

Patients should be advised not to use antacid preparations containing magnesium trisilicate while taking Macrobid.

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Macrobid should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Macrobid is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Macrobid or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

General:

Prescribing Macrobid in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Drug Interactions:

Antacids containing magnesium trisilicate, when administered concomitantly with nitrofurantoin, reduce both the rate and extent of absorption. The mechanism for this interaction probably is adsorption of nitrofurantoin onto the surface of magnesium trisilicate.

Uricosuric drugs, such as probenecid and sulfinpyrazone, can inhibit renal tubular secretion of nitrofurantoin. The resulting increase in nitrofurantoin serum levels may increase toxicity, and the decreased urinary levels could lessen its efficacy as a urinary tract antibacterial.

### Which treatment strategy for women with symptoms of urinary tract infection? [^1f9da0ec]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

In patients with severe and persistent symptoms, microbiological examination of urine can help the GP to identify the micro-organisms causing the infection. In Nordic countries, many GPs have direct access to point of care testing such as urine phase contrast microscopy, culture, and direct susceptibility testing to identify patients who need antibiotic treatment. In the study by Gágyor and colleagues, only a third of patients with uncomplicated UTI needed antibiotics during the four weeks of follow-up, so a strategy of delayed prescription for patients with light to moderate symptoms might also be a feasible strategy. We need trials of delayed prescriptions for UTI. Delayed prescribing has been shown to reduce antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory tract infections by 50–70%.(this is same sentence repeated in adifferent way!)

### Compliance to international guidelines and rational use of antibiotics in urinary tract infections in a country without national guidance: a cross-sectional study [^5311e3c1]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in humans. Women are significantly more affected than men: one in three women will have at least one episode of UTI by the age of 24, and roughly 50% of women will experience a UTI in their lifetime.

UTIs are classified according to the site of infection (pyelonephritis, cystitis, urethritis and prostatitis) and the presence of risk factors for complications. While asymptomatic UTIs are left untreated in most cases according to guidelines, the high incidence of symptomatic UTIs that require antibiotics (ATBs) emphasises the need to ensure appropriate therapy with agents that maximise success and minimise the risk of resistance.

According to the WHO, rational drug use requires that patients receive drugs appropriate to their clinical condition, in doses that suit their needs, for an adequate period of time and at the lowest cost for themselves and their community.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: As a result of the presence of nitrofurantoin, a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur. This has been observed with Benedict's and Fehling's solutions but not with the glucose enzymatic test.

### Insights into durability against resistance from the antibiotic nitrofurantoin [^b93136a9]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2024). Medium credibility.

The escalating spread of antimicrobial resistance poses a considerable challenge to global public health. For the majority of antibiotics, resistance usually emerges within a decade of its first clinical use. However, nitrofurantoin stands out as an exception to this trend, as rates of resistance have remained low, despite high frequency of usage as a treatment for urinary tract infections (UTIs). Lessons learned from nitrofurantoin's robustness could prove useful in the attempt to develop other antibiotic treatment strategies that are durable against resistance.

Nitrofurantoin is a synthetic antibiotic, originally patented in 1952 by Eaton Laboratories in Norwich, New York, USA. It first entered clinical use in 1953 and was marketed under the brand names Furadantin, Macrobid, and Macrodantin. Though its mechanism of action was not completely understood at the time, it was known to affect metabolism through inhibition of bacterial enzymes and to interfere with cell wall synthesis, among other effects. Nitrofurantoin's broad-spectrum activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including common uropathogens Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. made it particularly effective, and it quickly became widely used for the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs. However, some less common uropathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus spp. were recognised to be intrinsically resistant.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:

Macrodantin should be given with food to improve drug absorption and, in some patients, tolerance.

Adults: 50–100 mg four times a day — the lower dosage level is recommended for uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

Pediatric Patients: 5–7 mg/kg of body weight per 24 hours, given in four divided doses (contraindicated under one month of age).

Therapy should be continued for one week or for at least 3 days after sterility of the urine is obtained. Continued infection indicates the need for reevaluation.

For long-term suppressive therapy in adults, a reduction of dosage to 50–100 mg at bedtime may be adequate. For long-term suppressive therapy in pediatric patients, doses as low as 1 mg/kg per 24 hours, given in a single dose or in two divided doses, may be adequate.

### Management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in the post-antibiotic era: select non-antibiotic approaches [^7806f6ca]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Given the high frequency of patients presenting with urinary tract infections (UTIs) and the ensuing high degree of antibiotic prescription, UTI is a critical point of intervention for non-antibiotic treatments to curb the further development of antimicrobial resistance and provide risk-appropriate care for patients.

Objectives

To highlight several select non-antibiotic therapies for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI and relevant indications (prevention and complicated UTI) from recent literature.

Sources

PubMed, Google Scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched for clinical trials published in the English language corresponding to non-antibiotic treatments for UTI.

Content

The focus of this narrative review centres on a limited number of non-antibiotic therapies for the treatment of UTI based on (a) herbal extracts or (b) antibacterial strategies (e.g. bacteriophage therapy and D-mannose). The experience of treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is also used to fuel discussion on the risk of developing pyelonephritis without antibiotics-compared with the projected harms of continuing their widespread use.

Implications

Non-antibiotic treatment strategies for UTI have shown varying results in clinical trials, and the current evidence does not yet indicate a clear, better alternative to antibiotics. However, the collective experience with non-antibiotic treatments suggests that there is a need to weigh the actual benefits/risks of unfettered, non-culture-confirmed antibiotic use in uncomplicated UTI. Given the different mechanisms of action of proposed alternatives, more in-depth knowledge on microbiological and pathophysiological factors influencing UTI susceptibility and prognostic indicators are highly needed to stratify patients most likely to benefit. The feasibility of alternatives in clinical practice should also be considered.

### Nitrofurantoin, macrocrystalline (macrodantin) [^893a744c]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE:

Macrodantin is specifically indicated for the treatment of urinary tract infections when due to susceptible strains of Escherichia coli, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and certain susceptible strains of Klebsiella and Enterobacter species.

Nitrofurantoin is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscesses.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Macrodantin and other antibacterial drugs, Macrodantin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Nitrofurantoins lack the broader tissue distribution of other therapeutic agents approved for urinary tract infections. Consequently, many patients who are treated with Macrodantin are predisposed to persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria. Urine specimens for culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained before and after completion of therapy. If persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria occurs after treatment with Macrodantin, other therapeutic agents with broader tissue distribution should be selected. In considering the use of Macrodantin, lower eradication rates should be balanced against the increased potential for systemic toxicity and for the development of antimicrobial resistance when agents with broader tissue distribution are utilized.

Discussion

In this cohort study, using a large, contemporary clinical dataset, we demonstrate that IDSA guidelines for treatment of uncomplicated UTI remain robust in terms of both effectiveness and adverse events, despite major changes in the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance. Unless a patient has a history of drug resistance or intolerance or lives in a region where local rates of resistance are high, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole remain the treatments of choice. We replicated our domain expert–derived results with an automated feature building package applied to a common data model, thereby supporting the hypothesis that complex causal inference analyses combined with careful cohort selection can be semiautomatable. This will help promote reproducibility of our findings in other health systems and opens inquiry into other important clinical questions.

We observed a small increase in rates of revisits for patients receiving fluoroquinolone therapy compared with those receiving first-line antibiotics. This result is surprising because fluoroquinolones are thought to be equivalent or superior to nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in terms of clinical effectiveness. The differences were limited to outpatients with a diagnosis of lower UTI and were much less pronounced for inpatients, suggesting that the benefit of first-line treatments is restricted to classic presentations of uncomplicated UTI. Follow-up visits soon after treatment may be the result of drug intolerance, toxic effects, or selection of a drug to which an organism is resistant. The latter may be a possible explanation for why people treated with nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole had fewer revisits. Recent workhas suggested that rates of resistance to nitrofurantoin remain low, despite its widespread use, and may be due to a high barrier to resistance. Although resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is more common, clinicians are less likely to use this drug on the basis of IDSA guidancethat recommends avoiding it when rates of local resistance exceed 20%, which is a common scenario throughout the US. In contrast, resistance to fluoroquinolones is most often mediated by the accumulation of variants in a single gene, often in response to antibiotic exposure. Given the high rate of fluoroquinolone prescription in the community, this may increase the risk for prescribing an agent to which the organism is resistant. This is further complicated by the fact that uncomplicated UTI is often managed over telephone and without culture data. Finally, given that prescribers are prone to prescribe the same antibiotic, the impact of prior exposure may be more likely to lead to selection of resistance if that antibiotic is a fluoroquinolone and the patients are otherwise healthy outpatients with a low risk for colonization by drug-resistant organisms.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^0845abca]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, ranking as the second most frequent indication for antibiotic prescribing in the outpatient setting. The majority of UTIs are "uncomplicated", occurring in non-pregnant adult women who are not immunocompromised and have normal genitourinary structure and function. Each year, 12.6% of women will have a UTI, and half of all women will have at least one UTI by age 32. The standard of care for uncomplicated UTI is oral antibiotic therapy, which typically leads to rapid symptom resolution and reduces the risk of complications such as pyelonephritis.

In recent years, growing antibiotic resistance has led to efforts to use antibiotics more judiciously. Specifically for uncomplicated UTIs, these initiatives have sought to reduce the amount — either duration or frequency — and spectrum of antibiotics. – Interviews with women indicate willingness to delay or avoid antibiotic prescriptions when safe to do so. Furthermore, some UTIs are self-limited without treatment and thus may not require antibiotic therapy. For example, a randomized controlled trial comparing nitrofurantoin with placebo for uncomplicated UTI demonstrated spontaneous symptomatic cure or improvement in over half of participants receiving placebo who had UTIs as proven by a combination of symptoms/signs and positive laboratory testing. While a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials found placebo to be inferior to antibiotics for resolution of UTI symptoms, it is unclear whether non-antibiotic treatment regimens for uncomplicated UTIs may be feasible as an outpatient antibiotic stewardship strategy. For example, cranberry extract was initially considered a potential antibiotic-sparing option; however, subsequent research has not supported its use in the treatment of UTI over antibiotics.

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^402463ca]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Up to 50% of women will experience a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, making it the third most common indication for antibiotic treatment in the US after respiratory tract infection and skin and soft-tissue infections. Treatment guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2011 encouraged the use of nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line treatments for uncomplicated UTI on the basis of their effectiveness and relatively limited adverse event profile. Fluoroquinolones are listed as an alternative option because of their predilection for selecting for multidrug-resistant organismsand their association with serious adverse events, including Clostridium difficile colitis. Despite this, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are still the most commonly used antibiotics in the treatment of UTI, which may reflect the real or perceived threat of antibiotic resistance to the first-line agents. The guidelines list β-lactams as an inferior alternative because they are associated with reduced treatment effectiveness.

The evidence supporting the IDSA treatment guidelines is based on a small number of randomized clinical trials and observational studies, many of which were completed several decades ago. Although those studies provided important information for policymaking, they were limited in terms of the diversity of patients they recruited and were performed at a time when standards of care and health care–seeking behavior differed greatly from current practice. Furthermore, the pathogen strains in circulation at the time of these studies have likely been replaced by new strains that may have a differential response to drug therapies, regardless of their susceptibility phenotype. Therefore, a re-evaluation of management strategies for uncomplicated UTI could provide useful information for treating clinicians and policymakers. In this study, we sought to estimate treatment effectiveness and adverse events for guideline-concordant and guideline-discordant treatments for UTI using causal inference supported by machine learning applied to a large contemporary claims dataset.

### Nitrofurantoin contraindication in patients with a creatinine clearance below 60 mL / min: looking for the evidence [^a0240734]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the evidence leading to nitrofurantoin contraindication in patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) below 60 mL/min.

Data Sources

Literature was searched in PubMed (1965-June 2012) by using the key words and MeSH terms urinary tract infections-drug therapy, chronic kidney insufficiency, kidney diseases, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy, combined with nitrofurantoin. Articles were limited to the English language. References from the identified studies, Food and Drug Administration-approved product information packets, drug information resources, and pharmacology books were also reviewed.

Data Synthesis

The contraindication of nitrofurantoin in patients with a CrCl below 60 mL/min was included in the product information packets sometime between 1988 and 2003. The 1988 Macrodantin product information indicated a CrCl cutoff level of 40 mL/min, but the current contraindication of less than 60 mL/min is found in the 2003 Macrobid product information. It is unclear when and why this change occurred, but it may have followed the work of Sachs and colleagues in 1968, who reported very little drug recovery in the urine of patients with a CrCl below 60 mL/min. This and previous studies have several and severe limitations, such as the inclusion of a small number of patients, an undefined or poorly defined method to determine CrCl and renal impairment, measurement of amounts of nitrofurantoin excreted in the urine instead of urinary concentrations, and most importantly, a lack of clinical efficacy end points. More recently, a chart review on clinical cure of urinary tract infections treated with nitrofurantoin provided grounds for further investigations on the utility of this drug for patients with a CrCl of 60 mL/min or lower. Concerns of increased risks of serious adverse reactions in patients with reduced renal function have further limited the use of nitrofurantoin. However, although not completely clear, these complications seem to be linked most often to prolonged treatment, genetic variability, and predisposition to hypersensitivity.

Conclusions

Data supporting the contraindication of nitrofurantoin for patients with a CrCl less than 60 mL/min are nonexistent. Well-designed clinical trials with urinary concentration information and clinical end points on patients with various degrees of renal impairment are much needed. Until such a study becomes available, the limited data available would support considering using this drug in patients with a CrCl of 40 mL/min or higher.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^dd9942a8]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated UTI with Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course (7 days) of antimicrobial therapy rather than a longer course (14 days) (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence). An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy.

### Duration of antibacterial treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^85c92aa4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease, occurring frequently in young sexually active women. In the past, seven day antibiotic therapy was recommended while the current practice is to treat uncomplicated UTI for three days.

Objectives

TO compare the efficacy and safety of three-day antibiotic therapy to multi-day therapy (five days or longer) on relief of symptoms and bacteriuria at short-term and long-term follow-up.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2004), the Cochrane Renal Group's Register of trials (July 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2003), and MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2003) were searched. We scanned references of all included studies and contacted the first or corresponding author of included trials and the pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing three-days oral antibiotic therapy with multi-day therapy (five days and longer) for uncomplicated cystitis in 18 to 65 years old non-pregnant women without signs of upper UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data concerning bacteriological and symptomatic failure rates, occurrence of pyelonephritis and adverse effects were extracted independently by two reviewers. Relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Outcomes were also extracted by intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

Thirty-two trials (9605 patients) were included. For symptomatic failure rates, no difference between three-day and 5–10 day antibiotic regimen was seen short-term (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.28) and long-term follow-up (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.27). Comparison of the bacteriological failure rates showed that three-day therapy was less effective than 5–10 day therapy for the short-term follow-up, however this difference was observed only in the subgroup of trials that used the same antibiotic in the two treatment arms (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.74, P = 0.01). This difference was more significant at long-term follow-up (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.73, P = 0.0002). Adverse effects were significantly more common in the 5–10 day treatment group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93, P = 0.0010). Results were consistent for subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

Three days of antibiotic therapy is similar to 5–10 days in achieving symptomatic cure during uncomplicated UTI treatment, while the longer treatment is more effective in obtaining bacteriological cure. In spite of the higher rate of adverse effects, treatment for 5–10 days could be considered for treatment of women in whom eradication of bacteriuria is important.

Self-treatment with antibiotics for recurrent UTI — Self-treatment can be paired with standing physician orders for urine culture before and possibly after treatment, but compared with continuous prophylaxis it is associated with a higher rate of infection (2.2 UTI per year vs 0.2 UTI per year). Self-treatment is an option for women with the ability to reliably recognize UTI symptoms and start antibiotics, those not suitable for long-term prophylaxis, or those who do not wish to take long-term therapy, and patients should contact their clinician if symptoms progress or fail to resolve within 48 hours. Fluoroquinolones are not preferred agents for self-treatment regimens, and we recommend use of other agents whenever possible.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^fc1d9dae]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

### The best rules for antimicrobial stewardship in urogenital tract infections [^5b3f0c5f]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) belong to the most common community-acquired and nosocomial infections, but therapy of UTIs is limited by resistance of pathogens and nonoptimal using of antibacterials. Narrative review of recent (2020–2018) literature dedicated to antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) in urological infections has been done.

Recent Findings

Analysis of recent 64 articles has shown following principles of AMS for UTIs: selecting the correct drug, correct dose, and shortest clinically effective duration of therapy whenever possible, is a base for optimal antimicrobial stewardship; symptomatic UTIs should be treated with antimicrobials to alleviate symptoms, and in the case of more serious infection, to prevent complications; in both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, quantitative culture is the gold standard for diagnosis; we have to avoid prescriptions of antibiotics when possible; we have to follow European and National Guidelines; we must avoid prescription of fluoroquinolones as empiric therapy for UTIs by many reasons, one of these is urogenital tuberculosis; the choice of antibiotic for UTI should be based on local level of resistance of uropathogens.

Summary

Studies of antimicrobial stewardship in urology are limited. Nevertheless, there are some golden rules, which may help to reduce inappropriate use of antimicrobials, improve patient outcomes, reduce side effects of antibiotic therapy, decrease the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant infections, as well as decrease total costs of the therapy.

### Treatment of bacterial urinary tract infections: presence and future [^2aca5aa2]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequent infections in the outpatient as well as in the nosocomial setting. The stratification into uncomplicated and complicated UTIs has proven to be clinically useful. Bacterial virulence factors on the one side and the integrity of the host defense mechanisms on the other side determine the course of the infection. In uncomplicated UTIs Escherichia coli is the leading organism, whereas in complicated UTIs the bacterial spectrum is much broader including Gram-negative and Gram-positive and often multiresistant organisms. The therapy of uncomplicated UTIs is almost exclusively antibacterial, whereas in complicated UTIs the complicating factors have to be treated as well. There are two predominant aims in the antimicrobial treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs: (i) rapid and effective response to therapy and prevention of recurrence of the individual patient treated; (ii) prevention of emergence of resistance to antimicrobial chemotherapy in the microbial environment. The main drawback of current antibiotic therapies is the emergence and rapid increase of antibiotic resistance. To combat this development several strategies can be followed. Decrease the amount of antibiotics administered, optimal dosing, prevention of infection and development of new antibiotic substances. The aim of this review is to highlight the current and to describe future treatment options for UTIs.

### D-mannose for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection among women: a randomized clinical trial [^f274c439]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the proportion of women experiencing at least 1 further episode of clinically suspected UTI for which they contacted ambulatory care (including primary care, emergency departments, hospitals, ambulance services, and out-of-hours primary care) within 6 months of randomization established via primary care record review. This outcome was chosen after discussion with women with lived experience of rUTI as the most important indicator of symptom burden, which prophylaxis would aim to avoid. In primary care, microbiological confirmation is not generally relied on for guiding initial antibiotic prescribing and in up to one-third of cases will be inconclusive.

Secondary outcomes included number of days of moderately bad (or worse) symptoms of UTI recorded in symptom diaries, time to next consultation with a clinically suspected UTI, number of clinically suspected UTIs, number of microbiologically proven UTIs, number and consumption of antibiotic courses for UTI, defined daily dose and total milligram by antibiotic type, proportion of women with resistant uropathogens cultured during an episode of acute infection, and hospital admissions related to UTI. We documented serious adverse events, excluding hospitalizations for elective procedures. Microbiological outcomes were based on urine samples sent by primary care clinicians for routine care, available on clinical record review. Outcomes including quality of life, health care utilization and acceptability, microbiological analyses using samples provided to our central laboratory, and process evaluation will be reported elsewhere.

Statistical Analysis

A 2016 study evaluating prophylactic treatment for rUTIs in a similar population found that 26.6% of women in the control group experienced a UTI within 6 months. The patient advisory panel for the present study suggested that to commit to daily use of a prophylactic regime they would expect evidence of at least a 50% reduction in the chance of a further UTI during the period of prophylaxis. To detect this with 90% power and an α of.05, we required 203 participants in each group, equating to 508 participants in total with allowance for 20% loss to follow-up. This sample size was also adequate to power the key secondary outcome (the number of UTIs experienced over 6 months) and detect a relative incidence rate of 0.5 between the treatment and placebo groups, assuming a base rate of 0.36 as estimated by Maki et al. Since the withdrawal rate was higher than our anticipated 20% in interim blinded data review, the sample size was increased to 598 to allow for additional withdrawals on November 7, 2019.

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.

### Towards individualised treatment of urinary tract infections [^2097878c]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Supporting individualised dosing by quantifying host-bacteria-drug interactions

Adjusting antimicrobial dosing to improve PK-PD target attainment, using indices such as C max to MIC ratio, results in improved treatment outcomes for patients with UTI. Current PK-PD targets are based on population PK in serum and in-vitro MIC values. They do not consider variations in host factors such as immune response, site of infection, or local changes in pH, which affect both the infectious organism and the drug. For example, nitrofurantoin, a common first line treatment for UTI, demonstrates significantly increased bactericidal activity against common urinary pathogens at lower pH levels. In-vivo PD estimation in urine has limited evidence of applicability to traditional antimicrobial susceptibility testing that is commonly used to guide antimicrobial selection.

TDM has been used to optimise dosing in UTI by measuring drug concentrations in blood, even though drug levels of antimicrobials in urine are typically considerably higher than in serum. For example, amoxicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, has been demonstrated to achieve significantly greater peak urinary concentrations following standard dosing compared to serum. Local urinary concentration will often exceed traditional MIC breakpoints used for antimicrobial susceptibility reporting and may explain observed treatment success in the face of isolates that are reported as resistant

The idea of connecting infection-specific biomarkers to antimicrobial PK to evaluate drug PD is well described. Galactomannan levels have been used to describe voriconazole PD in invasive aspergillosis in children. Urinary biomarkers are frequently used to diagnose UTI, and the quantitative time-course of biomarkers, for example urinary leukocytes, has been shown to predict treatment outcome.

We propose that the origin of well-described UTI biomarkers currently reported is either bacteria- or host-response-specific. Bacteria- and host-response biomarkers measured in urine could facilitate PD estimates for UTI if linked to observed drug exposure during treatment. This renders urine a promising area for the development of simple, non-invasive, longitudinal methods of monitoring and optimising antimicrobial PK-PD in real-time.

Evidence of effectiveness with a well-tolerated, safe product and parent education are needed; a urinary antiseptic that could be taken indefinitely without resistance is particularly desirable, and probiotics are another possible strategy.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^1ec6abc3]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Differences in the pattern of antibiotic prescription profile and recurrence rate for possible urinary tract infections in women with and without diabetes [^fe9da445]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Diabetes is an increasingly important endocrine disease. Incidence of infections is increased in diabetic (type 1 and type 2) patients compared with control subjects, and the urinary tract is the most prevalent site of these infections. Furthermore, diabetic patients with a urinary tract infection (UTI) more often develop severe and rare complications, such as emphysematous cystitis and papillary necrosis. Studies addressing differences in UTI recurrence rates between diabetic patients and control subjects show contradictory results for uncomplicated lower and upper UTIs. Currently, there are no controlled clinical trials investigating the optimal antimicrobial treatment strategy in diabetic patients with UTIs. Current recommendations rely on the opinion of experts. It is generally recommended to treat UTIs in diabetic patients with antibiotics with high tissue penetration for 7–14 days. Importantly, we lack data on the clinical practice of how diabetic patients with a UTI are actually treated, to assess recurrence rates.

The aims of this study are to describe the treatments (duration and agents) for uncomplicated UTIs in women with and without diabetes in the Netherlands and to analyze recurrence rates of these UTIs within 30 days after the last treatment.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^45d011bf]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

The primary endpoint was analyzed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, including all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the study drug (on the eighth day of UTI treatment), and on the per-protocol (PP) population, including all randomized patients who had been given the study drug for a minimum of 24 hours (in case of treatment failure) or who had taken at least 80% of the study drug (in case of clinical cure).

The study sample size was calculated on the basis of a clinical cure rate of 10 percentage points lower at short-term follow-up in the 7-day treatment arm with the assumption of a 90% clinical cure rate in patients treated for 14 days. We adopted 10% as the margin of non-inferiority as suggested previously. As we were only interested in non-inferiority and not in equivalence, the sample size calculation was based on a one-tailed alpha of 0.05. Assuming a non-inferiority margin of 0.10, 1-tailed alpha of 0.05, and a power of 0.90, the required sample size per group was 200. This implies that the 90% confidence interval of a two-tailed χ 2 test should not cross the predefined risk difference of 10% lower clinical cure rate, or equivalently, the one-sided P value is less than the 0.05 significance level. Interim analyses were done after randomization of 100 and 200 patients. After the second interim analysis, there was no reason to stop the trial for safety reasons. However, the principal investigators, who obviously were still blinded with respect to treatment allocation, noted that the overall cure rate was 92%. This is comparable with the results of a recently published similar trial in women comparing 73 to 83 patients treated over 7 or 14 days, respectively. As we had indeed included a larger sample size of 200 patients, we estimated that our study would likely have already met the criteria for non-inferiority while still having a power of 0.80 with a type 1 error of 0.05. As we were confronted with an almost empty budget and a dropping inclusion rate after almost 5 years of participation, we considered continuation of the trial was no longer realistic and thus we decided to stop the trial at this point.

### Urinary tract infections: core curriculum 2024 [^52dde126]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are some of the most commonly encountered infections in clinical practice. Accurate diagnosis and evidence-based treatment of UTIs will lead to better clinical care for many patients and limit unnecessary antibiotic use. Urinalysis and urine cultures are helpful tools in the diagnosis of UTIs; however, it is important to recognize their limitations. Differentiating between asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and true UTI is important because antibiotics are unnecessary in most nonpregnant patients with ASB and can even potentially cause harm if prescribed. Choice and duration of antibiotics varies across the spectrum of UTI syndromes such as acute uncomplicated cystitis, pyelonephritis, prostatitis, and catheter-associated UTIs. The treatment approach also depends on patients' degree of immunosuppression and their genitourinary anatomy. Therefore, patients with urological obstruction or kidney transplants may require a specialized and multidisciplinary management approach. For individuals prone to frequent UTIs, some preventative measures can be utilized, yet there is often not a "one size fits all" approach.

14.8 Complicated Urinary Tract Infections and Acute Pyelonephritis: 10-day Treatment Regimen

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the 250 mg dose, 10 day regimen of levofloxacin, 567 patients with uncomplicated UTI, mild-to-moderate cUTI, and mild-to-moderate AP were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial conducted in the U.S. from June 1993 to January 1995 comparing levofloxacin 250 mg orally once daily for 10 days (285 patients) with ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days (282 patients). Patients with a resistant pathogen, recurrent UTI, women over age 55 years, and with an indwelling catheter were initially excluded, prior to protocol amendment which took place after 30% of enrollment. Microbiological efficacy was measured by bacteriologic eradication of the baseline organism(s) at 1 to 12 days post-therapy in patients with a pathogen identified at baseline.

The bacteriologic cure rates overall for levofloxacin and control at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit for the group of all patients with a documented pathogen at baseline (modified intent to treat or mITT) and the group of patients in the mITT population who closely followed the protocol (Microbiologically Evaluable) are summarized in Table 18.

### Increasing antimicrobial resistance and the management of uncomplicated community-acquired urinary tract infections [^c3dc2c2b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in women. Therapy for these infections is usually begun before results of microbiological tests are known. Furthermore, in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis, empirical therapy without a pretherapy urine culture is often used. The rationale for this approach is based on the highly predictable spectrum of etiologic agents causing UTI and their antimicrobial resistance patterns. However, antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens causing community-acquired UTIs, both cystitis and pyelonephritis, is increasing. Most important has been the increasing resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the current drug of choice for treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women. What implications do these trends have for treatment of community-acquired UTIs? Preliminary data suggest that clinical cure rates may be lower among women with uncomplicated cystitis treated with TMP-SMX when the infecting pathogen is resistant to TMP-SMX. Women with pyelonephritis also have less bacterial eradication and lower clinical cure rates when treated with TMP-SMX for an infection that is resistant to the drug. Therefore, in the outpatient setting, identifying risk factors for TMP-SMX resistance and knowing the prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance in the local community are important steps in choosing an appropriate therapeutic agent. When choosing a treatment regimen, physicians should consider such factors as in vitro susceptibility, adverse effects, cost-effectiveness, and selection of resistant strains. Using a management strategy that takes these variables into account is essential for maintaining the safety and efficacy of treatment for acute UTI.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis [^b58a3adf]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections treated in the outpatient setting and range in severity from minimally symptomatic cystitis to severe septic shock in a wide array of patients. Diagnosis of uncomplicated cystitis can be inferred from history and physical, and confirmed by urinalysis. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should rapidly improve symptoms in all UTIs. Treatment can be further tailored according to severity of illness, analysis of individualized risk factors, and antimicrobial resistance patterns. This article discusses treatment options in light of bacterial resistance in the twenty-first century.

Recommendation 10a — antibiotic duration for acute cystitis episodes in recurrent UTI: Clinicians should treat rUTI patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Supporting evidence includes a review of 15 trials (N = 1,644) where single-dose antibiotics increased short-term (< 2 weeks) bacteriological persistence versus short-course (3 to 6 days; RR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.05 to 3.84; I2 = 36%) or long-course (7 to 14 days; RR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.01 to 3.70; I2 = 31%) therapy, and another review of 32 trials (N = 9,605) showing three-day courses, irrespective of class, increased long-term (4 to 10 weeks) bacteriological failure (RR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.60; I2 = 30%) versus more prolonged (5 to 10 day) therapy, with no differences in short-term (2 to 15 days) bacteriological failure (RR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.44; I2 = 0%).

### Short compared with standard duration of antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^356073e6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To compare the effectiveness of short course (2–4 days) with standard duration oral antibiotic treatment (7–14 days) for urinary tract infection (UTI).

Methods

Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials using a random effects model. Ten trials were eligible, involving 652 children with lower tract UTI recruited from outpatient or emergency departments. Main outcome measures were UTI at the end of treatment, UTI during follow up (recurrent UTI), and urinary pathogens resistant to the treating antibiotic.

Results

There was no significant difference in the frequency of positive urine cultures between the short (2–4 days) and standard duration therapy (7–14 days) for UTI in children at 0–7 days after treatment (eight studies: RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.76) and at 10 days to 15 months after treatment (10 studies: RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.33). There was no significant difference between short and standard duration therapy in the development of resistant organisms in UTI at the end of treatment (one study: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.01) or in recurrent UTI (three studies: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.29).

Conclusion

A 2–4 day course of oral antibiotics is as effective as 7–14 days in eradicating lower tract UTI in children.

### Fluconazole dose recommendation in urinary tract infection [^b36de55b]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify the most appropriate dose of fluconazole for the treatment of symptomatic fungal urinary tract infection (UTI).

Data Sources

Primary literature identified through MEDLINE (1990-June 2000). Key search terms included fluconazole and urinary tract infection.

Data Synthesis

Fluconazole is approved for the treatment of candidal UTIs, but dosage recommendations are not consistent. An evaluation of clinical studies of fluconazole for the treatment of candidal UTI was performed.

Conclusions

Questions remain about the optimal dosing of fluconazole, including the most appropriate dose in non-albicans species of candida as well as the optimal duration of therapy. Until further studies are performed, a fluconazole 200-mg loading dose followed by 100 mg/d for at least four days appears to be the most appropriate dose for the treatment of symptomatic candidal UTI in patients without systemic fungal infection or severe renal failure.

Short-course therapy for uncomplicated acute UTI — Three-day regimens of TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones have comparable effectiveness with 79%–100% and 85%–98% cure rates and are widely accepted when there are no complicating factors. These regimens are as effective for symptomatic relief as longer 5- to 10-day regimens and have improved compliance, decreased costs, and lower adverse reaction rates. The efficacy of 5 days of nitrofurantoin is comparable to 3 days of TMP-SMX, and five days of nitrofurantoin has better efficacy than a 3-day regimen.

Selection of definitive antibiotic therapy for complicated UTI — In patients with confirmed complicated UTI, we suggest selecting a definitive effective antibiotic with a targeted spectrum based on the results of urine culture (identification and susceptibility) as soon as these are available, rather than continuing empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for the complete duration of treatment (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The comment states that this recommendation places a high value on de-escalating antibiotic therapy based on culture results and notes that de-escalation may be less practical in cases of cUTI managed in the outpatient setting.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^3891d814]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Procedures

For participants assigned to antibiotic prophylaxis, the drug used was chosen from nitrofurantoin (50 or 100 mg), trimethoprim (100 mg), or cefalexin (250 mg) given orally once daily, depending on previous urine culture results and individuals' history of allergy or intolerance. Methenamine hippurate was prescribed as a twice daily oral dose (1 g). Participants were allowed to switch between antibiotic drugs or between treatment strategies, however, the need to adhere to the allocated intervention was emphasised. Participants experiencing symptomatic UTI episodes were advised to seek discrete treatment courses of antibiotics in their usual way, typically via their general practitioner.

Follow-up assessments took place every three months until month 18. At each visit, participants were asked about the occurrence of any UTIs, treatment adherence, and adverse events. Information on UTI episodes was confirmed where necessary from healthcare records. Blood samples were taken to monitor kidney and liver function in all participants. Urine samples were submitted to the central laboratory at baseline, at scheduled three monthly visits and at the time of UTI episodes. Optional perineal swabs were submitted at baseline and at six monthly routine visits. Participants completed symptom questionnaires every three months and at the time of symptomatic UTI.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^e1ad4b5e]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

The trial was powered to assess non-inferiority of the absolute difference in UTI incidence over the 12 month treatment period. The non-inferiority margin, defined after a series of patient focus group meetings, was a difference of one UTI episode per year. Two meta-analyses of antibiotic prophylaxis and methenamine hippuratequoted relative risks of UTI versus placebo of 0.15 and 0.24, respectively. With this information, and local audit suggesting that untreated participants had an average of 6.5 UTI episodes/year, we assumed an average incidence rate of 0.975 and 1.56 episodes/year in the antibiotic prophylaxis and methenamine hippurate groups, respectively, equating to an estimated difference of 0.6 episodes/year (in favour of antibiotics). Using a two sample t test, and assuming a difference of 0.6 episodes/year and a standard deviation of 0.9 (based on placebo groups from meta-analyses), we required 87 participants per group to be 90% sure that the lower limit of a one sided 95% confidence interval (equivalently 90% two sided) was above the non-inferiority limit. To account for an estimated 25% attrition rate over the course of the trial, the target sample size was 240.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^29cb5ad6]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — antibiotic prophylaxis evidence synthesis: the systematic review identified 28 trials evaluating antibiotics for prevention of rUTI, most were rated as medium to high risk of bias, and sample sizes ranged from 26 to 308 (total N = 2,758). These trials demonstrated that antibiotics perform better than placebo with consistent results across antibiotics, and the duration of preventive treatment ranged from 6 to 12 months. When comparing prophylactic antibiotic use to placebo or no antibiotics, antibiotics were associated with a decreased likelihood of experiencing ≥ 1 UTI recurrence (11 studies; RR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.37; I2 = 14%; absolute risk difference [ARD]: -46%, 95% CI: -56% to -37%). Because most relevant randomized controlled trials were published prior to 1995, results should be interpreted in light of current resistance patterns.

### A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials comparing short-and long-course antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infections in children [^00006251]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Short-course antibiotic regimens, ranging in duration from a single dose to 3 days, are the current standard of care for the treatment of acute lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) in adult women. Despite multiple small randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) showing no difference in efficacy between short-course (≤ 3 days) and long-course (7–14 days) therapy in children, concerns about occult pyelonephritis and renal scarring have prompted standard recommendations of 7 to 14 days of antibiotics for UTIs in children.

Objective

To determine whether long-course antibiotic therapy is more effective than short-course therapy for the treatment of UTIs in children, and to explore potential sources of heterogeneity in the results of existing studies.

Methods

We searched online bibliographic databases (Medline and Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry) for RCTs comparing short- and long-course therapy for the treatment of UTI in children, and examined the references of all retrieved articles. Candidate studies for meta-analysis were restricted to RCTs comparing short-course (≤ 3 days) and long-course (7–14 days) outpatient therapy for acute UTI in children age 0 to 18 years. We excluded studies that were restricted to children with recurrent UTI or included children with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was evaluated using a 9-item scoring system developed by the investigators. Data on the primary outcomes-treatment failure and reinfection rate-were extracted when available and reanalyzed based on intention to treat whenever possible. To determine whether anatomic level of infection (upper vs lower urinary tract) influenced the results, the meta-analysis was repeated on the subgroup of studies that attempted to restrict their participants to children with lower UTI. To determine whether there was a dose-response effect for the duration of short-course therapy, we performed separate subgroup analyses of studies of single-dose or single-day therapy and studies of 3-day therapy. To explore other potential sources of study result heterogeneity, such as study quality and patient age, we developed a random-effects regression model that included these variables as covariates.

Results

The pooled estimate for the relative risk (RR) of treatment failure with short-course antibiotic therapy was 1.94 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19–3.15) and for the RR of reinfection was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.39–1.47). When we excluded the 3 studies that did not attempt to restrict their participants to patients with lower UTI, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 1.74 (95% CI: 1.05–2.88) and of reinfection was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.32–1.52). For the subgroup of studies comparing single-dose or 1-day therapy to long-course therapy, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 2.73 (95% CI: 1.38–5.40) and of reinfection was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.12–1.18). For the subgroup of studies comparing 3-day therapy to long-course therapy, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 1.36 (95% CI: 0.68–2.72) and of reinfection was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.46–2.13). In the meta-regression, neither study quality nor mean participant age was significantly associated with the odds ratio of treatment failure or reinfection, in either the complete set of studies or the subset of studies restricted to patients with lower UTI.

Conclusions

In pooled analyses of published studies comparing long- and short-course antibiotic treatment of UTI in children, long-course therapy was associated with fewer treatment failures without a concomitant increase in reinfections, even when studies including patients with evidence of pyelonephritis were excluded from the analysis. Until there are more accurate methods for distinguishing upper from lower UTI in children, no additional comparative trials are warranted and clinicians should continue to treat children with UTI for 7 to 14 days.

### Acute uncomplicated UTIs in adults: rapid evidence review [^4f91305f]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

An acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a bacterial infection of the lower urinary tract with no sign of systemic illness or pyelonephritis in a noncatheterized, nonpregnant adult with no urologic abnormalities or immunocompromise. In women, a self-diagnosis of a UTI with the presence of typical symptoms (e.g., frequency, urgency, dysuria/burning sensation, nocturia, suprapubic pain), without vaginal discharge, is accurate enough to diagnose an uncomplicated UTI without further testing. Urine culture and susceptibility testing should be reserved for women with recurrent infection, treatment failure, history of resistant isolates, or atypical presentation to make a definitive diagnosis and guide antibiotic selection. First-line antibiotics include nitrofurantoin for five days, fosfomycin in a single dose, trimethoprim for three days, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for three days. Symptomatic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and delayed antibiotics may be considered because the risk of complications is low. Increased fluids, intake of cranberry products, and methenamine hippurate can prevent recurrent infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis is also effective in preventing recurrence but has a risk of adverse effects and antimicrobial resistance. Men with lower UTI symptoms should always receive antibiotics, with urine culture and susceptibility results guiding the antibiotic choice. Clinicians should also consider the possibility of urethritis and prostatitis in men with UTI symptoms. First-line antibiotics for men with uncomplicated UTI include trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin for seven days. Uncomplicated UTIs in nonfrail women and men 65 years and older with no relevant comorbidities also necessitate a urine culture with susceptibility testing to adjust the antibiotic choice after initial empiric treatment; first-line antibiotics and treatment durations do not differ from those recommended for younger adults.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^fcad96c4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common in elderly patients. Authors of non systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7 to 14 days) for older women, but the evidence for such recommendations is unclear.

Objectives

To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTI in elderly women.

Search Strategy

We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies, screened reference lists of identified articles, reviews and books, and searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International and Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings without language restriction. Date of most recent search: 7 May 2008.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTIs in elderly women were included. Whenever possible we obtained outcome data for older women included in studies with a broader age range. We excluded patients with fever, flank pain or complicating factors; studies with treatment durations longer than 14 days and prevention studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

The two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Fifteen studies (1644 elderly women) were included. Three studies compared single dose with short-course treatment (3 to 6 days), six compared single dose with long-course treatment (7 to 14 days) and six compared short- with long-course treatment. Methodological quality of all studies was low except for a more recent geriatric study. There was a significant difference for persistent UTI between single dose and short-course treatment (RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.84) and single versus long-course treatment (RR 1.93, 1.01 to 3.70 95% CI), in the short-term (< 2 weeks post-treatment) but not at long-term follow-up or on clinical outcomes. Patients preferred single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.88) to long-course treatments, but this was based on one study comparing different antibiotics. Short versus longer treatments showed no significant difference in efficacy. Rate of adverse drug reactions increased significantly with longer treatment durations in only one study.

Authors' Conclusions

Short-course treatment (3 to 6 days) could be sufficient for treating uncomplicated UTIs in elderly women, although more studies on specific commonly prescribed antibiotics are needed.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^ba7fc8c1]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

For the primary outcome, the incidence rate in each group was the total number of UTI episodes divided by the total follow-up (exposure) time, reported with 95% confidence intervals calculated using a resampling procedure (bootstrap). The absolute difference between groups was calculated and reported with a 90% bootstrap confidence interval. Non-inferiority would be concluded if the upper limit of the confidence interval was below one UTI episode/year. We estimated relative treatment differences using a negative binomial model with follow-up time included as an exposure variable, recruiting centre as a random effect, and baseline stratification factors (menopausal status and prior UTI frequency) as fixed effects. This model yielded an estimate of the incidence rate ratio, presented with a 95% confidence interval.

Sensitivity analyses excluded days when participants took therapeutic antibiotics for UTI from the follow-up time. We analysed a binary indicator of at least one UTI episode using a mixed effects logistic regression model adjusted for centre and baseline stratification factors. Analyses were primarily conducted in a modified intention-to-treat population, which included all participants observed for at least six months, because these participants were assumed to provide a reliable estimate of UTI incidence. Prespecified sensitivity analyses were conducted in intention-to-treat and per protocol populations (participants achieving ≥ 90% adherence with preventive treatment; switching between treatment strategies was considered adherent). We also conducted a post hoc sensitivity analysis in a strict per protocol population that included only those participants achieving ≥ 90% adherence with initially randomised treatment.

Symptomatically diagnosed UTI incidence in the post-treatment period and microbiologically confirmed UTIs were analysed as for the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle and included all participants with data available. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria and antibiotic resistance were compared by χ 2 or Fisher's exact tests. These analyses are considered exploratory and should be interpreted with caution. We made no adjustments for multiple testing. Domain scores of the treatment satisfaction questionnaire for drug treatment were compared between groups using a two sample t test and an analysis of covariance model adjusted for baseline stratification factors. To account for switching between treatment strategies, adverse events were reported according to treatment received at the time with data summarised by numbers of participants receiving each intervention. All analyses were conducted using Stata version 16. Independent trial steering and data monitoring committees had oversight throughout the trial. The trial was registered with the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN70219762).

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^8f9c6ae6]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) is defined as repeated UTI with a frequency of at least two episodes in the preceding six months or three episodes in the past year. Acute UTI is most often uncomplicated cystitis and occurs in 50–80% of women in the general population. About one in four women with one UTI episode will go on to develop frequent recurrences, representing a substantial global healthcare problem. An economic analysis from the US described UTI as accounting for more than 6.8 million consultations, 1.3 million emergency department visits, and 245 000 hospital admissions with an annual cost of more than US$2.4bn (£1.8bn; €2.1bn). National and international guidelines acknowledge the need for preventive strategies, and those from the UK, Europe, and US strongly recommend the use of daily, low dose antibiotics as the standard prophylactic treatment for recurrent UTI.

The urgent need for demonstration of effective non-antibiotic treatments is underlined by the UK antimicrobial resistance strategy, which comments that "we are heading rapidly towards a world in which our antibiotics no longer work" and recommends a "strong focus on infection prevention". One aim of this strategy is to reduce antimicrobial use in people by 15% before 2024; to achieve that, exploration of non-antibiotic preventive treatments in common conditions such as UTI is essential. Methenamine hippurate is one such non-antibiotic treatment, which is hydrolysed to formaldehyde in acidic environments such as the distal tubules of the kidney. Formaldehyde is bacteriocidal and works by denaturing bacterial proteins and nucleic acids.

Methenamine hippurate has been evaluated in previous Cochrane systematic reviews, which concluded that "methenamine hippurate may be effective for preventing UTI" but recognised the "need for further large well-conducted RCTs [randomised controlled trials] to clarify". This study aimed to determine whether methenamine hippurate was an effective alternative to the standard treatment of low dose antibiotics for prophylaxis in women with recurrent UTI in a routine clinical setting. We tested the null hypotheses that methenamine hippurate was inferior to daily antibiotics for the prevention of recurrent UTI in women.

Main outcome measures

The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit (short-term clinical cure). Clinical cure was defined as being alive with absence of fever and resolution of UTI symptoms (either absence of symptoms or at least 2 points improvement on a 0–5 point severity score scale), without additional antimicrobial therapy (for relapse of UTI). Secondary outcome measures were bacteriological cure through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit, clinical cure rate through the 70- to 84-day post-treatment visit (cumulative clinical cure), all-cause mortality, adverse event rate determined at 10–18 days and 70–84 days post-treatment, and rate of UTI relapses. In addition, outcome measures were analyzed as stratified by specific predefined subgroups (men, patients with complicated UTI, older age, patients with bacteremic UTI). Bacteriologic cure was defined as eradication of the study entry uropathogen with no recurrence of bacteriuria (pathogen growth < 10 4 CFU/mL in women or < 10 3 CFU/mL in men of a midstream urine culture combined with disappearance of leucocyturia).

### Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in adults and children [^672857be]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection that can lead to significant morbidity including stricture, abscess formation, fistula, bacteraemia, sepsis, pyelonephritis and kidney dysfunction. Mortality rates are reported to be as high as 1% in men and 3% in women due to development of pyelonephritis. Because probiotic therapy is readily available without a prescription, a review of their efficacy in the prevention of UTI may aid consumers in making informed decisions about potential prophylactic therapy. Institutions and caregivers also need evidence-based synopses of current evidence to make informed patient care decisions.

Objectives

Compared to placebo or no therapy, did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality, when used to prevent UTI in susceptible patient populations?Compared to other prophylactic interventions, including drug and non-drug measures (e.g. continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, topical oestrogen, cranberry juice), did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality when used to prevent UTIs in susceptible patient populations?

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 21 September 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of susceptible patients (e.g. past history of UTI) or healthy people in which any strain, formulation, dose or frequency of probiotic was compared to placebo or active comparators were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

All RCTs and quasi-RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at comparing probiotics to no therapy, placebo, or other prophylactic interventions were included. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes.

Main Results

We included nine studies that involved 735 people in this review. Four studies compared probiotic with placebo, two compared probiotic with no treatment, two compared probiotics with antibiotics in patients with UTI, and one study compared probiotic with placebo in healthy women. All studies aimed to measure differences in rates of recurrent UTI. Our risk of bias assessment found that most studies had small sample sizes and reported insufficient methodological detail to enable robust assessment. Overall, there was a high risk of bias in the included studies which lead to inability to draw firm conclusions and suggesting that any reported treatment effects may be misleading or represent overestimates. We found no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI between patients treated with probiotics and placebo (6 studies, 352 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.12; I(2) = 23%) with wide confidence intervals, and statistical heterogeneity was low. No significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI was found between probiotic and antibiotic treated patients (1 study, 223 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.33). The most commonly reported adverse effects were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, constipation and vaginal symptoms. None of the included studies reported numbers of participants with at least one asymptomatic bacterial UTI, all-cause mortality or those with at least one confirmed case of bacteraemia or fungaemia. Two studies reported study withdrawal due to adverse events and the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event. One study reported withdrawal occurred in six probiotic participants (5.2%), 15 antibiotic participants (12.2%), while the second study noted one placebo group participant discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.

Authors' Conclusions

No significant benefit was demonstrated for probiotics compared with placebo or no treatment, but a benefit cannot be ruled out as the data were few, and derived from small studies with poor methodological reporting. There was limited information on harm and mortality with probiotics and no evidence on the impact of probiotics on serious adverse events. Current evidence cannot rule out a reduction or increase in recurrent UTI in women with recurrent UTI who use prophylactic probiotics. There was insufficient evidence from one RCT to comment on the effect of probiotics versus antibiotics.

14.8 Complicated Urinary Tract Infections and Acute Pyelonephritis: 10-day Treatment Regimen

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the 250 mg dose, 10 day regimen of levofloxacin, 567 patients with uncomplicated UTI, mild-to-moderate cUTI, and mild-to-moderate AP were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial conducted in the U.S. from June 1993 to January 1995 comparing levofloxacin 250 mg orally once daily for 10 days (285 patients) with ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days (282 patients). Patients with a resistant pathogen, recurrent UTI, women over age 55 years, and with an indwelling catheter were initially excluded, prior to protocol amendment which took place after 30% of enrollment. Microbiological efficacy was measured by bacteriologic eradication of the baseline organism(s) at 1 to 12 days post-therapy in patients with a pathogen identified at baseline.

The bacteriologic cure rates overall for levofloxacin and control at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit for the group of all patients with a documented pathogen at baseline (modified intent to treat or mITT) and the group of patients in the mITT population who closely followed the protocol (Microbiologically Evaluable) are summarized in Table 18.

### Urinary tract infection: traditional pharmacologic therapies [^caf7a445]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, particularly in women. Antimicrobial therapy is seldom indicated for asymptomatic infection, but antimicrobial therapy is usually indicated for amelioration of symptoms. Management of acute uncomplicated UTI (cystitis) is generally straightforward, with a predictable distribution of uropathogens isolated. First-line treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI has traditionally involved a 3-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or TMP alone for patients with sulfa allergies. Increasing resistance among community-acquired Escherichia coli to TMP-SMX worldwide has led to a reassessment of the most appropriate empiric therapy for these infections. Alternative first-line agents include the fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin. Factors to be considered in the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy include pharmacokinetics, spectrum of activity of the antimicrobial agent, resistance prevalence for the community, potential for adverse effects, and duration of therapy. Ideal antimicrobial agents for UTI management have primary excretion routes through the urinary tract to achieve high urinary drug levels. In addition, there are special considerations in the management of UTI among selected populations, including postmenopausal and pregnant women, and for women with frequent recurrent UTIs.

### Short-course nitrofurantoin for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women… [^f16cf599]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the recommended drug of choice in the United States for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women. Evidence-based guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America concluded that a 3-day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was the preferred regimen because of its high efficacy and minimal adverse events. On the basis of the large body of literature supporting this regimen, it was also recommended as the standard comparator for evaluation of any new drug or dosing schedule for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in women.

1. Few studies have evaluated the efficacy and tolerance of nitrofurantoin, especially in a regimen shorter than 7 days, as is now more commonly preferred for the treatment of UTI.

1, 2 The purpose of this study was thus to assess the efficacy and tolerance of a 5-day course of nitrofurantoin compared with a standard 3-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis. The effects of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance on efficacy were also assessed. Although the study was not designed to specifically evaluate a 3-day regimen of nitrofurantoin, it does demonstrate that most women had microbiological cure by 3 days of therapy. This is in contrast to a study16 performed in a similar population in which a 3-day course of macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin resulted in early microbiological cure in only 32 of 38 women and overall cure in only 22 of 36 women. Clinical cure rates with the 7-day regimen of nitrofurantoin were similar to what we report herein with a 5-day regimen.

A more recent randomized trial19 comparing nitrofurantoin, 100 mg twice daily for 7 days, with single-dose fosfomycin for uncomplicated cystitis found a microbiological cure rate of 81% 5 to 11 days after nitrofurantoin therapy. Another study20 of a 7-day regimen of nitrofurantoin found an 82% microbiological cure rate with a twice daily formulation and an 83% microbiological cure rate with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, both lower than those reported herein.

Patient and public involvement

The host institution has an established UTI patient group and as such patient and public involvement began at the planning stage of this trial. Patient representatives were included on the trial steering committee. The patient and public involvement group helped define the main outcome measure and in particular stressed the importance of a practical UTI definition rather than sole reliance on microbiological tests. The non-inferiority margin was exclusively defined by the patient group who stressed the severity of UTI symptoms and advised a non-inferiority margin of one UTI in a year. This margin was considered a clinically meaningful difference by our patient and public involvement group based on an appreciation of the likely numerical reductions in UTI frequency in both of our trial arms. During recruitment, the study was advertised via patient representatives from Bladder Health UK and results will be disseminated widely among patients including via this groups' regular publications.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^2363b269]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This trial has demonstrated that the non-antibiotic preventive treatment for UTI (methenamine hippurate) is not inferior to the current guideline recommended standard (daily, low dose prophylactic antibiotics). This trial adds to the evidence base for the use of methenamine hippurate for prophylactic treatment in adult women with recurrent UTI. Although the methenamine hippurate group had a 55% higher rate of UTI episodes than the antibiotics group, the absolute difference was just 0.49 UTI episodes per year, which has limited clinical consequence.

The risks of long term prophylactic antibiotic treatment have been well recognised in a recent study, which identified the increased risk of antibiotic resistance development in elderly patients receiving this treatment. The authors also described an increased risk of antibiotic associated complications, including Clostridium difficile infection, and concluded that the risks of long term antibiotic prophylaxis might outweigh the benefits in older patients with UTI. Our results could support a change in practice in terms of preventive treatments for recurrent UTI and provide patients and clinicians with a credible alternative to daily antibiotics, giving them the confidence to pursue strategies that avoid long term antibiotic use. The observed numerical difference in clinically diagnosed UTI between the two trial arms, which favoured antibiotic prophylaxis, was small and did not exceed the predefined non-inferiority margin of one episode per person year. This finding was consistent across the modified intention-to-treat, strict intention-to-treat, per protocol, and modified per protocol (post hoc) analyses. The information provided by this trial will allow clinicians and patients to undertake a shared decision making process relating to UTI preventive treatments. The study showed a small numerical difference in UTI incidence between the daily antibiotics and methenamine hippurate groups, but the potential trade-off includes the avoidance of antibiotic consumption, which is closely associated with antimicrobial resistance development.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^04c0230f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria — general risk–benefit rationale outside pregnancy: Although women with ASB may also be at increased risk of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), ASB, even when persistent, appears not to be associated with other adverse outcomes, and there is no evidence to suggest that episodes of symptomatic UTI are attributable to the ASB. Moreover, treatment of ASB may not decrease the frequency of symptomatic UTI, including pyelonephritis, and antibiotics may increase rather than decrease the risk of subsequent UTI. There is high-quality evidence that antibiotics have an increased risk of adverse effects, that screening and treating ASB is extremely costly, and that the use of antibiotics promotes emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

### Common questions about recurrent urinary tract infections in women [^6839a447]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in women, including healthy women with normal genitourinary anatomy. Recurrent UTI is typically defined as three or more UTIs within 12 months, or two or more occurrences within six months. The same species that caused previous infections is typically responsible for recurrences. In premenopausal women, sexual intercourse three or more times per week, spermicide use, new or multiple sex partners, and having a UTI before 15 years of age are established risk factors. In postmenopausal women, risk is primarily increased by sequelae of lower estrogen levels. Episodes of recurrent UTI are typically characterized by dysuria and urinary frequency or hesitancy. Findings from the history or physical examination that suggest complicated infection or another disease process warrant additional evaluation. At least one symptomatic episode should be verified by urine culture to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment. Imaging is rarely warranted. Short courses of antibiotics are as effective as longer courses. Patient-initiated treatment lowers the cost of diagnosis, number of physician visits, and number of symptomatic days compared with physician-initiated treatment. It also reduces antibiotic exposure compared with antibiotic prophylaxis. Antibiotic prophylaxis effectively limits UTI recurrence but increases the risk of antibiotic resistance and adverse effects. Cranberry products may reduce recurrent UTIs in premenopausal women, but are less effective than antibiotic prophylaxis, and data are conflicting. Optimal dosing is unknown. Postmenopausal women with atrophic vaginitis may benefit from topical estrogen therapy.

### The current management strategies for community-acquired urinary tract infection [^f211be53]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Acute uncomplicated UTI is one of the most common problems for which young women seek medical attention and accounts for considerable morbidity and health care costs. Acute cystitis or pyelonephritis in the adult patient should be considered uncomplicated if the patient is not pregnant or elderly, if there has been no recent instrumentation or antimicrobial treatment, and if there are no known functional or anatomic abnormalities of the genitourinary tract. Most of these infections are caused by E. coli, which are susceptible to many oral antimicrobials, although resistance is increasing to some of the commonly used agents, especially TMP-SMX. In women with risk factors for infection with resistant bacteria, or in the setting of a high prevalence of TMP-SMX-resistant uropathogens, a case can be made for using a fluoroquinolone or nitrofurantoin. Use of nitrofurantoin for the empiric treatment of mild cystitis is supportable from a public health perspective in an attempt to decrease uropathogen resistance because it does not share cross-resistance with more commonly prescribed antimicrobials. Beta-lactams and fosfomycin should be considered second-line agents for empiric treatment of cystitis. Acute pyelonephritis in an otherwise healthy woman may be considered an uncomplicated infection. Fluoroquinolone regimens are superior to TMP-SMX for empiric therapy because of the relatively high prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance among uropathogens causing pyelonephritis. TMP-SMX, effective for patients with mild to moderate disease, is an appropriate drug if the uropathogen is known to be susceptible. It is reasonable to use a 7- to 10-day oral fluoroquinolone regimen for outpatient management of mild to moderate pyelonephritis in the setting of a susceptible causative pathogen and rapid clinical response to therapy. Most women with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis are now managed safely and effectively as outpatients. Acute uncomplicated cystitis or pyelonephritis in healthy adult men is very uncommon but is generally caused by the same spectrum of uropathogens with the same antimicrobial susceptibility profile as that seen in women. The choice of antimicrobials is similar to that recommended for cystitis in women except that nitrofurantoin is not considered a good choice. Treatment duration should generally be longer than that recommended for women.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^fb0d862e]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

First-line antimicrobial agents — IDSA-aligned options and nitrofurantoin regimen: In the Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines for premenopausal women, 3 first-line antibiotics for UTI treatment are recommended — nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), and fosfomycin — and recommendations are extrapolated for rUTI, older women, and women with urogynecologic disorders. Nitrofurantoin is bacteriostatic and therapeutically active only in the lower urinary tract; it is effective against E. coli and many gram-negative species with low levels of resistance but is ineffective against some Proteus species and some strains of Enterobacter and Klebsiella. The duration of treatment is typically 7 to 10 days; a meta-analysis of women ranging from 12 to 70 years old concluded that 5-day regimens are as effective (not necessarily generalizable to women with rUTI), and the 2010 "International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women" recommends a 5-day regimen of 100 mg orally twice daily. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and most gram-negative bacteria.

Endoscopic urologic procedures — single-dose versus longer-course antimicrobial treatment for preoperative asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) showed no significant differences in postoperative urinary tract infection (UTI) but lower cost and anxiety with single-dose.

In a second spinal cord injury (SCI) cohort, a single dose (35 patients) given 30 minutes prior to the procedure was compared to 3–5 days of preprocedural antimicrobials (25 patients), with no significant differences in the frequency of postoperative UTI; the single-dose regimen decreased antimicrobial cost (3.6 ± 6.1 US dollars vs 33.1 ± 47.6 US dollars; P < .001) and those who received the longer course reported greater preprocedural anxiety (18 vs 0%; P < .05). These 2 studies suggest that single-dose preoperative treatment of ASB is likely sufficient and associated with fewer adverse events. Perioperative antimicrobials probably reduce the risk of sepsis by approximately 6% and of UTIs by approximately 9%, and prolonged antimicrobial courses increase cost and adverse effects and probably increase length of stay and patient anxiety.

### Efficacy and safety of quinolones for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: a network meta-analysis [^9ba99b56]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (uUTI) is defined as the presence of pathogenic organisms in the urinary tract without anatomical and functional abnormalities, is accompanied by inflammatory leukocytes and cytokines and may or may not develop clinical symptoms. The frequency of uncomplicated urinary tract infection is higher in young women. Several quinolone treatment regimens are available; however, since we do not know which is the best antibiotic regimen for the treatment of this urinary infection, we analyzed the published evidence and conducted a systematic review with network meta-analysis. The aim was to compare and hierarchize quinolones according to their efficacy and safety and to identify the best treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women through a systematic review with network meta-analysis.

Methods

Medline, Embase, LILACS, Cochrane CENTRAL and other databases were searched for trials. Bias in the trials was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. To analyze efficacy and adverse events, for direct comparisons, we obtained risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals by applying a fixed-effects model using tau 2 and Q 2 tests to calculate the heterogeneity. For the network meta-analysis, we analyzed the indirect comparisons by Bucher's method.

Results

We included 18 trials (8765 women). For premenopausal women, ofloxacin had a 57% probability of achieving remission but an 83% frequency of adverse events. For postmenopausal women, ofloxacin was 82% more effective for remission, with a 49% frequency of adverse events, compared with other types of quinolones.

Conclusions

Compared with other quinolones, ofloxacin 200 mg once daily for a treatment duration < 3 days provides the highest clinical and bacteriological remission rates with the lowest relapse and resistance rates for the treatment of women with uUTIs. However, additional trials are needed to confirm our findings, especially when the treatment duration exceeds 3 days.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^bd248e36]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common conditions seen in female patients in general practice. These infections affect 50% of women at least once in their lives, and more than 20% of infections are resistant to trimethoprim and cephalosporins and 50% to amoxicillin.

Urinary dipsticks are the most commonly used near patient test in primary care in the United Kingdom. The aim of using dipsticks is to target treatment to the 60% of women who have urinary tract infections, while minimising antibiotic use for women without infection. A previous validation study has shown that dipsticks and clinical scoring algorithms can potentially help improve the precision of diagnosis by improving the positive predictive values. If clinicians are to use dipsticks, however, they need to have strategies to deal with the poor negative predictive values. We know of no trial that has assessed dipstick or clinical management algorithms in comparison with the realistic alternatives. Previous studies have documented that delayed antibiotic prescribing in respiratory infections results in good symptom control, reduced belief in the effectiveness of antibiotics, and fewer repeat consultations. We hypothesised that, compared with an immediate antibiotic prescription, other management strategies would result in worse symptom control, particularly in women asked to delay antibiotics empirically or while waiting for the result of midstream urine analysis.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of management using dipstick or clinical algorithms compared with the alternative management strategies (empirical antibiotic treatment, delayed prescribing, and targeted prescribing based on midstream urine results).

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^c5f71de2]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Guideline Statement 23 — long-term oral antibiotics: Long-term oral antibiotic administration should not be offered. Standard (Evidence Strength: Grade B). One RCT reported that an 18 week protocol of sequential antibiotic administration resulted in 20% of the treatment group reporting 50% or greater symptom improvement compared to 16% of the placebo group – a nonsignificant difference, with AEs typical of long-term antibiotic administration. Using less intensive protocols, two observational studies reported higher efficacy rates of 45% and 47%, but the Panel judged that antibiotic treatment is contraindicated in patients who have previously been administered antibiotics without efficacy and who present with a negative urine culture. This Standard is not intended to prevent antibiotic administration to antibiotic-naïve patients; it is focused on preventing repeated or chronic antibiotic administration to patients for whom no relief was obtained in an initial course, and it is also not intended to prevent prophylactic antibiotic administration (e.g., nightly for several months) to patients who present with recurrent UTIs and symptoms suggestive of IC/BPS between infections.
