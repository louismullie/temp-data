## Question

What is the recommended workup for a 2.7 × 3.6 dermoid cyst in the right ovary?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended workup for a 2.7 × 3.6 cm right ovarian dermoid cyst. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and key patient factors such as age, menopausal status, symptoms, fertility goals, and prior imaging. Then, I should confirm the first-line imaging strategy and diagnostic confidence on ultrasound, including operator expertise and dermoid-specific features. Next, I will review when second-line imaging is needed, how to approach tumor markers, and how to stratify risk and indications for referral. After that, I will compare expectant management versus surgery for a small asymptomatic dermoid and outline follow-up protocols. Finally, I will consider special situations, surgical approach if indicated, and patient counseling points before stating a concise recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because management hinges on whether the patient is premenopausal or postmenopausal, symptomatic or asymptomatic, and whether fertility preservation is a priority, as well as any prior imaging documenting stability or change over time, and I should explicitly note that a detailed history and physical, including family cancer history and abdominal and pelvic examination, is foundational before making management decisions [^115Gq5xW] [^116k33iP] [^notfound].

> I will now examine the first-line diagnostic approach, and I need to ensure we anchor this on high-quality transvaginal pelvic ultrasound as the primary modality, supplemented by transabdominal views if the lesion exceeds the transvaginal field of view, while remembering that expert operator interpretation improves diagnostic accuracy and downstream management, and that IOTA-based morphology assessment is appropriate in this context, with color Doppler supporting assessment for torsion and vascularized solid components [^115DzNLe] [^114spAuH] [^114nW5XQ] [^113EVfRF] [^115tGDjs].

> Hold on, I should verify dermoid-specific sonographic features to justify a confident benign diagnosis on ultrasound, including a Rokitansky nodule with shadowing, fat-fluid levels, echogenic interfaces from sebaceous material and hair, and mixed echogenicity patterns that are characteristic of mature cystic teratoma, because documenting these classic features supports expectant management when clinical context is low risk [^113N4Bd8] [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the role of 3D ultrasound in this evaluation, as I recall guidelines caution against routine 3D morphologic assessment; yes, 3D is not recommended routinely for cyst characterization, so I should not rely on it here even if available, and I should instead focus on high-quality 2D TVUS with expert assessment and Doppler [^112yUVaz] [^116FpMyU] [^113EVfRF].

> Next, I should review when to escalate to second-line imaging, and I need to ensure MRI is used when ultrasound features are indeterminate or characterization is uncertain, reserving CT for cases in which malignancy is suspected and cross-sectional staging is needed, because unnecessary radiation should be avoided in reproductive-age patients with presumed benign lesions [^113uNcKS] [^116YsKqD] [^112y1XrD].

> Let me consider tumor markers carefully; in premenopausal patients with an ultrasound diagnosis of a typical dermoid and no suspicious features, routine CA-125 is not indicated, and for complex masses in patients under 40 when a malignant germ cell tumor is a concern, LDH, AFP, and hCG are the markers to obtain, but in a classic dermoid these are typically unnecessary; wait, I almost applied the simple cyst CA-125 rule directly here, but a dermoid is not a simple cyst, so my correction is that the rationale not to order CA-125 is based on low specificity in premenopausal patients and the benign, well-characterized nature of dermoids rather than the "simple cyst" rule per se [^112qNfoX] [^1165zfgG] [^114WntV9].

> I should confirm how to stratify malignancy risk and indications for referral; while RMI is primarily validated for epithelial malignancy risk in postmenopausal women, the general principle is to refer if ultrasound shows worrisome features such as vascularized solid components, papillary projections, irregular thick septations, ascites, or peritoneal nodularity, and use a threshold such as RMI I ≥ 200 in appropriate contexts to trigger gynecologic oncology referral, keeping in mind that this 2.7 × 3.6 cm lesion is small and, if a classic dermoid on US, very low risk [^116Lsekv] [^115FYzco] [^115HgPi3].

> Now, I need to check the natural history and complication risks of dermoids to weigh surveillance versus surgery; mature cystic teratomas grow slowly, many remain stable for years, torsion risk increases with size, and malignant transformation is rare, roughly around 1% in a large modern surgical cohort and broadly cited between 0.17–2% across the literature, which supports conservative management for asymptomatic small lesions in reproductive-age patients when imaging is characteristic and benign [^112RQLxF] [^1162DU2s] [^114cmkzi].

> For this 2.7 × 3.6 cm asymptomatic dermoid, I should recommend expectant management with surveillance, but let me double-check the follow-up cadence; observational data support initial follow-up ultrasound around 6–12 months to confirm stability, with extension to yearly or every 1–2 years if stable, and although some RCOG rules about 5–7 cm "simple cysts" specify annual surveillance, I should be careful not to conflate simple cyst guidance with dermoid management, so my corrected approach is to base intervals on the benign dermoid literature and clinical context rather than the simple cyst algorithm [^112RQLxF] [^notfound] [^notfound].

> I will now examine indications to move from surveillance to surgery, and I need to ensure I capture symptoms such as pain or pressure, interval growth suggesting increasing risk of torsion, any complications like torsion or rupture, emergence of atypical imaging features, or patient preference; size alone is not an absolute trigger at this small dimension, and larger size thresholds are variably used, but the consistent theme is to individualize based on risk, symptoms, and reproductive goals, recognizing that persistence and growth are not features of functional cysts and may justify intervention [^notfound] [^115vKZuk] [^1162DU2s].

> If surgery becomes indicated, I should confirm the operative strategy; laparoscopic cystectomy with ovarian preservation is preferred in reproductive-age patients, with meticulous efforts to avoid spillage, use of a retrieval bag, and copious lavage if spillage occurs, and I should reassure that chemical peritonitis is rare even when spillage happens in contemporary series, though minimizing spillage remains best practice; in-bag techniques can further reduce contamination risk, and specimens should be retrieved in containment [^113bQdNo] [^115cLGRQ] [^1112Avbv] [^1162DU2s] [^112VLfZG].

> But wait, what about special situations; in pregnancy, dermoids are common and torsion risk may rise with advancing gestation, so timing and approach should be individualized with a tendency toward minimally invasive surgery in the first trimester if needed and more laparotomy in later trimesters as reported, while in postmenopausal patients the threshold for surgical removal and oncologic evaluation is lower, with standardized use of TVUS, appropriate tumor markers, CT if malignancy is suspected, and referral pathways to oncology as indicated, and in suspected torsion, emergent laparoscopy for detorsion and cystectomy is the goal without delays for extensive imaging [^1162DU2s] [^114spAuH] [^112y1XrD] [^1154MnJR].

> Next, I should review counseling points and follow-up; I need to ensure the patient understands the high likelihood of benign behavior, the low malignancy risk, the small but real risks of torsion and rupture which rise with size, the expected slow growth trajectory, and the potential impact of cystectomy on ovarian reserve, which can be minimized but not eliminated, with plans for periodic ultrasound surveillance and prompt reassessment if new symptoms occur [^112RQLxF] [^1162DU2s] [^112RQLxF].

> Final recommendation for a 2.7 × 3.6 cm right dermoid: Hold on, let me first confirm that ultrasound demonstrates classic benign dermoid features without suspicious components, and if so, I recommend expectant management with a repeat transvaginal ultrasound in about 12 months to confirm stability and then extend to every 1–2 years if unchanged, with no routine tumor markers in a premenopausal patient unless atypical features arise or germ cell malignancy is suspected, and reserve surgery for symptoms, documented growth, complications, or changing imaging features, favoring laparoscopic ovarian-sparing cystectomy with retrieval bag if intervention becomes necessary [^115DzNLe] [^113N4Bd8] [^112RQLxF] [^1162DU2s] [^113bQdNo].

---

A 2.7 × 3.6 cm right ovarian dermoid cyst in a premenopausal woman should be managed with **transvaginal ultrasound** as the **first-line modality**, confirming typical dermoid features (Rokitansky nodule, echogenic debris, calcifications) [^113N4Bd8] [^115DzNLe]. MRI is reserved for **indeterminate or atypical lesions** [^117HXvAQ]. Tumor markers are not routinely indicated unless features suggest malignancy [^112qNfoX]. Asymptomatic cysts < 5 cm with benign imaging may be observed with repeat ultrasound at 6–12 months; surgery is indicated for symptoms, growth, or suspicion of malignancy, with laparoscopic cystectomy preferred and careful technique to avoid spillage [^113bQdNo] [^113HAzUD].

---

## Clinical evaluation

Clinical evaluation should include a thorough **history and physical examination** to assess for abdominal/pelvic pain, fullness, or pressure and to evaluate for acute abdomen suggesting torsion or rupture [^1117SWLX], along with a review of **risk factors** by documenting family history of ovarian, breast, or bowel cancer and personal history of infertility, endometriosis, or prior ovarian cysts [^114i7GGN].

---

## Imaging studies

### First-line imaging

Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is the **preferred initial modality**, with typical dermoid features including a Rokitansky nodule, echogenic debris, calcifications, and fat-fluid levels [^113N4Bd8] [^111ZBpL8]. Transabdominal ultrasound is a **supplementary option** when TVUS is limited by size or patient factors [^112FtU4p].

---

### Second-line imaging

Use **MRI** when ultrasound is indeterminate or atypical, as it characterizes fat and calcifications typical of dermoids [^117HXvAQ]. CT scan is not routine and should be considered only if **malignancy is suspected** or for complex surgical planning [^112y1XrD].

---

## Laboratory tests

Routine **tumor markers** are not indicated for typical dermoids; consider CA-125, AFP, β-hCG, and LDH only if features suggest malignancy or in patients < 40 years with complex masses [^112qNfoX] [^1165zfgG].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgery is indicated when any of the following are present:

- **Symptoms**: Persistent pain, pressure, or acute abdomen suggesting torsion or rupture [^114k1XP9].

- **Growth**: Increase in size on serial imaging [^115vKZuk].

- **Suspicion of malignancy**: Solid components with vascularity, papillary projections, irregular septations, ascites, or peritoneal nodularity [^115FYzco].

- **Patient preference**: Desire for definitive management or fertility preservation.

---

## Surgical approach

- **Laparoscopic cystectomy**: Preferred for cysts < 5 cm; ovarian-sparing and lower morbidity [^113HAzUD].

- **Laparotomy**: Reserve for large, complex, or suspicious masses.

- **Avoid spillage**: Use endoscopic retrieval bags and careful technique to minimize chemical peritonitis risk [^113bQdNo].

---

## Conservative management and follow-up

Conservative management consists of **observation** for asymptomatic cysts < 5 cm with benign imaging and **surveillance** with repeat ultrasound at 6–12 months, with intervention if growth, symptoms, or suspicious features develop [^115vKZuk].

---

## Potential complications

- **Torsion**: Most common complication (~3.5%) [^1117SWLX].

- **Rupture**: Rare (~2%); risk of chemical peritonitis [^1117SWLX].

- **Malignant transformation**: Rare (< 1%) [^1117SWLX].

---

## Patient counseling

Patient counseling should emphasize the **benign nature** of mature cystic teratomas and the **low malignancy risk**. Discuss **potential complications**, including torsion, rupture, and the rare possibility of malignant transformation. Review **management options**, comparing observation versus surgery with associated risks and benefits. Address **fertility considerations**, including ovarian reserve and fertility preservation when relevant [^113HAzUD].

---

A 2.7 × 3.6 cm right ovarian dermoid cyst is **typically benign** and is managed with ultrasound confirmation, with MRI reserved for indeterminate cases. Observation with interval ultrasound is appropriate unless **symptoms, growth, or suspicious features** arise, in which case laparoscopic cystectomy is preferred.

The management approach depends on the size of the cyst, available equipment, and the experience level of the surgeon. Many authors advise against aspirating the contents of the cyst due to potential complications such as infection, bleeding, rupture of the cyst, and an increased risk of peritoneal adhesion. However, surgery can be performed laparoscopically. This involves the introduction of trocars, followed by the aspiration of cyst contents before removal. Laparoscopy is not recommended when malignancy is suspected due to the risk of spreading cancer cells. In our case, we chose a laparotomy because the benign nature of the cyst was uncertain preoperatively. Additionally, laparoscopic surgery was not feasible due to the cyst's large size.

An immediate complication to be wary of when removing a giant ovarian cyst is vacuum shock; therefore, good preventive vascular filling is necessary. Literature on giant ovarian cysts during pregnancy or postpartum is scarce. For example, in 2002, Qublan et al. removed a 6 kg ovarian mucinous cyst following a caesarean section. Petros et al. reported the removal of a 30 × 25 mm bilateral mucinous benign ovarian cyst in 2005. Noreen et al. in 2011 documented a giant ovarian cyst discovered at 32 weeks of gestation, which was removed at 38 weeks through an oophorectomy. In 2017, Baradwan et al. removed a 16.5 × 26.3 × 22.4 cm ovarian serous cystadenoma laparoscopically in the postpartum period. These cysts during the gravid-puerperium period did not match the size of our cyst, which measured 42 cm.

### ACR appropriateness criteria: Clinically suspected adnexal mass, no acute symptoms [^115MShp9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

There are approximately 9.1 pelvic surgeries performed for every histologically confirmed adnexal malignancy in the United States, compared to 2.3 surgeries per malignancy in oncology centers and 5.9 surgeries per malignancy in other centers in Europe. An important prognostic factor in the long-term survival of patients with ovarian malignancy is the initial management by a gynecological oncologist. The high accuracy of imaging for adnexal mass characterization and appropriate triage to subspecialty referral can improve treatment outcomes through better use of gynecologic oncology.

Ultrasound, including transabdominal, transvaginal, and duplex ultrasound, combined with MRI with contrast, can classify adnexal masses as benign with specific features (e.g. functional masses, dermoid, endometrioma, fibroma, pedunculated fibroid, hydrosalpinx, peritoneal inclusion cyst, Tarlov cyst), malignant, or indeterminate.

- **Guidelines development**: The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision processes include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the guidelines.

### Bilateral dermoid ovarian cyst in an adolescent girl [^117A5GDJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

A 19-year-old unmarried woman with regular menstrual cycles presented with symptoms of vague abdominal pain of one month's duration. Her general condition was fair.

- **Clinical examination**: Per abdomen, a firm, non-tender mass corresponding to 26 weeks of gestation with a smooth surface and upper and lateral borders well defined was observed. The lower border was not palpable.

- **Ultrasonography findings**: A left ovarian tumor measuring 28×19 cm with mixed echogenicity was seen in the pelvis extending superiorly into the abdominal cavity. It contained fat, fluid, and multiple septations. The right ovary measured 6×4 cm with a 3.7 cm focal hyperechoic lesion. The uterus was anteverted and of normal size. No free fluid was observed.

- **CT scan**: Confirmed the ultrasonography findings.

- **Laboratory results**: Cancer antigen (CA) 125 was 52 IU/mL.

- **Surgical intervention**: An exploratory laparotomy was performed, followed by left ovariotomy and salpingectomy as well as right ovarian cystectomy, leaving behind a significant amount of normal ovarian tissue. A cut section of the gross specimen of the left ovarian tumor revealed a dermoid cyst with plenty of sebaceous fluid and a large tuft of hair. The right ovarian cystectomy revealed a dermoid cyst with hair and pellets of sebum.

- **Histopathology findings**: Showed bilateral dermoid ovarian cyst.

### Management of ovarian dermoid cysts in the pediatric and adolescent population [^116Y9n32]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

To evaluate the surgical approach used in the management of ovarian dermoid cysts in the pediatric and adolescent population, a descriptive retrospective chart review was conducted. The study reviewed all cases of ovarian dermoid cyst excision between January 2001 and January 2006 at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada.

Participants included forty-one female children and adolescents who underwent operative management of an ovarian dermoid cyst. The main outcome measures were the surgical approach (laparoscopy vs. laparotomy), intraoperative cyst rupture, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications.

- **Results**:
	- The mean age was 12.5 years, and all cysts were unilateral.
	- **Surgical approaches**: Twenty-three patients (56%) underwent laparoscopic cystectomy, fourteen (34%) had a cystectomy via laparotomy, and four (10%) oophorectomies were performed via laparotomy.
	- Cyst size was significantly larger in the laparotomy group compared to the laparoscopy group, with a mean diameter of 14.4 cm vs. 7.1 cm, respectively (P < .001).
	- There was a significantly higher rate of cyst rupture during laparoscopic cystectomy (100%), compared to excision via laparotomy (27.7%, P < .001).
	- Length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopy group compared to the laparotomy group, with a median of 0 vs. 3 days, respectively (P < .001).
	- A single case in the laparoscopy group sustained a bladder injury and developed postoperative necrotizing fasciitis, resulting in a prolonged hospitalization and recovery.
	- There were no operative or postoperative complications related to cyst content spillage, regardless of the surgical approach.

### Multiple and bilateral dermoids: A case report [^114EJYip]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

A 27-year-old nulliparous woman presented with pain in the lower abdomen for six months. She was diagnosed with bilateral dermoid cysts. Ovarian dermoid tumors can be bilateral in up to 15% of cases. After laparoscopy, we found that she had seven dermoid cysts on the left side and two dermoid cysts on the right side, which is a rare occurrence. All the dermoid cysts were enucleated laparoscopically. The cysts were placed in an endobag and retrieved by morcellation. A one-year follow-up showed no evidence of recurrence or granulomatous peritonitis.

### Management of ovarian lesions diagnosed during infancy [^112qh3uZ]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Prior studies of infant ovarian cysts have recommended intervention for those larger than 4 cm. We reviewed the natural history and features of those managed operatively versus nonoperatively.

A retrospective study was performed of ovarian lesions in children less than 1 year old from 2000 to 2014. Forty patients were identified. Twenty-eight (70%) underwent operative management, while 12 (30%) were managed conservatively, including one undergoing aspiration. The mean age at surgery was 125 days. All but one patient (96%) had evidence of antenatal torsion intraoperatively or on final pathology. All resected lesions were benign.

- **Ultrasound findings**: More common in those undergoing surgery included intracystic debris (p < 0.001), fluid-fluid or fluid-debris levels (p = 0.002), absence of Doppler flow (p = 0.014), solid components (p = 0.04), and calcifications (p = 0.001). Cysts managed nonoperatively had an average diameter of 2.5 cm, compared to 5.1 cm in the operative group (p < 0.001). Three of the lesions managed nonoperatively had a diameter greater than 3.5 cm (mean 5.1 cm) and were followed for an average of 153 days until resolution.

The majority of infant ovarian lesions were excised, although none were malignant. Aspiration or observation of larger cysts was feasible and safe. Ovarian cysts in this age group should be considered for nonoperative management and closely followed.

### Chronic appendicitis diagnosed preoperatively as an ovarian dermoid [^111poNst]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Right lower quadrant pain in young women can present a diagnostic dilemma. Chronic appendicitis is often mistakenly excluded from the differential diagnosis. In the present case, a 19-year-old woman with bilateral lower abdominal pain (greater on the right than the left), fever, and elevated white blood cell count was diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease. She was treated with intravenous antibiotics until the symptoms resolved. However, the pain recurred one month later, prompting a visit to our emergency department. At that time, she was afebrile, and all laboratory results were normal or negative, except for an elevated white blood cell count. Although computed tomography suggested a right ovarian dermoid, laparoscopy revealed that the right tube and ovary were normal, confirming chronic appendicitis. Although computed tomography is often effective in identifying the cause of pelvic abnormalities, it may also be misleading.

### Ovarian dermoid cyst trajectory in premenarchal girls [^116GiL95]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2024). Low credibility.

The study objective was to investigate mature ovarian dermoid cysts (ODCs), which are the most common benign ovarian tumors diagnosed in children. Though there is minimal data on the management of ODCs in premenarchal patients, this study assesses characteristics associated with expectant management (EM) versus surgical management (SM) in premenarchal patients, as well as the growth rate of ODCs in EM patients at a single institution.

Forty-four premenarchal patients, either post-surgical with pathologically confirmed ODC or having radiologic findings consistent with ODCs, were included in the study. Data collected comprised demographics, cyst characteristics, imaging findings, presence of symptoms, surgical procedures performed, and occurrence of ovarian torsion.

Results indicated that patient age at diagnosis was similar between groups (SM: 8.8 years vs. EM: 8.0 years, P = 0.55). At presentation, 36 patients (82%) underwent SM, while 8 patients (18%) underwent EM. There was a significant difference in cyst size between groups (SM: 8.9 cm vs. EM: 3.6 cm, P = 0.004). Among SM patients, 30% underwent oophorectomy as opposed to cystectomy, with a significant size difference in ODCs between the procedures (11.8 cm vs. 7.7 cm, P = 0.016). For EM patients, 75% had at least one follow-up ultrasound, and 60% had three follow-up ultrasounds, with average follow-up timeframes of 3.7 and 27 months, respectively. The average yearly ODC growth rate for the latter group was 0.8 cm.

The conclusion drawn from the study was that the average yearly growth rate of ODCs in premenarchal patients within our institution was slower than in older cohorts. Age and cyst size significantly influenced the determination of surgical procedures. Continuous study on EM in premenarchal patients is recommended.

### Successful pregnancies following fertility-preserving treatment for ovarian carcinoma [^114mMg2a]. Nature Clinical Practice. Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

A 30-year-old woman underwent a routine sonogram at 6 weeks of gestation during her first pregnancy and was found to have a 6 cm complex right-ovarian mass, thought to be a dermoid cyst. The pregnancy progressed to term, resulting in a normal vaginal delivery. At 3 months postpartum, she underwent a laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy. Preoperative serum cancer antigen 125 was within the normal range at 23.6 U/ml.

- **Investigations**: Pelvic ultrasound, evaluation of serum cancer antigen 125, abdominal and pelvic CT scans.

- **Diagnosis**: Stage IA clear-cell epithelial carcinoma of the right ovary.

- **Management**: Laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy, dilation and curettage, laparotomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy, infracolic omentectomy, peritoneal biopsy, peritoneal washing, appendectomy, bilateral pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin.

### Laparoscopic resection of a torted ovarian dermoid cyst [^1154MnJR]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

A 20-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe right iliac fossa pain lasting for 12 hours. The pain was constant, without radiation, and was rapidly worsening prior to her admission. It was associated with anorexia and vomiting. Direct questioning revealed no relevant gynecologic or urologic symptoms. The patient reported a similar, but milder, episode one month ago when she was seen at another hospital. No diagnosis was made at that time, and the pain resolved after analgesia.

Upon examination, she was hemodynamically stable and afebrile. She exhibited tenderness in the right iliac fossa with guarding and rebound tenderness. Hematological blood tests revealed neutrophilia, and a urinary pregnancy test was negative. The patient was scheduled for an urgent laparoscopy with a provisional diagnosis of appendicitis or a ruptured ovarian cyst.

After the induction of general anesthesia, a large central abdominal mass was discovered. Laparoscopy, using one 10 mm and two 5 mm ports, revealed bleeding from a large torted right ovarian cyst approximately 15 cm in diameter and an enlarged left ovary. The cyst was untwisted, and the right fallopian tube was viable. The cyst was dissected free from the residual right ovary, and its contents were carefully aspirated. The collapsed cyst was then placed into a small bag and removed. A thorough and complete washout of the blood clot was performed with normal saline. She made a very good recovery and was discharged the next day.

### Laparoscopic resection of a torted ovarian dermoid cyst [^111PnJyC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Ovarian dermoid cysts may present as an emergency after torsion or rupture, and general surgeons will encounter such cases from time to time. Laparoscopic management is beneficial, as it often allows for the preservation of ovarian tissue and the fallopian tube. We recommend placing the cyst into a bag and externalizing it prior to aspiration to avoid any risk of contamination.

### Mature cystic teratoma of the ovary: a cutting edge overview on imaging features [^113N4Bd8]. Insights into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

- **Shadowing echodensity (Rokitansky nodule or dermoid plug)**: The Rokitansky nodule is the most common sonographic finding and is seen as a densely echogenic protuberance projecting into the cystic lumen (Fig. 1). This nodule, also called a dermoid plug, may show acoustic shadowing due to hair, teeth, and fat content (Fig. 2). Although described as a rounded solid mass, a bridge across the cyst, or a thickened segment of the wall, it may rarely appear completely cystic (Fig. 3). The Rokitansky nodule is a common site of malignant transformation and should be sectioned appropriately during pathological analysis.

	- **Figures**:
		1. Transverse sonogram of a 20-year-old female with a mature cystic teratoma. A densely echogenic protuberance on the left side of the wall projecting into the cystic lumen is consistent with a Rokitansky nodule.
		2. Transverse sonogram of an 18-year-old female with mature cystic teratoma. Shadowing echodensity projecting into the cystic lumen is seen, which was proved to contain fat and hair in the pathological specimen.
		3. Transverse sonogram of a 14-year-old female with mature cystic teratoma demonstrates a cystic Rokitansky nodule (arrows) in a cystic mass. Note that there is echogenic debris at the gravity-dependent portion of the cyst.

- **Diffuse or regional high-amplitude echoes**: This finding is the second most common manifestation of MCT. It results from the presence of mixed sebaceous material and hair. The increased echogenicity may be diffuse throughout the mass or focal with accompanying sound attenuation (Fig. 4). In 8% of cases, the echogenicity can vary.

Ensure all figures and references are correctly linked and presented within the text.

Most cysts in the gravid-puerperium period are functional and therefore benign; often, these are luteomas of pregnancy. Other ovarian cysts encountered during pregnancy, in order of frequency, include benign teratomas, mucosal adenomas, rete ovarii tumors, and endometriotic cysts. A serous cystadenoma is the most common benign ovarian cyst, accounting for approximately 60–75% of ovarian cysts. These are benign epithelial tumors and are usually unilateral and uni-locular, with an incidence peak at 20–40 years. The etiology of serous cysts is unknown, although they may be associated with other ovarian tumors, such as mature cystic teratomas. Cheng et al. demonstrated that mutations in BRAF and KRAS, which characterize serous borderline tumors and low-grade serous carcinomas, are absent in serous cystadenomas. It is speculated that a small proportion of these cystadenomas become clonal, and mutations of KRAS or BRAF in some of these clonal cystadenomas lead to the development of serous borderline tumors, the precursors of low-grade serous carcinoma.

After surgery, because our patient's cyst was benign, the long-term risks were presumed to be significantly reduced. These risks are related more to the surgery itself rather than the pathology. The occurrence of adhesions of intra-abdominal organs is possible post-surgery. Furthermore, the ovariectomy performed may slightly reduce fertility and decrease the age of onset of menopause.

This case report demonstrates that vaginal delivery is possible when a giant ovarian cyst is associated with pregnancy.

### The approach to ovarian dermoids in adolescents and young women [^114cmkzi]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Mature cystic teratomas (MCTs) are the most common ovarian neoplastic lesions found in adolescents. MCTs are usually asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally on exam or imaging. The recurrence rate of MCTs following cystectomy is 3–4%, and the incidence of malignant transformation is estimated to be 0.17–2%. Given the accuracy with which MCTs can be diagnosed preoperatively, studies suggest that these lesions can be treated surgically using laparoscopic techniques. The management of MCTs in the adolescent population poses unique challenges given the potential impact on sexual development and fertility.

- **Case**: A 17-year-old female was found to have bilateral adnexal masses consistent in appearance with MCTs on computed tomography following a motor vehicle accident. She underwent exploratory laparotomy with pathology confirming the presence of bilateral ovarian MCTs. Three years later, she returned to the office with occasional abdominopelvic pain. Ultrasound revealed bilateral complex cysts suggestive of recurrent MCTs. She was expectantly managed with serial ultrasounds, and after 24 months, slow but visible growth of the MCTs was confirmed. The patient is now 22 years old and asymptomatic. What is the most appropriate management?

- **Summary and conclusion**: The risks of expectant management in women like the one presented are small. This suggests that although the traditional treatment for MCTs is laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy, in children and adolescents with MCTs, we should consider close follow-up without intervention to preserve ovarian function and future fertility.

### Treatment and outcomes of congenital ovarian cysts a study by the Canadian Consortium for Research in Pediatric Surgery (CanCORPS) [^117BrphA]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

The outcomes of interest were the incidence of cyst resolution, interventional management, and ovarian preservation. Cyst resolution was defined as either the complete sonographic disappearance of the previously identified ovarian cyst or a decrease in ovarian cyst size to less than 10 mm. An intervention was defined as a procedure performed to remove the cyst or diminish its size, including percutaneous aspiration, ovarian-sparing surgical procedures such as cyst unroofing or cystectomy, or oophorectomy. Ovarian preservation was defined as the presence of a viable ovary at the point of last follow-up after either operative or nonoperative management. Specifically, it was the sonographic identification of a viable ipsilateral ovary after observation, or the surgical documentation of a visibly viable residual ovary in a patient who underwent operative management.

There was no standardized management protocol during the study period, and management was based on surgeons' preferences. Patients with asymptomatic ovarian cysts were categorized into two groups based on the intended management during the first three months of life: early surgical intervention or observation. This time point is based on literature describing a decline in maternal gonadotropin levels at approximately three months of age, corresponding to an expected spontaneous resolution of congenital ovarian cysts. Patients with cysts that underwent prenatal resolution or a prenatal procedure, and those who underwent emergency surgical intervention, were excluded from this analysis as an observation period was not applicable.

### Laparoscopic resection of a torted ovarian dermoid cyst [^112TEBc3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Laparoscopy is the preferred technique for diagnosing and treating the acute abdomen. In our case, no preoperative scan was done, and it was not until general anesthesia was induced that a mass was felt. Although there was bleeding from the ruptured, ischemic cyst, the true cyst wall remained intact. Unfortunately, we did not have a large enough retrieval bag available on the day, so a controlled aspiration of the cyst was done prior to placing it in a retrieval bag. No 'dermoidal contents' were spilled, and the operation was completed with a thorough washout with normal saline. In our opinion, there was no chance of chemical peritonitis from the procedure.

### Laparoscopic single-site "in-bag" ovarian dermoid cystectomy in a 16-week-pregnant patient [^112VLfZG]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to demonstrate a novel "in-bag" ovarian cystectomy technique for a large adnexal mass in pregnancy. This stepwise demonstration was accompanied by a narrated video. It took place in an academic tertiary care hospital, involving a 26-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, at a gestational age of 7 weeks and 3 days. She presented to the emergency department with persistent left pelvic pain and was diagnosed with a 16 cm × 10 cm × 12 cm dermoid cyst. The patient re-presented at a gestational age of 16 weeks and 3 days, reporting worsening pelvic pain, leading to the decision for surgical intervention.

Laparoscopic transumbilical single-site surgery for managing adnexal masses during pregnancy has been shown to be feasible and safe [1–3]. However, single-site laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy poses challenges, particularly concerning suturing during pregnancy. Exteriorizing the ovary and cyst after intraperitoneal drainage may allow for faster and easier extracorporeal suturing. Nonetheless, if not performed in a bag, this process can increase the likelihood of cystic content spillage, which may result in peritonitis in cases of dermoid cysts. The adoption of a combination of in-bag and extracorporeal ovarian cystectomy presents a novel, minimally invasive approach that is cosmetic, safe, and effective.

Several helpful techniques are utilized in this novel combination technique:

- **Creating an umbilical incision**: Ensure an incision of at least 2 cm or one large enough to better manipulate both the surgical bag and adnexal mass.

### Struma ovarii: Role of imaging [^111ZBpL8]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

- **Ultrasound**: Whilst a mature teratoma or dermoid cyst presents on ultrasound as a cystic lesion with a densely echogenic tubercle (termed a Rokitansky nodule or nidus), which projects into the cystic lumen, as well as associated sound attenuation due to sebaceous material and hair within the cyst cavity or recognizable fluid–fluid levels from the sebum floating above aqueous material, the ultrasound features of a struma ovarii are quite indistinct. As struma ovarii presents with a variety of non-specific appearances and usually manifests as a multilocular cystic ovarian mass with solid components of various amounts, the ultrasound typically demonstrates these non-specific heterogeneous solid cystic features.

- **Fig. 3**: Difference in ultrasound features between struma ovarii and ovarian dermoid cyst. (a) Predominantly cystic struma ovarii typically mimicking an epithelial ovarian tumor (either cystadenoma or borderline ovarian tumor) in the right ovary of a 51-year-old patient presenting with non-specific abdominal cramps. Some thicker septations are seen (arrow) between otherwise cystic areas presenting with anechoic fluid and posterior acoustic enhancement. (b) Right 1.5-cm and (c) left 5.1-cm dermoid cyst in a 24-year-old woman. Both lesions on ultrasound have the typical pattern of high attenuation within the cyst (arrows) representing its fatty component.

### Multiple intraabdominal parasitic cystic teratomas [^11698kbh]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

We report an interesting case of multiple intraabdominal dermoids in a patient who had undergone an excision of an ovarian dermoid cyst earlier and presented with a recurrence of symptoms. She had masses all over the abdominal wall, omentum, and pouch of Douglas, and a dermoid cyst in the ovary as well. It is generally believed that autoamputation and reimplantation of an ovarian dermoid cyst is the most common cause of omental teratomas. Abdominal pain is the main presenting symptom of these tumors, and on physical examination, a mobile abdominal or pelvic mass is often found. Both ultrasonography with color-flow Doppler ultrasonography and computed tomography are helpful in the diagnosis of dermoid tumors, but the correct diagnosis of omental localization is extremely difficult. We removed all the masses laparoscopically. A literature search did not reveal such extensive parasitic dermoids in any patient.

### Unilateral ovarian dermoid cyst accompanied by an ipsilateral paratubal cyst in a girl with Proteus Syndrome discovered by laparoscopic surgery [^115KFubw]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Proteus syndrome is a rare hamartomatous disorder characterized by the overgrowth of multiple tissues in a mosaic pattern. Tumors of the genitourinary tract in Proteus syndrome are uncommon.

- **Case**: We report a 5-year-old girl with Proteus syndrome who developed a cystic mass in the pelvic cavity. The cyst was discovered by ultrasonographic examination and was ultimately identified as a unilateral ovarian dermoid cyst accompanied by an ipsilateral paratubal cyst via laparoscopic surgery.

- **Summary and conclusion**: Proteus syndrome accompanied by an ovarian cyst is rare in girls. The possibility of an underlying ovarian cyst requiring surgical intervention should be considered in Proteus syndrome cases.

### Ovarian dermoid cyst complicated by small bowel obstruction, entero-ovarian fistula formation, and malignant degeneration [^113HDo2C]. Clinical Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Dermoid cysts, or mature cystic teratomas, are complicated by malignant degeneration in only 1–2% of cases. Rarely, dermoid cysts result in complications such as small bowel obstruction or entero-ovarian fistula formation. We present the case of a 59-year-old female with a known dermoid cyst who presented with leukocytosis and was discovered to have a small bowel obstruction at the level of an ileo-ovarian fistula. The patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and short segment small bowel resection. A review of the surgical pathology revealed areas of malignant degeneration within the dermoid cyst to squamous cell carcinoma. To our knowledge, this is only the second reported case of an ovarian dermoid cyst complicated by small bowel obstruction, entero-ovarian fistula formation, and malignant degeneration.

Mature ovarian teratomas are a benign subset of germ cell tumors (GCT) often diagnosed during reproductive years and are the most common GCT among children and adolescents. Many are found incidentally on unrelated imaging. There are no definitive guidelines on the management of these teratomas, particularly in the pediatric population. This case presents the management of an adolescent patient with an incidentally found ovarian teratoma. A discussion of contemporary literature also identifies a significant gap in the literature for definitive guidelines in pediatric patients with mature teratomas.

### Treatment and outcomes of congenital ovarian cysts: A study by the Canadian Consortium for Research in Pediatric Surgery (CanCORPS) [^113opGQP]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Ovarian cysts are the most common cystic abdominal mass necessitating referral to a pediatric surgeon, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 2625 live births. Most ovarian cysts detected in the prenatal period are asymptomatic and are thought to be the result of maternal hormonal stimulation. Many of these cysts can be observed with serial ultrasounds until they resolve or regress spontaneously. However, tremendous variability exists in the evaluation and management of these lesions.

Despite their benign nature, fetal ovarian cysts have been associated with a variety of complications, including torsion and hemorrhage. Early surgical intervention has been proposed as a way to mitigate the risk of ovarian loss due to such complications. However, despite the intention to spare ovarian tissue, most surgical interventions result in oophorectomy.

Although nonsurgical management has succeeded in many patients, no standardized observation period or surveillance protocols have been established for the longitudinal follow-up of infants with fetal ovarian cysts. There are reports of cysts being observed for up to 2 years until complete resolution. Moreover, there is a paucity of literature comparing the long-term outcomes and risks of nonsurgical and surgical management.

We investigated the management strategies and outcomes of congenital ovarian cysts in a national cohort of patients. The primary objectives for this study were to identify the incidence of spontaneous cyst resolution and to identify the clinical and sonographic predictors of intervention for congenital ovarian cysts.

### Effect of quality of gynaecological ultrasonography on management of patients with suspected ovarian cancer: a randomised controlled trial [^113EVfRF]. The Lancet Oncology (2008). High credibility.

The diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography for differentiating between benign and malignant adnexal masses is proportional to the expertise of the operator. However, it is not known if improved diagnostic accuracy will affect the management of these tumors. We assessed the effect of the quality of gynecological ultrasonography on the management of patients with suspected ovarian cancer in a randomized controlled trial.

- **Methods**: A total of 165 patients referred to the regional gynecological cancer centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (London, UK), between June 7, 2004, and April 23, 2006, with suspected adnexal tumors met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 150 patients were randomly assigned to either level II (routine) ultrasonography (n = 73) or level III (expert) ultrasonography (n = 77). The primary endpoint was the number of major surgical staging procedures, including a laparotomy and at least an oophorectomy and omental biopsy, in each group of the study. Secondary endpoints included the total number of surgical procedures, number of minimally invasive procedures (e.g. operative laparoscopy or ultrasonography-guided cyst aspiration), number of additional diagnostic tests (e.g. CT or laparoscopy), number of follow-up scans, diagnostic accuracy of level II and III ultrasonography, and duration of hospital stay. All analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered on the Controlled Trials website http://www.controlled-trials.com/mrct/trial/230201/ISRCTN02631195.

### Triple synchronous tumour of female genital tract: cervical squamous cell carcinoma, right ovarian dermoid cyst and left ovarian benign Brenner tumour [^112RUEj1]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Synchronous tumours of two different histological types are not uncommon in the female genital tract, but triple synchronous tumours of three or more different histological types are extremely rare. We describe a case of a 48-year-old female patient who presented with cervical growth and bilateral ovarian masses. Pathological evaluation of the surgical specimen revealed synchronous cervical squamous cell carcinoma, right ovarian dermoid cyst, and left ovarian benign Brenner tumour. The patient was treated as per the carcinoma cervix protocol and is disease-free at a 1-year follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such an occurrence. This occurrence cannot be related to any known hereditary syndromes; hence, it may be considered a chance association. Although rare, awareness of such an occurrence is important for the surgeon, radiologist, and the surgical pathologist for proper diagnosis and management.

### Early abdominal pregnancy complicated by parasitic dermoid cyst: Diagnosis by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and management by laparoendoscopic single-site surgery [^113BMkg1]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

A 26-year-old primigravida patient was referred with suspicion of ectopic pregnancy 39 days after her last menstrual period. Her serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin value was 3812 mIU/mL. As we suspected the existence of ectopic pregnancy with bilateral dermoid cysts, laparoendoscopic single-site surgery was performed. After dissection of dense pelvic adhesion, cystectomy was performed for a left ovarian dermoid cyst. Although there was a right ovary in the correct position, a parasitic dermoid cyst firmly attached to the peritoneal surface of the cul-de-sac was identified. After excision of the parasitic dermoid cyst, early abdominal pregnancy tissue implanted in the peritoneal hollow of the right deep pararectal space was identified under the guidance of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and was excised. With systemic administration of methotrexate, the postoperative course was uneventful.

### Virilizing ovarian dermoid cyst with Leydig cells [^116wC5NQ]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

The clinical observation of virilization is a rare finding with several possible explanations. Ovarian tumors causing virilization are exceedingly rare and mostly occur in post-menopausal women. No cases of virilization from a testosterone-producing ovarian dermoid in the adolescent female age group have been reported. The most frequent germ cell tumor derived from the ovaries is the benign cystic teratoma (dermoid), accounting for 25% of all ovarian neoplasms. Teratomas consist of tissues representing the ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm. Usually, the tumors are asymptomatic, but they can occasionally cause severe pain if there is torsion or if sebaceous material perforates the cyst wall, leading to reactive peritonitis.

- **Case**: A 12-year-old female was found to have a large 35 x 19 x 12 cm ovarian mature cystic teratoma arising from her right ovary. The patient also displayed evidence of masculinization demonstrated by a deepening voice and clitoromegaly. The dermoid was producing large amounts of testosterone from a nest of Leydig cells found pathologically in the mass.

- **Conclusion**: Benign cystic teratomas can produce active hormones, albeit rarely. This is an important consideration when performing ovarian cystectomy for the removal of a benign cystic teratoma.

### Ovarian dermoid cyst super-infected with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus leading to the misdiagnosis of appendicitis in an adolescent [^117ATUDE]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Mature cystic teratomas (dermoid cysts) are the most common ovarian tumor in adolescents. Super-infection of a dermoid cyst is a rare event usually associated with a concomitant infection.

- **Case**: A 14-year-old female was transferred to our institution with five days of fevers and abdominal pain. CT of the abdomen/pelvis was read as acute appendicitis with a 7.6 cm right adnexal dermoid cyst. The patient was treated for appendicitis but later found to have an infected dermoid cyst, primarily infected with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, which led to the misdiagnosis of appendicitis.

- **Summary and conclusion**: Super-infection of an ovarian dermoid cyst is an extremely rare event. We recommend that previously described evaluation, surgical management, and ovarian conservation be employed in all cases of ovarian dermoid cysts.

### Guideline no. 403: Initial investigation and management of adnexal masses [^114WntV9]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2020). High credibility.

In considering diagnostic investigations for ovarian cysts, particularly in relation to tumor markers, the SOGC 2020 guidelines emphasize the need to recognize that the sensitivity and specificity of the cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) as a tumor marker are higher in postmenopausal patients. This is because many benign clinical conditions that can elevate CA-125 levels are more prevalent in the premenopausal population, whereas the majority of epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer cases occur in the postmenopausal population.

### Intraoperative rupture of ovarian dermoid cysts in the pediatric and adolescent population: Should this change your surgical management [^1112Avbv]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2017). High credibility.

The study aimed to determine the incidence of chemical peritonitis after cystectomy for ovarian dermoid cysts with intraoperative cyst rupture in the pediatric and adolescent population. It also examined the intraoperative and postoperative outcomes of cystectomies performed using laparoscopy and laparotomy, particularly in cases with intraoperative cyst rupture.

The research was designed as a retrospective cohort study involving female patients who underwent ovarian cystectomy with proven ovarian dermoid pathology between July 2007 and July 2015. The setting for this study was Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, Texas.

The study participants included 144 patients aged between 1 and 21 years who underwent ovarian cystectomy with confirmed benign ovarian dermoid histology based on pathology reports.

- **Interventions and main outcome measures**:
	- Occurrence of spill of cyst contents, chemical peritonitis, postoperative complications, and hospital readmissions.

The results indicated that 144 female patients underwent cystectomy (38 laparotomy and 106 laparoscopy), all resulting in benign ovarian dermoid histology. The mean age was 12.4 ± 4.1 years (range, 1–21), and the mean cyst size was 9.2 ± 6.4 cm (range, 1–30 cm). No patients had elevated tumor markers. Notably, 42 (29.1%) patients presented with torsion, 73 (50.7%) experienced cyst fluid spill, and there were no cases of chemical peritonitis. Few significant differences were observed between cases performed via laparoscopy and laparotomy and those with and without intraoperative cyst rupture resulting in content spill. Cases performed by laparotomy were found to have larger cysts.

The objective of this study is to assess the natural history of ultrasonographically diagnosed benign ovarian teratomas in asymptomatic women.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of 408 women (mean age 36.6 years, range 14–81 years) diagnosed with an ovarian teratoma by transvaginal ultrasonography (except eight who only had a transabdominal study done) between January 2003 and December 2013 at a single tertiary care institution. Six hundred thirteen women were diagnosed with ovarian teratoma, of whom 205 were promptly treated surgically, leaving 408 patients followed conservatively with follow-up scans at 3 and 6 months from diagnosis and then yearly. The ultrasonographic diagnosis of a benign ovarian teratoma required at least one of the following features: a cystic mass with mixed echogenicity, thick band-like echoes, a fat-fluid level, or echogenic tubercle with posterior shadowing. Clinical, ultrasonographic, and histologic data (in case of surgery) were retrieved for analysis.

Results: During follow-up, 130 of 408 (31.8%) women underwent surgery. The main reason for surgery was the physician's recommendation according to our protocol (n = 115). One patient had adnexal torsion. Most surgeries (112/130 [86.2%]) were performed within the first 5 years after diagnosis. The remainder (278/408) is still being followed (median time 45.6 months, range 6–147 months). The vast majority of these lesions had no change, and women remain asymptomatic. Histologic diagnosis of tumors removed surgically revealed a benign ovarian teratoma in 103 of 130 (79.2%) of the women.

### Management of the adnexal mass [^114i2UZw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Adnexal masses are commonly encountered in gynecologic practice and often present both diagnostic and management challenges. This is partly because the majority of adnexal masses identified represent benign entities that do not necessarily require active intervention. However, a small subset represents malignant processes that require both timely and appropriate surgical intervention for optimal outcomes.

To determine the best diagnostic and management strategies in this setting, physicians must effectively triage risk for malignancy by having a thorough understanding of the entities on the differential diagnosis and carefully considering the clinical context for each individual patient. Optimal selection and interpretation of diagnostic tests are enhanced by both an accurate clinical risk assessment and an understanding of the inherent accuracy of diagnostic tests considered in this setting.

The purpose of this document is to provide clinicians with a practical strategy for distinguishing benign and malignant masses in the nonpregnant woman. Our approach addresses the critical elements of accurate risk stratification, reviews the performance of diagnostic tests for identifying malignancy, and offers evidence-based management algorithms to optimize outcomes for women with adnexal masses.

### Diagnosis of an autoamputated ovary with dermoid cyst during a cesarean section [^113ADN7y]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

To report an extremely rare case of an autoamputated ovary with a dermoid cyst diagnosed during a cesarean section and review the literature, a case was presented from a tertiary hospital involving a 33-year-old pregnant woman. She underwent a cesarean section during which an incidental diagnosis was made of the absence of the right ovary, which was found implanted in the cul-de-sac.

The intervention involved a cesarean section and the extraction of a pedunculated tumor formation from the cul-de-sac through adhesiolysis. Histologic analysis of the extracted morphoma confirmed the diagnosis of a dermoid cyst with the coexistence of residual ovarian tissue.

The patient experienced an uneventful postpartum period and was subsequently discharged home. Ovarian autoamputation is an extremely rare phenomenon with uncertain etiology; it may develop after ovarian torsion or torsion of a dermoid cyst and may be asymptomatic. The usual site of implantation is the greater omentum.

### Generalised purulent peritonitis and small bowel obstruction due to a spontaneously perforated ovarian dermoid cyst [^113gb9sq]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

We outline the narrative of a 28-year-old woman who initially presented to the emergency department with vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. Blood tests revealed significantly raised inflammatory markers and acute renal failure. Initially, this was attributed to gastroenteritis due to recent foreign travel, but further investigations and radiological imaging revealed a large right ovarian dermoid cyst with a significant amount of free intra-abdominal fluid and small bowel dilation. She underwent laparotomy, which revealed a spontaneously perforated right ovarian dermoid cyst resulting in generalized purulent peritonitis and small bowel obstruction due to bowel adherence at the perforation site. Meticulous adhesiolysis, right salpingo-oophorectomy, and extensive peritoneal lavage were performed, with a good postoperative recovery. Spontaneous perforation of an ovarian dermoid cyst, without an associated torsion, is extremely rare, but it should be considered in cases of peritonitis and bowel obstruction of unclear cause with a concomitant finding of a dermoid cyst.

### Minimally invasive management of the prenatally torsed ovarian cyst [^112r7dTg]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Fetal and neonatal ovarian cysts are frequently detected by ultrasonography. The presence of these lesions can result in adnexal torsion in utero with autoamputation. Historically, these have been removed by laparotomy.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was conducted at a single children's hospital from October 1996 to September 2001.

- **Results**: Six cases of torsion of ovarian cysts were removed laparoscopically. Five of the six patients had a prenatal ultrasound diagnosis. The sixth had the cyst detected incidentally by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 months of age. All cysts were complex by ultrasound criteria. All six procedures were performed via a 2-port laparoscopic approach. The average age at surgery was 3.7 months (range: 9 days to 7.5 months). There were no postoperative complications, and five patients were discharged on the day of surgery.

- **Conclusion**: Laparoscopy offers a safe, effective, and cosmetic means of managing perinatal torsion of ovarian cysts.

### Peritoneal implantation of squamous cell carcinoma following rupture of a dermoid cyst during laparoscopic removal [^111FB5ou]. Gynecologic Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

In recent years, there has been a move toward using laparoscopy in the management of presumed benign ovarian masses. This paper discusses the use of laparoscopy for ovarian masses, particularly dermoid cysts, focusing on the implications for unexpected malignancies.

- **Case**: We report a case involving a dermoid cyst that was removed at laparoscopy and was subsequently found to contain a squamous cell carcinoma. Spillage of the cyst's contents occurred at the time of removal. At staging laparotomy, peritoneal implants of the tumor were found, upgrading the tumor from FIGO stage Ia to IIc.

- **Conclusion**: Spillage rates of dermoid cyst content with laparoscopic removal are inevitably higher than with excision at laparotomy. It remains controversial whether upstaging from FIGO stage Ia to IIc affects prognosis; however, in this case, it led to aggressive adjuvant therapy. This imposed significant additional morbidity, including loss of fertility, on the patient. One should be aware of the possibility of unexpected malignancy when the decision is made to manage an ovarian mass laparoscopically.

### Laparoscopic management of an ovarian dermoid cyst containing a mandibular structure with teeth: A novel surgical approach [^111g9XgP]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

The presence of ectodermal-derived tissue, including teeth, in an ovarian dermoid cyst is a common occurrence. The presence of a fully formed mandibular structure with teeth, however, is rare, and there are few case reports in the literature that discuss its surgical management.

We report a case of an adolescent girl found to have a mandibular structure with teeth in her dermoid cyst at the time of her laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy. The novel surgical approach used involved the extraction of the cyst contents from the abdominal cavity.

Use of an arthroscopic surgical blade to morcellate the mandibular-like bone allowed for completion of the procedure laparoscopically, without laparotomy for specimen extraction, allowing the patient to benefit from the advantages of minimally invasive surgery.

### Impact of cystectomy on ovarian reserve: Review of the literature [^113HAzUD]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Ovarian cysts are common in the reproductive age. Pathologic cysts such as endometriomas and dermoids often require surgical intervention if symptomatic. Laparoscopic cystectomy is the first-line treatment for these cysts and is associated with better pain control and less recurrence than drainage or cyst ablation procedures. There has been an emerging concern about the effect of ovarian cystectomy on ovarian reserve, with some evidence of both short-term and long-term reduction in ovarian reserve. Certain cyst characteristics, including endometrioma pathology, large cyst size, and bilateral presentation, are associated with a greater decline in ovarian reserve after cystectomy. The impact of surgery on ovarian reserve can be minimized by selecting the appropriate surgery for the patient, careful tissue handling, and limited use of electrosurgery. Patients should be counseled on the risks of surgery on reproductive potential, and the management plan should be individualized based on the patient's symptoms and reproductive goals.

### Dermoid cyst management and outcomes: a review of over 1000 cases at a single institution [^1162DU2s]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). High credibility.

Mature cystic teratomas represent nearly 60% of benign ovarian neoplasms across all age groups.

This study aimed to update existing descriptive studies of ovarian teratomas, including the epidemiology, rate of torsion or malignancy, and treatment modalities in a large modern cohort of patients.

This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of all pathology-confirmed cases of ovarian teratoma that underwent surgery at one tertiary care institution from 2004 to 2015. Patient demographics, ovarian cyst characteristics, surgical approach and timing, rate of spillage, and surgical complications were examined.

A total of 1054 cases of ovarian teratoma were identified during the study period. There were 113 cases (10.7%) of bilateral teratoma. The mean age at diagnosis was 38 years, and the average cyst size was 6.26 cm. The overall rate of torsion was 5.6%, with a higher rate of torsion associated with increasing cyst size. More than 70% of cases were treated with minimally invasive surgery, which was associated with decreased perioperative complications but an increased risk of cyst spillage. Among 394 patients with cyst spillage, only one patient developed chemical peritonitis. The malignant transformation rate of mature cystic teratoma in this cohort was 1.1%.

This cohort included 100 pregnant women with mature teratoma. Pregnant patients were more likely to have minimally invasive surgery in the first trimester of pregnancy and more likely to undergo laparotomy in the second or third trimester of pregnancy.

### The recurrence rate of ovarian dermoid cysts in pediatric and adolescent girls [^111gyV5G]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

The study aimed to assess the rate of recurrence of ovarian dermoid cysts in pediatric and adolescent girls at the Hospital for Sick Children. This was achieved through a retrospective chart review of all dermoid cysts surgically managed at the hospital from January 2003 to June 2012, in Toronto, Canada.

Participants included 66 adolescent and pediatric patients under 18 years old who underwent ovarian cystectomy for their dermoid cysts, either by laparoscopy (n = 40) or laparotomy (n = 26).

- **Main outcome measures**: Total dermoid cyst recurrence, recurrence after laparoscopy versus laparotomy, follow-up imaging completed, and ultrasonographic identification of other ovarian cysts in follow-up. Data were assessed with the Fisher exact test where appropriate (P < .05).

- **Results**: The mean age of patients at the time of surgery was 12.9 years (range 2.5–18.1). Among the patients, 25 out of 66 (38%) received no follow-up, 6 out of 66 (9%) were followed by a single ultrasonography, and 35 out of 66 (53%) were followed with annual ultrasonography for up to 5 years. Thirty-five patients completed their initial ultrasonography, where 19 out of 35 (54%) were diagnosed with new ovarian cysts, including 6 functional/hemorrhagic, 3 dermoid, and 10 unspecified cysts. All new dermoids were suspected at the first follow-up ultrasonography (6 out of 35), but 3 required a second follow-up ultrasonography for confirmation. Overall, 7 out of 66 (11%) had recurrent or persistent dermoid cysts, of which 2 (3%) required repeat surgery. There was no significant impact on the type of surgery and dermoid recurrence.

In conclusion, the incidence of new dermoid cysts after initial surgery did not significantly differ with the type of surgical approach employed.

### Chemical peritonitis: A rare complication of an iatrogenic ovarian dermoid cyst rupture [^115k5kz3]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Laparoscopy is the standard method for the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian dermoid cysts, representing 10% to 15% of all ovarian tumors. This procedure offers many advantages, including less postoperative pain, lower risk of wound complications, early ambulation, and more rapid convalescence. The risk of adhesion formation is also reduced. However, in the case of an ovarian dermoid cyst, the laparoscopic approach could result in chemical peritonitis caused by the spilled contents of a ruptured dermoid cyst. We report a case of chemical peritonitis following the rupture of an ovarian dermoid cyst during laparoscopy. Two operations were required, and medical treatment was not beneficial. We discuss a possible new medication for the treatment of this complication and compare this case with other recent reports.

### Laparoscopy versus laparotomy for pediatric ovarian dermoids [^1172CwvB]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

With increased surgeon comfort using laparoscopy, we hypothesized that resection of pediatric ovarian dermoids using laparoscopy would yield a shorter length of stay and no increase in morbidity or recurrence compared to laparotomy.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was conducted across eleven pediatric hospitals. Patients aged 2 to 21 who underwent resection of an ovarian dermoid from 2010 to 2020 were included. Patient characteristics, operative details, and outcomes by approach were evaluated using Chi-squared and Wilcoxon-Mann tests.

- **Results**: A total of 466 patients were included, with a median age of 14.4 years and a median follow-up of 4.0 months. Of these, 279 patients underwent laparoscopy (60%), 139 underwent laparotomy (30%), and 48 underwent laparoscopy converted to laparotomy (10%). There were no differences in rates of tumor spillage by approach (p = 0.15). Sixty-five percent of patients underwent ovarian-sparing surgery, while 35% underwent oophorectomy. Length of stay was significantly shorter among patients who underwent laparoscopy (1 day versus 2 days for laparotomy and converted cases, p < 0.0001). There were no differences in rates of suspected recurrence or reoperation (p = 0.19 and p = 0.57, respectively).

- **Conclusion**: Patients who underwent laparoscopy experienced no differences in the rates of tumor spillage, recurrence, or reoperation, and had a shorter length of stay compared to laparotomy. Laparoscopy is an acceptable approach for the resection of pediatric ovarian dermoids.

### Diagnosis of the most frequent benign ovarian cysts: Is ultrasonography accurate and reproducible [^115JKS7P]. Journal of Women's Health (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility and accuracy of B-mode ultrasonographic features in diagnosing three different kinds of benign ovarian cysts: ovarian endometrioma, mature teratoma, and serous cyst.

- **Methods**: Digitally stored B-mode sonographic images of 98 women, who underwent surgery for the presence of an adnexal mass, were evaluated by five different examiners with varying levels of experience. The histological type of each mass was predicted based on typical B-mode benign findings. These were identified as the ground-glass endocystic pattern for endometrioma, the echogenic pattern with or without acoustic shadow for cystic teratoma, and anechoic cyst without endocystic vegetations for a serous cyst. To assess reproducibility, intraobserver and interobserver agreements were calculated using the kappa index.

- **Results**: The intraobserver agreement was good to very good for all examiners and patterns (kappa = 0.71–1), except for the dermoid cyst, which showed moderate agreement (kappa = 0.42) for the highly experienced operator. Interobserver agreement was good for all experts for endometrioma (kappa = 0.66–0.78) and serous cyst (kappa = 0.82–1), but was moderate to good for cystic teratoma (kappa = 0.51–0.72). Interobserver agreement between experts and highly experienced operators was fair (kappa = 0.33–0.36) for teratoma, and good to very good for endometrioma (kappa = 0.70–0.83) and serous cyst (kappa = 0.76–0.82). The accuracy for different kinds of cysts was comparable among different operators.

- **Conclusions**: Typical features of benign ovarian cysts allow for reproducible and moderately accurate diagnosis using B-mode ultrasonography.

### The management of ovarian cysts in postmenopausal women [^11647rcs]. RCOG (2016). High credibility.

In the context of ovarian cysts in postmenopausal women, specifically regarding tumor markers, the RCOG 2016 guidelines recommend against using CA-125 levels in isolation to determine cyst malignancy. Normal CA-125 values should not be used to exclude ovarian cancer due to the nonspecific nature of the test, although a very high value may assist in reaching a diagnosis.

### Laparoscopic resection of a torted ovarian dermoid cyst [^1117SWLX]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

A dermoid is a benign, cystic lesion containing tissue from all three embryonic layers: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. Ovarian dermoids constitute 10–15% of ovarian tumours and typically occur in young women in their reproductive years, though they have been reported in prepubertal and elderly patients. These structures grow slowly; a recent study found a growth rate of 1.8 mm/year in pre-menopausal women.

- **Presentation and symptoms**: Ovarian dermoids present with discomfort, pain, or pressure symptoms, often becoming apparent when a complication arises. Torsion is the most common complication, occurring in approximately 3.5% of cases. Rupture, which may lead to chemical peritonitis and subsequent granulomatous peritoneal deposits, occurs in up to 2% of cases. Rarely, a dermoid cyst may rupture into the bladder, leading to urinary tract infections or the unusual symptom of pilimiction. Rupture into the bowel, with passage of dermoid structures per rectum, has also been reported. Less than 1% of dermoid cysts are malignant.

- **Laparoscopic cystectomy**: The first laparoscopic cystectomy was performed in 1989, and since then, various spillage rates have been reported. This variation is partly due to differing definitions of 'spillage'; even purposeful puncture of the cyst is judged by some to be 'spillage'. A recent study of 83 cases reported a spillage rate of approximately 66%, similar to other studies, but associated with no cases of chemical peritonitis. Similarly, a study of 12 laparoscopic dermoid cyst resections, all involving intraoperative spillage and copious lavage, did not lead to adverse outcomes.
