Rate control afib with rvr

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about acute rate control for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate hemodynamic assessment and when to cardiovert. Then, I should verify first-line pharmacologic choices for stable patients and how heart failure status modifies agent selection. Next, I will examine dosing nuances, onset of action, and safety trade-offs between diltiazem and metoprolol. After that, I need to check second-line options like digoxin and amiodarone, including guideline cautions. I will then review adjuncts such as IV magnesium and combination therapy. Finally, I should confirm rate targets, monitoring, disposition, and special scenarios like WPW, postoperative AF, and sepsis, and close with a concise synthesis of the algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the initial priorities: assess hemodynamic stability immediately because instability mandates emergent synchronized electrical cardioversion rather than pharmacologic rate control, and I should not delay that decision while I sort through drugs, since delays worsen outcomes in shock or ischemia [^notfound] [^114z1UZd].

> Wait, let me verify the definition of instability I'm using: hypotension, ongoing chest pain or ischemia, pulmonary edema, altered mental status, or signs of shock all qualify and should trigger immediate cardioversion; if the patient is stable, I can proceed with pharmacologic rate control while preparing for rhythm control if indicated [^114XsYAu].

> Next, I should review first-line agents for stable patients without decompensated heart failure: beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are recommended equivalently, with the choice individualized to comorbidities and adrenergic tone; I need to ensure I avoid CCBs if there is moderate or severe LV systolic dysfunction or decompensated HF because of negative inotropy [^111Sdrky] [^116RssEu] [^1135qgne].

> Hold on, I should verify onset and relative efficacy: diltiazem tends to achieve rate control faster than metoprolol in ED cohorts, with median times around 15 minutes for diltiazem versus 30 minutes for metoprolol, though sustained control rates are similar; weight-based diltiazem dosing improves early success, and a recent meta-analysis suggests metoprolol may have fewer total adverse events than diltiazem, though hypotension and bradycardia rates were not statistically different in pooled analyses [^117Nsyuh] [^notfound] [^112GLsyE].

> I will now examine dosing specifics I should not gloss over: for diltiazem, 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus over 2 minutes with a 0.35 mg/kg repeat in 15 minutes if needed is standard, and weight-based dosing outperforms lower fixed doses for achieving HR < 100 bpm by 30 minutes; for metoprolol, 2.5–5 mg IV every 5 minutes to a total of 15 mg is typical, with slower onset but comparable sustained control; I should double-check for hypotension or bradycardia after each dose and be ready to adjust [^1174Gczn].

> But wait, what if the patient has heart failure with reduced EF or is in decompensated HF; I need to ensure I avoid IV nondihydropyridine CCBs because they can worsen LV function, and instead favor beta-blockers cautiously if tolerated, digoxin, or IV amiodarone if first-line agents fail or are contraindicated; I should confirm that guidelines support amiodarone in critically ill or decompensated HF when beta-blockers and CCBs are not suitable [^116RssEu] [^111jfJvB] [^116MWexS].

> Let me consider digoxin carefully: it has a slow onset with peak effect at 6 hours and limited efficacy during exertion, so it is not ideal for rapid control; it is reasonable as adjunct or when beta-blockers and CCBs are ineffective or contraindicated, and it can be combined with other agents, but I should monitor for toxicity and interactions, especially with amiodarone or verapamil [^115niqiX] [^112ekckL] [^113E8pGw].

> I should confirm second-line and special-case options: IV amiodarone is reasonable for acute rate control in critically ill patients or those with decompensated HF when beta-blockers and CCBs are ineffective or contraindicated, with the caveat that amiodarone may cardiovert and thus necessitate stroke risk assessment and anticoagulation planning; magnesium sulfate can be added to standard therapy and modestly improves rate and rhythm control in nonpostoperative cohorts without clear excess adverse effects [^116MWexS] [^111jfJvB] [^116Q1V7p] [^117988Vp].

> Hold on, I should verify whether combination therapy helps: combining diltiazem with digoxin can yield faster and more durable control than diltiazem alone, with fewer fluctuations, though I need to monitor closely for bradycardia and drug interactions; contemporary guidelines also endorse combination rate control when a single agent is insufficient, provided we avoid excessive bradycardia [^115HLdau] [^113rz33a].

> Next, I should review rate targets and monitoring cadence: for most stable patients without HF, a lenient resting HR target of < 100–110 bpm is acceptable and noninferior to strict targets in many settings, whereas stricter control (< 80 bpm at rest, < 110 bpm with moderate exertion) may be reasonable in those with suspected tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy, persistent symptoms, or ICD/CRT considerations; I need to ensure reassessment every 15–30 minutes initially and titrate to effect while watching blood pressure and rhythm [^113b9KYs] [^112uGbqv] [^1177LmhS] [^115yL76f].

> I need to ensure I address anticoagulation and disposition early: calculate stroke risk with CHA2DS2-VASc and initiate anticoagulation unless contraindicated, and use validated tools like RED-AF or AFFORD to guide admission versus discharge once rate control is achieved and precipitating factors are addressed; I should double-check that DOACs are first-line for most patients without mechanical valves or significant CKD [^114XsYAu] [^111Sdrky].

> Let me reconsider special scenarios so I don't miss anything: in suspected WPW with pre-excitation, I must avoid AV nodal blockers and proceed to procainamide or urgent cardioversion; in postoperative AF, I should treat triggers like pain, hypoxia, and anemia while using beta-blockers preferentially; in sepsis-associated AF, beta-blockers may achieve faster early control than amiodarone or digoxin, though comparative effectiveness varies by time horizon; in valvular AF such as rheumatic mitral stenosis, rate control is reasonable but anticoagulation with VKA is indicated given embolic risk [^1136nTnE] [^113DtqfB] [^115mbMRs].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated that diltiazem is categorically superior to metoprolol; I should correct that to "faster onset on average" rather than "superior", because sustained control rates are comparable and agent selection should remain individualized to comorbidities, hemodynamics, and adrenergic milieu, with attention to safety profiles and patient-specific risks [^117Nsyuh] [^112GLsyE] [^111Sdrky].

> To synthesize the bedside algorithm: if unstable, cardiovert immediately; if stable and EF > 40%, use IV metoprolol or diltiazem with attention to faster onset with diltiazem and fewer total adverse events with metoprolol in pooled analyses; if stable with EF ≤ 40% or decompensated HF, avoid IV CCBs, favor cautious beta-blockade, digoxin, or amiodarone as indicated; add magnesium and consider combination therapy if monotherapy fails; titrate to lenient targets in most and stricter targets when tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy is suspected; and ensure anticoagulation and appropriate disposition planning [^111Sdrky] [^116RssEu] [^116Q1V7p] [^113rz33a] [^113b9KYs].

Rate control in AF with RVR aims to reduce heart rate and relieve symptoms using **beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers** as first-line agents [^111Sdrky] [^111Sdrky], with digoxin or amiodarone reserved for specific scenarios such as heart failure or contraindications [^115niqiX] [^116MWexS]. For most patients, a **lenient target of < 100–110 bpm** is appropriate [^113b9KYs] [^115yL76f]; stricter targets (< 80 bpm at rest) are reserved for persistent symptoms or tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy [^1177LmhS] [^112uGbqv]. IV magnesium can be added to improve rate control and rhythm outcomes [^116Q1V7p] [^117988Vp]. Avoid nondihydropyridine CCBs in moderate-to-severe LV systolic dysfunction or decompensated HF [^116RssEu] [^111jfJvB], and monitor for hypotension and bradycardia during titration [^112GLsyE].

## Pharmacological agents for rate control

### First-line agents

Key characteristics of first-line agents:

| **Aspect** | **Beta-blockers** | **Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs)** |
|-|-|-|
| Guideline position | first-line for acute rate control in hemodynamically stable patients without contraindications [^111Sdrky] | diltiazem or verapamil are first-line alternatives [^111Sdrky] |
| Efficacy and speed of rate control | effective and safe, with metoprolol associated with fewer adverse events than diltiazem [^112GLsyE] | diltiazem achieves rate control faster than metoprolol [^11737sxq] |
| Safety and adverse events | metoprolol associated with fewer adverse events than diltiazem [^112GLsyE] | but has more adverse events [^112GLsyE] |

---

### Second-line agents

Second-line options include **digoxin**, considered when beta-blockers or CCBs are ineffective or contraindicated, particularly in heart failure or sedentary patients [^115niqiX] [^113HzjY6], and **amiodarone**, used for acute rate control in critically ill patients or those with decompensated heart failure when first-line agents are ineffective or contraindicated [^116MWexS] [^111jfJvB].

---

### Adjunctive therapy

Adjunctive therapy with **intravenous magnesium** can be added to standard rate control measures to improve rate control and rhythm outcomes [^116Q1V7p] [^117988Vp].

---

## Clinical scenarios and contraindications

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended agents** | **Contraindications** |
|-|-|-|
| Hemodynamically stable patients without heart failure | - Beta-blockers <br/> - Nondihydropyridine CCBs | - Severe bradycardia <br/> - Hypotension <br/> - Reactive airway disease |
| Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) | - Beta-blockers <br/> - Nondihydropyridine CCBs <br/> - Digoxin | - Severe bradycardia <br/> - Hypotension |
| Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) | - Beta-blockers <br/> - Digoxin <br/> - Amiodarone | - Nondihydropyridine CCBs (diltiazem, verapamil) [^116RssEu] [^111jfJvB] |
| Critically ill patients or decompensated heart failure | - Amiodarone <br/> - Beta-blockers (cautiously) | - Nondihydropyridine CCBs [^116RssEu] [^111jfJvB] |

---

## Target heart rate and monitoring

- **Lenient rate control**: < 100–110 bpm at rest is appropriate for most patients [^113b9KYs] [^115yL76f].

- **Strict rate control**: < 80 bpm at rest and < 110 bpm during moderate exercise is reserved for persistent symptoms or tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy [^1177LmhS] [^112uGbqv].

- **Monitoring**: continuous cardiac monitoring during acute rate control; regular outpatient follow-up to assess symptoms, heart rate, and medication tolerance [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications and considerations

Potential complications include **hypotension and bradycardia** — monitor closely during titration and adjust therapy as needed [^112GLsyE] — and **tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy**, for which persistent rapid rates can cause reversible LV dysfunction; strict rate control may be necessary [^115VFjyq] [^1177LmhS]. Shared decision-making is essential to discuss rhythm- versus rate-control strategies, medication risks, and patient preferences [^113EdKv5] [^1129PNwd].

---

Rate control in AF with RVR centers on **beta-blockers or CCBs as first-line therapy**, with digoxin or amiodarone for specific indications, and a lenient target of < 100–110 bpm for most patients. Therapy should be individualized based on comorbidities, contraindications, and patient preferences, with close monitoring for adverse effects.

### What is the best agent for rate control of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response? [^11737sxq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common dysrhythmia associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although many patients have stable AF, some patients can present with a rapid ventricular response (RVR). In these patients, it is important to lower their heart rate. However, there are several options available for rate control in the emergency department setting.

Clinical Question

What is the most effective agent for rate control for the patient with AF in RVR?

Evidence Review

Studies retrieved included two prospective, randomized, double-blind studies and six retrospective cohort studies. These studies provide estimates of the efficacy and safety of calcium channel blockers and β-blockers for rate control in those with AF with RVR.

Conclusion

Based upon the available literature, diltiazem likely achieves rate control faster than metoprolol, though both agents seem safe and effective. Clinicians must consider the individual patient, clinical situation, and comorbidities when selecting a medication for rate control.

### Update on medical management of atrial fibrillation in the modern era [^116UKMQL]. Heart Rhythm (2009). Low credibility.

The management of atrial fibrillation involves control of the ventricular response rate, anticoagulation to reduce the risk of stroke and attempts to maintain sinus rhythm. The approach to patients with atrial fibrillation has become increasingly complex as therapeutic options have expanded. The ultimate reasons to treat atrial fibrillation include improvement in symptoms, reduction in adverse outcomes and improvement in survival. Despite increasing interest in non pharmacological approaches to treat and potentially cure atrial fibrillation, drugs remain the primary method to treat most patients. This review updates the present state-of-the-art regarding medical management of atrial fibrillation based on present and emerging evidence.

### Emergency medicine updates: atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response [^114XsYAu]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) may lead to stroke, heart failure, and death. When AF occurs in the context of a rapid ventricular rate/response (RVR), this can lead to complications, including hypoperfusion and cardiac ischemia. Emergency physicians play a key role in the diagnosis and management of this dysrhythmia.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning AF with RVR for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

Differentiating primary and secondary AF with RVR and evaluating hemodynamic stability are vital components of ED assessment and management. Troponin can assist in determining the risk of adverse outcomes, but universal troponin testing is not required in patients at low risk of acute coronary syndrome or coronary artery disease - especially patients with recurrent episodes of paroxysmal AF that are similar to their prior events. Emergent cardioversion is indicated in hemodynamically unstable patients. Rate or rhythm control should be pursued in hemodynamically stable patients. Elective cardioversion is a safe option for select patients and may reduce AF symptoms and risk of AF recurrence. Rate control using beta blockers or calcium channel blockers should be pursued in those with AF with RVR who do not undergo cardioversion. Anticoagulation is an important component of management, and several tools (e.g. CHA₂DS₂-VASc) are available to assist with this decision. Direct oral anticoagulants are the first-line medication class for anticoagulation. Disposition can be challenging, and several risk assessment tools (e.g. RED-AF, AFFORD, and the AFTER (complex, modified, and pragmatic) scores) are available to assist with disposition decisions.

Conclusion

An understanding of the recent updates in the literature concerning AF with RVR can assist emergency clinicians in the care of these patients.

### Ventricular rate control as an endpoint for treatment of atrial fibrillation [^112jWgbs]. Heart Rhythm (2004). Low credibility.

Interest in the use of rate control as an endpoint for managing atrial fibrillation likely will increase given the results of recent randomized clinical trials. As an endpoint, rate control has favorable attributes of ease of measurement and clear numerical definitions. Pharmacologic rate control is achieved in approximately 80% of patients in large clinical trials. Ablation and pacing may achieve rate control in all patients. Rate control has been shown to improve quality of life over pretreatment status. However, several issues regarding the use of rate control as an endpoint are unsettled. Technical issues concerning when and how to measure heart rate remain. The current definitions of rate control are lacking in scientific foundation and demonstration of clinical relevance. Heart rate control during exercise may be difficult to achieve in many patients despite control at rest. Finally, the relationship of rate control to some important clinical outcomes has not been established.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 atrial fibrillation — mechanisms, efficacy, and practical considerations for rate control: The main determinants of ventricular rate during AF are the intrinsic conduction characteristics and refractoriness of the AV node and autonomic tone, and drugs that prolong the AV nodal refractory period are generally effective. The efficacy of pharmacological interventions designed to achieve rate control in AF has been about 80% in clinical trials. There is no evidence that pharmacological rate control has any adverse influence on LV function, but bradycardia and heart block may occur, particularly in patients with paroxysmal AF, especially the elderly. When rapid control is required or oral administration is not feasible, medication may be administered intravenously; otherwise, in hemodynamically stable patients with a rapid ventricular response, negative chronotropic medication may be administered orally. Combinations may be necessary to achieve rate control in both acute and chronic situations, some patients may require permanent pacing for symptomatic bradycardia, and nonpharmacological therapy should be considered when pharmacological measures fail.

### Atrial fibrillation: is rhythm control required, and If so, how, and what is the internist's role? [^112MRxJr]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation-no primary care physician can escape it! Atrial fibrillation is the most common tachyarrhythmia encountered in clinical practice-whether family practice, internal medicine, cardiology, pulmonology medicine, etc. Moreover, with growth of the older segment of our population and better survival of patients with cardiovascular disorders, the incidence and prevalence of atrial fibrillation are both increasing progressively. Currently, a review of major guidelines shows that the treatment approach to atrial fibrillation involves 4 "pillars"-treatment of contributory comorbidities ("upstream therapy"), control of the ventricular response to the rapid atrial rates during atrial fibrillation, prevention of thromboembolism with oral anticoagulation or left atrial appendage occlusion (except in the minority of patients at too low a thromboembolic risk), and rhythm control in those patients who require it. The latter is the most complex of the 4, and many, if not most, primary care physicians currently prefer to leave this "pillar" to the care of a cardiologist or electrophysiologist. Nonetheless, it is important for the primary care physician to be familiar with the rhythm treatment components and choices (both overall and, specifically, the ones in which they must participate) as they will impact many interactions with their patients in multiple ways. This review details for the primary care physician the components of care regarding rhythm control of atrial fibrillation and the areas in which the primary care physician/internist must be knowledgeable and proactively involved.

### BET 1: lenient or strict rate control for atrial fibrillation [^1155sKAe]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether the degree of rate control influences mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation. 22 papers presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these papers are shown in the two tables. It is concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific rate control target to decrease mortality in rate-controlled rapid atrial fibrillation.

### Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options to maintain sinus rhythm: guideline-based and new approaches [^114SqaYv]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia in patients with heart failure and is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality. Restoration and preservation of sinus rhythm, therefore, has a premium. Of the numerous treatment options available, many must be avoided because of their potential for adverse effects or because of limited proof of efficacy in defined populations. Published guidelines provide help by synthesizing clinical trial data into a recommended approach. This article summarizes current information regarding the best methods applicable to patients with left ventricular dysfunction for rate control, sinus rhythm restoration and maintenance, and stroke prevention. New and evolving therapies and how they might fit into the evolving treatment paradigm are also briefly reviewed.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Management overview — Management of patients with AF involves 3 objectives — rate control, prevention of thromboembolism, and correction of the rhythm disturbance, and these are not mutually exclusive. The initial management decision involves primarily a rate-control or rhythm-control strategy; under the rate-control strategy, the ventricular rate is controlled with no commitment to restore or maintain sinus rhythm, while the rhythm-control strategy attempts restoration and/or maintenance of sinus rhythm and also requires attention to rate control. Depending on the patient's course, the strategy initially chosen may prove unsuccessful and the alternate strategy is then adopted.

### Comparative effectiveness of heart rate control medications for the treatment of sepsis-associated atrial fibrillation [^113DtqfB]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response frequently complicates the management of critically ill patients with sepsis and may necessitate the initiation of medication to avoid hemodynamic compromise. However, the optimal medication to achieve rate control for AF with rapid ventricular response in sepsis is unclear.

Research Question

What is the comparative effectiveness of frequently used AF medications (β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, amiodarone, and digoxin) on heart rate (HR) reduction among critically ill patients with sepsis and AF with rapid ventricular response?

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study among patients with sepsis and AF with rapid ventricular response (HR > 110 beats/min). We compared the rate control effectiveness of β-blockers to calcium channel blockers, amiodarone, and digoxin using multivariate-adjusted, time-varying exposures in competing risk models (for death and addition of another AF medication), adjusting for fixed and time-varying confounders.

Results

Among 666 included patients, 50.6% initially received amiodarone, 10.1% received a β-blocker, 33.8% received a calcium channel blocker, and 5.6% received digoxin. The adjusted hazard ratio for HR of < 110 beats/min by 1 h was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.34–0.74) for amiodarone vs β-blocker, 0.37 (95% CI, 0.18–0.77) for digoxin vs β-blocker, and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.51–1.11) for calcium channel blocker vs β-blocker. By 6 h, the adjusted hazard ratio for HR < 110 beats/min was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.47–0.97) for amiodarone vs β-blocker, 0.60 (95% CI, 0.36–1.004) for digoxin vs β-blocker, and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.71–1.49) for calcium channel blocker vs β-blocker.

Interpretation

In a large cohort of patients with sepsis and AF with rapid ventricular response, a β-blocker treatment strategy was associated with improved HR control at 1 h, but generally similar HR control at 6 h compared with amiodarone, calcium channel blocker, or digoxin.

### Management of atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in patients with acute decompensated heart failure: a systematic review [^1168cN3w]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective was to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and nonpharmacological management options for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (AFRVR) in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in the acute care setting.

Methods

This study was a systematic review of observational studies or randomized clinical trials (RCT) of adult patients with AFRVR and concomitant ADHF in the emergency department (ED), intensive care unit, or step-down unit. The primary effectiveness outcome was successful rate or rhythm control. Safety outcomes were adverse events, such as symptomatic hypotension and venous thromboembolism.

Results

A total of 6577 unique articles were identified. Five studies met inclusion criteria: one RCT in the inpatient setting and four retrospective studies, two in the ED and the other three in the inpatient setting. In the RCT of diltiazem versus placebo, 22 patients (100%) in the treatment group had a therapeutic response compared to 0/15 (0%) in the placebo group, with no significant safety differences between the two groups. For three of the observational studies, data were limited. One observation study showed no difference between metoprolol and diltiazem for successful rate control, but worsening heart failure symptoms occurred more frequently in those receiving diltiazem compared to metoprolol (19 patients [33%] vs. 10 patients [15%], p = 0.019). A single study included electrical cardioversion (one patient exposed with failure to convert to sinus rhythm) as nonpharmacological management. The overall risk of bias for included studies ranged from serious to critical. Missing data and heterogeneity of definitions for effectiveness and safety outcomes precluded the combination of results for quantitative meta-analysis.

Conclusions

High-level evidence to inform clinical decision making regarding effective and safe management of AFRVR in patients with ADHF in the acute care setting is lacking.

### Rhythm control versus rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: insights from get with the guidelines-heart failure [^114CzeSf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for one half of all heart failure (HF) visits and hospital admissions in the United States. Patients with HFpEF have similar risks of morbidity and all‐cause mortality as patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). 1, 2 Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in patients with HF, occurring in approximately one third of patients. 3, 4, 5, 6 In patients with HFpEF, the prevalence of AF ranges from 15% to 41% in registries and clinical trials. 6

Patients with HF and AF have worse outcomes than patients with HF without AF. 7 The HF guidelines focus their recommendations on prevention of thromboembolism and symptom control with the goal to correct underlying causes of AF and HF and optimize HF management. The guidelines then differentiate patients who develop HF as a result of AF and patients who have HF and go on to develop AF. 8 Patients with newly diagnosed HF in the presence of AF with rapid ventricular response are recommended to undergo rhythm control, as a rate‐related cardiomyopathy is a reversible cause of HF. There is no other specific recommendation for rate versus rhythm control in the HF guidelines. 8 The AF guidelines recommend rhythm control only in patients who remain symptomatic despite rate control treatment. 9 A recent meta‐analysis revealed that all‐cause mortality is significantly higher in patients with AF and HFrEF compared with patients with AF and HFpEF, yet stroke risk and HF hospitalization rates were similar among both groups. 10 Similar comparisons in the GWTG‐HF (Get With The Guidelines — Heart Failure) registry extends these prior findings, demonstrating that AF is common in patients with HF and associated with higher mortality, readmissions, and HF readmissions. 11

HFpEF and AF have shared risk factors, confer increased risks for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and frequently occur together. 6, 12 Despite accumulating epidemiologic data detailing worse outcomes in patients with HFpEF complicated by AF, there are no medical therapies that have been definitively shown to improve outcomes for patients with HFpEF. As a result, the guideline writing committees limit their scope to treatment of associated comorbidities. 8, 13, 14, 15, 16 To describe current treatment patterns and subsequent outcomes in patients with HFpEF complicated by AF, we analyzed the GWTG‐HF registry linked to Medicare claims data.

### Assessment of rhythm and rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation [^111bjw4d]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2006). Low credibility.

A recent series of randomized prospective clinical trials that compared rate control with rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) found no significant difference in primary outcome between the two strategies. However, these trials lacked clear criteria for defining "successful" rate or rhythm control. Various measures have been used to gauge the success of antiarrhythmic drug therapy, including time to first recurrence of AF, any AF recurrence, AF burden, and a reduction in symptoms. Determining the success of antiarrhythmic therapy can be relatively straightforward by using how patients feel during therapy as a key endpoint. Most patients are satisfied with a major reduction in symptomatic AF episodes and can live comfortably with occasional episodes of AF. For those who are bothered by even infrequent, brief AF episodes, a treatment regimen that eliminates nearly all AF recurrences is required, although often hard to achieve. Catheter ablation may be necessary to achieve a successful outcome in these patients. Suppression of AF in a patient at high risk of stroke does not, however, remove the need for concomitant warfarin therapy. The endpoints of ventricular rate control are not clear, and the recently published rhythm versus rate control trials lacked standard criteria for judging acceptable rate control. One relatively simple method is to try and achieve a 24-hour heart rate that mimics expected normal sinus rhythm. It is important to achieve good rate control to minimize symptoms and the risk of tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy.

### Rate or rhythm control for atrial fibrillation: update and controversies [^112cXLrx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is associated with increased mortality and considerable morbidity, including stroke, heart failure, and diminished quality of life. Despite these adverse outcomes, rhythm control has not demonstrated benefit in clinical trials. Antiarrhythmic medications, including recently developed agents, have limited efficacy in achieving durable sinus rhythm and substantial toxicity. A rate-control strategy is therefore more attractive for minimally symptomatic patients, but younger and more symptomatic patients may benefit from restoration of sinus rhythm. Catheter ablation is more effective than medications in preventing arrhythmia recurrence, avoids adverse effects associated with antiarrhythmic drugs, and should be considered early in symptomatic patients when success is likely. However, more definitive data are needed from randomized trials assessing long-term outcomes after ablation, including stroke risk and mortality. Clinical decision tools help select the appropriate management for individual patients. Lenient rate management is easy to achieve and seems reasonably safe for certain patients, although the optimum rate varies with individual comorbidities. Because safer and more effective pharmacologic and interventional therapies are now available, an individualized approach to atrial fibrillation management is essential.

2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS atrial fibrillation guideline — Heart rate targets for rate control in arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF): The ideal target heart rate remains uncertain, but given potential harms of rapid ventricular rates, a stricter strategy may be reasonable. In AF-CHF, rate control was defined as ventricular rate < 80 bpm at rest and < 110 bpm during a 6-minute walk test. In RACE II, 614 patients with permanent AF were randomized to strict control (< 80 bpm at rest and < 110 bpm with moderate exercise) versus lenient control (resting heart rate, < 110 bpm), showing similar outcomes, though patients were rate controlled at enrollment (baseline heart rate, 96 bpm), and only 15% had LVEF < 40% with very few > 100 bpm. In a crossover study of 20 patients with persistent AF and LVEF < 40%, metoprolol (average dose, 121 mg) targeted < 70 bpm and after 3 months reduced resting heart rate from 94 ± 14 bpm to 85 ± 12 bpm without significant QOL or functional differences. Strict rate control is also advisable in patients with ICDs and CRT.

Management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with heart failure (HF) — key guideline recommendations state that in patients with a new diagnosis of HFrEF and AF, arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy should be suspected, and an early and aggressive approach to AF rhythm control is recommended; in appropriate patients with AF and HFrEF on guideline-directed medical therapy and with reasonable expectation of benefit, catheter ablation is beneficial to improve symptoms, quality of life (QOL), ventricular function, and cardiovascular outcomes; in symptomatic AF with HFpEF and reasonable expectation of benefit, catheter ablation can be useful to improve symptoms and QOL; for AF with HF, digoxin is reasonable for rate control, either with other rate-controlling agents or as monotherapy if others are not tolerated; when AF with HF presents with rapid ventricular rates and beta blockers or calcium channel blockers are contraindicated or ineffective, intravenous amiodarone is reasonable for acute rate control; in AF, HF, HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 50%) with refractory rapid ventricular response and not candidates for or failing rhythm control, atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) with biventricular pacing can be useful to improve symptoms, QOL, and LVEF; in AF and HF with implanted biventricular pacing where effective pacing percentage cannot be achieved pharmacologically, AVNA can be beneficial to improve functional class, reduce ICD shock risk, and improve survival; after recovery of LV function from AF‑induced cardiomyopathy, long-term surveillance can be beneficial to detect recurrent AF; for suspected AF‑induced cardiomyopathy or refractory HF symptoms on pharmacological rate control, a stricter rate-control strategy (target heart rate ≤ 80 bpm at rest and < 110 bpm during moderate exercise) may be reasonable; in AF and HFrEF undergoing AVNA, His bundle or left bundle branch area pacing may be reasonable as an alternative to biventricular pacing to improve symptoms, QOL, and LVEF; and in AF with known LVEF < 40%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel–blocking drugs should not be administered because of the potential to exacerbate HF.

### Rate control vs rhythm control strategies in atrial fibrillation [^113F62Lu]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Rhythm management for atrial fibrillation is a subject of intense interest. In this review, the two main strategies for rhythm management in atrial fibrillation, the "heart rate control" strategy and the "heart rhythm control" strategy, are discussed under several headings. Some of the basic issues surrounding heart rate control and heart rhythm control and their study in clinical trials are reviewed. Seven published trials that deal with a comparison of these two strategies are reviewed in some detail. In summary, no distinct advantage of the rhythm control strategy has been identified so far. With respect to pharmacologic therapies and the type of patient studied in most of these trials, advantages seem to accrue to the rate control strategy. Those advantages include fewer adverse drug effects, fewer hospitalizations, and lower cost. Two trials studying quite different patients, and in one case quite different drug therapies, are currently in progress, and these two trials are also briefly reviewed. Current guidelines have not taken into account fully the findings of the studies described in this review, and comment is offered on the current guidelines. Finally, some of the possibilities for future research around this question are highlighted.

### Rate versus rhythm control in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation [^1121mx2i]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

The management of patients with atrial fibrillation involves three main areas: anticoagulation, rate control and rhythm control. Importantly, these are not mutually exclusive of each other. Anticoagulation is necessary for patients who are at a high risk of stroke; for example, those who are older than 75 years, or those who have hypertension, severe left ventricular dysfunction, previous cerebrovascular events, or diabetes. It is now clear that patients who are at a high risk of stroke require long-term anticoagulation with warfarin regardless of whether a rate-control or rhythm-control strategy is chosen. One possible exception might be patients who are apparently cured with catheter ablation. Several published trials comparing rate-control and rhythm-control strategies for the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation have shown no difference in mortality between these approaches. The patients enrolled in these studies were typically over 65 years of age. Data comparing rate and rhythm strategies in patients who are younger than 60 years of age are limited. For more elderly patients, it seems reasonable to consider rate control as a primary treatment option and to reserve rhythm control for those who do not respond to rate control. For younger patients, we prefer to start with a rhythm-control approach and to reserve rate-control approaches for patients in whom antiarrhythmic drugs, ablation, or both, do not ameliorate the symptoms.

### Is rhythm control better than rate control for new-onset atrial fibrillation in the emergency department? [^111bXhmN]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation and symptom onset within 48 hours, rhythm control is preferred over rate control if the patient is younger than 65 years. For patients with congestive heart failure, valvular heart disease, hypertension, or permanent atrial fibrillation, rate control remains the favored strategy.

### Prognostic significance of ventricular rate at discharge in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation and HF [^113AD9DL]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia and is associated with an increased risk of heart failure (HF), systemic thromboembolism, and mortality. It is seen in 10% to 45% of patients with congestive HF at initial presentation. Its presence in HF patients is associated with worse prognosis in terms of morbidity and mortality. Frequently, cause-effect relationship cannot be established at the time of presentation, as persistent atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate can lead to HF, and on the contrary, severe HF can be complicated by atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate.

In atrial fibrillation, the relationship between ventricular rate and congestive HF is complex. Optimal management of HF, through neuro-hormonal influences, decreases sympathetic activity and thus slows ventricular rate. Slowing ventricular rate by atrioventricular blockade leads to improved ventricular filling and cardiac output. In individual patients, it is very difficult to establish which of the above is more critical; however, controlling ventricular rate is intuitive and is associated with improvement in HF. The optimal ventricular rate that is associated with the best long-term outcome remains a matter of debate.

### Selection of drugs in pursuit of rate control strategy [^114hi9uo]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia. Based on multiple large randomized trials, rate control therapy has been shown to be safe and effective and is gaining greater acceptance as a frontline alternative to drugs to maintain sinus rhythm. Adequate rate control can be achieved by atrioventricular nodal blocking agents both in the acute and chronic settings. In refractory patients, other methods such as atrioventricular node ablation can be used to control rate.

### Efficacy of intravenous magnesium for the management of non-post operative atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117988Vp]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous magnesium (IV Mg), a commonly utilized therapeutic agent in the management of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response, is thought to exert its influence via its effect on cellular automaticity and prolongation of atrial and atrioventricular nodal refractoriness thus reducing ventricular rate. We sought to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of IV Mg versus placebo in addition to standard pharmacotherapy in the rate and rhythm control of AF in the nonpostoperative patient cohort given that randomized control trials (RCTs) have shown conflicting results.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials comparing IV Mg versus placebo in addition to standard of care were identified via electronic database searches. Nine RCTs were returned with a total of 1048 patients. Primary efficacy endpoints were study-defined rate control and rhythm control/reversion to sinus rhythm. The secondary endpoint was patient experienced side effects.

Results

Our analysis found IV Mg in addition to standard care was successful in achieving rate control (odd ratio [OR] 1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13–3.11, p = .02) and rhythm control (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.04–2.03, p = .03). Although not well reported among studies, there was no significant difference between groups regarding the likelihood of experiencing side effects.

Conclusions

IV Mg, in addition to standard-of-care pharmacotherapy, increases the rates of successful rate and rhythm control in nonpostoperative patients with AF with rapid ventricular response and is well tolerated.

Atrial fibrillation — digoxin provides limited rate control with delayed onset, is not first-line for rapid management, and has important adverse effects and interactions. Although intravenous digoxin may slow the ventricular response to AF at rest, there is a delay of at least 60 min before onset and the peak effect does not develop for up to 6 h; digoxin is no more effective than placebo in converting AF to sinus rhythm, in a review of 139 episodes of paroxysmal AF there was no difference between those taking digoxin and those not, and digoxin is no longer considered first-line therapy for rapid management of AF except in patients with HF or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction or in very sedentary patients. According to a systematic review, digoxin alone slows resting heart rate by an average of 4 to 21 beats per minute but does not slow heart rate during exercise in AF; the most frequent adverse effects are ventricular arrhythmias, atrioventricular (AV) block, and sinus pauses, and serum digoxin concentration may rise with verapamil or antiarrhythmic agents such as propafenone or amiodarone.

Atrioventricular nodal ablation (AVNA) in atrial fibrillation (AF) — recommendations: In patients with AF and a persistently rapid ventricular response who undergo AVNA, initial pacemaker lower rate programming should be 80 to 90 bpm to reduce the risk of sudden death. In patients with AF and uncontrolled rapid ventricular response refractory to rate-control medications (who are not candidates for or in whom rhythm control has been unsuccessful), AVNA can be useful to improve symptoms and quality of life. In patients with AF who are planned to undergo AVNA, implantation of a pacemaker before the ablation (ie, before or same day of ablation) is recommended to ensure adequate back-up pacing leads before performing ablation. In patients with AF with normal ejection fraction undergoing AVNA, conduction system pacing of the His bundle or left bundle area may be reasonable.

### DOsing strategy effectiveness of diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response [^1174Gczn]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To evaluate the dose-dependent comparative safety and effectiveness between weight-based and alternative dosing strategies for diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response who received treatment with intravenous diltiazem. Groups were retrospectively categorized according to the initial dose: low (< 0.1875 mg/kg), weight-based (0.1875 to 0.3125 mg/kg), and high (> 0.3125 mg/kg). The primary outcome was rate control (heart rate < 100 beats/min) within 30 minutes of treatment.

Results

Of 345 records, 252 were included. Because of scarcity (N = 6), outcomes for the high-dose group were not analyzed. By 30 minutes, the weight-based dosing group had more often achieved rate control (weight-based 55%; low 27%; difference 29% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17% to 40%]). Regression analysis identified the weight-based dosing group (odds ratio 3.63, 95% CI 2.06 to 6.39) and initial heart rate of less than 145 beats/min (odds ratio 2.56, 95% CI 1.46 to 4.51) as variables associated with the primary outcome. The weight-based dosing group less often required rescue therapy (weight-based 6%; low 17%; difference -12% [95% CI -20% to -4%]) relative to the low-dose group. Mortality was higher in the low-dose group than in the weight-based dosing group (low 7%; weight-based 1%; difference 6% [95% CI 1% to 11%]).

Conclusion

This study shows dose-dependent hemodynamic effects with diltiazem in patients with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Weight-based diltiazem (0.25 mg/kg) was associated with greater rate control with no evidence of increased adverse effects. There was no perceived advantage in using lower, alternative doses.

### Rate control in atrial fibrillation [^113HzjY6]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Control of the heart rate (rate control) is central to atrial fibrillation management, even for patients who ultimately require control of the rhythm. We review heart rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation, including the rationale for the intervention, patient selection, and the treatments available. The choice of rate control depends on the symptoms and clinical characteristics of the patient, but for all patients with atrial fibrillation, rate control is part of the management. Choice of drugs is patient-dependent. β blockers, alone or in combination with digoxin, or non-dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (not in heart failure) effectively lower the heart rate. Digoxin is least effective, but a reasonable choice for physically inactive patients aged 80 years or older, in whom other treatments are ineffective or are contraindicated, and as an additional drug to other rate-controlling drugs, especially in heart failure when instituted cautiously. Atrioventricular node ablation with pacemaker insertion for rate control should be used as an approach of last resort but is also an option early in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation treated with cardiac resynchronisation therapy. However, catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation should be considered before atrioventricular node ablation. Although rate control is a top priority and one of the first management issues for all patients with atrial fibrillation, many issues remain.

Atrial fibrillation long-term rate control — synopsis highlights effective classes and selection considerations. Both nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem) and beta blockers are effective for long-term rate control, and these agents are useful in ventricular rate control in the absence of preexcitation. Digoxin may be useful in patients with limited tolerability to other agents, or as adjunct therapy in patients with a difficult to control ventricular rate. Limited data exist comparing various rate control agents, especially in the setting of chronic rate control, and selection of specific agents should consider patient-specific characteristics (ie, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF], reactive airway disease) and response.

Atrial fibrillation acute rate control — comparative trials report that "Intravenous diltiazem was more effective than intravenous digoxin in 2 small RCTs.6,7" In one emergency department trial, investigators "randomized 150 patients with AF without major comorbidities and a ventricular rate > 120 bpm in a 1:1:1 ratio to intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, and amiodarone.6" with "time to reduce the heart rate < 90 bpm" shorter with diltiazem. Another RCT of "30 patients" found diltiazem "significantly decreased heart rate within 5 minutes versus 3 hours with intravenous digoxin.7" Diltiazem also reduced rate "more rapidly than intravenous digoxin in a double-blinded RCT in 40 patients with rapid AF after CABG, with similar control at 12 to 24 hours". Additional evidence shows "In another RCT of 84 patients in rapid AF who presented to the emergency department, intravenous amiodarone resulted in faster control of the ventricular response compared with intravenous digoxin.8" and "Finally, 52 patients with rapid AF were randomized to receive either an intravenous combination of diltiazem and digoxin or intravenous diltiazem alone, with a more rapid and durable response to the combination.9"

Tachycardia-mediated ventricular dysfunction in atrial fibrillation may improve with rate control. In one study, the median LV ejection fraction increased with rate control from 25% to 52%, and conduction disturbances may exacerbate mitral regurgitation and limit ventricular filling.

### Acute management of atrial fibrillation: part I. rate and rhythm control [^117BqSuj]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the arrhythmia most commonly encountered in family practice. Serious complications can include congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and thromboembolism. Initial treatment is directed at controlling the ventricular rate, most often with a calcium channel blocker, a beta blocker, or digoxin. Medical or electrical cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm is the next step in patients who remain in atrial fibrillation. Heparin should be administered to hospitalized patients undergoing medical or electrical cardioversion. Anticoagulation with warfarin should be used for three weeks before elective cardioversion and continued for four weeks after cardioversion. The recommendations provided in this two-part article are consistent with guidelines published by the American Heart Association and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

### Rate control versus rhythm control in atrial fibrillation: lessons learned from clinical trials of atrial fibrillation [^111yoNhZ]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Ample evidence supports the statement that in patients with atrial fibrillation in whom treatment is warranted, either rhythm control or rate control are acceptable primary therapeutic options. If a rhythm control strategy is chosen, it is important to consider that recurrence of atrial fibrillation is not treatment failure per se. Occasional recurrence, with cardioversion if necessary, may be quite acceptable. The latter will depend on the frequency, duration and symptoms associated with recurrence, and may require a change in the rhythm control therapy, e.g., change the antiarrhythmic drug, or initiate or redo atrial fibrillation ablation. And a rhythm control strategy should include careful attention to and treatment of comorbidities (hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, etc.). If a rate control strategy is chosen, treatment with a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is almost always required to achieve adequate rate control. Digoxin is often useful to obtain satisfactory rate control in combination with a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. Digoxin may be useful as primary therapy in the presence of hypotension or heart failure. Satisfactory ventricular rate control is usually a resting rate less than 110 beats per minute, although resting rates below 90 beats per minute are probably wiser. Finally, when pursuing a rhythm control strategy, because recurrence of atrial fibrillation is common, rate control therapy should be a part of the treatment regimen.

### Modern physiological approach to inappropriate ICD shocks due to atrial fibrillation with very fast ventricular response. A case report [^113KYXxs]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Fast-conducting atrial fibrillation misinterpreted as ventricular tachycardia is the leading cause for inappropriate shocks in patients with implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICD). These inappropriate shocks are associated with significant morbidity and mortality and cause great discomfort and stress.

Case presentation

We report the case of a patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy, permanent atrial fibrillation, and a single-chamber DF-1 ICD implanted for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death, who presented for multiple inappropriate internal shocks due to very fast-conducting atrial fibrillation, which was mislabeled as ventricular fibrillation by the ICD. Since the patient was under maximal atrioventricular nodal blocking medical therapy (beta-blockers and digitalis) and we didn't find any reversible causes for the heart rate acceleration, we opted for rate control with atrioventricular node ablation. To counteract the risk of pacing-induced cardiomyopathy in this patient who would become totally pacemaker-dependent, we successfully performed left bundle branch area pacing. Because the patient's ICD had a DF-1 connection and the battery had a long life remaining, we connected the physiological pacing lead to the IS-1 sense-pace port of the ICD. The 6-month follow-up showed an improvement in left ventricular function with no more inappropriate shocks.

Conclusions

Left bundle branch area pacing and atrioventricular node ablation in patients with an implantable single-chamber DF-1 defibrillator and fast-conducting permanent atrial fibrillation is a cost-efficient and very effective method to prevent and treat inappropriate shocks, avoiding the use of an additional dual-chamber or CRT-D device.

Atrial fibrillation in heart failure (HF) — rate control and rhythm strategy guidance emphasizes rate targets, agent selection, and anticoagulation. Digoxin 'slows atrioventricular conduction more effectively at rest than during exercise', while 'Beta-blockers are more effective than digoxin during exercise… and are preferred because of their favorable effects on the natural history of HF'; verapamil and diltiazem 'should be avoided', and if beta-blockers are 'ineffective or contraindicated… amiodarone may be a useful alternative'. If tachycardia persists, 'Atrioventricular nodal ablation may be needed'. For rate targets, 'every effort should be made to reduce the ventricular response to less than 80 to 90 beats per min at rest and less than 110 to 130 beats per min during moderate exercise'. For stroke prevention in this setting, 'Anticoagulation should be maintained in all patients with HF and a history of atrial fibrillation, regardless of whether sinus rhythm is achieved'.

### Atrial fibrillation in heart failure: what should we do? [^116TMVjM]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Future directions

Given the limited treatment options for patients with HF and AF, there is a clear unmet need in this important patient population. Future investigation is particularly required for rate control, optimal methods of rhythm control, and prevention. There is also a need to stratify the use of various treatments to improve efficacy and safety, and a number of studies are addressing whether genetic profiling can help to personalize our therapeutic approach.

Despite advances in many areas of AF, it seems that the evidence to guide best practices for rate control is more uncertain than ever. Adequately powered prospective clinical trials are needed to clarify optimal rate-control targets and the best pharmacologic treatments to achieve rate control in patients with HF and AF. While ablation represents a promising alternative to AAD, clinicians require more information on the balance between effectiveness, complications, and potential prognostic benefits. Finally, given the poor outcomes observed in patients with HF and AF, perhaps the best treatment strategy is to prevent AF from occurring in the first place. Clinical trials of interventions targeted at left atrial substrate and preventing disease progression may have an important role in this regard. Table 3 presents some of the main studies currently recruiting that will assess patients with HF and AF. It is clear that the combination of these two common CV conditions will continue to challenge physicians both in CV and general medicine for many years to come.

### Pharmacologic management of atrial fibrillation: current therapeutic strategies [^117ATJch]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common form of sustained arrhythmia, is associated with a frightening risk of embolic complications, tachycardia-related ventricular dysfunction, and often disabling symptoms. Pharmacologic therapy is the treatment used most commonly to restore and maintain sinus rhythm, to prevent recurrences, or to control ventricular response rate.

Methods

This article reviews published data on pharmacologic treatment and discusses alternative systems to classify AF and to choose appropriate pharmacologic therapy.

Results

AF is either paroxysmal or chronic. Attacks of paroxysmal AF can differ in duration, frequency, and functional tolerance. In the new classification system described, 3 clinical aspects of paroxysmal AF are distinguished on the basis of their implications for therapy. Chronic AF usually occurs in association with clinical conditions that cause atrial distention. The risk of chronic AF is significantly increased by the presence of congestive heart failure or rheumatic heart disease. Mortality rate is greater among patients with chronic AF regardless of the presence of coexisting cardiac disease. The various options available for the treatment of chronic AF include restoration of sinus rhythm or control of ventricular rate. Cardioversion may be accomplished with pharmacologic or electrical treatment. For patients in whom cardioversion is not indicated or who have not responded to this therapy, antiarrhythmic agents used to control ventricular response rate include nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists, digoxin, or beta-blockers. For patients who are successfully cardioverted, sodium channel blockers or potassium channel blockers such as sotalol, amiodarone, or a pure class III agent such as dofetilide, a selective potassium channel blocker, may be used to prevent recurrent AF to maintain normal sinus rhythm.

Conclusions

The ultimate choice of the antiarrhythmic drug will depend on the presence or absence of structural heart disease. An additional concern with chronic AF is the risk of arterial embolization resulting from atrial stasis and the formation of thrombi. In patients with chronic AF the risk of embolic stroke is increased 6-fold. Therefore anticoagulant therapy should be considered in patients at high risk for embolization. Selection of the appropriate treatment should be based on the concepts recently developed by the Sicilian Gambit Group (based on the specific channels blocked by the antiarrhythmic agent) and on clinical experience gained over the years with antiarrhythmic agents. For example, termination of AF is best accomplished with either a sodium channel blocker (class I agent) or a potassium channel blocker (class III agent). In contrast, ventricular response rate is readily controlled by a beta-blocker (propranolol) or a calcium channel blocker (verapamil). Alternatively, antiarrhythmic drug therapy may be chosen based on the Vaughan-Williams classification, which identifies the cellular electrophysiologic effects of the drug.

### A comparison of rate control and rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation [^113kJ4ki]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

There are two approaches to the treatment of atrial fibrillation: one is cardioversion and treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm, and the other is the use of rate-controlling drugs, allowing atrial fibrillation to persist. In both approaches, the use of anticoagulant drugs is recommended.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, multicenter comparison of these two treatment strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation and a high risk of stroke or death. The primary end point was overall mortality.

Results

A total of 4060 patients (mean [± SD] age, 69.7 ± 9.0 years) were enrolled in the study; 70.8 percent had a history of hypertension, and 38.2 percent had coronary artery disease. Of the 3311 patients with echocardiograms, the left atrium was enlarged in 64.7 percent and left ventricular function was depressed in 26.0 percent. There were 356 deaths among the patients assigned to rhythm-control therapy and 310 deaths among those assigned to rate-control therapy (mortality at five years, 23.8 percent and 21.3 percent, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.15 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.34]; P = 0.08). More patients in the rhythm-control group than in the rate-control group were hospitalized, and there were more adverse drug effects in the rhythm-control group as well. In both groups, the majority of strokes occurred after warfarin had been stopped or when the international normalized ratio was subtherapeutic.

Conclusions

Management of atrial fibrillation with the rhythm-control strategy offers no survival advantage over the rate-control strategy, and there are potential advantages, such as a lower risk of adverse drug effects, with the rate-control strategy. Anticoagulation should be continued in this group of high-risk patients.

### Atrial fibrillation in heart failure: what should we do? [^111eLV36]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Device therapy and management of advanced heart failure

Cardiac resynchronization therapy decreases mortality and prevents hospitalizations in patients with symptomatic HF, LVEF ≤ 35%, and QRS duration ≥ 120 ms. Between 25 and 50% of patients eligible for CRT have AF, although patients with AF are not well represented in randomized trials of CRT. At present, CRT is a class IIa recommended therapy in patients with HF and concomitant AF. Loss of AV synchrony and rapid ventricular rates in AF may impair benefit from CRT and small studies have suggested that the beneficial effect is rather due to AV node ablation. A meta-analysis of 23 observational studies including 7495 recipients suggests that patients with AF have a higher rate of non-response to CRT (35 vs. 28%, P = 0.001). Recent data from 8951 patients with AF and HF in the US NCDR registry demonstrated that CRT-D therapy was associated with lower mortality, all-cause, and HF readmissions compared with ICD therapy alone. Thus while response rates are lower in patients with AF, CRT should still be pursued in appropriate patients and every attempt should be made to ensure aggressive rate control. This is important to ensure biventricular pacing is as close to 100% as possible, and avoid inappropriate shocks. AV node ablation should be considered in cases of tachycardia refractory to medical therapy.

Patients with HFrEF and AF often present unique challenges when implanted pump-support is required. Increased hospitalization and mortality have been observed in patients with the HeartMate II left ventricular assist device (adjusted HR for persistent AF 3.54; 95% CI 1.52–8.25; P < 0.01), with more frequent thromboembolic events in AF despite higher INR.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — criteria for rate control during AF: Criteria for rate control vary with patient age but usually involve achieving ventricular rates between 60 and 80 beats per minute at rest and between 90 and 115 beats per minute during moderate exercise. For the AFFIRM trial, adequate control was defined as an average heart rate up to 80 beats per minute at rest and either an average rate up to 100 beats per minute over at least 18-h ambulatory Holter monitoring with no rate above 100% of the maximum age-adjusted predicted exercise heart rate or a maximum heart rate of 110 beats per minute during a 6-min walk test. In the RACE trial, rate control was defined as less than 100 beats per minute at rest, and only about 5% of patients from these large clinical trials required AV ablation to achieve heart rate control within these limits. No standard method for assessment of heart rate control has been established to guide management of patients with AF.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation in heart failure

Disorganized atrial activity during atrial fibrillation (AF) has many deleterious haemodynamic effects contributing to cardiac remodelling and induction of fibrosis. Early studies proved that irregularity and loss of atrial contribution to left ventricular (LV) filling decreased cardiac output (CO). Further exploration revealed that independent of rate, irregular ventricular rhythm disables cardiac contractility to adapt during beat‐to‐beat changes in ventricular filling. In addition, AF leads to insufficient coronary flow, molecular LV remodelling, and disrupted Ca²+ homeostasis, which eventually may induce contractile dysfunction. In brief, deleterious haemodynamic effects of AF on cardiac function can be attributed to loss of atrial contraction, reduced CO, and irregular and often rapid heart rate. Considering these facts, removing irregularity and fast ventricular response alone can increase CO and prevent long‐term deleterious effects of AF culminating in arrhythmia‐induced cardiomyopathy.

Treatment strategies

Catheter ablation enables restoration of sinus rhythm and several studies have recently demonstrated its prognostic benefit. Therefore, current guidelines recommend CA as a first‐line treatment when arrhythmia‐induced cardiomyopathy is highly probable (class I, level of evidence B, European and US guidelines). However, these benefits might be less distinct in patients with long‐standing, persistent AF in whom lower interventional success rates might be expected. Additionally, most trials do not specify ablation outcomes in persistent AF or elderly patients with more comorbidities in whom recurrences may be particularly problematic. Therefore, even though the guidelines recommend CA as a treatment of choice, alternative therapeutic strategies may be considered. Atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) with permanent pacemaker implantation (pace and ablate strategy) is a feasible rate control option that offers more robust control of ventricular rate over medical therapy alone, as well as definitive rhythm regularization. A recent meta‐analysis compared the efficacy and safety endpoints among five major approaches for AF. Although CA performed best in reducing AF recurrence, the pace and ablate strategy showed superiority in reducing mortality and rehospitalization. Current 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend AVNA in patients unresponsive or intolerant to intensive rate and rhythm control therapy, and not eligible for rhythm control by CA (class IIa, level of evidence B). The choice of pacing modality depends on patient characteristics and the presence of heart failure (HF).

### Prognostic significance of ventricular rate at discharge in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation and HF [^113VUzTd]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Early rhythm control, when feasible, has become the mainstay of treatment for atrial fibrillation. However, there is an important subset of patients who require rate control as the primary modality of treatment, either as a short- or long-term goal of therapy. Multiple studies have reported the effect of ventricular rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation and HF. RACE II (The Rate Control Efficacy in Permanent Atrial Fibrillation: a Comparison between Lenient versus Strict Rate Control II) trialis the sole randomized trial to evaluate clinical outcomes associated with a specific target heart rate. In this study, patients with permanent atrial fibrillation were randomized to a lenient rate-control strategy (resting heart rate < 110 beats/min) or a strict rate-control strategy (resting heart rate of < 80 beats/min or < 110 beats/min during moderate exercise). There was no difference in the composite primary outcome of cardiovascular death, HF hospitalizations, stroke, systemic embolism, bleeding, and life-threatening arrhythmic events (absolute difference of −2.0 percentage points [90% CI: −7.6 to 3.5; P < 0.001] for the noninferiority margin). This study was primarily designed to evaluate chronic outpatient management of rate control in atrial fibrillation. Importantly, however, patients with HF were under-represented and it remained unclear whether the results could be extrapolated to such a population. Hess et alused registry data that included 13,981 patients to assess optimal rate control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation and HF. The study demonstrated that after multivariable adjustment, compared with strict rate control, lenient rate control was associated with higher adjusted risks of death (HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.11–1.33; P < 0.001), all-cause readmission (HR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.03–1.15; P < 0.002), death or all-cause readmission (HR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.05–1.18; P < 0.001), but not cardiovascular readmission (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.00–1.16; P = 0.051) at 90 days. The authors of this study concluded that heart rates higher than 80 beats/min were associated with adverse outcomes, irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction. Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (ORBIT-AF)investigated optimal heart rate control in 2,812 outpatients with permanent atrial fibrillation. The authors reported a nonlinear J-shaped relationship between heart rate and mortality, where decreasing heart rate ≤ 65 beats/min was associated with increasing all-cause mortality (adjusted HR: 1.15 per 5-beats/min increase; 95% CI: 1.01–1.32; P = 0.04), and increasing heart rate > 65 beats/min was associated with worse all-cause mortality (adjusted HR: 1.10 per 5-beats/min increase; 95% CI: 1.05–1.15; P < 0.0001). Similar observations were noted in the multicenter prospective observational registry - Clinical Implications of Heart Rate Control in Heart Failure with Atrial Fibrillation (CODE-AF). It was shown that in patients with atrial fibrillation and HF with preserved ejection fraction, the resting heart rate has U-shaped associations with the composite endpoint of death and hospitalization. No studies have specifically reported long-term outcomes of the degree of heart rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation and HF.

### Metoprolol vs diltiazem for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: systematic review and meta-analysis of adverse events [^112GLsyE]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous (IV) diltiazem and metoprolol are commonly used to achieve rate control for atrial fibrillation with RVR (Afib with RVR), and are both recommended as first-line by current guidelines. While prior studies investigated the efficacy of these medications, there is little evidence available regarding the risk of adverse events (AEs) with their use.

Methods

We identified randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies reporting rates of AEs following administration of IV diltiazem and metoprolol for Afib with RVR by searching PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. Our primary outcome was the incidence of AEs and specifically hypotension and bradycardia, which were examined individually as secondary outcomes. We performed random-effects meta-analysis to identify rates of each AE. We used moderator analysis and meta-regressions to evaluate risk factors. We used the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2 tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess study quality.

Results

We reviewed 13 studies and included 1660 patients, 888 (53%) treated with metoprolol and 772 (47%) with diltiazem. Metoprolol was associated with a 26% lower risk of AE (total incidence 10%) compared to diltiazem (total incidence 19%), (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56–0.98, p = 0.034) with a prediction interval of 0.50–1.10. Patients with higher initial heart rates faced higher rates of AEs (Correlation Coefficient 0.11, 95% CI 0.03–0.19, p = 0.006). There was no difference with respect to rates of bradycardia (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.15–1.30, p = 0.14) or hypotension (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.61–1.04, p = 0.10).

Conclusion

Afib with RVR treated with metoprolol had lower rates of AE (bradycardia and/or hypotension) compared to those treated with diltiazem. We found no difference in rates of hypotension or bradycardia when individually assessed. Existing data are limited by small sample sizes, variability in dosing, and limited representation of important patient subgroups.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — definition and electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics — is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia characterized by uncoordinated atrial activation with consequent deterioration of atrial mechanical function. On the ECG, AF is characterized by the replacement of consistent P waves by rapid oscillations or fibrillatory waves that vary in amplitude, shape, and timing, associated with an irregular, frequently rapid ventricular response when atrioventricular (AV) conduction is intact, and regular cardiac cycles (R-R intervals) are possible in the presence of AV block or ventricular or AV junctional tachycardia. The ventricular response to AF depends on electrophysiologically (EP) properties of the AV node and other conducting tissues, the level of vagal and sympathetic tone, the presence or absence of accessory conduction pathways, and the action of drugs, and in patients with implanted pacemakers, diagnosis of AF may require temporary inhibition of the pacemaker to expose atrial fibrillatory activity. A rapid, irregular, sustained, wide-QRS-complex tachycardia strongly suggests AF with conduction over an accessory pathway or AF with underlying bundle-branch block, and extremely rapid rates (over 200 beats per minute) suggest the presence of an accessory pathway or ventricular tachycardia.

### Prognostic significance of ventricular rate at discharge in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation and HF [^1119Dea5]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite all limitations, the authors are to be commended for studying this specific patient population who had HF decompensation and atrial fibrillation and limiting their study to an inpatient setting, which has significant challenges when it comes to study design. It is of note that favorable outcomes associated with a heart rate lower than 81 beats/min persisted across the range of left ventricular ejection fraction, which provides a good reminder that patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction and decompensated HF syndrome should also have a very nuanced approach to managing rate control. Lower ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation is a good indicator of improved HF. Although, at present, rhythm control is preferable for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation in HF, it is not feasible for a large proportion of patients related to the inability to restore and/or maintain sinus rhythm. Overall, the data presented here can make us pause when discharging this group of patients and potentially think about who needs a closer follow-up and vigilant, comprehensive management of HF and other cardiovascular comorbidities in a timely manner.

### A compelling case for less aggressive arrhythmia management in patients with chronic heart failure and long-standing atrial fibrillation [^117BDpJg]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Methods

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in chronic heart failure, and some have advocated intensive rate and/or rhythm control strategies for these patients. However, the loss of atrial systole and irregularity of the ventricular response has not been shown to contribute to the progression of heart failure, and the presence or rate of long-standing AF in patients with chronic heart failure does not have prognostic significance.

Results

In randomized clinical trials, pharmacological rhythm control has not been shown to be superior to rate-control in influencing long-term outcomes, but the use of membrane-active antiarrhythmic drugs can increase the risk of both pump failure and arrhythmic deaths in patients with heart failure. Additionally, intensive efforts to slow the ventricular rate in AF can potentially cause clinically inapparent bradyarrhythmias, which can trigger rate-dependent lethal rhythm disturbances or hemodynamic abnormalities. In patients with AF, a more stringent approach to rate control (target rate < 80/min) is not superior to a more lenient strategy (target rate < 110/min) on the risk of major events. Little is known about the effects of catheter ablation of long-standing AF in established heart failure, particularly in patients with a preserved or a meaningfully reduced ejection fraction, but ablation can add to the fibrotic burden of the left atrium and impair its capacitance functions.

Conclusions

For all of these reasons, the management of heart failure and long-standing AF should be primarily directed to slowing of the progression of their underlying cardiomyopathic process rather than the treatment of the arrhythmia. In addition, patients should receive long-term oral anticoagulation with non-vitamin K-antagonist oral anticoagulants to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events. The utility of intensive rate and rhythm control interventions for long-standing AF in patients with established heart failure requires further study.

Atrial fibrillation in heart failure — rate control failure with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 50%: For patients with AF and LVEF ≤ 50%, if a rhythm control strategy fails or is not desired, and ventricular rates remain rapid despite medical therapy, atrioventricular nodal ablation with implantation of a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device is reasonable (Class 2a, Level B-R).

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^1123w9eu]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

The published literature describing the safety and efficacy of AF ablation in patients with HF and/or a reduced EF is considerable. When viewed cumulatively, these published results describe the outcomes of AF ablation in more than 1000 patients with HF. Included within this large body of literature are four prospective, randomized clinical trials, the results of which were recently summarized in a meta-analysis. A total of 224 patients were randomized, among whom 83% had persistent AF. AF ablation resulted in an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by a mean of 8.5% compared with rate control alone. AF ablation also was superior to rate control in improving QOL. Peak oxygen consumption and 6-minute walk test distance increased in ablation compared with rate control patients. Major adverse events were not different in the two treatment arms. The meta-analysis of these four studies concluded that catheter ablation is superior to rate control in improving LVEF, QOL, and functional capacity. This conclusion is consistent with other data that reveal that adequate rate control alone is insufficient to prevent AF-mediated cardiomyopathy in a subset of AF patients. Prior to accepting a rate control strategy, patients with HF and persistent AF or drug-refractory AF should be advised to consider AF ablation.

Based on this growing body of data, the writing group believes that catheter ablation of AF is a safe, effective, and clinically acceptable therapeutic option in patients with AF and HF. This applies both to patients suspected of having a cardiomyopathy that is strongly suspected to be due to AF, with a rapid ventricular response, as well as to other populations of patients with AF. The writing group recommends that it is reasonable to use similar indications for AF ablation in selected patients with HF as for patients without HF (Class IIa, LOE B-R).

Atrial fibrillation — implications of the rhythm-control versus rate-control trials: Theoretically, rhythm control should have advantages over rate control, yet a trend toward lower mortality was observed in the rate-control arm of the AFFIRM study and did not differ in the other trials from the outcome with the rhythm-control strategy. The RACE and AFFIRM trials did not address AF in younger, symptomatic patients with little underlying heart disease, in whom restoration of sinus rhythm by cardioversion antiarrhythmic drugs or nonpharmacological interventions still must be considered a useful therapeutic approach. One may conclude from these studies that rate control is a reasonable strategy in elderly patients with minimal symptoms related to AF, and an effective method for maintaining sinus rhythm with fewer side effects would address a presently unmet need.

### Analysis of current management of atrial fibrillation in the acute setting: GEFAUR-1 study [^117KSwuX]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Limited information relative to the management of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department (ED) daily practice is available. This study evaluates current management of atrial fibrillation in this setting to identify areas for practice improvement.

Methods

This was a prospective multicenter observational study carried out in 12 EDs. Adults in whom atrial fibrillation was demonstrated in an ECG obtained in the ED were included. Clinical variables and atrial fibrillation management in the ED were prospectively collected by the treating physicians using a standardized questionnaire. Patients with rapid ventricular response (> 100 beats/min) were considered eligible for rate control, and patients with recent-onset episodes (< 48 hours) were eligible for rhythm control.

Results

Of 1,178 patients, 41% presented with a rapid ventricular response and 21% had recent-onset episodes. Rhythm control was attempted in 42% of eligible patients, with antiarrhythmic drugs in 88% of cases (I-C drugs in 44% of patients; amiodarone in 43% of patients). Overall effectiveness of pharmacologic cardioversion was 63% (amiodarone 54.5%, flecainide 93%), whereas electrocardioversion was effective in 87.5% of cases. Rate control was performed in 68.3% of eligible patients (overall effectiveness 47.8%); digoxin was used in 67% of cases (effectiveness 45%). Both strategies were selected in 4.5% of cases, whereas no treatment for atrial fibrillation was performed in 60% of patients.

Conclusion

In our ED population, rate-control effectiveness is poor and rhythm control is not attempted in most recent-onset episodes. Methods to improve rate-control effectiveness, the selection of patients for rhythm control, and the use of electrocardioversion appear warranted.

Acute pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) — agent-specific notes: Intravenous esmolol may have modest efficacy for pharmacological cardioversion of recent-onset AF, but this has not been established by comparison with placebo; it is not useful in patients with persistent AF, a response may be expected within 1 h after initiation of intravenous infusion, and hypotension and bronchospasm are major adverse effects. Verapamil and diltiazem have not been found effective for pharmacological cardioversion of recent-onset or persistent AF but act rapidly to control the rate of ventricular response; negative inotropic effects might result in hypotension and caution should be used in patients with heart failure (HF). Digitalis glycosides are generally not more effective than placebo for conversion of recent-onset AF to sinus rhythm, may prolong episodes of paroxysmal AF, and manifestations of digitalis toxicity are dose related. Disopyramide has not been tested adequately for conversion of AF but may be effective when administered intravenously; adverse effects include drying of mucous membranes, constipation, urinary retention, and depression of left ventricular (LV) contractility, making it a relatively unattractive option. Sotalol has no proved efficacy for pharmacological cardioversion of recent-onset or persistent AF when given either orally or intravenously, but it does control the heart rate; in patients who tolerate AF relatively well, a wait-and-see approach using oral sotalol is an appropriate option, and side effects consist mainly of QT prolongation associated with torsades de pointes.

Managing episodes of bradycardia associated with postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) — AF occurs commonly after cardiac surgery in adults, with a peak incidence 2 to 4 days postoperatively and an overall incidence ranging from 10% to 65%; postoperative AF occurs more frequently in patients undergoing valve surgery than in those undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft; bradycardia may take several forms in these patients, including slow ventricular response during AF and prolonged sinus pauses after sinus rhythm is restored; a slow and regular ventricular response during AF usually indicates complete heart block, and pacing may be required if resolution does not occur; in general, bradyarrhythmias in the setting of postoperative AF should be treated similarly to those occurring in the nonoperative setting, and a period of watchful waiting rather than early PPM implantation is generally used; in occasional patients with refractory AF with rapid ventricular responses associated with significant SND limiting rate control drugs, a PPM may be required for adequate AF management.

Atrial fibrillation rate control targets and RACE II evidence — Criteria for rate control vary with patient age but usually involve achieving ventricular rates between 60 and 80 bpm at rest and between 90 and 115 bpm during moderate exercise. In AFFIRM, adequate control was defined as an average heart rate of up to 80 bpm at rest and either an average rate of up to 100 bpm over at least 18 hours of ambulatory Holter monitoring with no rate greater than 100% of the maximum age-adjusted predicted exercise heart rate or a maximum heart rate of 110 bpm during a 6-minute walk test. In the RACE II trial of 614 patients with permanent AF, strict (resting heart rate < 80 bpm, heart rate < 110 bpm during moderate exercise) versus lenient (resting heart rate < 110 bpm) control yielded a 3-year estimated cumulative incidence of 12.9% in the lenient-control group and 14.9% in the strict-control group, with HR of 0.84 (90% CI, 0.58 to 1.21; P = 0.001 for the prespecified noninferiority margin); the study reported that lenient-rate control < 110 bpm is not inferior to strict-rate control < 80 bpm, symptoms were also similar in both groups, and lenient-rate control may be adopted as a reasonable strategy in patients with permanent AF.

### Comparison of sustained rate control in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: metoprolol vs. diltiazem [^117Nsyuh]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare sustained rate control with intravenous (IV) diltiazem vs. IV metoprolol in acute treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This retrospective chart review at a large, academic medical center identified patients with AF with RVR diagnosis who received IV diltiazem or IV metoprolol in the ED. The primary outcome was sustained rate control defined as heart rate (HR) < 100 beats per minute without need for rescue IV medication for 3 h following initial rate control attainment. Secondary outcomes included time to initial rate control, HR at initial control and 3 h, time to oral dose, admission rates, and safety outcomes.

Results

Between January 1, 2016 and November 1, 2018, 51 patients met inclusion criteria (diltiazem n = 32, metoprolol n = 19). No difference in sustained rate control was found (diltiazem 87.5% vs. metoprolol 78.9%, p = 0.45). Time to rate control was significantly shorter with diltiazem compared to metoprolol (15 min vs. 30 min, respectively, p = 0.04). Neither hypotension nor bradycardia were significantly different between groups.

Conclusions

Choice of rate control agent for acute management of AF with RVR did not significantly influence sustained rate control success. Safety outcomes did not differ between treatment groups.

### Acute ventricular rate control in atrial fibrillation: IV combination of diltiazem and digoxin vs. IV diltiazem alone [^115HLdau]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze the efficacy of an IV combination of diltiazem and digoxin vs IV diltiazem alone for acute ventricular rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Design

Prospective, randomized, open-label study.

Patients and Methods

Fifty-two patients with atrial fibrillation and uncontrolled ventricular rates were randomized to receive either an IV combination of diltiazem and digoxin or IV diltiazem alone and were observed for 12 h. The successful rate control was defined as a ventricular rate < 100 beats per minute (bpm) persisting for 1 h or conversion to sinus rhythm. The loss of rate control was defined as an increase in the ventricular rate to > 100 bpm persistently for > 30 min or rebound to atrial fibrillation.

Results

In both treatment arms (n = 26 each), all patients achieved successful and comparable ventricular rate control at 12 h. The mean (± SD) time taken to achieve successful rate control was shorter in the combination arm (15 ± 16 vs. 22 ± 22 min). Six patients in the combination arm and 11 in the diltiazem-alone arm experienced episodes of loss of rate control. This loss in the combination arm was less than that in the diltiazem-alone arm (14 vs 39 episodes; p = 0.05). The loss of rate control per patient in the combination arm was also less than that in the diltiazem-alone arm (2.0 ± 1.0 vs. 3.5 ± 1.9 episodes per patient; p = 0.04).

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that in patients with atrial fibrillation who have a rapid ventricular response, the IV combination of diltiazem and digoxin results in a more efficacious ventricular rate control with fewer fluctuations than that achieved by therapy with IV diltiazem alone.

### Association of atrial fibrillation risk alleles and response to acute rate control therapy [^1179nDHv]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Given the sparse evidence for selection of first-line therapy for acute atrial fibrillation (AF) based on clinical factors alone, incorporation of genotype data may improve the effectiveness of treatment algorithms and advance the understanding of interpatient heterogeneity. We tested whether candidate nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to AF physiologic responses are associated with ventricular rate control after intravenous diltiazem in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

We conducted an analysis within a prospective observational cohort of ED patients with acute symptomatic AF, ventricular rate > 110 beats per minute within the first 2 hours, initially treated with intravenous diltiazem, and who had DNA available for analysis. We evaluated 24 candidate SNPs that were grouped into 3 categories based on their phenotype response (atrioventricular nodal [AVN] conduction, resting heart rate, disease susceptibility) and calculated 3 genetic scores for each patient. Our primary outcome was maximum heart rate reduction within 4 hours of diltiazem administration. Multivariable regression was used to identify associations with the outcome while adjusting for age, sex, baseline heart rate, and diltiazem dose.

Results

Of the 142 patients, 127 had complete data for the primary outcome. None of the genetic scores for AVN conduction, resting heart rate, or AF susceptibility showed a significant association with maximal heart rate response.

Conclusion

Using a candidate SNP approach, screening for genetic variants associated with AVN conduction, resting heart rate, or AF susceptibility failed to provide significant data for predicting successful rate control response to intravenous diltiazem for treating acute AF in the ED.

### Atrial fibrillation (chronic) [^1151roRM]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia characterised by the presence of fast and uncoordinated atrial activation leading to reduced atrial mechanical function. Risk factors for atrial fibrillation include increasing age, male sex, co-existing cardiac and thyroid disease, pyrexial illness, electrolyte imbalance, cancer, and co-existing infection.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral medical treatments to control heart rate in people with chronic (defined as longer than 1 week for this review) non-valvular atrial fibrillation? What is the effect of different treatment strategies (rate versus rhythm) for people with persistent non-valvular atrial fibrillation? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 23 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: beta-blockers (with or without digoxin), calcium channel blockers (with or without digoxin), calcium channel blockers (rate-limiting), digoxin, and rate versus rhythm control strategies.

Atrial fibrillation — electrical and pharmacological cardioversion overview is described as follows: Cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm is a mode of acute rhythm control and can be achieved electrically or pharmacologically. Electrical cardioversion, given rapidity and efficacy, is the treatment of choice for patients with hemodynamic instability attributable to AF, and cardioversion should also be considered for hemodynamically stable AF intolerant of atrioventricular dyssynchrony, loss of atrial kick, or unable to achieve adequate rate control. In stable AF, both electrical and pharmacological cardioversion are acceptable, safe, and efficacious; electrical cardioversion is more effective than pharmacological cardioversion alone but involves the trade-off of anesthesia or sedation. Thromboembolic risks and considerations for anticoagulation apply to both pharmacological and electrical cardioversion.

Atrial fibrillation — beta-adrenergic blockers for ventricular rate control are supported by comparative data and require caution in heart failure. In 7 of 12 comparisons, beta-adrenergic blockade proved safe and effective for control of heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and superior to placebo, and in the AFFIRM study beta blockers achieved specified heart rate endpoints in 70% of patients compared with 54% with calcium channel blockers; beta blockers should be initiated cautiously in patients with AF and heart failure (HF) who have reduced ejection fraction, and atenolol, metoprolol, and sotalol provide better control of exercise-induced tachycardia than digoxin.

### Is lenient rate control effective for atrial fibrillation? [^114us8QV]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Background: Rate control is the cornerstone of atrial fibrillation management, but the optimal target heart rate is unknown. Guidelines recommend strict rate control, but whether this approach actually improves patient outcomes has not been proven. Van Gelder and colleagues studied lenient rate control to determine if it is as effective as strict rate control in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in persons with atrial fibrillation. The Study: The authors evaluated data from the Rate Control Efficacy in Permanent Atrial Fibrillation: a Comparison between Lenient versus Strict Rate Control II study, a prospective randomized trial examining whether lenient rate control was noninferior to strict rate control in preventing cardiovascular events over two to three years.

Eligible patients were younger than 80 years, had permanent atrial fibrillation for up to 12 months, were receiving anticoagulant therapy, and had a mean resting heart rate greater than 80 bpm. A total of 614 patients were given one or more rate-controlling drugs to achieve their target heart rate. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular-associated outcomes, including death, embolism, sustained ventricular tachycardia, syncope, hospitalization for heart failure, and implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator. Results: Significantly more patients were able to achieve their target heart rates in the lenient rate-control group compared with the strict rate-control group, and significantly fewer followup visits were needed in the lenient rate-control group to achieve the target heart rate.

No difference was noted between the groups regarding the primary outcome. There was also no difference between the groups with regard to all-cause mortality, heart failure stage, hospitalization rate, or adverse events, although the lenient ratecontrol group had a lower risk of stroke. There was no difference between the groups in the prevalence of atrial fibrillation symptoms, including palpitations, dyspnea, or fatigue. Conclusion: The authors conclude that lenient rate control is easier to achieve than strict rate control in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation, with a similar rate of major clinical events.

### Differences between the AAFP atrial fibrillation guideline and the… [^113itkz9]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Strict vs. Lenient Rate Control Both guidelines agree that rate control is preferred to rhythm control in most patients with atrial fibrillation. The AHA/ACC/HRS guideline recommends controlling ventricular rate using a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker in patients with paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent atrial fibrillation. It also advises that a strict rate control strategy is reasonable for management of atrial fibrillation. 1 Many family physicians struggle with a recommendation for such strict control, especially in asymptomatic patients, and are concerned about the potential need for higher doses of medication and the increased risk of medication-related adverse effects. No study definitively shows that strict control improves morbidity or mortality compared with more lenient control. There is some evidence that stroke may be reduced with lenient vs. strict control.

5 Although both guidelines agree that data support preferentially using calcium channel blockers and beta blockers over digoxin, there is insufficient evidence to support the superiority of one calcium channel blocker or beta blocker over another. 3 The updated AAFP guideline recommends lenient rate control over strict rate control, but it does not recommend specific drug therapies. In reality, although the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score increases the number of patients eligible for anticoagulation, both it and the CHADS₂ score are similar in assisting clinicians and patients in determining the risk of stroke. 4 In the AAFP guideline, there is no preference for the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score over the CHADS₂ score. The focus is on ensuring that persons with a high risk of stroke are identified, bleeding risk is evaluated, and the overall risks, benefits, and values are openly discussed to reach an optimal patient-centered decision.

Limited but Beneficial Advice The updated AAFP guideline is limited in scope and does not address all patients with atrial fibrillation; atrial fibrillation due to a reversible cause or valvular disease is excluded. The recommendations on rate control and stroke risk assessment are sound, and the guideline is transparent about the strength of the evidence used to reach those conclusions.

### Rate vs. rhythm control in atrial fibrillation… [^116KXeGm]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, affecting about 2. 3 million persons in the United States. Persons with atrial fibrillation have a four to five times greater risk of stroke and twice the risk of death. There are two approaches to management of atrial fibrillation: rate control and rhythm control. In rate control, medication is used to prevent thromboembolic events. In rhythm control, electric or pharmacologic cardioversion to sinus rhythm is followed by administration of antiarrhythmic agents to maintain this rhythm. Both strategies have risks and benefits with regard to morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have sought to determine which of these two strategies result in better clinical outcomes. De Denus and associates performed a meta-analysis of published studies to evaluate rate versus rhythm control in terms of patient outcomes. The authors extracted data and assessed the quality of trials based on established criteria.

The data were given a quality rating according to the risk for bias: low — all quality criteria were met; moderate — one or more quality criteria were only partly met; or high — one or more criteria were not met. Five published trials with a total of 5, 239 patients met the inclusion criteria. In the individual trials, there were no significant differences in all-cause mortality when rate control was compared with rhythm control. When the data were pooled, there still was no significant difference in all-cause mortality rates between rate-control and rhythm-control groups. However, there was a positive trend in the rate-control group. The pooled data showed no significant difference in the rate of ischemic stroke between the rate-control and the rhythm-control groups.

The authors conclude that in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, or with atrial fibrillation that is likely to reoccur, rate control in combination with anticoagulation seems to be comparable with attempting to maintain sinus rhythm. They add that the rhythm-control strategy may be indicated in selected patients, although it should not be the preferred strategy in all patients with atrial fibrillation.
