Itp pathophysiology

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the pathophysiology of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and clinical framing of ITP. Then, I should verify the two principal mechanisms: antibody-mediated platelet destruction and impaired platelet production. Next, I will examine the humoral arm, including autoantibody targets and Fcγ receptor–mediated clearance, and I should double-check complement's role. After that, I need to review the cellular arm, especially cytotoxic T cells and T-cell subsets, and consider megakaryocyte injury. Finally, I will integrate genetic and environmental contributors, secondary ITP, and reconcile any conflicting data before summarizing the multifactorial model with therapeutic implications.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and scope. ITP is an acquired autoimmune disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100 × 10⁹/L) due to antibody- and T-cell–mediated destruction of platelets and impaired platelet production, with no other identifiable cause of thrombocytopenia, and it can be primary or secondary to drugs, infections, or other autoimmune diseases [^1b62cc9d] [^2ba610f1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single mechanism. I need to verify the dual-pathway model. Contemporary evidence supports both accelerated peripheral destruction and inadequate bone marrow production as coexisting drivers, with the relative contribution varying by patient and disease phase, which explains heterogeneity in severity and treatment response [^1b62cc9d] [^7fd8c814].

> I will now examine the humoral mechanism. Autoantibodies, predominantly IgG, target platelet glycoproteins such as GPIIb/IIIa and GPIb/IX, opsonize platelets, and drive clearance via Fcγ receptors on macrophages in the spleen and liver; complement activation can augment destruction, and anti-GPIb/IX antibodies may enhance desialylation and hepatic clearance via the Ashwell-Morell pathway, which I should confirm as a distinct, clinically relevant route of destruction [^67ae85a6] [^1b62cc9d].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for T-cell–mediated cytotoxicity. CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes can directly lyse platelets and injure megakaryocytes, and ex vivo studies show CTL-mediated platelet destruction in active ITP; this complements the humoral arm and helps explain cases with minimal detectable autoantibodies or refractory responses to B-cell–targeted therapies [^d7c4c1c7] [^67ae85a6].

> Next, I should review T-cell subset dysregulation. There is a shift toward a proinflammatory phenotype with increased Th1 and Th17 activity, coupled with reduced regulatory T-cell number and function, and emerging data implicate splenic T follicular helper cells in driving autoreactive B-cell differentiation; these abnormalities sustain autoantibody production and perpetuate disease, especially in chronic ITP [^b8c7f7b5] [^8cb60c6e].

> Let me consider impaired platelet production more carefully. ITP plasma and autoantibodies can suppress megakaryocyte proliferation and maturation, and platelet kinetic studies show reduced turnover despite thrombocytopenia, indicating ineffective thrombopoiesis; importantly, thrombopoietin levels are often normal or only modestly elevated, suggesting a relative inadequacy of the TPO–TPO receptor axis in compensating for destruction, which provides the rationale for TPO receptor agonists [^7fd8c814] [^b779e7f7].

> I should confirm the role of complement, because I recall conflicting statements. Earlier summaries emphasized antibody-opsonization and Fcγ-mediated clearance with limited direct complement evidence, but more recent data show classical complement pathway activation contributes to platelet destruction in a subset of patients, and C1s inhibition with sutimlimab improves platelet counts, indicating a clinically meaningful complement component in some cases; I need to reconcile this by noting that complement involvement is variable and patient-specific rather than universal [^67ae85a6] [^1cad8fd5].

> But wait, what if genetic predisposition shapes who gets ITP and how it behaves. Multiple studies associate polymorphisms in immune-related genes with susceptibility, including Fcγ receptor loci, cytokine genes, and T-cell costimulatory pathways; pediatric cohorts also implicate canonical Wnt signaling and inborn errors of immunity in a minority, supporting a model where environmental triggers act on a genetically primed immune system to break tolerance [^e6fb68f2] [^113eaa83].

> I need to check environmental and secondary contributors. Infections such as H. pylori, hepatitis C, CMV, and VZV, as well as vaccines like MMR, can precipitate ITP, and drugs including heparin, valproate, and immune checkpoint inhibitors can induce immune thrombocytopenia; secondary ITP shares core mechanisms but may also include molecular mimicry or drug-dependent antibodies, reinforcing the concept that ITP is a clinical syndrome with diverse precipitants [^1b62cc9d] [^d989210d].

> Hold on, I should verify how these mechanisms translate to clinical heterogeneity. The balance between destruction and impaired production varies, explaining why some patients have dramatic responses to IVIG or splenectomy while others require TPO receptor agonists or B-cell depletion; this mechanistic diversity underpins guideline emphasis on individualized, shared decision-making and the lack of a one-size-fits-all second-line strategy [^2ba610f1] [^e599f805].

> Let me reconsider the overall model to ensure coherence. ITP arises from a loss of tolerance to platelet antigens, with autoreactive B cells producing opsonizing and complement-fixing antibodies, cytotoxic T cells directly destroying platelets and megakaryocytes, and a permissive cytokine milieu driven by Th1/Th17 skewing and Treg defects; megakaryopoiesis is suppressed, and in many patients the TPO response is insufficient to restore counts, yielding persistent thrombocytopenia and bleeding risk that correlate imperfectly with platelet number alone [^1b62cc9d] [^b8c7f7b5].

> Finally, I should double-check that the therapeutic implications logically follow. Treatments that block Fcγ-mediated clearance (IVIG, anti-D, FcRn inhibition), blunt B-cell autoimmunity (rituximab, other anti-CD20s), enhance Treg function, or stimulate thrombopoiesis (TPO receptor agonists) each target a distinct node of the pathophysiology, which explains why responses are heterogeneous and why combination or sequential strategies are sometimes necessary in refractory disease [^67ae85a6] [^e6f73a20].

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is driven by **autoantibody-mediated platelet destruction** [^1b62cc9d] and **impaired megakaryocyte function**, with contributions from cytotoxic T cells and complement [^67ae85a6] [^d7c4c1c7] [^1cad8fd5]. Autoantibodies (mainly IgG) target platelet glycoproteins (GPIIb/IIIa, GPIb/IX) [^67ae85a6], leading to opsonization and phagocytosis in the spleen and liver, while also inhibiting megakaryocyte proliferation and platelet production [^b779e7f7]. T-cell dysregulation (Th1/Th17 skewing, Treg defects) [^b8c7f7b5] and complement activation further amplify destruction [^1cad8fd5]. These mechanisms explain the thrombocytopenia and bleeding risk, and underpin therapies that block autoimmunity (IVIG, anti-D, rituximab) [^67ae85a6] or enhance production (TPO-RAs) [^b779e7f7].

---

## Autoantibody-mediated platelet destruction

- **Autoantibody targets**: IgG autoantibodies most often bind GPIIb/IIIa and GPIb/IX on platelets, marking them for destruction [^67ae85a6].

- **Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis**: Opsonized platelets are cleared by macrophages in the spleen and liver via Fcγ receptors, shortening platelet lifespan [^67ae85a6].

- **Complement activation**: Classical pathway activation can cause direct lysis and further opsonization, worsening destruction [^1cad8fd5].

---

## Impaired platelet production

- **Megakaryocyte inhibition**: Autoantibodies suppress megakaryocyte proliferation and maturation, reducing platelet output [^b779e7f7].

- **Ineffective thrombopoiesis**: Despite thrombocytopenia, TPO levels are often normal or only modestly increased, indicating impaired production [^67ae85a6].

- **TPO receptor agonists**: These agents bypass inhibition to restore platelet counts, confirming a production defect [^b779e7f7].

---

## T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes can directly destroy platelets and megakaryocytes, especially in chronic ITP [^d7c4c1c7]. T-cell dysregulation with **Th1/Th17 skewing** and **Treg defects** sustains autoimmunity and platelet injury [^b8c7f7b5].

---

## Complement activation

Classical pathway activation contributes to **platelet lysis and opsonization**, and C1s inhibition (sutimlimab) improves counts, supporting a causal role [^1cad8fd5].

---

## Genetic and environmental factors

Genetic polymorphisms in **immune genes** (e.g. Fcγ receptors, cytokines) increase susceptibility, and environmental triggers such as infections, drugs, and vaccines can initiate autoimmunity [^e6fb68f2] [^1b62cc9d].

---

## Summary of pathophysiology

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Autoantibody-mediated destruction | IgG against GPIIb/IIIa/GPIb/IX → Fcγ-mediated phagocytosis and complement lysis [^67ae85a6] [^1cad8fd5] |
| Impaired production | Autoantibodies inhibit megakaryocytes; TPO inadequately increased [^b779e7f7] [^67ae85a6] |
| T-cell cytotoxicity | CTLs destroy platelets/megakaryocytes; Th1/Th17 skew and Treg defects [^d7c4c1c7] [^b8c7f7b5] |
| Complement activation | Classical pathway augments destruction [^1cad8fd5] |
| Genetic/environmental | Immune gene variants and triggers (infections, drugs, vaccines) [^e6fb68f2] [^1b62cc9d] |

---

ITP reflects a **multifactorial autoimmune process** with autoantibody-driven destruction, impaired production, T-cell cytotoxicity, and complement activation, shaped by genetic and environmental influences [^1b62cc9d].

### The pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopaenic purpura [^f28510eb]. British Journal of Haematology (2006). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopaenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disease that is rarely fatal. However, in many adults treatment is unsatisfactory, with as much morbidity from the immunosuppressive effects of treatment as from bleeding. Identifying the underlying disease process should help us to identify more targeted therapies and improve not only the treatment but also the quality of life of patients with this disorder.

### Immune thrombocytopenic purpura [^a6251a27]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoantibody-mediated thrombocytopenic disorder in which accelerated destruction of platelets occurs; platelet production may also be impaired by these antibodies. ITP is characterized by mucocutaneous bleeding. Rarely, more severe hemorrhages, such as intracranial hemorrhage, may occur. Traditional therapies, such as steroids, immunoglobulin therapy, and splenectomy, generally reduce peripheral destruction of platelets. More recently, with a better understanding of the immunopathologic mechanisms underlying thrombocytopenia, several new treatments have been developed, including thrombopoietic agents, specific inhibitors of Fcgamma receptor (FcgammaR) signaling, and B-cell depletion therapies. This article outlines current understanding of the epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of ITP. The focus is on recent pathophysiologic insights and areas of potential controversy in which studies are ongoing.

### Refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura: current strategies for investigation and management [^e486702b]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

There is currently no consensus on how best to manage refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). In part, this reflects the need for individualized treatment due to the wide spectrum of patients' requirements and responsiveness to therapies. The objective of this review is to provide a clinically useful guide to current management strategies. This article suggests investigations to identify factors that may exacerbate thrombocytopenia and underlie poor therapeutic responses, and highlights emerging therapies, including the thrombopoietic agents, which are anticipated to dramatically alter the natural history of "refractory" ITP. Morbidity, mortality and heath-related quality of life are also discussed.

### Diagnosis and classification of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia [^a4b407bc]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia, or ITP, has been recognized as a clinical entity for centuries, and the importance of humoral mechanisms in the pathophysiology of ITP has been recognized for decades. Despite the long history of the syndrome, progress in understanding its epidemiology and management has been hindered by inconsistencies in nomenclature and classification schema together with the inherent heterogeneity in characteristics of global populations and ITP-associated disorders. In the past decade, great strides have been made in devising a common language for caregivers and investigators alike through standardization definitions and outcome measures, while new tools have become available for management of its clinical manifestations. In 2009, an International Working Group presented proposed standards for definitions, classification criteria, and outcome measures. The American Society of Hematology adopted these standards in 2011, including them in that body's guideline for immune thrombocytopenia. Despite the progress made so far, 20th century interventions such as corticosteroids and IVIg remain the mainstay of therapy. However, advances in treatment have led to the introduction of targeted therapies for select patients with chronic disease. In this paper, we review aspects of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of ITP and discuss the recent changes in guidelines for nomenclature, diagnosis, and treatment.

### Immune thrombocytopenic purpura [^7dfb0197]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Although many advances have been achieved in the understanding of ITP, critical issues regarding the pathophysiology and biology of the disease remain to be elucidated. The recent characterization of the human genome along with new sophisticated molecular biology techniques will allow basic researchers to study genes that may affect the presentation and clinical course of the disease. Different patterns of gene expression in this population can be studied, leading to the identification of subsets of patients with ITP at higher risk of bleeding. The multigene patterns of expression might also provide clues about regulatory mechanisms and broader cellular functions. In order to answer essential clinical questions, like the incidence of ICH in relation to drug treatment or observation alone, clinical trials should be appropriately designed. More studies are necessary to better define the optimal treatment approach for each child with ITP. Even though the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage cannot be used as the primary outcome measure because of its rarity, numerous other outcomes, such as rate of rise in platelet count, cost and side effects of therapy, health related quality of life of the patient and family, and severity of hemorrhage can be measured and compared between treatment groups. Future investigators should find it attractive to conduct trials in children with this common hematological disease so that decision making can be based more on scientific evidence than on anecdote and opinion.

### Current management of immune thrombocytopenia [^bc721cb0]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune-mediated condition that results from antibody-mediated destruction of platelets and impaired megakaryocyte platelet production. ITP patients exhibit severe thrombocytopenia and are at risk for significant hemorrhage. Few randomized trials exist to guide management of patients with ITP. Ultimately, each patient requires an individualized treatment plan that takes into consideration the platelet count, bleeding symptoms, health-related quality of life, and medication side effects. This article provides an up-to-date review of management strategies drawing on links between the expanding amounts of clinical trial data and associated biology studies to enhance understanding of the disease heterogeneity with regard to the complex pathogenesis and response to treatment.

### ITP: a historical perspective [^7bd89d91]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

A clinical syndrome of bleeding and purpura consistent with a diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) was described by Werlhof long before platelets were identified as the cellular component of blood playing an essential role in primary haemostasis. Although a role for the spleen was suggested nearly a century ago, the pathophysiology of ITP has remained elusive for many decades. During this time Werlhof's disease was renamed idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, from which the acronym ITP originally derives. The second half of the 20th century brought recognition of the autoimmune components of ITP, and hence the need for a new standard nomenclature, which has recently been accepted. ITP currently stands for Immune Thrombocytopenia, a name that more appropriately reflects the low platelet count rather than purpura as the main feature of the disease, as well as to defining its underlying nature. Advances in our knowledge of the disease have paralleled the availability of new therapeutic agents, and we are now entering an era of pathophysiologically-based treatment options.

### How do we diagnose immune thrombocytopenia in 2018? [^6341a9bd]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

In this report, we will review the various clinical and laboratory approaches to diagnosing immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), with a focus on its laboratory diagnosis. We will also summarize the results from a number of laboratories that have applied techniques to detect anti-platelet autoantibodies as diagnostic tests for ITP. Although there is considerable variability in methods among laboratories, there is general agreement that platelet autoantibody testing has a high specificity but low sensitivity. This suggests several possibilities: (1) the ideal test for ITP has yet to be developed, (2) current test methods need to be improved, or (3) ITP is the clinical expression of a variety of thrombocytopenic disorders with different underlying mechanisms. Even the clinical diagnosis of ITP is complex, and experienced clinicians do not always agree on whether a particular patient has ITP. Improvements in the diagnostic approach to ITP are necessary to improve the management of this disorder.

### Pathophysiology and management of chronic immune thrombocytopenia: focusing on what matters [^99a814ec]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a common autoimmune disease characterized by low platelet counts and an increased risk of bleeding. Antibody-mediated platelet destruction has been the prevailing hypothesis to explain ITP pathogenesis, supported by the efficacy of B-cell depletion therapy; however, the recent success of thrombopoietin receptor agonists lends support to the notion that platelet production is also insufficient. Best practice for the management of chronic ITP has not yet been established because data from comparative trials are lacking. Despite renewed interest in novel drugs capable of increasing platelet counts, ultimate treatment goals for ITP patients must be kept in mind: to improve patients' health and well-being. In this article, the pathophysiology of ITP is reviewed and key remaining questions about mechanism are explored. A rational approach to the management of ITP in adults is outlined, acknowledging evidence and evidence gaps, and highlighting the need for clinically important endpoints in future clinical trials.

### The immune thrombocytopenia syndrome: a disorder of diverse pathogenesis and clinical presentation [^c26b1a45]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

This article presents a brief history of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) from the first clinical description written in 1735, through years of controversy about the nature and causes of what was first known as idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, then immune thrombocytopenic purpura, and, finally, ITP. Current understanding of ITP's primary and secondary forms and the effect of diverse defects in immune self tolerance that result in the development of antiplatelet antibodies is described. This overview is followed by a narrative list of other articles in this issue on topics ranging from a comprehensive review of the role of antiplatelet antibodies in platelet destruction and production to a review of classic treatment modalities and newer approaches to initial treatment.

### Pathogenesis in immune thrombocytopenia: new insights [^6296d91b]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Idiopathic (immune) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a common autoimmune disorder resulting in isolated thrombocytopenia. ITP can present either alone (primary) or in the setting of other conditions (secondary) such as infections or altered immune states. ITP is associated with a loss of tolerance to platelet antigens and a phenotype of accelerated platelet destruction and impaired platelet production. Although the etiology of ITP remains unknown, complex dysregulation of the immune system is observed in ITP patients. Antiplatelet antibodies mediate accelerated clearance from the circulation in large part via the reticuloendothelial (monocytic phagocytic) system. In addition, cellular immunity is perturbed and T-cell and cytokine profiles are significantly shifted toward a type 1 and Th17 proinflammatory immune response. Further clues into immune dysregulation in ITP may be gleaned from studies of secondary ITP. Some infections can induce antiplatelet Abs by molecular mimicry, and there may be common elements involved in breaking tolerance with other autoimmune disorders. There is also evidence for a genetic predisposition to both ITP and responsiveness to therapy, which may in part lie within immune-related genes. Lastly, treatment with immunomodulatory agents remains the mainstay of ITP therapies.

### The geoepidemiology of immune thrombocytopenic purpura [^ff21db36]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

First described in 1735 (Watson-Williams et al., 1958), immune-mediated platelet destruction is a phenomenon of protean associations that has historically varied in its definition. Recently, consensus guidelines were proposed for a standardized system of nomenclature that preserves the acronym "ITP" but encompasses a number of causes of immune-mediated thrombocytopenias, including both primary immune thrombocytopenia as well as such entities as thrombocytopenia associated with connective tissue diseases or cancer. In this paper, we will focus on current aspects of geoepidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of adult and pediatric primary immune thrombocytopenia. It is clear that both genetic and extrinsic factors exist for ITP and are likely different between children and adults. Immune thrombocytopenia remains a challenging problem but our understanding of its pathophysiology has greatly improved.

### The ITP syndrome: pathogenic and clinical diversity [^3c897fa6]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is mediated by platelet autoantibodies that accelerate platelet destruction and inhibit their production. Most cases are considered idiopathic, whereas others are secondary to coexisting conditions. Insights from secondary forms suggest that the proclivity to develop platelet-reactive antibodies arises through diverse mechanisms. Variability in natural history and response to therapy suggests that primary ITP is also heterogeneous. Certain cases may be secondary to persistent, sometimes inapparent, infections, accompanied by coexisting antibodies that influence outcome. Alternatively, underlying immune deficiencies may emerge. In addition, environmental and genetic factors may impact platelet turnover, propensity to bleed, and response to ITP-directed therapy. We review the pathophysiology of several common secondary forms of ITP. We suggest that primary ITP is also best thought of as an autoimmune syndrome. Better understanding of pathogenesis and tolerance checkpoint defects leading to autoantibody formation may facilitate patient-specific approaches to diagnosis and management.

### Chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura: mechanisms of pathogenesis [^e8d05029]. The Oncologist (2009). Low credibility.

The mechanism of idiopathic (autoimmune) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) has historically been attributed to platelet autoantibody production and the resultant platelet destruction. More recent evidence suggests a multifactorial pathogenesis. A complex picture of the immune processes involved in autoimmunity has emerged over the last decade with the identification and characterization of immunoregulatory elements (receptors, cytokines, and other signaling molecules) and cell trafficking patterns. An understanding of the interplay of cellular and humoral immune responses in the breakdown of self-tolerance has brought to light unrecognized mechanisms of the autoimmune destruction of platelets in ITP and potential targets for future therapeutic advances. The failure of the bone marrow to maximally increase platelet production also appears to play an important role in the thrombocytopenia of ITP. Treatment strategies targeting the thrombopoietin receptor to increase platelet production are a promising new approach to the management of ITP.

### The bleeding risk and natural history of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in patients with persistent low platelet counts… [^e4ee8c1a]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Otherwise, the patient will remain in the ITP state for the next cycle. ADULT idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is a relatively common and easily recognizable bleeding disorder. Nonetheless, the natural history of this condition is unknown. 1 The course and prognosis of ITP is mainly determined by the risk of spontaneous bleeding associated with low platelet counts. 1, 2 The American Society of Hematology ITP guideline panel recently published their conclusions based on a systematic review of clinical series. 2 They estimated that the risk of fatal hemorrhage was approximately 5% throughout the lifetime of a patient with ITP. We considered patients with ITP to be at risk for major hemorrhage when their platelet counts fell below 30 × 109/L.

1–3 The analysis referred to 4 bleeding categories: fatal bleeding events; hemorrhagic strokes with residual disability; major "transient" bleeding events requiring hospitalization, but without long-term sequelae; and minor oozing and bruising. We assumed no difference in bleeding rates between the sexes. Since the exact period of patient observation was not reported in most studies, we used an average between 2 extreme patient time estimates. When the model is set to the low estimates for bleeding risk, a loss of 11. 15 QALY is predicted; setting high estimates yields a loss of
16. 32 QALY. According to the base case analysis, a 30-year-old patient with ITP is predicted to lose 14. 24 QALY. The effect of varying these parameters within a plausible range was minimal.

The results of our analysis are quite surprising, considering the prevailing conception that ITP has a relatively benign course. 3 While the LE of an "average" patient with ITP seems to be only mildly compromised, our model indicates that this might not apply for patients with persistently low platelet counts. Considering the consistency of the evidence and the stability of the models' results despite uncertainties in the estimates used, we believe that these conclusions regarding the poor prognosis of ITP with persistently low platelet counts should not be ignored.

### Management of newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: can we change outcomes? [^db53bd5e]. Blood Advances (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia resulting from antibody-mediated platelet destruction combined with impaired platelet production is a common cause of thrombocytopenia. The decision to treat newly diagnosed patients is based on several factors including ceasing hemorrhagic manifestations, increasing the platelet count, prevention of bleeding, and inducing remission. Current standard first-line therapy is a course of corticosteroids. Although this treatment paradigm increases the platelet count in the majority of patients, a high percentage relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy. For this reason, intensification of first-line therapy that results in superior long-term remission rates would be desirable. This manuscript focuses primarily on adults with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), highlighting pediatric data and practice when applicable. The primary aim is to outline upfront strategies for treatment-naive patients with ITP to enhance remission rates, taking into account assessment of the risks and benefits of these approaches.

### Targeted ITP strategies: do they elucidate the biology of ITP and related disorders? [^5794561c]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

An elusive goal in hematology is a detailed understanding of autoimmune blood disorders including idiopathic (immune) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), and Evans Syndrome. While it is clear that these disorders have an autoimmune pathophysiology, the exact mechanisms are not clear. Agents that target the immune system specifically, such as rituximab and tacrolimus, are currently being used clinically with favorable results. Targeted therapy may be useful not only in treating these difficult diseases, but also may provide clues to the underlying disease pathophysiology. Carefully designed studies using targeted therapy may provide biologic predictors of disease severity, as well as predictors of response to therapy.

### On the horizon: upcoming new agents for the management of ITP [^e599f805]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has evolved over the last 20 years in response to our increased understanding of the pathophysiology of this complex immune disorder. New treatments in development have taken advantage of our evolving understanding of the biology of this disease to target new mechanisms and expand the available ways in which to approach patients with this disorder. This review focuses on novel therapeutics in the ITP pipeline and discusses the pathophysiology of ITP that has led to their development.

### Development and research in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura: an inflammatory and autoimmune disorder [^39641db5]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Bleeding and isolated thrombocytopenia in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) are phenomena of a transient or long-term disturbed immune response. Since 1980, ITP has become a model for targeted therapeutic immunomodulation with still unclear mechanisms of action. The systematic analysis of ITP aims to determine more clearly defined patient subgroups for targeted therapy and to explore the complex immune disturbances in this autoimmune disorder.

### Clinical updates in adult immune thrombocytopenia [^ebeb73d4]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) occurs in 2 to 4/100000 adults and results in variable bleeding symptoms and thrombocytopenia. In the last decade, changes in our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder have led to the publication of new guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ITP and standards for terminology. Current evidence supports alternatives to splenectomy for second-line management of patients with persistently low platelet counts and bleeding. Long-term follow-up data suggest both efficacy and safety, in particular, for the thrombopoietin receptor agonists and the occurrence of late remissions. Follow-up of patients who have undergone splenectomy for ITP reveals significant potential risks that should be discussed with patients and may influence clinician and patient choice of second-line therapy. Novel therapeutics are in development to address ongoing treatment gaps.

### Initial lymphocyte count and the development of persistent / chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura [^4c787646]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a common, benign, self-limiting disease in children. Chronic ITP is diagnosed when thorombocytopenia persists beyond 12 months. Older age is associated with increased risk for development of chronic ITP. The main objective of the current study was to examine whether total leukocyte (TLC) and absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) at diagnosis correlate with the persistence of ITP beyond 6 months.

Procedure

Two hundred and twenty four consecutive medical records for patients diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia, between April 1993 and July 2007, were reviewed and 188 patients were eligible for analysis. Case records were examined to ascertain the following information: age, gender, ethnicity, date of presentation, presenting CBC with differential count, treatment given and the outcome.

Results

The male to female ratio was almost 1:1; 24% (45/188) of patients had persistent ITP beyond 6 months. We determined that age > 8.5 year, TLC < 6,250/microl and ALC < 3,050/microl was associated with a significant risk for development of persistent ITP beyond 6 months.

Conclusions

TLC and ALC at diagnosis are predictive variables for the development of persistent/chronic ITP. Further studies are recommended to confirm the current finding and to assess the underlying pathophysiology with the course of the ITP.

### Cellular immune dysfunction in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) [^92cc3ade]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Over the past decades, a wealth of information has been reported about the pathogenic features of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). To this day, however, it is unclear whether the immune abnormalities associated with ITP play causative roles in the disease or are secondary epiphenomena brought on by the inflammatory processes that are associated with the disorder. Like the majority of all autoimmune diseases, ITP is an organ-specific disease and abnormalities in immune cell types, such as antigen-presenting cells (APC), T cells and B cells have been shown to play some sort of role in the initiation and/or perpetuation of the disease. This review will discuss recent advances in understanding three immune cells important in ITP pathophysiology: APC, T cells and B cells, and will review how they interact with each other to initiate and perpetuate ITP, particularly the chronic form of the disorder. It will also focus on new data related to the genetics of the disorder and discuss relevant animal models of ITP.

### Immune thrombocytopenia [^b928553b]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a common hematologic disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia. ITP presents as a primary or a secondary form. ITP may affect individuals of all ages, with peaks during childhood and in the elderly, in whom the age-specific incidence of ITP is greatest. Bleeding is the most common clinical manifestation of ITP. The pathogenesis of ITP is complex, involving alterations in humoral and cellular immunity. Corticosteroids remain the most common first line therapy for ITP.

### The immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) bleeding score: assessment of bleeding in patients with ITP [^32c24455]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

A method for objective quantification of bleeding symptoms in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) has not been established. The ITP Bleeding Scale (IBLS) is a novel bleeding assessment system comprising 11 site-specific grades. Implementation of the IBLS on 100 patient visits revealed that although platelet count and large platelet count correlated well with bleeding symptoms overall, this relationship disappeared in marked thrombocytopenia. The IBLS is a useful clinical tool for monitoring bleeding and may be used to aid the development of laboratory parameters that correlate with underlying bleeding propensity in thrombocytopenia.

### The pathophysiology of ITP revisited: ineffective thrombopoiesis and the emerging role of thrombopoietin receptor agonists in the management of chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura [^b779e7f7]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2008). Low credibility.

Autoimmune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is characterized by autoantibody-mediated platelet destruction that can be demonstrated by shortened radiolabeled platelet survival. An additional role of ineffective thrombopoiesis was suggested by autologous platelet kinetic studies performed in the 1980s. Sera of patients with ITP have been demonstrated to inhibit megakaryocyte growth in culture supporting the concept of suboptimal platelet production as a contributing factor to the thrombocytopenia. The relatively modest rise in thrombopoietin (TPO) levels in thrombocytopenic patients with ITP has helped to identify the TPO receptor as a potential target for the treatment of ITP. Initial studies with recombinant TPO in patients with ITP were encouraging, and novel compounds designed to stimulate the TPO receptor and resultant pathways have been shown in randomized trials to be effective in raising the platelet count and sustaining it at safe levels. Adverse effects of these agents have been relatively mild, although rare serious events including increased bone marrow reticulin deposition, increased numbers of circulating blasts and thrombosis have occurred, and theoretic risks of stimulation of megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet activation remain a concern. As these agents become available it will be important to identify those patients who will most benefit from their use. The place of these drugs in the current management algorithms of ITP will evolve over time as results of clinical trials with these agents and experience with their use in the clinic clarify short-term and long-term efficacy and potential toxicities.

### Immune thrombocytopenic purpura of childhood [^60c4eba9]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

Immune mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a common manifestation of autoimmune disease in children. Although patients often present with bruises, petechiae, and some mucosal bleeding, the incidence of life-threatening hemorrhage is rare (0.2–0.9%) but can be fatal when presenting in vital organs. A wide range of therapeutic regimens are currently in use, including observation alone, as the majority of children recover within 4–6 months regardless of treatment. A growing understanding of the pathophysiology of acute ITP in children has not impacted the controversy surrounding treatment, but has clarified the mechanism of action of the most frequently used agents in chronic ITP. Newer monoclonal antibodies such as Rituxan have proved very useful in chronic or refractory ITP and studies are ongoing to determine the best regimens using this form of immune modulation. Splenectomy and newer agents to boost platelet production are also under study in chronic ITP. Neonates may also have a form of immune thrombocytopenia with extensive bruising and thrombocytopenia called neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenic purpura (NATP). Rather than autoantibodies, the platelet destruction is secondary to transplacental maternal IgG alloantibodies. During pregnancy mothers may become sensitized to platelet membrane antigens present on fetal platelets. These antibodies may result in serious bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage in the perinatal period. Once identified, these mothers may require treatment during future pregnancies to minimize serious bleeding in the fetus and neonate. Treatment in utero and immediately following delivery is focused on restoring neonatal platelets to a safe level and preventing life-threatening bleeding.

The cause of idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP) is largely unknown, although the underlying pathophysology is an autoimmune process. Anti-idiotypic antibodies and their role on regulatory T-cells might play an important role in the switch from acute to chronic ITP. The exact interaction remains to be elucidated. The effects of the dysregulated immune system and of the autoimmune process on thrombocytopoiesis and megakaryopiesis are ill defined. Therapy of acute and chronic ITP is directed to the risk of bleeding.

### Cryptic conspirators: a conversation about thrombocytopenia and antiphospholipid syndrome [^f7ee1c97]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is best known for conveying increased risk of thrombotic events and pregnancy morbidity, thrombocytopenia is also recognized as a common association. In this review, we will explore the relationship between thrombocytopenia and APS, highlighting our evolving understanding - and persistent knowledge gaps - through clinically oriented questions and answers.

Recent Findings

A history of thrombocytopenia likely portends a more severe APS phenotype (including increased risk of thrombosis). Although the pathophysiology underlying thrombocytopenia in APS has yet to be definitively revealed, mechanisms that play a role (at least in subsets of patients) include: immune thrombocytopenic purpura/ITP-like autoantibodies against platelet glycoproteins; antiphospholipid antibody (aPL)-mediated platelet activation and consumption; and potentially life threatening thrombotic microangiopathy. Although thrombocytopenia is often 'mild' in APS (and therefore, may not require specific therapy), there are causes of acute-onset thrombocytopenia that mandate emergent work-up and treatment. When APS-related thrombocytopenia does require therapy, the approach must be individualized (requiring an understanding of pathophysiology in the particular APS patient). For patients with ITP-like disease, rituximab is emerging as a popular approach to treatment; in contrast, there are hints that thrombopoietin mimetics may be associated with elevated thrombotic risk.

Summary

Thrombocytopenia is common in APS, and is likely associated with more severe disease. Improved understanding of thrombocytopenia in APS has the potential to improve risk stratification, reveal novel aspects of APS pathophysiology, and lead to treatments that are more individualized and holistic.

### Immune thrombocytopenia [^5a56a26e]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by autoimmune-mediated platelet destruction and impairment of thrombopoiesis. ITP may occur in the absence of an evident predisposing etiology (primary ITP) or secondary to a growing list of associated conditions (secondary ITP), and must be differentiated from other causes of thrombocytopenia. This review focuses on primary ITP in adults. The traditional goal of therapy in this population is to achieve a hemostatic platelet count of 30×10⁹/L or above for most patients while minimizing treatment-related morbidity. This approach has been called into question by the recent advent of well-tolerated and effective agents for the management of ITP, including pulse-dose dexamethasone, rituximab, and the thrombopoietin receptor agonists. Recent studies suggest the potential for aggressive therapy at the time of diagnosis to alter the natural history of ITP and point to the importance of quality-of-life considerations in therapeutic decision making.

### Thrombopoietin and platelet production in chronic immune thrombocytopenia [^7a896aee]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Since 1968, a greater understanding of platelet biology and its regulation by thrombopoietin (TPO) has emerged. It is now recognized that immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a disorder of reduced platelet production as well as increased platelet destruction. New therapies for ITP have emerged that have exploited this new pathophysiologic understanding. This article reviews the biology of TPO, the regulation of its circulating level in ITP, the platelet kinetic data supporting inappropriate platelet production in ITP, and the TPO mimetic agents available to treat ITP.

### Pathogenesis of refractory ITP: overview [^a91b696b]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Medium credibility.

A subset of individuals with 'primary' or 'idiopathic' immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who fail to respond to conventional first- and second-line agents or who lose responsiveness are considered to have 'refractory' disease (rITP), placing them at increased risk of bleeding and complications of intensive treatment. However, the criteria used to define the refractory state vary among studies, which complicates research and clinical investigation. Moreover, it is unclear whether rITP is simply 'more severe' ITP, or if there are specific pathogenic pathways that are more likely to result in refractory disease, and whether the presence or development of rITP can be established or anticipated based on these differences. This paper reviews potential biological features that may be associated with rITP, including genetic and epigenetic risk factors, dysregulation of T cells and cytokine networks, antibody affinity and specificity, activation of complement, impaired platelet production and alterations in platelet viability and clearance. These findings indicate the need for longitudinal studies using novel clinically available methodologies to identify and monitor pathogenic T cells, platelet antibodies and other clues to the development of refractory disease.

### The role of T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells in refractory immune thrombocytopenia [^2e92f8ac]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is characterized by a dysregulated immune response against platelets, affecting both their destruction and production. A role for an abnormal T-cell compartment has been established in ITP pathogenesis and treatments that increase platelet counts in patients with ITP have shown improvements in T-cell profiles. On the other hand, patients who were refractory to treatment appear to retain the T-cell abnormalities as before. Myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs) are also emerging as key contributors to the immune pathology of ITP and response to treatment. In this review, we will discuss how various treatments affect the T-cell and MDSC compartments in ITP. The review will focus on studies that have examined the underlying mechanisms and/or genetic basis responsible for refractoriness to a given treatment and highlight remaining challenges in identifying factors and mechanisms to predict response to treatment.

WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF THROMBOCYTOPENIA IN ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME?

To our knowledge, there is no consensus explanation as to what drives thrombocytopenia in APS, and we would posit that distinct, overlapping mechanisms are often at play. These may include immune thrombocytopenic purpura/immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)-like autoantibodies against platelet glycoproteins; aPL-mediated platelet activation and consumption; and potentially life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathy. Less common causes of thrombocytopenia in APS include decreased platelet production, increased platelet pooling, and pseudothrombocytopenia (platelet clumping in vitro), as discussed in an excellent recent review of the topic. Clinicians may also need to investigate causes of thrombocytopenia not related to APS, including adverse effects of medications, certain atypical infections, and bone-marrow processes.

Abstract

The 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) included recommendations on the management of adults (recommendations 1–9) and children (recommendations 10–21) with primary ITP. We describe here the results of a review of the 2019 guidelines by a working group of experts requested by ASH to inform decision-making about the need for and timing of a guideline revision. An updated Medline and Embase search applied the same search terms as in the 2019 ASH guidelines, limited to systematic reviews and clinical trials, from May 2017 to July 2022. There were 193 studies identified, 102 underwent abstract reviews, and 54 full reviews. Each study was assessed based on relevance to the previous recommendation with regard to the population, prioritized outcomes, new outcomes, and study design. Reviewers assessed if the data would change the strength or the directionality of the existing recommendation or merit development of a new recommendation. Based on this review, the ASH Committee on Quality endorsed a focused update on second-line management for adults with ITP. In addition, there will be continued annual monitoring and reviewing of the 2019 ASH guidelines on ITP in full to evaluate when there is sufficient new evidence to warrant additional revisions.

Thrombocytopenia is common in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) at diagnosis. It is a universal side effect of dose-intensive regimens employed in the treatment of adult ALL. In patients with ALL who achieve remission, thrombocytopenia frequently indicates relapse.

### Pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopenia [^b8c7f7b5]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare autoimmune disease due to an abnormal T cell response, notably supported by splenic T follicular helper cells, that stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of autoreactive B cells. The antiplatelet autoantibodies they produce facilitate platelet phagocytosis by macrophages, essentially in the spleen. Macrophages contribute to the perpetuation of the auto-immune response as the main antigen-presenting cell during ITP. CD8 + T cells also participate to thrombocytopenia by increasing platelet apoptosis. Besides this peripheral platelet destruction, inappropriate bone marrow production also exacerbates thrombocytopenia, due to an immune response against megakaryocytes. Moreover, the level of circulating thrombopoietin, the main growth factor of megakaryocytes, is low during ITP. In this review, the major mechanisms leading to thrombocytopenia, the role of the different immune cells and the different targets of treatments are described.

The background notes minimal randomized-trial data to assist management, and the conclusions state there was a lack of evidence to support strong recommendations, that strategies avoiding medication side effects were favored, that a large focus was placed on shared decision-making (especially second-line therapy), and that future research should apply standard corticosteroid-dosing regimens, report patient-reported outcomes, and include cost-analysis evaluations.

### Pathogenesis of chronic immune thrombocytopenia: increased platelet destruction and / or decreased platelet production [^7fd8c814]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a haematological disorder in which patients predominantly develop skin and mucosal bleeding. Early studies suggested ITP was primarily due to immune-mediated peripheral platelet destruction. However, increasing evidence indicates that an additional component of this disorder is immune-mediated decreased platelet production that cannot keep pace with platelet destruction. Evidence for increased platelet destruction is thrombocytopenia following ITP plasma infusions in normal subjects, in vitro platelet phagocytosis, and decreased platelet survivals in ITP patients that respond to therapies that prevent in vivo platelet phagocytosis; e.g., intravenous immunoglobulin G, anti-D, corticosteroids, and splenectomy. The cause of platelet destruction in most ITP patients appears to be autoantibody-mediated. However, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated platelet (and possibly megakaryocyte) lysis, may also be important. Studies supporting suppressed platelet production include: reduced platelet turnover in over 80% of ITP patients, morphological evidence of megakaryocyte damage, autoantibody-induced suppression of in vitro megakaryocytopoiesis, and increased platelet counts in most ITP patients following treatment with thrombopoietin receptor agonists. This review summarizes data that indicates that the pathogenesis of chronic ITP may be due to both immune-mediated platelet destruction and/or suppressed platelet production. The relative importance of these two mechanisms undoubtedly varies among patients.

### Deciphering the genetic basis of immune thrombocytopenia: current evidence for genetic predisposition in adult ITP [^e8c631d5]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

To add further value to data collected on the genetic background of ITP, research agendas should go beyond conducting association studies alone and should aim to demonstrate clear genotype-phenotype associations. After all, studies on various other autoimmune diseases have shown similar associations with polymorphisms as those observed in ITP, which raises the question of whether any discovered polymorphism is actually causative for ITP or potentially related to autoimmunity in general. Future studies need to investigate whether there is a direct causal relationship between different polymorphisms and ITP and to determine the relevance of any alteration for the defining thrombocytopenic state. The most valuable approach to achieve this ambitious goal is certainly the use of well-designed murine models, which have already contributed substantially to the understanding of the basic genetic and proteomic mechanisms of ITP. In the future, the generation of knockin mouse models that allow detailed functional analysis of the effects of genetic alterations on molecular and cellular processes in vivo may help elucidate the impact of genetic predisposition in ITP.

The complex etiology of ITP and its diverse clinical presentation most likely results from an equally heterogeneous genetic background. Many different SNPs may affect the response to different environmental factors and precipitating events. This makes the identification of a definite driver mutation highly unlikely. Consequently, there are currently no genetic markers that are individually sufficiently powerful to provide a causal explanation for the development of ITP. However, there is no question that further genetic analyses will lead the way in deciphering the pathogenic mechanisms of ITP and identifying potential biomarkers or treatment targets required for stratified and targeted therapies.

### Immune thrombocytopenia [^1b62cc9d]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on immune thrombocytopenia:

- **Definition**: ITP is an acquired autoimmune disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100×10⁹/L) due to antibody- and T-cell-mediated destruction of platelets and impaired platelet production, in the absence of other causes of thrombocytopenia.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of ITP involves the production of autoantibodies against platelet glycoproteins, which leads to platelet opsonization and phagocytosis. Additionally, abnormalities in T cell immunity, including cytotoxic T cells, abnormal T regulatory cells, helper T cell imbalance, and abnormal T cell anergy, play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of this condition.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of ITP is estimated at 3.7 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for the development of ITP include vaccines or infectious exposures, such as mumps-measles-rubella vaccine, H. pylori infection, CMV or VZV, HCV infection. Other autoimmune disorders, exposure to certain medications (bactrim, vancomycin, valproic acid, heparin, oxaliplatin, alemtuzumab) have also been linked to the development of ITP.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, ITP presents with symptoms related to thrombocytopenia, such as easy bruising, abnormal bleeding, and petechiae. The disease course is highly variable, with some patients experiencing an acute episode that resolves spontaneously, while others may have a chronic course with persistent thrombocytopenia.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of ITP is often favorable but can be unpredictable. Some patients may achieve remission, while others may experience relapses or chronic disease.

### Autoimmune thrombocytopenia [^6c3e75d9]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder in which platelets coated with mainly antibodies against platelet GPIIb/IIIa and GPIb/IX are destroyed in the spleen. Recent evidence suggests that platelets are also destroyed by cytotoxic T cells. The diagnosis is made by exclusion for other causes of thrombocytopenia. As routine blood counts are becoming more available, many mild cases of ITP (platelets > 30 × 10⁹ L⁻¹) are being diagnosed and they usually do not require treatment. In patients with platelet counts persistently < 30 × 10⁹ L⁻¹, treatment with corticosteroids, and/or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or anti-D may be required. The primary goal of treatment is to maintain the platelet count at a safe level with minimal side effects. After 3–6 months, if spontaneous remission has not occurred and if the side effects are significant, splenectomy is recommended. This is the single most effective treatment of ITP. The refractory patients who fails splenectomy and subsequently first- and second-line therapies, is a management dilemma. Therapeutic options are limited, available treatments potentially toxic and the chances of sustained response low. Observation with no active treatment is a reasonable option. With the increased availability of the thrombopoietic agents in the future, there may be a good prospect of keeping the platelet counts of these refractory patients at a safe long-term level with one of these drugs.

Introduction

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an immune-mediated disorder in which defects in immune self-tolerance lead to accelerated platelet destruction and impaired platelet production, both resulting in a thrombocytopenic state with variable bleeding symptoms. Once considered idiopathic, ITP is now seen as a condition with a complex autoimmune pathogenesis characterized by multiple processes of immune system dysregulation. The formation of antiplatelet autoantibodies is considered to be the pivotal mechanism of platelet destruction together with impaired megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis in the bone marrow. More recently, T-cell–mediated processes have been shown to play an equally crucial role in the development and perpetuation of ITP. Several mechanisms, such as the disturbed balance of T helper cells (Th1/Th2), a decreased number and dysfunction of regulatory T cells, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte–mediated platelet destruction, have been identified. Moreover, it is increasingly recognized that platelets are not only targets of autoinflammatory processes but might directly play an active role in ITP onset and progression via their role as both immune sensing and immune effector cells.

Despite the advances in understanding the pathogenesis of ITP, the principle immune mechanism that initiates ITP has not yet been identified. ITP is considered to be a multifactorial disease caused, and sustained by, interactions between environmental as well as genetic factors. Although the contribution of individual genetic factors, and their impact on the emergence and course of ITP are still largely unknown, efforts are underway to uncover potential host genetic factors associated with the development of ITP. Discovering causative genes or pathways is crucial for identifying populations that are at risk and for developing new therapeutic strategies that may prevent chronicity. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs), the most common patterns of genetic variants, have been identified in various immunity-related genes, such as cytokine genes, Fcγ receptor (FcγR) genes, or T-cell costimulatory genes, and have been linked to patients' susceptibility to develop ITP (Figure 1).

METHODS

Study design

We retrospectively identified 0‐ to 21‐year‐old patients diagnosed with ITP between 01 January 2019 and 31 December 2023 who received medical care within the Texas Children's Hospital system under an institutional review board‐approved protocol. Initially, all patients with presumed ITP (both primary and secondary) were included. Patients with presumed ITP later confirmed to be an inherited or functional platelet disorder were subsequently excluded. Additionally, patients with specific subtypes of secondary ITP that differ significantly in their underlying pathophysiology (ITP diagnosed after solid or haematopoietic stem cell transplant, ITP diagnosed during or after cancer therapy, neonatal ITP secondary to maternal ITP and fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenic purpura) were also excluded.

Data collection and definitions

The definitions and outcome criteria for ITP published by the International Working Group (IWG) in 2009 were used for this study. Thrombocytopenia < 100 × 10³/μL was required for diagnosis. Secondary ITP was defined as forms of ITP due to an underlying disease or drug exposure. Patients with viral infections or vaccines in the preceding 6 weeks before diagnosis were considered as primary ITP. The term 'comorbid autoimmune, rheumatologic or allergic (CARA) conditions' was used to capture other clinical conditions that are not definitive causes of secondary ITP but that may distinguish patients with underlying immune dysregulation that could be influencing the ITP pathophysiology and thus response to treatment. CARA conditions included all causes of immune‐mediated secondary ITP (SLE, ES, among others), as well as conditions not definitively associated with autoimmune cytopenias, such as asthma, atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis. Bleeding scores were retrospectively assigned as per the modified Buchanan and Adix bleeding scale for the worst overall bleeding severity within 3 months of diagnosis and within the total time of follow‐up. ITP was considered resolved if platelets were > 150 × 10³/μL on two occasions at least 1 month apart or if platelets were > 200 × 10³/μL with a mean platelet volume (MPV) < 11.5 fL on one occasion, absent of ITP‐directed therapy. The absence of ITP therapy was defined in accordance with IWG‐defined treatment response and duration timelines, as follows: 6 weeks since last dose of IVIG or RhoD, 3 weeks since completion of corticosteroids, 1 week since last dose of TPO‐RA, 1 week since last immunomodulator or at least 6 months since last anti‐CD20 therapy with evidence of B‐cell re‐population.

After completing this article, readers should be able to: Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is an acquired hemorrhagic disorder characterized by: 1)thrombocytopenia that is defined as a platelet count less than 150 × 10⁹/L, 2) a purpuric rash, 3) normal bone marrow, and 4) the absence of signs of other identifiable causes of thrombocytopenia. ITP is classified as acute or chronic, with the latter defined as the persistence of thrombocytopenia for more than 6 months from the initial presentation of signs and symptoms. ITP is estimated to be one of the most common acquired bleeding disorders encountered by pediatricians, with the incidence of symptomatic disease being approximately 3 to 8 per 100, 000 children per year. Acute ITP is more prevalent among children younger than 10 years of age, affects males and females equally, and is more prevalent during the late winter and spring. Chronic ITP affects adolescents more often than. Comments

The evidence review "included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that had internal comparators", and due to scarcity also "included all single-arm prospective studies of ≥ 50 adults with newly diagnosed ITP" and, for observation, "retrospective studies of ≥ 50 adults". No direct comparative studies were found: "We found no studies that directly compared corticosteroids vs management with observation in adult patients with ITP with a platelet count of < 30 × 10⁹/L", though "We found 5 RCTs… and 2 prospective studies" of corticosteroids. Reported outcomes included "Four studies reported data on response within 7 days; 6 studies reported on remission; 3 studies reported on major bleeding; 4 studies reported on mortality; 0 studies reported on overall HRQoL", and "There were no studies in ITP patients with platelet counts of < 30 × 10⁹/L who were managed with observation alone". Consequently, "The relative effects were not estimable from the data because of a lack of direct comparisons".

### Deciphering the genetic basis of immune thrombocytopenia: current evidence for genetic predisposition in adult ITP [^e6fb68f2]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is the consequence of a complex, still incompletely understood immunological dysregulation. Proposed mechanisms include autoantibody-induced platelet destruction, impaired platelet production as well as abnormalities in T-cell immunity, such as T helper cells (Th1) polarization, a high proportion of Th17 cells, and a reduced number of regulatory T cells. Although the etiology of ITP is incompletely understood and considered multifactorial in most cases, genetic variants are thought to play a key role in susceptibility to ITP, especially in persistent or chronic ITP. Efforts are currently underway to uncover possible predisposing genetic factors for the development of ITP. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variations have been identified in several immune-related genes, such as cytokine genes, Fcγ receptor genes or T-cell costimulation genes, and have been associated with patients' susceptibility to ITP. However, because of the clinical heterogeneity and low incidence of ITP it remains challenging to perform genetic analyses with sufficiently large sample size within informative patient populations, highlighting the need for collection of well-annotated biomaterials in clinical trials or registry projects. Another significant challenge is to go beyond performing association studies alone and to establish genotype-phenotype associations, thus proving causality between a genetic alteration and ITP pathogenesis. This review summarizes our current knowledge on genetic alterations identified as potential predisposing factors for the development of ITP in adults, thereby addressing signaling pathways considered critical for ITP pathogenesis.

Thrombocytopenia and purpura

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) occurs when autoantibodies target and destroy platelets. It presents as isolated thrombocytopenia without anemia, leukopenia, or another apparent cause (Table 3). Patients may have purpura, petechiae, hemorrhage, epistaxis, and fatigue. Diagnosis is based on exam, complete blood count (CBC), reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear. Bone marrow biopsy is not typically required but, when performed, shows increased megakaryocytes from destruction exceeding production.

Table 3
Hematologic immune adverse effects related to ICI therapy: thrombocytopenia and purpura

Treatment is prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for 2–3 weeks with tapering over 4–6 weeks. IVIG can be given as a single 1 g/kg dose. Rituximab monotherapy or in combination with thrombopoietin receptor agonists is used for steroid/IVIG-refractory cases23. Emerging data catalog immune-mediated bleeding/thrombotic complications in the broader ICI setting, supporting vigilance and early hematology consultation3⁷.

Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)

Acquired TTP is a thrombotic microangiopathy caused by severe ADAMTS13 protease deficiency, leading to unchecked von Willebrand factor activity and platelet aggregation. Thrombi form in small vessels, damaging organs. The classic pentad includes hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, fever, neurologic abnormalities, and renal dysfunction. Additional symptoms may include nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspnea, chest pain, bleeding, or easy bruising.

TTP is a medical emergency. Standard treatment includes plasma exchange and methylprednisolone (1 g daily × 3 days after plasma exchange). Rituximab is frontline in patients receiving blood/plasma transfusions. ICI-associated hemostatic complications — including TTP and acquired hemophilia — are increasingly cataloged and should trigger rapid multidisciplinary management.

Post-transfusion purpura (PTP)

PTP is a rare delayed complication of transfusion, usually 5 to 10 days post-transfusion, often triggered by alloimmunization to platelet antigens (e.g. HPA-1a). Platelet destruction results from complement fixation. Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion and serologic testing, though treatment should begin empirically if PTP is suspected, as serology may not be readily available. Standard treatment includes IVIG, plasmapheresis, and corticosteroids. Discontinuation of ICI therapy may be required in severe cases5.

Definition of terms in 2019 ASH guideline on immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — standardized thresholds for responses, disease phases, and bleeding severity are specified. Corticosteroid-dependent is defined as ongoing need for continuous prednisone > 6 mg/d (or corticosteroid equivalent) or frequent corticosteroid courses to maintain a platelet count ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L and/or to avoid bleeding. Response categories include durable response (platelet count ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L and at least doubling of the baseline count at 6 mo), early response (platelet count ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L and at least doubling baseline at 1 wk), and initial response (platelet count ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L and at least doubling baseline at 1 mo). Disease duration terms are newly diagnosed ITP (ITP duration of < 3 mo), persistent ITP (ITP duration of 3–12 mo), and chronic ITP (ITP duration of ≥ 12 mo), and remission is platelet count > 100 × 10⁹/L at 12 mo. Bleeding severity includes major bleeding defined as (1) WHO grade 3 or 4 bleeding, (2) Buchanan severe grade, (3) Bolton-Maggs and Moon "major bleeding", (4) IBLS grade 2 or higher, or (5) life-threatening or intracerebral hemorrhage bleeding, whereas minor bleeding is any bleeding not meeting the criteria for "major bleeding".

### Antiplatelet antibodies in chronic immune thrombocytopenia and their role in platelet destruction and defective platelet production [^844da0b9]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder manifested by immune-mediated platelet destruction and suppression of platelet production. Chronic ITP characteristically has an insidious onset, usually requires therapy, and is most commonly seen in adults. The diagnosis of chronic ITP is one of exclusion and is based on the American Society of Hematology Guidelines: The patient's history, physical examination, and peripheral blood film must be consistent with the diagnosis and other causes of thrombocytopenia must be ruled out. This article reviews the role of antiplatelet autoantibody in adult chronic ITP.

### Feasibility of plasma proteomics in patients with immune thrombocytopenia [^22f6de2a]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

ITP is an acquired autoimmune bleeding disorder characterized by an isolated thrombocytopenia. The pathophysiology is highly multifactorial and involves antibody- and/or cytotoxic T cell-mediated killing of platelets and disruption of megakaryocyte function hampering platelet production. ITP remains a diagnosis of exclusion, and due to the high degree of variability between patients, it remains challenging to predict disease courses and responses to therapeutic agents. Hence, diagnostic and therapeutic laboratory biomarkers are highly warranted. To address this issue, in their paper, Jiang and colleagues have performed plasma proteomics in ITP patients (n = 40), in comparison to patients with thrombocytopenia due to other causes than ITP (non-ITP thrombocytopenia, n = 19) and healthy controls (n = 18). The data underscore that patients with ITP have a distinct plasma proteomic signature compared to non-ITP thrombocytopenia patients and healthy individuals. The findings should be further validated and investigated but suggest that the application of plasma proteomics is feasible and promising with respect to the search for potential biomarkers in patients with ITP.

American Society of Hematology guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia — research priorities emphasize that the panel was able to make a strong recommendation for approximately one-fifth (5/21) of the prioritized questions and recommend methodological directions for future evidence generation. The panel recommends that collaborative cohort studies (retrospective and prospective), registries, and other observational studies addressing these issues could contribute much to improve the current levels of evidence and are likely more feasible than RCTs. These studies should apply standard dosing regimens and definitions, consistently report on patient-reported outcomes including HRQoL and side effects, and report long-term follow-up data. The panel also recommends ongoing collaborative engagement of patients to best understand how to apply these guidelines within the context of shared decision-making. Lastly, the panel recognizes that many of the management options covered in these recommendations are unavailable in certain countries; therefore global cost-effective strategies should also be assessed.

Primary immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder with platelet destruction due to B- and T-cell dysregulation and antiplatelet autoantibodies production. Flow cytometry can be used to further characterize the B- and T-cell compartments involved in platelet destruction. This case-control study was to enumerate plasmablast cells in pediatric ITP patients and to correlate their levels with disease course. This study included 30 ITP patients and 10 controls. Identification and enumeration of Plasmablast were done by multicolor flow cytometry using specific antibody panels (CD19, CD27 & CD38) and sequential gating using FACSCanto flow cytometer and FlowJo software. We found that lymphocytes subpopulation in ITP patients and controls revealed increase in frequency of CD19 (B lymphocytes) in acute, persistent, and chronic ITP patients in comparison with controls (p < 0.001, 0.023, 0.001) respectively. Plasmablast cells could play a role in the pathogenesis of ITP and might guide therapy in ITP patients in the future.

Proposal for a prospective study to establish the existence and search for pathomechanisms of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura of unidentified pathophysiology

If the underlying pathophysiology in uTTP cases were indeed to involve a non-immune mechanism, one may imagine several possibilities resulting in severely deficient ADAMTS13 activity. As suggested by Simon et al. non-immune destruction or consumption of ADAMTS13, deficient synthesis in liver failure, proteolytic degradation or catalytic inhibition of ADAMTS13, e.g. by interleukin-6, may be considered. I fully agree with Knöbl that carefully planned prospective studies will be needed and Table 1 in his Commentlists many important items to be applied: prospective patient enrollment at hospital admission is mandatory. A strict protocol must be in place for clinical monitoring, blood sampling, laboratory analyses and biomaterial sample storage for future investigations, e.g. citrated plasma, EDTA plasma, serum and samples for DNA- and/or RNA-based analyses. A professional biobank set-up, as reported for a prospective cohort study on elderly patients with venous thrombosis, should be established. Necessarily, this needs to be a multicenter study with dedicated TTP specialist centers and all included patients should be followed-up, optimally for several years. This will allow to determine whether, similarly to the cohort reported by Simon et al.some 20% of patients will later receive a revised diagnosis of iTTP when autoantibodies against ADAMTS13 become positive and/or clinical relapses occur.

Such a proposed study needs broad academic input from many centers and needs to be funded. The International Working Group on TTP, may be optimally positioned to set up a Steering Committee preparing a study protocol and I would hope that, besides academically acquired funding, industry will substantially support such an investigation.

### Rituximab in the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia: what is the role of this agent in 2019? [^67ae85a6]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology of immune thrombocytopenia

The milestone role of autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of ITP was first reported in 1951 by Harrington et al. who showed that the infusion of plasma from ITP patients into normal controls caused thrombocytopenia, thus imputing the cause of the disease to a plasma-derived factor. This "factor" was subsequently identified as an IgG anti-platelet antibody, directed against platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa and/or the GPIb-IX-V complex. Very rarely, antibodies against GPIa-IIa or GPIV can be found (5%).

Antibody-opsonized platelets are then recognized through the Fcγ-receptors by macrophages in the spleen, liver and bone marrow, phagocytized and prematurely destroyed. Other mechanisms through which antibodies can mediate platelet destruction are complement deposition with intravascular lysis and induction of platelet apoptosis. – Plasma from patients with ITP also inhibits megakaryocyte growth and function in the bone marrow.

The Ashwell-Morell receptors in hepatocytes have been invoked as a further pathogenic mechanism, because they physiologically remove desialylated, "old" platelets from the circulation. Anti-GPIb/IX autoantibodies are thought to enhance the desialylation of GPIb, increasing hepatic clearance of platelets.

Many abnormalities have been shown in T cells of patients with ITP: an altered Th1/Th2 balance, with an increased number of Th1 T-helper cells, and a decrease in the number and function of regulatory T cells. The abnormal activation of cytotoxic CD8 + T cells may also have a role in the pathogenesis of ITP, contributing to both platelet destruction and impaired platelet production.

Circulating thrombopoietin levels in ITP are not increased proportionally to the level of thrombocytopenia, and are usually normal or only slightly increased.

Evidence review found no usable comparative ITP data because no studies had data on short courses of prednisone. Based on clinical experience, the panel agreed there was likely trivial benefit in continuing corticosteroids beyond 6 weeks; for the majority of patients, a visit 6 weeks after starting corticosteroids should determine remission versus need for additional therapy, and for patients who require additional therapy, consideration of alternative therapy is preferred over ongoing exposure to corticosteroids. The panel also agreed the risk of harm was large with courses > 6 weeks and acknowledged that 6 weeks is not evidence based but represents a reasonable duration to permit a standard maximum 21 days of treatment plus taper.

### Autoimmune effector mechanisms associated with a defective immunosuppressive axis in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) [^b87598b7]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by an isolated thrombocytopenia and variable phenotype as some patients suffer no bleeding whilst others have bleeding from mild to severe, which may be fatal. This variability probably reflects the disease's complex pathophysiology; a dysregulated hyperreactive immune effector cell response involving the entire adaptive immune system (e.g. B and T cell subsets) that leads to platelet and megakaryocyte (MK) destruction. It appears that these effector responses are due to a breakdown in immune tolerance, and this is characterized by defects in several immunosuppressive cell types. These include defective T regulatory cells (Tregs), B regulatory cells (Bregs) and Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), all of which are all intimately associated with antigen presenting cells (APC) such as dendritic cells (DC). The loss of this immunosuppressive axis allows for the activation of unchecked autoreactive T cells and B cells, leading to the development of autoantibodies and cytotoxic T cells (CTL), which can directly destroy platelets in the periphery and inhibit MK platelet production in the bone marrow (BM). This review will focus on the effector cell mechanisms in ITP and highlight the defective immunosuppressive axis that appears responsible for this platelet-specific immune hyperreactivity.

### Clinical factors and biomarkers predict outcome in patients with immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^e27f47e9]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is a rare, but life-threatening, hematologic disorder. It is characterized by severe thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), with or without end organ damage. The underlying pathophysiology of iTTP is a functional deficiency of plasma ADAMTS13 activity, resulting from autoantibodies targeting plasma ADAMTS13, a metalloprotease that cleaves von Willebrand factor (VWF). – Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) remains the standard of care, in conjunction with immunosuppressive therapies that include corticosteroids and rituximab to inhibit acute inflammation and autoantibody production. However, an in-hospital mortality rate remains as high as ~20%, or less than 10% following the introduction of a novel therapy caplacizumab, an anti-VWF nanobody; nearly 30% of surviving patients may experience disease exacerbationand/or relapse. Currently, clinical factors and biomarkers predictive of clinical course/outcome are scanty, and their predictive values have yet to be established in diverse patient populations.

Demographic features such as race, gender and age are shown to associate with disease prevalence and severity. For instance, iTTP occurs more commonly in African-American females, and, perhaps not surprisingly, older age (> 60 years) is associated with an increased mortality. Additionally, serum levels of creatine kinase-muscle/brain (CK-MB), troponin I, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ADAMTS13 antigen or activity levels, anti-ADAMTS13 antibody levelsand, more recently, the platelet recovery rateare shown to be associated with increased mortality.

In this study, we describe the Alabama cohort of 73 unique patients with confirmed diagnosis of iTTP selected from a total of 142 admissions. This cohort of patients was primarily from the Southeastern United States. Clinical information, laboratory values, and various biomarkers were collected and analysed with respect to their associations with admission type, disease severity, and mortality.

Perspectives: future directions

Despite the considerable progress made in unravelling the role of ADAMTS13 in primary hemostasis, our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of iTTP is still not complete. Future studies will have to reveal a reason for the paradoxically extremely low incidence of the disease considering the frequent occurrence of identified genetic risk factors within the HLA-class II locus in the healthy population. Another field of investigation involves the mechanisms determining the reoccurrence of autoreactive lymphocytes in patients following immunomodulation with B-cell depleting therapies in order to better anticipate relapses. Moreover, a new therapeutic area is being opened in the field with the development of the recombinant ADAMTS13; its interactions with the immune system of iTTP patients will require further investigation.

Chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a bleeding disorder that is characterized by increased platelet destruction and is believed to be autoantibody mediated. In this study, CD3+ T cells from ITP patients had increased expression of genes involved in cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In addition, cytotoxic cell-mediated lysis of autologous platelets was shown in active ITP. Our data suggest that T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity is an alternative mechanism for platelet destruction in ITP.

### Splenectomy for immune thrombocytopenia: the evolution and preservation of treatment [^608b8e97]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

The management of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has evolved over the course of the past twenty- five years as new treatments have emerged (Figure 1). Despite such advances, splenectomy remains a viable choice. In this edition of Haematologica, Avila et al. provide long-term outcomes of pediatric patients with ITP who underwent splenectomy. Using data derived from the Splenectomy Registry of the Intercontinental Cooperative ITP Study (ICIS) group, an update of outcomes of patients with primary ITP who underwent splenectomy treatment between 1997 and 2017 was analyzed. Findings from this study provide important and relevant information regarding splenectomy as an effective treatment option for ITP, which in certain contexts may have improved outcomes.

Immune thrombocytopenia was first described even prior to the identification of platelets as a component of blood. Various conditions associated with purpura were described from the 11 th to the 17 th century. However, it was only in 1735 that Paul Gottleib Werlhof reported the first classical case of ITPin a teenage girl with cutaneous and overt mucosal bleeding symptoms following an infectious disease. This led to the eponym of "Werlhof's Disease", which was previously used to describe ITP. Over time, as microscopy technology progressed, platelets were discovered. Shortly after Bizzozero's discovery of the association between presence and function of platelets in 1881, our understanding of the pathophysiology of thrombocytopenia grew during the late 1880s.

### Splenectomy for immune thrombocytopenia: the evolution and preservation of treatment [^e13ebe68]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypotheses began to emerge regarding the pathophysiology of ITP, with respect to a state of either poor platelet production versus a process of peripheral platelet destruction. In the early 1900s, Marino inoculated guinea pigs with rabbit platelets producing antiplatelet antibodies, this simulated ITP in humans suggesting an immunemediated destructive cause. Years later, in 1916, Paul Kaznelson extrapolated the pathophysiology of immunemediated hemolytic anemia to ITP and suggested that platelet destruction occurred in the spleen. This led to the first successful splenectomy in a 36-year-old woman with presumed chronic ITP, improving her platelet count from 2×10⁹/L to 500×10⁹/L. Finally, in 1950 Dr. Harrington injected himself with blood from a woman with ITP; his platelet count immediately dropped, recovering five days later. This experiment was the first to support the concept of an anti-platelet factor in the blood. Over the course of the following hundred years, knowledge of the pathophysiology of ITP has continued to expand to embrace a comprehensive recognition of the complex interactions in the immune system, in turn leading to a variety of novel treatment modalities. Despite these advances, splenectomy has continued to stand the test of time since it was first performed in 1916, remaining a beneficial option for this condition.

Treatment guidelines for ITP were first established through the British Paediatric Haematology Group in 1992, soon followed by American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines in 1996. These initial guidelines outlined expert consensus-based practice standards for the evaluation and treatment of children and adults with ITP. Subsequently, revisions of the ASH guidelines were published in 2011, and most recently in late 2019 applying more rigorous evidence-based methodology. Recommendations for secondary treatment for primary ITP in the original guidelines were limited to splenectomy. There were minimal data on the use of splenectomy in children, with one study demonstrating a 72% rate of complete remission. Evidence of adverse effects was also insufficient, and non-specific to ITP. Both early guidelines encouraged delaying splenectomy until children had had ITP for at least 12 months and also reserved splenectomy for children with bleeding symptoms. The ASH 1996 guidelines further suggested that patients have a platelet count < 10×10⁹/L (ages 3–12 years), or 10–30×10⁹/L with bleeding symptoms (ages 8–12 years).

### Treatment of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenias [^d989210d]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) were developed as a novel treatment approach for cancer and are currently used as immune therapy. ICI are monoclonal antibodies against proteins (PD-L1 and CTLA4 17) used by tumor cells to escape the immunosurveillance system. Complications during immune therapy with ICI are primarily inflammatory conditions and autoimmune disorders. However, ICI-induced ITP has been observed in some cases. This condition is rare, with an incidence between 0.2% to 2.8%, and is almost never severe or fatal.

Pathophysiology of ICI-induced immune thrombocytopenia

Immune-induced adverse events are thought to be triggered by a revival of exhausted T cells that can be induced on ICI administration (Figure 1). Whereas the exact pathomechanism of ICI-induced ITP is still unclear, it is likely that ICI trigger the expression of antiplatelet antibodies similarly to primary ITP.

Clinical manifestations of ICI-induced immune thrombocytopenia

Patients who develop ICI-induced ITP show symptoms common to other types of thrombocytopenia, such as petechiae, easy bruising, spontaneous bleeding, and hematuria. However, more severe manifestations, such as cerebral hemorrhage with subsequent neurological deficits, have been also reported in some rare fatal cases.

Diagnosis of ICI-induced immune thrombocytopenia

Obtaining a clear diagnosis of ICI-induced ITP is complex for several reasons. First, it is characterized by symptoms similar to all immune thrombocytopenias. Moreover, the absence of specific diagnostic tests and/or biomarkers represents a critical limitation. Consequently, the diagnosis can only be made by a process of exclusion. In addition, it must be remembered that the onset of the majority of the symptoms appears within the first 12 weeks of treatment, which is an identical time-frame to other more common types of acquired thrombocytopenias.

Risk management of patients with ICI-induced immune thrombocytopenia

Due to the uncertainties of a laboratory or clinical diagnosis, there is no reliable strategy to lower the risk of this condition. However, the search for autoantibodies in patients with a personal or family history of autoimmune diseases is recommended.

### Thrombotic microangiopathies (TTP, HUS, HELLP) [^2438fbe7]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia, strictly defined as a platelet count less than 150,000, is common in the emergency department. Recognition, diagnostic investigation, and proper disposition of a thrombocytopenic patient are imperative. One group of disorders leading to thrombocytopenia is the thrombotic microangiopathies, hallmarked by platelet destruction. These thrombotic microangiopathies include thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, low platelet count (HELLP), which should be distinguished from similar disease processes such as immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). In this article, clinical presentations, pathophysiology, diagnostic workup, management plans, complications, and dispositions are addressed for this complex group of platelet disorders.

### More on the pathogenesis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. comment on "Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura without detectable Anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies: a possible underlying autoimmune mechanism" and on "The different faces of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura" [^35d788b1]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

In recent decades, many publications have clarified the pathophysiology of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a life-threatening disease characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and multiorgan failure.TTP is a clinical entity caused by the deficiency of ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13). ADAMTS13, also known as von Willebrand factor (VWF) cleaving protease, is responsible for cleaving VWF multimers, thereby quenching the heightened activity of ultra-large VWF multimers in binding to Gp1b receptors on platelets. In the absence of ADAMTS13 (i.e. in TTP), ultra-large VWF multimers accumulate in plasma, resulting in the widespread formation of VWF- and platelet-rich microthrombi.

Congenital TTP is caused by defects in the ADAMTS13 gene, leading to decreased or absent enzyme activity. In contrast, in most patients with immune-mediated TTP (iTTP), ADAMTS13 deficiency is an acquired disorder due to the development of antibodies against ADAMTS13, which promote the clearance of ADAMTS13 from the circulation or inhibit its activity. Mariotte et al. reported that TTP can also occur without anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies as an acquired form of unknown cause (uTTP) and unclear mechanism. The same group reported that 20% of the cases in their national cohort were uTTP, although 21% of them needed to be revisited because anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies were actually detected during follow-up. In the remaining cases, the absence of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies, searched for using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, excluded the presence of ADAMTS13 activity inhibition, as confirmed by the Bethesda method or plasma mixing assay. Therefore, the authors suggested a non-immune mechanism involving the destruction or consumption of ADAMTS13, and concluded that the absence at baseline of detectable anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies in patients with typical features of iTTP (such as young age, cerebral involvement, severe thrombocytopenia, and severe ADAMTS13 deficiency) should not rule out a diagnosis of iTTP.

Conclusion and future aspects

Thrombocytopenia after drug administration can be associated with bleeding or thrombosis, depending on the pathophysiology of platelet destruction. Significant progress has been made over the last two decades in understanding the pathogenetic mechanism of DITP. However, there are still numerous diagnostic and treatment challenges, especially in critically ill patients, including the difficulty in distinguishing drug-associated thrombocytopenia from secondary thrombocytopenia caused by underlying disorders.

### The role of AMG-531 in the treatment of thrombocytopenia in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and myelodysplastic syndromes [^78d45444]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia can be seen in a variety of disease states, including immune mediated thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The most concerning complication is the development of hemorrhagic complications that may contribute to patient morbidity and mortality. The ligand thrombopoeitin (TPO) and its interaction with its receptor (c-mpl) are important in platelet production. Thrombopoietic agonists can help in the management of thrombocytopenia related to these conditions. Amgen Megakaryopoiesis Protein 531 (AMG-531) (Romiplostim) is a recombinant TPO with a peptide fragment that shares no sequence homology with endogenous TPO, preventing the production of neutralizing antibodies. Recent studies have shown that it is effective in raising platelet counts, and is well tolerated in ITP and MDS patients. In this review, we discuss thrombopoiesis regulation by TPO; the chemistry, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AMG-531 in animals and humans; the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to thrombocytopenia in ITP and MDS; and clinical trials demonstrating its efficacy in treating thrombocytopenia.

2 SECOND‐LINE TREATMENT OPTIONS

Second‐line or maintenance therapy in persistent or chronic ITP (hereafter referred to as ITP) aims to establish a durable platelet response and to minimize bleeding events with a treatment that is safe, tolerable, and convenient for long‐term management. Splenectomy, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO‐RAs), and rituximab are the standard second‐line treatment options in current use. 3, 4 Before initiation of a second‐line therapy, it is advisable to confirm the diagnosis of primary ITP by excluding potential non‐immune causes of thrombocytopenia as well as causes of secondary ITP if these have not been previously ruled out.

ASH 2019 immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — interpretation of strong vs conditional recommendations is summarized across stakeholders as follows: For patients, "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", whereas under conditional recommendations "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not; decision aids may be useful in helping patients to make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences". For clinicians, strong recommendations state "Most individuals should follow the recommended course of action; formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences", while conditional recommendations advise "Recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that you must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with the patient's values and preferences; decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences". For policy-makers, strong recommendations indicate "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations; adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator", whereas conditional recommendations note "Policy-making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders; performance measures should assess whether decision-making is appropriate". For researchers, strong recommendations are "supported by credible research or other convincing judgments that make additional research unlikely to alter the recommendation", and conditional recommendations state "The recommendation is likely to be strengthened (for future updates or adaptation) by additional research; an evaluation of the conditions and criteria (and the related judgments, research evidence, and additional considerations) that determined the conditional (rather than the strong) recommendation will help identify possible research gaps".

### Autoantibodies immuno-mechanically modulate platelet contractile force and bleeding risk [^96d1fbe1]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Using our cytometer, we investigated whether impaired cellular biophysical function, is implicated in pediatric immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), an autoimmune bleeding disorder that remains problematic for clinicians. ITP is characterized by platelet destruction and consumption and is clinically diagnosed as a platelet count < 100 × 10⁹/L with other causes of thrombocytopenia excluded. Although the etiology for ITP is unknown, canonically, the pathophysiologic process is thought to be triggered by post-infectious autoantibodies after a viral or bacterial infection. For the over 12,000 individuals affected by ITP each year, the clinical challenge lies in predicting which of the minority of patients need immediate initiation of therapy due to risk of life-threatening bleeding. While ITP patients have an increased bleeding risk, due in part to the low circulating platelet concentrations, only a subset of patients are at risk for severe bleeding, where 20% of patients are at risk for major bleeding episodes and 1 in 200 are at risk for life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage. Unfortunately, no biomarker objectively and reliably correlates with bleeding to guide treatment and predict clinical outcomes. Even low platelet counts, no matter how extreme, only loosely correlate with risk and severity of bleeding –, however when significant bleeding does occur, patients typically present with platelet counts < 20 × 10⁹/L, where 90% of intracranial hemorrhaging events occur. The lack of a biomarker is problematic as the mainstay of ITP therapies involve immunosuppression and/or splenectomy, which harbor significant side effects. Taken together, clinicians are forced to balance the potential increased bleeding risk with significant side effects of current therapies, which may not even be necessary since the majority of patients spontaneously resolve without intervention. As hemostasis is an inherently mechanical process where platelets must perform multiple biophysical processes to close a wound, we hypothesized that single platelet force may be associated with bleeding. Previously, we generated evidence suggesting that low platelet force was associated with unexplained bleeding in a small cohort of 3 patients. We hypothesized that a similar phenomenon may occur in ITP. Here we report on the largest single cell biophysical biomarker study to date and show that force is a sensitive and specific marker of bleeding in ITP in 53 patients. Leveraging this technology, we also performed a detailed mechanistic study into the origin of low force and mechanistic consequence of antibodies on cellular function.

### T cells in ITP: focus on T follicular helper cells and cytotoxic T cells [^8cb60c6e]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease where premature destruction of platelets as well as inhibition of platelet production leads to thrombocytopenia and associated bleeding. It has long been considered a disease primarily caused by B cells, but the role of T lymphocytes in its pathogenesis is now better understood and deserves elucidation. Two types of T cells will be discussed: (1) splenic T follicular helper cells (TFH) that participate in differentiation of B cells within germinal centres (GC) and stimulate the production of antiplatelet antibodies, thus supporting the humoral autoimmune response; and (2) antibody-independent mechanisms of action of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) that may directly participate in platelet destruction as well as inhibit their production by targeting megakaryocytes. To date, most novel therapies target antibody-mediated disease, but targeting either TFH or CTL may provide new therapeutic opportunities.

Remarks specify that patients with social concerns, uncertainty about the diagnosis, significant comorbidities with risk of bleeding, and more significant mucosal bleeding may benefit from admission to the hospital; patients not admitted to the hospital should receive education and expedited follow-up with a hematologist, and the need for admission is also highly variable across the range of platelet counts represented (0 to 20 × 10⁹/L).

### Genetic variants in canonical wnt signaling pathway associated with pediatric immune thrombocytopenia [^113eaa83]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is the most common acquired bleeding disorder in childhood, with ∼3000 to 4000 new cases diagnosed per year. Despite the first classical case of ITP being described in 1735 by Paul Gottleib Werlof, substantial gaps in our understanding of its pathogenesis remain. Pediatric ITP is thought to develop from an interplay of a triggering event and subsequent immune activation in the context of predisposing genetic factors. Particularly in chronic, refractory, or multilineage immune cytopenias, causative inborn errors of immunity are increasingly being identified.,

The exact immune mechanism driving disease is identified for few cases of pediatric ITP. Children with symptomatic or prolonged courses of ITP are often treated as a monolith and broad immune suppressive medications are applied with variable efficacy and disease control. Fortunately, the landscape of ITP care is evolving. Genetic testing has led to the identification of new disorders that predispose to ITP. Targeted therapies are now available for a subset of patients with germ line causes of immune cytopenias, for example, the use of abatacept for patients with CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency or Lipopolysaccharide-responsive and beige-like anchor (LRBA) deficiency. With increased accessibility and decreased cost of genetic sequencing, there is substantial opportunity to improve ITP care by tailoring treatments to individual patients.

Beyond the potential to identify genetic etiologies of ITP and refine therapeutic choices, genetic testing holds the promise of improving global understanding of the ITP pathophysiology. The scope of ITP pathophysiology extends well beyond early descriptions of autoantibody–mediated platelet destruction, with pathologic mechanisms now understood to involve a multitude of immune abnormalities including defects in the megakaryocyte compartment; shifts toward proinflammatory T-cell responses; loss of regulatory immune populations; direct cytotoxic T-cell destruction; loss of sialic acid residues; defects in innate immunity; and, recently, complement-mediated platelet destruction. With the goal of better understanding the genetic predisposition for ITP and to shed light on pathophysiology, we performed genotyping on DNA samples obtained from a large multi-institutional cohort of pediatric patients with ITP.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia [^3fa2c914]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — 2018 European joint working group (JWG) guidance and second-line differences: The JWG recommended corticosteroids for adults with ITP who have no or mild bleeding (World Health Organization [WHO] 0-II) and platelet counts below 20 × 10⁹/L to 30 × 10⁹/L, with observation for patients with platelet count values above 20 × 10⁹/L to 30 × 10⁹/L; prolonged corticosteroid use is discouraged, and the JWG guidelines did not discuss the addition of rituximab to corticosteroid treatment in newly diagnosed adults. For second-line management, the JWG guidelines place a priority on thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) as second-line treatment with rituximab being considered a third-line agent reserved for patients who have failed a TPO-RA, and splenectomy is primarily reserved for patients with ITP for > 12 months' duration or major bleeding (WHO III, IV); the ASH guidelines herein also include a remark that splenectomy should be delayed until 12 months when possible. In children, the JWG advises that a low platelet count alone is not sufficient to start treatment in newly diagnosed ITP and that the majority with no or only mild bleeding do not require treatment; they acknowledge no standard treatment of chronic ITP with referral to a specialist center recommended, and suggest that splenectomy be avoided in children and reserved as a last option in those that are refractory.
