## Question

eosinophilia difention

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the definition of eosinophilia and how it is categorized. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic definition of eosinophilia in peripheral blood. Then, I should verify the thresholds that distinguish mild, moderate, and severe eosinophilia. Next, I will consider the concept of persistence and when to call it hypereosinophilia. After that, I need to check how tissue eosinophilia is defined and when it matters. Finally, I will integrate organ damage criteria to distinguish hypereosinophilic syndrome and briefly note special contexts like travel medicine and pediatrics, making sure each assertion is supported by sources.

> Let me first confirm the basic definition. Eosinophilia in peripheral blood is generally defined as an absolute eosinophil count greater than 0.5 × 10⁹/L, which is the same as 500 cells/μL, and this threshold is consistently used across contemporary guidelines and reviews, including the 2023 ICOG‑EO consensus and the 2024 WHO/ICC update, as well as travel medicine references from CDC [^a5e81e0f] [^d6134537] [^871715f5].

> Wait, let me verify the severity cut points. Mild eosinophilia corresponds to 0.5–1.49 × 10⁹/L, moderate to 1.5–5.0 × 10⁹/L, and severe to greater than 5.0 × 10⁹/L; these ranges are explicitly defined in the 2023 ICOG‑EO proposal and align with the CDC's practical categorization in travel medicine contexts, which also reminds us not to rely on percentage alone because leukopenia can artifactually elevate the eosinophil percentage [^5a945315] [^871715f5].

> Hold on, I should verify the persistence requirement for hypereosinophilia. Historically, some definitions required persistence for at least 4 weeks, but the 2021 ICOG‑EO refinement shortened the interval to persistence documented on at least two occasions separated by at least 2 weeks, which is now reflected in the 2023 consensus and aligns with WHO thinking in recent updates; this change recognizes that some clonal drivers can cause rapid organ damage, warranting earlier confirmation and treatment [^5a945315] [^d6134537].

> I need to check tissue eosinophilia next. Tissue hypereosinophilia is not defined by a single universal number; rather, it is established by bone marrow eosinophils exceeding 20% of nucleated cells, by pathologist assessment of extensive tissue infiltration, or by marked extracellular deposition of eosinophil granule proteins even when intact eosinophils are sparse; importantly, tissue hypereosinophilia can occur without peripheral blood hypereosinophilia, which is why organ-restricted HES is recognized as a valid entity in modern classifications [^b6ca8195] [^5a945315].

> Let me consider the organ damage dimension. Hypereosinophilic syndrome is not merely a high eosinophil count; it requires blood and/or tissue hypereosinophilia plus organ damage attributable to eosinophil infiltration or toxicity, with exclusion of other primary causes of that organ damage; this is the modern consensus definition and is operationalized in NCCN and ICOG‑EO documents, and it underscores that HES is a clinical syndrome rather than a single disease entity [^ed2b77a1] [^0b3625ff].

> But wait, what if the patient is a traveler or migrant? I should double-check that the same absolute thresholds apply. Yes, the CDC Yellow Book uses the same absolute eosinophil thresholds for mild, moderate, and severe eosinophilia in post-travel evaluation, and it emphasizes interpreting counts in clinical context because eosinophilia is common in helminth infections and may be the key clue in otherwise nonspecific presentations [^871715f5] [^043c8f0e].

> I will now examine pediatric considerations briefly. The same absolute thresholds are used in children, but HES is rarer in pediatrics and the diagnostic approach mirrors adults with attention to clonal versus reactive etiologies; pediatric reviews reiterate the ≥ 1.5 × 10⁹/L threshold for hypereosinophilia and the requirement for organ damage to diagnose HES, which helps frame urgency and therapy decisions in children [^384e9cd6].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Eosinophilia is an absolute eosinophil count greater than 0.5 × 10⁹/L, stratified into mild, moderate, and severe ranges; hypereosinophilia requires persistence at or above 1.5 × 10⁹/L on at least two occasions separated by at least 2 weeks; tissue hypereosinophilia is defined by marrow or tissue criteria and can exist without peripheral hypereosinophilia; and HES requires hypereosinophilia plus organ damage attributable to eosinophils after excluding other causes, which together reflect current international consensus and guideline standards [^a5e81e0f] [^5a945315] [^d6134537] [^ed2b77a1].

---

Eosinophilia is defined as an **absolute eosinophil count > 0.5 × 10⁹/L** [^a5e81e0f] in peripheral blood. Hypereosinophilia is a **persistent elevation ≥ 1.5 × 10⁹/L** [^5a945315] on at least two occasions separated by ≥ 2 weeks [^5a945315], or tissue eosinophilia with > 20% eosinophils in bone marrow or extensive infiltration in other tissues [^b6ca8195]. Severity is categorized as mild (0.5–1.49 × 10⁹/L), moderate (1.5–5.0 × 10⁹/L), or severe (> 5.0 × 10⁹/L) [^5a945315]. Eosinophilia can be reactive (allergic, parasitic, drug-induced, autoimmune) [^5708ef7e], clonal (myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with TK fusions) [^1b884d62], or idiopathic (HES) [^ed2b77a1]. Evaluation should include history, exam, labs, and targeted testing to identify the cause and assess for organ damage [^9e4355dc].

---

## Definition and classification

Eosinophilia is defined as an **absolute eosinophil count (AEC) > 0.5 × 10⁹/L** [^a5e81e0f] in peripheral blood. Hypereosinophilia (HE) is a persistent AEC ≥ 1.5 × 10⁹/L [^5a945315] on at least two occasions separated by ≥ 2 weeks, or tissue eosinophilia with > 20% eosinophils in bone marrow or extensive infiltration in other tissues [^b6ca8195]. Severity is categorized as mild (0.5–1.49 × 10⁹/L), moderate (1.5–5.0 × 10⁹/L), or severe (> 5.0 × 10⁹/L) [^5a945315].

---

## Etiology

Eosinophilia is broadly classified into **three categories**:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Reactive (secondary) | - Allergic diseases (asthma, atopic dermatitis) [^5708ef7e] <br/> - Parasitic infections (strongyloidiasis, schistosomiasis) [^174a6739] <br/> - Drug reactions (DRESS, imatinib) [^3e10f4a2] <br/> - Autoimmune diseases (EGPA, IBD) [^5708ef7e] |
| Clonal (primary) | - Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with TK fusions (PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, JAK2) [^1b884d62] <br/> - Chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL, NOS) [^b12ecdd1] <br/> - Systemic mastocytosis with eosinophilia [^d24dbe7c] |
| Idiopathic | - Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) — diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out reactive and clonal causes [^ed2b77a1] |

---

## Clinical significance

Eosinophilia can be benign or associated with **significant organ damage**, particularly when persistent or severe. Potential complications include:

- **Cardiac**: endomyocardial fibrosis, thromboembolism [^ed2b77a1].
- **Pulmonary**: eosinophilic pneumonia, respiratory failure [^e71ffde6].
- **Neurologic**: peripheral neuropathy, encephalopathy [^ed2b77a1].
- **Gastrointestinal**: eosinophilic esophagitis, gastritis, colitis [^2bb2039c].
- **Dermatologic**: angioedema, urticaria, vasculitis [^ed2b77a1].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic evaluation** is essential to determine the cause and guide management:

- **History and physical examination**: travel, medication use, allergic symptoms, organ involvement [^efd7a535].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC with differential, liver and renal function, autoimmune screening, parasitic serologies [^9e4355dc].
- **Bone marrow biopsy**: indicated for persistent eosinophilia without obvious reactive cause, abnormal CBC, or suspicion of clonal disease [^1f694d60].
- **Molecular testing**: FISH/PCR for TK fusions (PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, JAK2) [^2c132139]; next-generation sequencing for cryptic fusions [^d409e8c5].
- **Imaging**: echocardiography, chest CT, abdominal ultrasound as indicated [^notfound].

---

## Management

Management depends on the **underlying cause and organ involvement**:

- **Reactive eosinophilia**: treat the underlying cause (e.g. antiparasitics, corticosteroids for allergic/autoimmune disease) [^d6134537].
- **Clonal eosinophilia**: targeted therapy with TK inhibitors (imatinib) for PDGFRA/B fusions [^a41763f3]; corticosteroids, interferon-alpha, or hydroxyurea for other clonal forms [^d6134537].
- **Idiopathic HES**: corticosteroids first-line; mepolizumab (anti-IL-5) for steroid-refractory cases [^a41763f3]; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for aggressive disease [^d6134537].

---

Eosinophilia is defined as an **AEC > 0.5 × 10⁹/L**, with hypereosinophilia ≥ 1.5 × 10⁹/L. It can be reactive, clonal, or idiopathic, and may cause organ damage. A structured evaluation and cause-specific therapy are essential for optimal outcomes [^a5e81e0f].

Eosinophilia occurs regularly in a number of benign and malignant diseases. Occasionally, however, it may occur unexpectedly and without apparent cause. In these instances every effort should be made to determine the cause of the eosinophilia, in view of its frequent association with serious occult disease. Wintrobe has listed the causes of eosinophilia as follows: allergic disorders: bronchial asthma, urticaria, angioneurotic edema, and hay fever; cutaneous diseases, especially pemphigus and dermatitis herpetiformis; parasitic infestations., especially parasites which invade the tissues such as trichinae, echinococci, and, less regularly, intestinal parasites; Loeffler's syndrome; "tropical eosinophilia"; infections such as scarlet fever, chorea, erythema multiforme;.

### Contemporary consensus proposal on criteria and classification of eosinophilic disorders and related syndromes [^c791694a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Eosinophilia is an important indicator of various neoplastic and nonneoplastic conditions. Depending on the underlying disease and mechanisms, eosinophil infiltration can lead to organ dysfunction, clinical symptoms, or both. During the past 2 decades, several different classifications of eosinophilic disorders and related syndromes have been proposed in various fields of medicine. Although criteria and definitions are, in part, overlapping, no global consensus has been presented to date. The Year 2011 Working Conference on Eosinophil Disorders and Syndromes was organized to update and refine the criteria and definitions for eosinophilic disorders and to merge prior classifications in a contemporary multidisciplinary schema. A panel of experts from the fields of immunology, allergy, hematology, and pathology contributed to this project. The expert group agreed on unifying terminologies and criteria and a classification that delineates various forms of hypereosinophilia, including primary and secondary variants based on specific hematologic and immunologic conditions, and various forms of the hypereosinophilic syndrome. For patients in whom no underlying disease or hypereosinophilic syndrome is found, the term hypereosinophilia of undetermined significance is introduced. The proposed novel criteria, definitions, and terminologies should assist in daily practice, as well as in the preparation and conduct of clinical trials.

### Proposed refined diagnostic criteria and classification of eosinophil disorders and related syndromes [^ebdf27e4]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

During the past two decades, several classifications of eosinophil disorders have been proposed. In 2011, a multidisciplinary international cooperative working group (ICOG‐EO) was convened to establish diagnostic criteria and a global classification of eosinophil disorders and related syndromes. This classification, published in 2012, is widely used, as it is easily applicable in daily practice and includes disease‐related markers and aspects from various fields of medicine, including allergy, hematology, immunology, pathology, and laboratory medicine.

Over the past 10 years, additional markers and disease‐triggering mechanisms have been identified, and novel concepts concerning the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of eosinophil disorders have been developed. The World Health Organization (WHO) has provided updated criteria and classifications for hematopoietic neoplasms accompanied by eosinophilia in 2017 and 2022. In complement to these updates, the ICOG‐EO organized the Year 2021 Working Conference on Eosinophil Disorders and Syndromes (Vienna, September 24–26, 2021) to discuss novel developments in the field encompassing all HE conditions, extending beyond hematopoietic neoplasms, and to refine criteria, definitions, and the classification of these disorders. Experts from the fields of dermatology, pathology, immunology, hematology, and laboratory medicine contributed to this project. All faculty members actively participated in pre‐conference and post‐conference discussions (March 2021 to March 2022). The outcomes of these discussions were formulated into consensus statements, which are summarized in this article. All faculty members contributed equally to discussions and manuscript preparation. The consensus‐reaching process is described in the Appendix S1.

### Hypereosinophilic syndrome [^1f9e01f8]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Hypereosinophilic syndrome consists of a group of disorders characterized by abnormal accumulation of eosinophils in the blood or peripheral tissues, independent of known secondary causes of eosinophilia such as parasitic infection. Clinical manifestations of the condition are highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic eosinophilia to severe tissue damage and end-organ failure. This entity has been recognized for decades, with early studies identifying distinct groups of patients with differing symptoms, exam findings, laboratory abnormalities, and prognosis. In the past, these patients were treated with non-targeted immunosuppressive agents, often with limited efficacy. More recently, advances in the knowledge of eosinophil biology and molecular diagnostics have allowed for more specific delineation of the many disease subgroups that characterize hypereosinophilic syndrome. Identification of these groups has led to a personalized management approach to the condition, with improved diagnostic techniques as well as stratification of patients into more effective treatment groups. This review will discuss the evolution of the definition of hypereosinophilic syndrome, outline current disease classifications, provide a guide for evaluation and monitoring, and discuss current and future therapeutic modalities.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia - NCCN, more specifically with respect to staging (tyrosine kinase gene fusions present), NCCN 2020 guidelines recommend to use the following steps:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Step 1. Disease Extent|- Assess involvement of bone marrow, peripheral blood, and extramedullary disease < br > - If extramedullary disease is clinically suspected, obtain imaging to identify it|
|Step 2. Disease Stage|- Determine whether bone marrow or peripheral blood represents chronic phase or blast phase disease < br > - If blast phase disease is present, classify extramedullary disease as a blast phase component|
|Step 3. Disease Lineage(s)|- Define the lineage of disease in bone marrow, peripheral blood, and/or extramedullary disease components < br > - Obtain immunophenotyping to establish lineage in all involved sites.|

Context

The advent of molecular tools capable of subclassifying eosinophilia has changed the diagnostic and clinical approach to what was classically called hypereosinophilic syndrome.

Objectives

To review the etiologies of eosinophilia and to describe the current diagnostic approach to this abnormality.

Data Sources

Literature review.

Conclusion

Eosinophilia is a common, hematologic abnormality with diverse etiologies. The underlying causes can be broadly divided into reactive, clonal, and idiopathic. Classically, many cases of eosinophilia were grouped together into the umbrella category of hypereosinophilic syndrome, a clinical diagnosis of exclusion. In recent years, an improved mechanistic understanding of many eosinophilias has revolutionized the way these disorders are understood, diagnosed, and treated. As a result, specific diagnoses can now be assigned in many cases that were previously defined as hypereosinophilic syndrome. Most notably, chromosomal rearrangements, such as FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusions caused by internal deletions in chromosome 4, are now known to be associated with many chronic eosinophilic leukemias. When present, these specific molecular abnormalities predict response to directed therapies. Although an improved molecular understanding is revolutionizing the treatment of patients with rare causes of eosinophilia, it has also complicated the approach to evaluating and treating eosinophilia. Here, we review causes of eosinophilia and present a framework by which the practicing pathologist may approach this diagnostic dilemma. Finally, we consider recent cases as clinical examples of eosinophilia from a single institution, demonstrating the diversity of etiologies that must be considered.

11 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

Diagnosis and management of eosinophil‐associated disorders and related syndromes are an emerging challenge in the fields of clinical immunology, hematology, and pathology. With the recent availability of eosinophil‐depleting targeted drugs, it is now even more important to unify definitions and classifications for these conditions in an interdisciplinary effort. HE may develop in the context of various hematologic neoplasms and in certain reactive states. In all these patients, it is important to (i) document or exclude a related neoplastic or non‐neoplastic disease, and to (ii) document or exclude the presence of HE‐related organ damage (HES). Several immunological, serological, molecular, and cytogenetic markers are available to establish the nature of the underlying condition and, thus, help define the variant of HE and HES. In 2012, our consensus group proposed a comprehensive classification of eosinophil disorders together with diagnostic criteria. This proposal was based on a multidisciplinary approach involving the fields of allergy, immunology, hematology, pathology, and molecular medicine. Because of its multidisciplinary character and simple format, this concept has been widely accepted and is considered standard. However, recent developments in the field emerged and created a need to update and refine these concepts and diagnostic criteria. In the Year 2021 Working Conference on Eosinophil Disorders (Vienna, September 24–26, 2021), these developments were discussed and used to adjust diagnostic criteria, as well as definitions and classification of eosinophil disorders. As in 2011, these proposed criteria and definitions are based on a multidisciplinary approach and are in line with the previous ICOG‐EO consensus proposal and the 2016‐ and 2022‐updated classification of the WHO and ICC. We also define where the ICOG‐EO proposal complements or adds to the 2022‐updated WHO classification and ICC. Our updated definitions and criteria, along with our increasing knowledge about the etiology of HE should improve diagnosis, management, and prognosis of patients with eosinophil disorders in daily practice as well as in clinical trials.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia - NCCN, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, NCCN 2020 guidelines recommend to diagnose chronic eosinophilic leukemia not otherwise specified for other clonal cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities or excess blasts (≥ 5% to < 20%).

Hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES) are a group of heterogeneous disorders many of which remain ill-defined. By definition, the HES must be distinguished from other disorders with persistently elevated eosinophilia with a defined cause. Although marked eosinophilia worldwide is most commonly caused by helminth (worm) infections, the diagnostic approach must include noninfectious (nonparasitic) causes of marked eosinophilia as well.

Despite recent attempts to define and classify patients with marked eosinophilia and features consistent with myeloproliferative disease, areas of controversy remain. These are particularly apparent in situations in which multiple lineages are involved in a clonal process and clinical manifestations are overlapping. Although the introduction of new molecular diagnostics and targeted therapies has begun to clarify the boundaries between some of these disorders, several questions remain with respect to the classification of patients with myeloproliferative hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) of unknown etiology.

### Proposed refined diagnostic criteria and classification of eosinophil disorders and related syndromes [^d054a833]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

Eosinophilia and eosinophil activation are recurrent features in various reactive states and certain hematologic malignancies. In patients with hypereosinophilia (HE), HE-induced organ damage is often encountered and may lead to the diagnosis of a hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). A number of known mechanisms and etiologies contribute to the development of HE and HES. Based on these etiologies and the origin of eosinophils, HE and HES are divided into primary forms where eosinophils are clonal cells, reactive forms where an underlying reactive or neoplastic condition is detected and eosinophils are considered to be "non-clonal" cells, and idiopathic HE and HES in which neither a clonal nor a reactive underlying pathology is detected. Since 2012, this classification and the related criteria have been widely accepted and regarded as standard. However, during the past few years, new developments in the field and an increasing number of markers and targets have created a need to update these criteria and the classification of HE and HES. To address this challenge, a Working Conference on eosinophil disorders was organized in 2021. In this conference, a panel of experts representing the relevant fields, including allergy, dermatology, hematology, immunology, laboratory medicine, and pathology, met and discussed new markers and concepts as well as refinements in definitions, criteria and classifications of HE and HES. The outcomes of this conference are presented in this article and should assist in the diagnosis and management of patients with HE and HES in daily practice and in the preparation and conduct of clinical trials.

Abstract

Eosinophilia and eosinophil activation are recurrent features in various reactive states and certain hematologic malignancies. In patients with hypereosinophilia (HE), HE‐induced organ damage is often encountered and may lead to the diagnosis of a hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). A number of known mechanisms and etiologies contribute to the development of HE and HES. Based on these etiologies and the origin of eosinophils, HE and HES are divided into primary forms where eosinophils are clonal cells, reactive forms where an underlying reactive or neoplastic condition is detected and eosinophils are considered to be "non‐clonal" cells, and idiopathic HE and HES in which neither a clonal nor a reactive underlying pathology is detected. Since 2012, this classification and the related criteria have been widely accepted and regarded as standard. However, during the past few years, new developments in the field and an increasing number of markers and targets have created a need to update these criteria and the classification of HE and HES. To address this challenge, a Working Conference on eosinophil disorders was organized in 2021. In this conference, a panel of experts representing the relevant fields, including allergy, dermatology, hematology, immunology, laboratory medicine, and pathology, met and discussed new markers and concepts as well as refinements in definitions, criteria and classifications of HE and HES. The outcomes of this conference are presented in this article and should assist in the diagnosis and management of patients with HE and HES in daily practice and in the preparation and conduct of clinical trials.

1 INTRODUCTION

Eosinophilia is observed in a number of inflammatory and other reactive conditions and related disease states, as well as in several hematologic malignancies. In reactive states, eosinophilia is usually a non‐neoplastic process triggered by eosinophil‐targeting cytokines, such as interleukin‐3 (IL‐3) or IL‐5. In contrast, in stem cell‐derived and myeloid neoplasms, eosinophils usually derive from the malignant clone. Reactive eosinophilia may be transient or episodic (recurrent) but may also persist. In contrast, clonal (neoplastic) eosinophilia is always a persistent condition unless the disease progresses to an acute leukemia or specific anti‐neoplastic therapy is introduced. Blood eosinophilia is defined by an absolute eosinophil count (AEC) of more than 0.5 × 10⁹/L, whereas hypereosinophilia (HE) requires an AEC of ≥ 1.5 × 10⁹/L.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia - NCCN, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, NCCN 2020 guidelines recommend to follow the appropriate diagnostic testing algorithm for rearrangements identified in PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, JAK2, ABL1, or FLT3. Recognize that the diagnosis requires a combination of histopathologic, clinical, laboratory, and cytogenetic/molecular analyses.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia - NCCN, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, NCCN 2020 guidelines recommend to consider suggesting primary (clonal/neoplastic) eosinophilia, generally indicated by an absolute eosinophil count ≥ 1.5×10⁹/L, if one or more of the following are present:

- elevated serum tryptase level

- abnormal T-cell population

- increased blasts, dysplasia, cytogenetic or molecular abnormality, and/or bone marrow fibrosis

- splenomegaly and/or lymphadenopathy.

### Asthma management: a new phenotype-based approach using presence of eosinophilia and allergy [^23d39955]. Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease. The Czech Pneumology and Allergology Societies commissioned 10 experts to review the literature and create joint national guidelines for managing asthma, reflecting this heterogeneity. The aim was to develop an easy-to-use diagnostic strategy as a rational approach to the widening opportunities for the use of phenotype-targeted therapy. The guidelines were presented on websites for public comments by members of both the societies. The reviewers' comments contributed to creating the final version of the guidelines. The key hallmark of the diagnostic approach is the pragmatic concept, which assesses the presence of allergy and eosinophilia in each asthmatic patient. The guidelines define three clinically relevant asthma phenotypes: eosinophilic allergic asthma, eosinophilic nonallergic asthma and noneosinophilic nonallergic asthma. The resulting multifunctional classification describing the severity, level of control and phenotype is the starting point for a comprehensive treatment strategy. The level of control is constantly confronted with the intensity of the common stepwise pharmacotherapy, and the concurrently included phenotyping is essential for phenotype-specific therapy. The concept of the asthma approach with assessing the presence of eosinophilia and allergy provides a way for more precise diagnosis, which is a prerequisite for using widening options of personalized therapy.

### Eosinophilia [^5708ef7e]. Primary Care (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on eosinophilia:

- **Definition**: Eosinophilia is a transient or sustained increase in the number of eosinophils in the tissues and/or blood with absolute blood eosinophil counts > 450 to 550 cells/mcL.
- **Pathophysiology**: Eosinophilia is caused due to allergies (asthma, atopic dermatitis, sinusitis), drugs (penicillins, ibuprofen, allopurinol, carbamazepine), parasites (ascariasis, cysticercosis, schistosomiasis) and infections (fungi, virus), autoimmune diseases (eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, IBD), malignancy (lymphoma, lung cancer), immunodeficiency (Job syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome), and idiopathic reasons (hypereosinophilic syndromes).
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of eosinophilia are heterogeneous that depend on the underlying cause and the affected organs (lungs, heart, skin, blood vessels, kidneys, brain, sinuses) that can range from being asymptomatic to showing symptoms of rash, pruritus, erythema, angioedema, urticaria, hives, fever, fatigue, malaise, tissue swelling, myalgias, weight gain, splenomegaly, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, thrombosis, and progressive HF.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Eosinophilia is associated with all-cause mortality with odds ratio of 1.16 (95% CI 1.09–1.24, p < 0.0001) and 1.60 (95% CI 1.35–1.91, p < 0.0001) for mild and severe eosinophilia, respectively.

### Consultation for elevated blood eosinophils: clinical presentations, high value diagnostic tests, and treatment options [^9e4355dc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

The workup of a patient found to have eosinophilia should follow a thorough path with a detailed history and physical examination aimed at eliciting eosinophilic organ involvement, followed by histological confirmation whenever possible. The differential diagnosis of hypereosinophilia is extensive, but a rational approach beyond the history and physical examination including serologic, blood, and bone marrow cell analyses, genetic testing, and radiologic imaging can distinguish many of the causes. Often input from specialists (eg, hematology, dermatology, pulmonary, gastroenterology, and neurology) can help narrow down the possibilities and eventually result in a specific diagnosis. An accurate diagnosis is key to choosing the optimal treatment for a particular condition, and this is certainly true for eosinophilic disorders. Myeloid neoplasms that present with eosinophilia, for example, may respond to medicines that the allergist may be less accustomed to using, such as immunosuppressive agents and kinase inhibitors. Similarly, newly approved biologics that target IL-5 and eosinophils may provide new options for management. What follows is a case-based approach that helps to underscore key features of diagnosis, management, and follow-up when faced with a patient with a potential eosinophil-related disorder.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease that can be classified into different clinical endotypes, depending on the type of airway inflammation, clinical severity, and response to treatment. This article focuses on the eosinophilic endotype of asthma, which is defined by the central role that eosinophils play in the pathophysiology of the condition. It is characterized by elevated sputum and/or blood eosinophils on at least 2 occasions and by a significant response to treatments that suppress eosinophilia. Histopathologic demonstration of eosinophils in the airways provides the most direct diagnosis of eosinophilic asthma; but it is invasive, thus, impractical in clinical practice.

3 UPDATED DEFINITION OF HYPEREOSINOPHILIA

Peripheral blood eosinophilia can occur as absolute blood eosinophilia (> 0.5 × 10 9 /L), relative blood eosinophilia (> 6% in differential counts) or combined absolute and relative eosinophilia (absolute > 0.5 × 10 9 /L and > 6%). Absolute PB eosinophilia can be divided into mild eosinophilia (0.5–1.49 × 10 9 /L), moderate hypereosinophilia (1.5–5.0 × 10 9 /L), and severe hypereosinophilia (> 5.0 × 10 9 /L). As mentioned before, eosinophilia may be transient, episodic, or persistent.

Our faculty also discussed the issue that in some myeloid leukemias with extreme blood leukocytosis, eosinophils can be ≥ 1.5 × 10 9 /L blood but represent only a minority of leukocytes (< 3%) and play no obvious pathogenic role. This holds true particularly for Ph‐chromosome‐positive CML and some AML variants. Therefore, our faculty concluded that the term HE should apply in CML and AML only when absolute and relative blood eosinophilia are present. Our proposed revised definition of HE for such leukemias is: persistent AEC ≥ 1.5 × 10 9 /L blood and ≥ 10% eosinophils in PB differential counts (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Definition of Hypereosinophilia (HE) and of the Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES)

In our original definition of HE, "persistent" was defined as AEC > 1.5 × 10 9 /L for at least 4 weeks. The WHO recently also proposed a 4‐week interval. In the Year 2021 Working Conference, this interval was again discussed. Based on our better understanding of the potential for rapidly deleterious clinical implications of certain driver genes and the availability of better (more rapid) diagnostic tests, our faculty agreed that the term "persistent" should apply to HE recorded on at least 2 occasions with a minimum "time‐interval" of 2 weeks.

Our faculty also discussed whether tissue HE should be defined with formal criteria and used to diagnose HE‐related pathologies and syndromes, including HES. After thorough discussion, our faculty concluded that the previously formulated criteria for tissue HE should be maintained and that the term "tissue HE" should be used in diagnostic reports documenting HE‐related pathology and syndromes.

Disease Overview

The eosinophilias encompass a broad range of non-hematologic (secondary or reactive) and hematologic (primary or clonal) disorders with the potential for end-organ damage.

Diagnosis

Hypereosinophilia (HE) has generally been defined as a peripheral blood eosinophil count greater than 1.5×10⁹/L, and may be associated with tissue damage. After the exclusion of secondary causes of eosinophilia, diagnostic evaluation of primary eosinophilias relies on a combination of various tests. They include morphologic review of the blood and marrow, standard cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, molecular testing and flow immunophenotyping to detect histopathologic or clonal evidence for an acute or chronic hematolymphoid neoplasm.

Risk Stratification

Disease prognosis relies on identifying the subtype of eosinophilia. After evaluation of secondary causes of eosinophilia, the 2022 World Health Organization and International Consensus Classification endorse a semi-molecular classification scheme of disease subtypes. This includes the major category "myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions" (MLN-eo-TK), and the MPN subtype, "chronic eosinophilic leukemia" (CEL). Lymphocyte-variant HE is an aberrant T-cell clone-driven reactive eosinophila, and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a diagnosis of exclusion.

Risk-Adapted Therapy

The goal of therapy is to mitigate eosinophil-mediated organ damage. For patients with milder forms of eosinophilia (e.g., < 1.5×10⁹/L) without symptoms or signs of organ involvement, a watch and wait approach with close follow-up may be undertaken. Identification of rearranged PDGFRA or PDGFRB is critical because of the exquisite responsiveness of these diseases to imatinib. Pemigatinib was recently approved for patients with relapsed or refractory FGFR1-rearranged neoplasms. Corticosteroids are first-line therapy for patients with lymphocyte-variant HE and HES. Hydroxyurea and interferon-α have demonstrated efficacy as initial treatment and in steroid-refractory cases of HES. Mepolizumab, an interleukin-5 (IL-5) antagonist monoclonal antibody, is approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration for patients with idiopathic HES. Cytotoxic chemotherapy agents, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have been used for aggressive forms of HES and CEL, with outcomes reported for limited numbers of patients. Targeted therapies such as the IL-5 receptor antibody benralizumab, IL-5 monoclonal antibody depemokimab, and various tyrosine kinase inhibitors for MLN-eo-TK, are under active investigation.

Most tests also report eosinophil percentage, the proportion of eosinophils out of 100 white blood cells, but a normal eosinophil percentage is less than 5% and the degree of eosinophilia should not be determined by percentage alone. If a patient has leukopenia, the eosinophil percentage would be relatively higher while the absolute count may remain within normal limits.

Hypereosinophilic syndromes (HESs) are a heterogeneous group of rare disorders characterized by peripheral eosinophilia and eosinophilic end organ complications. Conventional therapies, including glucocorticoids and cytotoxic and immunomodulatory agents, have variable efficacy and significant toxicity. Although the recent development of agents that target eosinophils, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, provides the possibility of more effective, less toxic approaches to treatment of HES, there are little available data to guide their use in these conditions. In the following review, the controversies regarding the definition and classification of HES will be discussed, and a pragmatic approach to treatment based on clinically defined HES variants will be presented. An illustrative case will be used to highlight the complexities of treatment selection in HES patients.

### Variability in diagnostic criteria for eosinophilic esophagitis: a systematic review [^bd940a4f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an emerging clinicopathologic entity defined by abnormal esophageal eosinophilic infiltration. Our understanding of this disease is hampered by the lack of a uniform diagnostic standard. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the range of diagnostic strategies and histologic criteria in the EoE literature.

Methods

The MEDLINE-indexed literature from 1950 through December 31, 2006 was independently searched by two investigators. To identify additional relevant studies, bibliographies were hand searched, as were the published proceedings of the 2000–2006 American College of Gastroenterology and American Gastroenterological Association national meetings. Data were extracted from all human EoE case reports, case series, cross-sectional and cohort studies, and clinical trials.

Results

Of 318 publications initially identified, 116 original articles, 39 abstracts, and 69 reviews were included. We found 10 different histologic definitions of EoE, ranging from 5 to 30 eosinophils per high-powered field (hpf), though 41 (35%) of the original articles did not state their diagnostic criteria. In the 13 original articles (11%) reporting an hpf area, the eosinophil density per mm(2) varied 23-fold. There was also variation in esophageal biopsy protocols, but specific protocols were reported in just 45 (39%) original articles.

Conclusions

Significant variability in diagnostic criteria for eosinophilic esophagitis exists, and in a large proportion of studies, criteria are not reported. Because of this lack of a common disease definition, conclusions drawn from the cumulative EoE literature should be viewed with caution. A consensus research-quality standard for diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis is needed.

### The pathology and causes of tissue eosinophilia in the gastrointestinal tract [^2bb2039c]. Histopathology (2017). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract may occur as a primary eosinophilic disorder or as a secondary response with other causes. Primary eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs) are Th2-mediated allergic diseases that overlap pathogenetically with atopic conditions involving other organs. The pathological diagnosis of primary EGIDs can be challenging, as the quantity of eosinophils considered to be 'abnormal' is difficult to define, and the diagnosis, by definition, requires exclusion of the far more common secondary causes. Our understanding of the basic biology and natural history of eosinophilic oesophagitis has advanced considerably over the last decade, whereas other EGIDs have proven more difficult to characterize; nonetheless, some recent advances have been made. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding the clinical presentation, diagnosis, natural history and treatment of EGIDs, including eosinophilic oesophagitis. We also draw attention to the numerous secondary causes of tissue eosinophilia in the gastrointestinal tract, and suggest a practical approach to the histological assessment, diagnosis and reporting of EGIDs.

### Approach to eosinophilia presenting with pulmonary symptoms [^e71ffde6]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Eosinophilia with pulmonary involvement is characterized by the presence of peripheral blood eosinophilia, typically ≥ 500 cells/mm³, by pulmonary symptoms and physical examination findings that are nonspecific, and by radiographic evidence of pulmonary disease and is further supported by histopathologic evidence of tissue eosinophilia in a lung or pleura biopsy specimen and/or increased eosinophils in BAL fluid, usually > 10%. Considering that there are a variety of underlying causes of eosinophilia with pulmonary manifestations and overlapping clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features, it is essential to approach the evaluation of eosinophilia with pulmonary findings systematically. In this review, we will describe a case presentation and discuss the differential diagnosis, a directed approach to the diagnostic evaluation and supporting literature, the current treatment strategies for pulmonary eosinophilia syndromes, and the levels of evidence underlying the recommendations, where available. Overall, optimal management of eosinophilic lung disease presentations are directed at the underlying cause when identifiable, and the urgency of treatment may be guided by the presence of severe end-organ involvement or life-threatening complications. When an underlying cause is not easily attributable, management of eosinophilia with pulmonary involvement largely relies on eosinophil-directed interventions, for which biologic therapies are increasingly being used.

Peripheral eosinophilia in post-travel evaluation — definition and interpretation are as follows: peripheral eosinophilia is defined as ≥ 500 eosinophils/μL and is subdivided into mild (< 1,500 eosinophils/μL), moderate (≥ 1,500 eosinophils/μL), and severe (≥ 5,000 eosinophils/μL). Most tests also report eosinophil percentage as the proportion of eosinophils out of 100 white blood cells, and a normal eosinophil percentage is less than 5%; however, the degree of eosinophilia should not be determined by percentage alone because it can be influenced by the number of other cell types present. For example, if a patient has leukopenia, the eosinophil percentage would be relatively higher, but the absolute count may remain within normal limits. Eosinophils are multifunctional pro-inflammatory cells formed in greater numbers in response to conditions including medications and allergic or eosinophilic drug reactions, malignancy, autoimmune disorders, atopic disorders, and parasitic infection. The majority of eosinophils reside in tissue, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract; in pathologic conditions, they are recruited to other anatomic sites through the peripheral blood vessels, and the presence of eosinophils outside of tissues or blood (e.g., in cerebral spinal fluid) should be considered an abnormal finding. Peripheral eosinophilia is present in many parasitic infections, and eosinophilia can be an important clinical finding when diagnosing a parasitic disease, but it is not a perfect metric.

NCCN Guidelines — definition and diagnostic criteria for hypereosinophilic syndrome specify that HES is defined as blood HE with end-organ damage attributable to tissue HE and requires fulfillment of criteria for peripheral blood HE, organ damage and/or dysfunction attributable to tissue HE, and exclusion of other disorders or conditions as the major reason for organ damage; in cases of evolving life-threatening end-organ damage, the diagnosis can be made immediately to avoid delay in therapy.

### Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [^3e10f4a2]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on DRESS syndrome:

- **Definition**: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms is a severe, idiosyncratic, drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction characterized by fever, diffuse rash, lymphadenopathy, hematologic abnormalities such as eosinophilia or atypical lymphocytes, and multi-organ involvement, most often affecting the liver, kidneys, and lungs. The condition typically develops 2–6 weeks after drug exposure, with antiepileptics, allopurinol, sulfonamides, and certain antibiotics being the most common triggers. Diagnosis is supported by RegiSCAR criteria, which combine clinical and laboratory findings.
- Pathophysiology: The pathogenesis involves a complex interaction of genetic, metabolic, and immunologic factors. Specific HLA alleles (e.g. HLA-B5801, HLA-A31:01) confer susceptibility to drug-specific immune responses. Impaired detoxification of reactive drug metabolites leads to cellular injury and T-cell activation, while reactivation of latent viruses, particularly human herpesvirus 6, amplifies the immune response. Activated T lymphocytes release pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-γ, driving systemic inflammation and multi-organ damage.
- **Epidemiology**: DRESS is a rare condition, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 2 cases per 100,000 individuals and an incidence ranging from 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 10,000 among patients exposed to certain medications, depending on the drug involved. In hospitalized patients, the incidence ranges from 2.18 to 40 cases per 100,000 inpatients. A higher incidence has been observed among women and in the Black population. Aromatic anticonvulsants pose the highest risk, followed by allopurinol and sulfonamide antibiotics. In the US, medications most commonly associated with DRESS include allopurinol, vancomycin, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, and TMP/SMX. DRESS also accounts for up to 23% of cutaneous drug reactions in hospitalized patients.
- **Disease course**: DRESS usually begins with fever, malaise, and pruritus, followed by a widespread morbilliform or exfoliative rash and facial edema. Internal organ involvement develops subsequently, with hepatitis being most common, followed by nephritis, pneumonitis, and myocarditis. Symptoms often appear weeks after drug initiation and may persist or relapse even after drug withdrawal. Systemic corticosteroids are the cornerstone of treatment, with immunoglobulins, cyclosporine, or antivirals reserved for severe or refractory cases.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The mortality rate of DRESS ranges from 1.2% to 10%, primarily due to fulminant hepatic failure, with an estimated 5% mortality rate reported in the US. Poor prognostic factors include marked eosinophilia (> 6000/mcL), cytopenias, coagulopathy, renal dysfunction, and exposure to high-risk drugs such as allopurinol or minocycline. Most patients recover over 6–9 weeks after discontinuing the offending agent, though relapses may occur. Long-term follow-up is necessary as up to 10–15% develop autoimmune sequelae such as thyroiditis, diabetes mellitus, or autoimmune hemolytic anemia months to years after recovery.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia - NCCN, more specifically with respect to diagnosis (general principles), NCCN 2020 guidelines recommend to suspect a diagnosis of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia in the following clinical situations:

- sustained eosinophilia (≥ 1.5×10⁹/L) or tissue eosinophilia (any eosinophil count) in a target organ, with the occurrence of characteristic genetic breakpoints, some of which may not be visible by standard cytogenetics (e.g. FIP1L1::PDGFRA, ETV6::ABL1)

- clinical features such as splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukoerythroblastosis, circulating dysplastic cells, elevated serum tryptase levels, and abnormal mast cell proliferation in the bone marrow

- features of systemic mastocytosis with eosinophilia but with interstitial, not dense aggregates of atypical mast cells (FIP1L1::PDGFRA rearrangement)

- features of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with eosinophilia (PDGFRB rearrangement)

- persistent eosinophilia after intensive treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, or T-cell lymphoma.

### World Health Organization-defined eosinophilic disorders: 2011 update on diagnosis, risk stratification, and management [^b90bf182]. American Journal of Hematology (2011). Low credibility.

Disease Overview

The eosinophilias encompass a broad range of non-hematologic (secondary or reactive) and hematologic (primary, clonal) disorders with potential for end-organ damage.

Diagnosis

Hypereosinophilia has generally been defined as a peripheral blood eosinophil count greater than 1,500/mm³ and may be associated with tissue damage. After exclusion of secondary causes of eosinophilia, diagnostic evaluation of primary eosinophilias relies on a combination of morphologic review of the blood and marrow, standard cytogenetics, fluorescent in situ-hybridization, flow immunocytometry, and T-cell clonality assessment to detect histopathologic or clonal evidence for an acute or chronic myeloid or lymphoproliferative disorder.

Risk Stratification

Disease prognosis relies on identifying the subtype of eosinophilia. After evaluation of secondary causes of eosinophilia, the 2008 World Health Organization establishes a semi-molecular classification scheme of disease subtypes including myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGFR1, chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified (CEL, NOS), lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia, and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), which is a diagnosis of exclusion.

Risk-Adapted Therapy

The goal of therapy is to mitigate eosinophil-mediated organ damage. For patients with milder forms of eosinophilia (e.g. < 1,500/mm(3)) without symptoms or signs of organ involvement, a watch and wait approach with close-follow-up may be undertaken. Identification of rearranged PDGFRA or PDGFRB is critical because of the exquisite responsiveness of these diseases to imatinib. Corticosteroids are first-line therapy for patients with lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia and HES. Hydroxyurea and interferon-alpha have demonstrated efficacy as initial treatment and steroid-refractory cases of HES. In addition to hydroxyurea, second line cytotoxic chemotherapy agents and hematopoietic cell transplant have been used for aggressive forms of HES and CEL with outcomes reported for limited numbers of patients. Although clinical trials have been performed with anti IL-5 (mepolizumab) and anti-CD52 (alemtuzumab) antibodies, their therapeutic niche in primary eosinophilic diseases and HES have yet to be established.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis [^6e912a5c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) definitions are provided for recommendation strength and quality of evidence: Strong recommendations are offered when the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects. Implications include, for patients, "Most individuals in this situation would prefer the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would choose an alternative", and for clinicians, "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action or an alternative with similar strength of recommendation". Conditional recommendations are offered when trade-offs are less certain — either because of low-quality evidence or because evidence suggests that desirable and undesirable effects are closely balanced. Implications include, for patients, "Some individuals would want the suggested course of action, whereas others may not. A discussion regarding pros, cons, and available alternatives is appropriate to reach an individualized patient-specific decision", and for clinicians, "A shared decision-making model through a discussion regarding the available evidence and alternative options is appropriate, taking into consideration the values and preferences of the patient". Quality of evidence levels are defined as: High — "We are very confident that the true effect closely aligns with that of the estimate of the effect"; Moderate — "We have a moderate level of confidence in the estimate of effect. It is likely that the true effect is close to the estimate of effect"; Low — "Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. The true effect could differ from the estimate of effect"; and Very low — "We have very little confidence in the effect estimate. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of effect".

### World Health Organization-defined eosinophilic disorders: 2022 update on diagnosis, risk stratification, and management [^a41763f3]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Disease Overview

The eosinophilias encompass a broad range of nonhematologic (secondary or reactive) and hematologic (primary or clonal) disorders with potential for end-organ damage.

Diagnosis

Hypereosinophilia (HE) has generally been defined as a peripheral blood eosinophil count greater than 1.5×10 9 /L. After exclusion of secondary causes of eosinophilia, diagnostic evaluation of primary eosinophilias relies on morphologic review of the blood and marrow, standard cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, next generation sequencing gene assays, and flow immunophenotyping to detect histopathologic or clonal evidence for an acute or chronic hematolymphoid neoplasm.

Risk Stratification

Disease prognosis relies on identifying the subtype of eosinophilia. After evaluation of secondary causes of eosinophilia, the 2016 World Health Organization endorses a semi-molecular classification scheme of disease subtypes. This includes the major category "myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and rearrangement of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGFR1 or with PCM1-JAK2", and the myeloproliferative neoplasm subtype, "chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified" (CEL, NOS). Lymphocyte-variant HE is an aberrant T-cell clone-driven reactive eosinophila, and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a diagnosis of exclusion.

Risk-Adapted Therapy

The goal of therapy is to mitigate eosinophil-mediated organ damage. For patients with milder forms of eosinophilia (eg, < 1.5×10 9 /L) without symptoms or signs of organ involvement, a watch and wait approach with close follow-up may be undertaken. Identification of rearranged PDGFRA or PDGFRB is critical because of the exquisite responsiveness of these diseases to imatinib. Corticosteroids are first-line therapy for patients with lymphocyte-variant HE and HES. Hydroxyurea and interferon-α have demonstrated efficacy as initial treatment and in steroid-refractory cases of HES. Mepolizumab, an interleukin-5 (IL-5) antagonist monoclonal antibody, was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for patients with idiopathic HES. The use of the IL-5 receptor antibody benralizumab, as well as other targeted therapies such as JAK2 and FGFR1 inhibitors, is under active investigation.

### Oesophageal eosinophilia and oesophageal diseases in children: are the limits clear? [^39f27f3f]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2020). High credibility.

Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, eosinophilic oesophagitis and oesophageal motility disorders are among the most common diseases accompanying oesophageal eosinophilia. They have similarities and their limits are frequently not well defined. This article reviews the main characteristics relating to their similarities and differences, highlighting existing controversies among these diseases, in addition to current knowledge. In the case of a patient with symptoms of oesophageal dysfunction, it is suggested to carry out an integral analysis of the clinical features and diagnostic test results, including histology, while individualising each case before confirming a definitive diagnosis. Future investigation in paediatric patients is necessary to assess eosinophilic infiltration in the various layers of the oesophageal tissue, along with its clinical and pathophysiological implications.

### Developing a standardized approach for assessing mast cells and eosinophils on tissue biopsies: a Work group report of the AAAAI allergic skin diseases committee [^1f694d60]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Eosinophilia — definitions and bone marrow biopsy indications — Eosinophilia is defined as an elevation of the eosinophil count in peripheral blood, usually above 0.5 × 10⁹ eosinophils/L, whereas HE is defined as eosinophil count above 1.5 × 10⁹ eosinophils/L, and tissue eosinophilia is defined as > 20% eosinophils in the bone marrow. Bone marrow biopsy is indicated in evaluation of eosinophilia when there are persistent eosinophilia without obvious reactive etiology, changes in the complete blood count other than eosinophilia, peripheral blood smear that shows atypical eosinophils or dysplasia in other lineages, organomegaly, an elevated tryptase, or an elevated serum vitamin B12, and other reasons based on clinical suspicion may prompt the need. In addition, bone marrow biopsy should be performed in patients with HE in which reactive etiologies have been excluded or if complete blood count/lab data raise suspicion for the likelihood for neoplastic processes.

Because of advances in our understanding of the hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and the availability of novel therapeutic agents, the original criteria defining these disorders are becoming increasingly problematic. Here, we discuss shortcomings with the current definition of HES and recent developments in the classification of these disorders. Despite significant progress in our understanding of the pathogenesis of some forms of HES, the current state of knowledge is still insufficient to formulate a new comprehensive etiologic definition of HESs. Nevertheless, we suggest a new working definition that overcomes some of the most obvious limitations with the original definition.

Joint ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN childhood non-EoE eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs) guidelines — abstract overview: Non-EoE EGIDs are rare chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders, with diagnosis based on clinical symptoms and histologic eosinophilic inflammation after exclusion of a secondary cause or systemic disease. ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN formed a task force to provide consensus guidelines for childhood non-EoE EGIDs, after an extensive electronic literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane up to February 2022 and formulation according to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The guidelines provide information on concept, pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic and disease surveillance procedures, and current treatment options. Thirty-four statements based on available evidence and 41 recommendations based on expert opinion and best clinical practices were developed. The literature is limited in scope and depth, and these consensus-based clinical practice guidelines are intended to assist clinicians caring for children with non-EoE EGIDs and to facilitate high-quality randomized controlled trials using standardized, uniform disease definitions.

### Proposed refined diagnostic criteria and classification of eosinophil disorders and related syndromes [^ed2b77a1]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

9 DEFINITION, CRITERIA, AND CLASSIFICATION OF

Based on the definition provided by the ICOG‐EO, HES is defined by (i) the presence of blood and/or tissue HE, (ii) HE‐associated organ damage, and (iii) exclusion of another underlying disorder or pathology as the primary driver of organ damage (Table 1). The second (ii) and third (iii) criteria require detailed histopathological and clinical evaluation as well as imaging studies not only to document organ involvement but to determine that local infiltration of eosinophils and/or the toxic effects of eosinophil‐derived substances are the most likely cause. In patients with HES, clinically relevant organ damage can include one or more of the following features: (a) fibrosis (e.g. in the lungs, heart, digestive tract, and other organs), (b) thrombosis (thromboembolism) in various organ systems, (c) cutaneous (skin or mucosal) erythema, edema/angioedema, blisters, ulceration, or eczema, (d) pulmonary manifestations, (e) gastrointestinal involvement, (f) peripheral or central neuropathy with chronic or recurrent neurological deficit(s), (g) manifestations of eosinophilic vasculitis, and (h) other less common organ manifestations of HES (liver, pancreas, kidney, others). Typical clinical features of HE‐related organ damage and thus HES are shown in Table S6. Whereas clinical and imaging studies (including radiological studies) are important and may often be diagnostic, in other cases only the pathologist will be able to confirm organ involvement by demonstrating the presence of tissue HE. In some instances, it may be difficult to establish a definite (causative) relationship between HE and the observed clinical manifestations either for technical reasons (e.g. the risks of obtaining an endomyocardial biopsy in an acutely ill patient or the need for urgent therapy), or because currently available investigations are not able to detect anomalies (e.g. central nervous system dysfunction may occur in the absence of overt abnormalities in imaging studies). Moreover, patients may experience non‐specific constitutional symptoms such as recurrent fever, malaise, fatigue, or myalgia, which may be severe but cannot be definitively related to eosinophil‐induced organ damage. In some cases, eosinophil involvement can reasonably be inferred from indirect but highly suggestive findings, such as the presence of classic findings of endomyocardial fibrosis on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (Table S6). Furthermore, substantial improvement or regression of the symptomatology with treatment may provide indirect evidence that organ manifestations were triggered by HE.

### Myeloid / lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and TK fusion genes, version 3.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^259fb58e]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2020). High credibility.

Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions — diagnosis and staging considerations highlight phase definitions and extramedullary disease (EMD) patterns. Chronic phase may present in the bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) as an MPN or MDS/MPN with or without eosinophilia, and the BM may exhibit an atypical mast cell proliferation, often in an interstitial pattern (not typical aggregates found in SM). Blast phase (≥ 20% blasts) may present in the BM or PB as AML, ALL, or mixed phenotype acute leukemias; EMD represents a blast phase component, and blast phase may also present as an EMD with an "MPN-like" picture in blood and marrow. There is no current definition for "accelerated phase" disease; similar to myeloid neoplasms such as CML, 10%–19% blasts in the BM or PB have been used to define "accelerated phase". EMD may present as extramedullary myeloid sarcoma, T-cell or B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, or myeloid/T-cell or B-cell lymphoid mixed phenotype acute leukemias, may present alone or with chronic or blast phase disease involving the BM or PB, and lineage involvement of the EMD may be different from the lineage involving the BM or PB. The clinical presentation of these diseases partly reflects the fusion partner gene for the TK, best exemplified by diverse phenotypes in FGFR1-rearranged diseases.

### Biologics and hypereosinophilic syndromes: knowledge gaps and controversies [^a3253dba]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES) are a heterogeneous group of disorders defined by blood and/or tissue hypereosinophilia and clinical manifestations attributable to the eosinophilia. Although various clinical subtypes of HES have been described, the general approach to therapy in all subtypes has focused on the reduction of blood and tissue eosinophilia to improve symptoms and halt disease progression. Until recently, this typically involved the use of corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs with significant toxicity. Whereas imatinib, the first targeted therapy approved for treatment of HES, has dramatically changed the prognosis of patients with primary (myeloid) forms of HES, it is ineffective in patients with other HES subtypes. For these nonmyeloid patients with HES, the development of eosinophil-targeting biologics (most notably, mepolizumab, the first biologic approved for the treatment of HES) has been transformative. Nevertheless, important issues remain with respect to the efficacy and safety of these biologics in the treatment of the varied subtypes of HES. Moreover, with the increasing number of commercially available biologics with direct or indirect effects on eosinophils, questions related to the choice of initial biologic, potential reasons for biologic failure, and treatment options in the setting of incomplete response are becoming increasingly common.

### How I treat hypereosinophilic syndromes [^11a34f8b]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Hypereosinophilic syndromes (HESs) are a heterogeneous group of uncommon disorders characterized by marked peripheral eosinophilia and end organ manifestations attributable to the eosinophilia or unexplained in the clinical setting. Whereas corticosteroids remain the mainstay of treatment for most patients, recent diagnostic advances and the development of novel targeted therapies, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and humanized monoclonal antibodies, have increased the complexity of therapeutic decisions in HESs. This review presents a treatment-based approach to the diagnosis and classification of patients with peripheral blood eosinophilia of 1.5 × 10⁹/L (1500/mm³) or higher and discusses the role of currently available therapeutic agents in the treatment of these patients.

### Eosinophilia: a pragmatic approach to diagnosis and treatment [^15ea2d96]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Eosinophilia is associated with a wide variety of allergic, rheumatologic, infectious, neoplastic, and rare idiopathic disorders. Clinical manifestations range from benign asymptomatic presentations to life-threatening complications, including endomyocardial fibrosis and thromboembolism. The prognosis and choice of treatment depend not only on the degree of eosinophilia and severity of organ involvement, but also on the etiology of the eosinophilia. Unfortunately, despite recent advances in molecular and immunologic techniques, the etiology remains unproven in the overwhelming majority of cases. This review presents a practical approach to the diagnosis and treatment of patients presenting with unexplained marked eosinophilia. A brief overview of the mechanisms of eosinophilia and eosinophil pathogenesis is also provided.

TABLE 3
Classification of hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES) and related disorders/syndromes

An important point is that HES should be differentiated from clinical syndromes associated with HE but that do not meet criteria for HES, such as some of the inborn errors of immunity and organ‐restricted inflammatory conditions where HE is present but does not play a major role in organ damage or dysfunction, and typical symptoms of HES are uncommon (Tables S3, S7 and S8).

Finally, it is of the utmost importance to delineate between the clinical syndrome of HES (defined by a symptom complex) and the underlying histopathological diagnosis. In fact, HES is neither a final diagnosis nor a defined immunological or hematologic disease. Rather, the contributing etiology and, thus, the underlying disease must be identified if possible in all patients with HES, and when no underlying disease is identified, the final diagnosis is HES I. It is noteworthy that some patients with HE US, HE R or HE N do not develop clinical features of HES (organ damage) despite persistent HE over many years.

### Management of hypereosinophilic syndromes [^07809bda]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The symptomatic hypereosinophilic patient must be approached in a stepwise manner, with thorough assessment to determine whether the hypereosinophilia itself is contributing to damage and disease manifestations (thereby defining a hypereosinophilic syndrome), and to identify an eventual cause of hypereosinophilia, followed by initiation of treatment directed against the underlying condition or deleterious hypereosinophilic state. Situations encountered in the clinic are extremely heterogeneous because of the numerous potential causes of hypereosinophilia and the variable spectrum of eosinophil-mediated organ damage. A practical approach to many of these situations is presented in this review.

### Hypereosinophilic syndrome [^68ebd7d6]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize the identified molecular and cellular mechanisms relevant to clinicians evaluating patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES).

Data Sources

Review of relevant peer-reviewed literature.

Study Selections

Studies on the pathogenesis of HES in relation to consensus definitions, disease classification, mechanisms of disease, and diagnosis and treatment are included.

Results

Changes to the definition of HES have been proposed based on recent studies identifying specific cellular and molecular disease phenotypes. Identification of specific mechanisms of disease may have clinical and therapeutic significance. Despite recent advances, in most cases the molecular pathogenesis of HES remains unknown.

Conclusion

Identification of specific HES disease mechanisms empowers the practicing clinician to offer specific mechanism-based treatment options to patients with HES in their clinical practice.

### The clinical features of asthma exacerbations in early-onset and eosinophilic late-onset asthma may differ significantly [^63d5d573]. Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Over 20 years ago, the concept of asthma control was created and appropriate measurement tools were developed and validated. Loss of asthma control can lead to an exacerbation. Years ago, the term "clinically significant asthma exacerbation" was introduced to define when a loss of control is severe enough to declare it an asthma exacerbation. This term is also used by health insurances to determine when an exacerbation is eligible for reimbursement of biologics in clinical practice, however, it sometimes becomes apparent that a clear separation between loss of "asthma control" and an exacerbation is not always possible. In this review, we attempt to justify why exacerbations in early allergic asthma and adult eosinophilic asthma can differ significantly and why this is important in clinical practice as well as when dealing with health insurers.

### Myeloid / lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and TK fusion genes, version 3.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^7030db64]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia - NCCN, more specifically with respect to principles of cytogenetic and molecular testing (PDGFRA rearrangement), NCCN 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that the FIP1L1::PDGFRA rearrangement is found in approximately 10% of patients with idiopathic eosinophilia. Elevated serum tryptase level and/or mast cell proliferation in the bone marrow are surrogate markers for FIP1L1::PDGFRA rearrangement (these patients are KIT D816V-negative and do not satisfy WHO criteria for SM). Peripheral blood or bone marrow FISH have similar sensitivities and the diagnosis can be made from either source. Decalcified bone marrow should not be used as this results in a yellow autofluorescence in cells that precludes FISH interpretation.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: updated consensus recommendations for children and adults [^0a69584d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a clinicopathologic condition of increasing recognition and prevalence. In 2007, a consensus recommendation provided clinical and histopathologic guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of EoE; however, only a minority of physicians use the 2007 guidelines, which require fulfillment of both histologic and clinical features. Since 2007, the number of EoE publications has doubled, providing new disease insight. Accordingly, a panel of 33 physicians with expertise in pediatric and adult allergy/immunology, gastroenterology, and pathology conducted a systematic review of the EoE literature (since September 2006) using electronic databases. Based on the literature review and expertise of the panel, information and recommendations were provided in each of the following areas of EoE: diagnostics, genetics, allergy testing, therapeutics, and disease complications. Because accumulating animal and human data have provided evidence that EoE appears to be an antigen-driven immunologic process that involves multiple pathogenic pathways, a new conceptual definition is proposed highlighting that EoE represents a chronic, immune/antigen-mediated disease characterized clinically by symptoms related to esophageal dysfunction and histologically by eosinophil-predominant inflammation. The diagnostic guidelines continue to define EoE as an isolated chronic disorder of the esophagus diagnosed by the need of both clinical and pathologic features. Patients commonly have high rates of concurrent allergic diatheses, especially food sensitization, compared with the general population. Proved therapeutic options include chronic dietary elimination, topical corticosteroids, and esophageal dilation. Important additions since 2007 include genetic underpinnings that implicate EoE susceptibility caused by polymorphisms in the thymic stromal lymphopoietin protein gene and the description of a new potential disease phenotype, proton pump inhibitor-responsive esophageal eosinophila. Further advances and controversies regarding diagnostic methods, surrogate disease markers, allergy testing, and treatment approaches are discussed.

### Eosinophilia in hematologic disorders [^ebb12471]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Eosinophilia in the peripheral blood can be the manifestation various medical conditions, including benign or malignant disorders. There are 3 main types of eosinophilia-associated myeloid neoplasms (MN-eos): myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms, chronic eosinophilic leukemia not otherwise specified, and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). Imatinib mesylate has revolutionized the treatment of molecularly defined MN-eos, and novel agents have been successfully used to treat HES. The discovery of new, recurrent molecular alterations in patients with MN-eos may improve their diagnosis and therapy. This review focuses on the hematologist's approach to a patient with eosinophilia and treatment options for those with eosinophilic myeloid neoplasms.

Classification and definition of hypereosinophilia — blood eosinophilia is defined as > 0.5 eosinophils × 10⁹/L blood. Hypereosinophilia (HE) requires > 1.5 × 10⁹/L eosinophils in the blood on 2 examinations (interval ≥ 1 month) and/or tissue HE defined by: 1) percentage of eosinophils in bone marrow exceeds 20% of all nucleated cells; and/or 2) pathologist is of the opinion that tissue infiltration by eosinophils is extensive; and/or 3) marked deposition of eosinophil granule proteins is found (in the absence or presence of major tissue infiltration by eosinophils). Subtypes include hereditary (familial) hypereosinophilia characterized by pathogenesis unknown with familial clustering and no evidence of a reactive or neoplastic condition/disorder underlying HE; hypereosinophilia of undetermined significance with no underlying cause of HE, no family history, no evidence of a reactive or neoplastic condition/disorder underlying HE, and no end-organ damage attributable to HE; primary (clonal/neoplastic) hypereosinophilia with an underlying stem cell, myeloid, or eosinophilic neoplasm as classified by WHO criteria, with eosinophils considered neoplastic cells; and secondary (reactive) hypereosinophilia due to an underlying condition/disease in which eosinophils are considered nonclonal cells, with HE considered cytokine-driven in most cases. Eosinophil-associated single-organ diseases are defined by criteria of HE fulfilled and single-organ disease.

### Diagnosis and management of pediatric hypereosinophilic syndrome [^384e9cd6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a diverse group of disorders characterized by peripheral blood eosinophilia of 1.5 × 10 9 /L (1,500/μL) or greater with evidence of end-organ damage attributable to eosinophilia and no other cause of the end-organ damage. The HES is rare, especially in children. This review aims to provide best practices in diagnosis and treatment of HES in children, including how to differentiate between primary and secondary causes of hypereosinophilia; how to distinguish the differences in clinical presentation, treatment, and prognosis of HES in children and adults; and how to identify key steps in the evaluation and management of HES in children.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia - NCCN, more specifically with respect to next-generation sequencing, NCCN 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that next-generation sequencing, RNA fusion panel, and/or comparative genomic hybridization can be used to identify novel gene fusion or gene fusion events that may not be detectable with other methods when clinical suspicion is high and FISH for PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, JAK2, ABL1, or FLT3 are negative. As these diagnostics are not broadly available, it is recommended that these cases be discussed with a hematopathologist.

ACG clinical guideline methods and evidence grading — A qualified medical librarian conducted the systematic review for each of the a priori Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) questions using PubMed and also manually searched systematic review and meta-analysis references and cross-checked with known randomized clinical trials (RCTs); for treatment-related PICOs, the guideline used the recently updated Cochrane review of EoE treatment trials, which included 41 RCTs and was up to date through March 3, 2023. The GRADE process (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) was used to assess the quality of evidence for each recommendation, and the quality of evidence is graded as high, moderate, low, or very low and is determined based on 5 parameters: risk of bias, publication bias, heterogeneity, directness, and precision. The document is structured with recommendations and key concepts considered clinically important, and key concepts are framed as "advice" or "considerations" and often include definitions, epidemiological statements, or clinical approaches.

### Practical approach to the patient with hypereosinophilia [^09f024b8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Markedly increased blood eosinophilia (ie, ≥ 1.5 x 10(9)/L), whether discovered fortuitously or found with signs and symptoms of associated organ involvement, commands diagnostic evaluation and often therapeutic interventions. This degree of hypereosinophilia is often but not uniformly associated with eosinophilic infiltration of tissues that can potentially lead to irreversible, life-threatening organ damage. Initial approaches focus on ascertaining that eosinophilia is not secondary to other underlying disease processes, including helminthic parasite infections, varied types of adverse reactions to medications, and other eosinophil-associated syndromes, such as eosinophilic gastroenteritides, eosinophilic pneumonias, and Churg-Strauss syndrome vasculitis. If evaluations exclude eosinophilia attributable to secondary causes or other eosinophil-related syndromes or organ-specific diseases, attention must be directed to considerations of varied other forms of the hypereosinophilic syndromes, which include myeloproliferative variants, lymphocytic variants, and many of still unknown causes. Cognizant of the capacities of eosinophils to mediate tissue damage, the varied causes for hypereosinophilia are considered, and a contemporary stepwise practical approach to the diagnosis and treatment of patients with hypereosinophilia is presented.

### UK guidelines for the investigation and management of eosinophilia in returning travellers and migrants [^174a6739]. The Journal of Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Eosinophilia is a common finding in returning travellers, migrants and other travelling groups. In this setting, it often indicates an underlying helminth infection. Infections associated with eosinophilia are frequently either asymptomatic or associated with non-specific symptoms but some can cause severe disease. Here the British Infection Association guidelines group has comprehensively reviewed and updated the UK recommendations for the investigation and management of eosinophilia in returning travellers, migrants and other relevant groups, first published in 2010. 1 Literature reviews have been undertaken to update the evidence on the prevalence and causes of eosinophilia in these groups and on the treatment of relevant pathogens and clinical conditions. Diagnostic tests available to UK-based clinicians are summarised. Changes made to the guidelines include updates in the sections on the investigation and empirical treatment of asymptomatic eosinophilia and on the treatment of trichuriasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, hookworm, fascioliasis and taeniasis. Pathogens which are rarely encountered in UK practice have been removed from the guidelines and others added, including an expanded section on fungal infection. A section on off-license and rarely used drugs has been included.

### Type 2 immunity-driven diseases: towards a multidisciplinary approach [^449e9981]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

TABLE 3
Unmet needs in type 2‐driven diseases

Another issue to be settled is the relevance of assessing type 2 inflammation involvement with biomarkers. A biomarker is a molecule, a gene or a characteristic that is linked to a specific diagnosis, prognosis or response to treatment. To be useful, a biomarker must be not only relevant and consistent but also specific and easy to use. Dealing with type 2 inflammation assessment in clinical practice, 2 situations must be emphasized. First, a clinician should be able to recognize type 2 involvement in individual settings. Second, tools should be available to help the clinician choose the best specific treatment for the patient.

In asthma, type 2 extended evaluation is principally done in rare severe forms of the disease (4% of the adult asthma population) due to the complex procedure involved and the cost of the biotherapies. However, such consideration must be tempered, as research on an allergic component has long been part of asthma healthcare strategies (avoidance of allergens, AIT). Phenotyping and endotyping of asthma of any severity is an important objective to improve our knowledge of the natural course of the disease and also its treatment. Consensual eosinophilic severe asthma definition was proposed by a European Respiratory Society taskforce based on a combination of major and minor criteria. This definition is based mainly on 3 biomarkers: sputum induction, blood eosinophilia and F ENO (exhaled nitric fraction). Sputum induction is considered to be the gold standard of inflammation evaluation in asthma. However, this technique requires trained operators and pathologists, lacks standardization and is also restricted to specialized expert centres. Recent guidelines from the European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society recommend assessing blood eosinophilia and F ENO at the expense of sputum induction. Nevertheless, it should be bear in mind that the correlations among blood eosinophilia, F ENO, eosinophilic infiltration and symptoms are far from perfect. Conversely, with such obstacles to ensure the strong endotyping of patients, robust biomarkers for the prediction of the response to biotherapies are still lacking. Even though correlations between blood eosinophilia and the response to anti‐IL5 strategies have been separately reported, there are still unexpected non‐responders.

### Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms vs toxic epidermal necrolysis: the dilemma of classification [^503d1042]. Clinics in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

According to contemporary vernacular, when the cutaneous manifestations of drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic signs (DRESS) syndrome are those of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), the condition is defined as "DRESS syndrome with severe cutaneous reactions". In this article, we have presented arguments for and against including patients with skin lesions of the SJS/TEN syndromes who also have fever (practically all of the patients) and internal organ involvement (most of the patients) under the definition of DRESS syndrome. After weighing the arguments for and against this alteration of definition, we conclude that it makes more sense for patients with SJS/TEN to be classified as such and not be lumped together under the misleading label of DRESS syndrome.

### Overlap of allergic, eosinophilic and type 2 inflammatory subtypes in moderate-to-severe asthma [^c10c55e2]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Asthma is a complex, chronic disease with marked heterogeneity in clinical symptoms, severity and treatment response. 1, 2 Several phenotypes of asthma have been defined based on various underlying clinical, inflammatory or molecular mechanisms, which may be used to classify asthma and personalize approaches to treatment. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Allergic asthma affects approximately two‐thirds of all patients with asthma and > 50% of patients with severe asthma. 8, 9 The allergic subtype is characterized by eosinophilic airway inflammation in response to allergens, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels. 10, 11 Eosinophilic asthma is a frequent, severe subtype of adult‐onset asthma and is associated with tissue and sputum eosinophilia, thickening of the basement membrane zone and corticosteroid refractoriness. While positive allergy testing and blood eosinophil levels are often used as indicators of systemic atopic and type 2 inflammation, a high fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level has been shown to be a reliable local marker for type 2 airway inflammation. 12, 13, 14 Further, decreased levels of FeNO have been demonstrated to correlate with asthma control. 12, 13, 15

Current guidelines recommend high‐dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long‐acting β 2 ‐agonists in patients with poorly controlled asthma. 16 However, a significant proportion of patients fail to achieve adequate asthma control despite high‐dose ICS therapy. 17 Until recently, therapeutic options for asthma, including oral corticosteroids, ICS or long‐acting β 2 ‐agonists, have been broadly employed in patients irrespective of phenotype. More recently, the emergence of biologic agents directed towards specific subtypes of allergic asthma, 14 eosinophilic asthma 18 or type 2 asthma 19 has allowed clinicians to provide more targeted therapy for patients based on differing asthma phenotypes. Biomarker cut‐off levels may be used to guide patient and treatment selection for targeted therapy. 20, 21 However, these subtypes are not mutually exclusive, and understanding the degree of overlap among these subtypes would be useful in guiding asthma phenotype interpretation, treatment decisions, treatment optimization and overall care. Our study aimed to characterize the degree of overlap among allergic asthma, eosinophilic asthma and type 2 asthma, defined on the basis of high FeNO levels, to better understand the relationship among these asthma subtypes in two adult populations with moderate‐to‐severe asthma: those not selected for any of these subtypes (non‐subtype–selected population) and, as a means of confirmation, those selected for perennial allergic asthma (allergic asthma–selected population).

### Proposed refined diagnostic criteria and classification of eosinophil disorders and related syndromes [^b6ca8195]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

Per the original definition, tissue HE is present when > 1 of the following features is documented: (i) the percentage of eosinophils exceeds 20% of all nucleated cells in BM sections, (ii) a pathologist is of the opinion that tissue infiltration by eosinophils is extensive (massive) compared with "normal physiologic ranges", or (iii) immunostaining reveals extensive extracellular deposition of eosinophil granule proteins, such as eMBP1 or EPX (Table 1). Although immunostaining for eosinophil granule proteins is not routinely available, when observed, it qualifies as a criterion for tissue HE even in the absence of marked (intact) eosinophil infiltration.

Of note, tissue HE can be detected in the absence of PB HE (e.g. in eosinophilic esophagitis or nasal polyposis), although in most instances, mild blood eosinophilia is also present. It is also important to state that the original definition of HES required PB HE. In other words, the diagnosis of HES could only be established when both PB HE and HE‐related organ damage were documented, irrespective of tissue HE. However, there are cases with tissue HE and associated organ damage resembling HES in which peripheral HE is absent. This occurs most commonly when only a single organ is involved. These patients should be labeled as "tissue‐restricted HES" or "organ‐restricted (mono‐organ) HES", and most should be managed in the same way as those who have classically‐defined HES.

### Eosinophilia / hypereosinophilia in the setting of reactive and idiopathic causes, well-defined myeloid or lymphoid leukemias, or germline disorders [^938df08b]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To report the findings of the 2019 Society for Hematopathology/European Association for Haematopathology Workshop within the categories of reactive eosinophilia, hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), germline disorders with eosinophilia (GDE), and myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia (excluding entities covered by other studies in this series).

Methods

The workshop panel reviewed 109 cases, assigned consensus diagnosis, and created diagnosis-specific sessions.

Results

The most frequent diagnosis was reactive eosinophilia (35), followed by acute leukemia (24). Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) received 17 submissions, including chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified (CEL, NOS). Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), MDS/MPN, and therapy-related myeloid neoplasms received 11, while GDE and HES received 12 and 11 submissions, respectively.

Conclusions

Hypereosinophilia and HES are defined by specific clinical and laboratory criteria. Eosinophilia is commonly reactive. An acute leukemic onset with eosinophilia may suggest core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia, blast phase of chronic myeloid leukemia, BCR-ABL1-positive leukemia, or t(5;14) B-lymphoblastic leukemia. Eosinophilia is rare in MDS but common in MDS/MPN. CEL, NOS is a clinically aggressive MPN with eosinophilia as the dominant feature. Bone marrow morphology and cytogenetic and/or molecular clonality may distinguish CEL from HES. Molecular testing helps to better subclassify myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia and to identify patients for targeted treatments.
