## Question

A 68-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension presents to the vascular surgery clinic with a 3-month history of a nonhealing ulcer on the lateral aspect of his right foot. He reports worsening pain in the foot, especially at night, and has noticed some black discoloration at the edge of the ulcer. On examination, the right foot is cool to touch with diminished dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. An ankle-brachial index (ABI) is performed and is 0.92 on the right side. The vascular surgeon is concerned about possible chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) and wants to assess the likelihood of wound healing and the need for revascularization.

According to current guidelines, what additional perfusion tests should be considered in this patient to assess arterial perfusion and the likelihood of wound healing, and why are these tests recommended beyond the ankle-brachial index?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which additional perfusion tests should be considered in a 68-year-old man with diabetes, a nonhealing foot ulcer, and an ABI of 0.92, to assess arterial perfusion and the likelihood of wound healing, and why these tests are recommended beyond ABI. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the ABI of 0.92 is misleading in this clinical context. Then, I should verify which guideline-endorsed perfusion tests best predict wound healing and amputation risk. Next, I will review the evidence-based thresholds that change pretest probabilities. After that, I need to check how these tests fit into a WIfI-based risk stratification and decision pathway. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized testing plan and note limitations and alternatives if primary tests are not feasible.

> Let me first confirm the ABI interpretation in this scenario. An ABI of 0.92 sits in the "borderline" or "normal" range, but in patients with diabetes and suspected CLTI, ABI can be falsely normal or noncompressible due to medial arterial calcification, masking significant distal ischemia and underestimating healing risk, so I should not rely on ABI alone here [^f2042906] [^707a3a7f] [^b52d310b].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance on next steps. Multiple high-credibility guidelines advise that when ABI is normal or borderline in the presence of tissue loss or rest pain, we should add tests that assess distal perfusion and wound-healing potential, specifically toe pressure/toe-brachial index with waveforms, transcutaneous oxygen pressure, and/or skin perfusion pressure, because these modalities better reflect microcirculatory delivery to the foot and ulcer bed [^f2042906] [^271c7c71] [^b9434ebb] [^dcf28875].

> I will now examine toe pressure and toe-brachial index. Hold on, I should confirm the thresholds that meaningfully shift prognosis: toe pressure ≥ 30 mmHg increases the likelihood of healing by about 20–30%, whereas toe pressure < 30 mmHg increases the likelihood of major amputation by about 20%; TBI ≤ 0.70 is abnormal and supports PAD, and in diabetes with tissue loss, TBI is preferred over ABI because digital arteries are less often calcified, making TBI more reliable for distal perfusion assessment [^dcf28875] [^7266aa83] [^a6b76a6b].

> Next, I should review transcutaneous oxygen pressure. Let me think about the evidence: TcPO2 ≥ 25 mmHg increases the pretest probability of healing by up to roughly 45%, while TcPO2 < 25 mmHg increases the probability of major amputation by about 20%; TcPO2 directly measures oxygen delivery to the skin and is less affected by arterial calcification, though edema and infection can limit accuracy and heating to about 40°C is required, so I need to ensure proper technique and clinical context when interpreting results [^dcf28875] [^7266aa83] [^88f316fe].

> I should confirm the role of skin perfusion pressure. SPP ≥ 40 mmHg is associated with a moderate increase in healing probability, and SPP can be measured quickly at the ulcer site; however, validation is more limited than for toe pressure and TcPO2, so I should treat SPP as supportive rather than definitive when the other tests are unavailable or inconclusive [^dcf28875] [^7266aa83].

> Let me consider how these perfusion metrics integrate with global risk stratification. The WIfI classification combines wound severity, ischemia grade, and foot infection to predict amputation risk and healing likelihood; in this patient, even with a "normal" ABI, low toe pressure or TBI would upstage ischemia and strengthen the case for revascularization, whereas higher perfusion values would support optimized wound care and surveillance, reinforcing the need to obtain toe pressure/TBI and TcPO2 to refine WIfI and guide therapy [^fef95168] [^4b63923f] [^0bb25a71].

> But wait, what if toe pressure cannot be measured due to digital ulcers or amputation? I should double-check alternatives: guidelines recommend TcPO2 or SPP when toe pressure is not feasible, and they also advise reassessing perfusion if there is no healing progress by about 4 weeks, which helps catch missed ischemia or evolving infection that alters risk and management [^dcf28875] [^0bb25a71].

> I need to ensure the testing sequence is practical. Given availability and prognostic strength, I would prioritize toe pressure/TBI with waveforms first, then TcPO2 if toe testing is not possible or results are borderline, and consider SPP as an adjunct; if these are unavailable, pulse volume recordings or duplex waveforms can provide supportive hemodynamic information, but they are less predictive for healing than toe pressure and TcPO2 and should be interpreted cautiously [^f2042906] [^b9434ebb] [^07a3063c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about revascularization based on a single value. I should confirm that perfusion results are interpreted alongside wound characteristics and infection, because healing also depends on debridement, offloading, and infection control; nonetheless, thresholds such as toe pressure < 30 mmHg or TcPO2 < 25 mmHg materially increase amputation risk and should prompt urgent vascular consultation and anatomic imaging to plan revascularization when appropriate [^dcf28875] [^0bb25a71] [^7f84fa9f].

> In summary, I should confirm that ABI alone is insufficient here due to calcification risk, and I will add toe pressure/TBI with waveforms and TcPO2 to quantify distal perfusion and predict healing; SPP is a reasonable alternative if toe testing is not feasible, and all results should be integrated with WIfI to align the urgency of revascularization with the patient's true limb risk and healing potential [^f2042906] [^271c7c71] [^b9434ebb] [^dcf28875].

In a 68-year-old man with diabetes, a nonhealing foot ulcer, and an ABI of 0.92, **additional perfusion testing is essential** because ABI can be falsely normal in medial arterial calcification [^707a3a7f]. Current guidelines recommend **toe pressure/toe-brachial index (TBI) with waveforms** [^f2042906] [^b9434ebb], **transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2)** [^271c7c71], and **skin perfusion pressure (SPP)** [^af3c5497] to assess distal perfusion and predict wound healing [^dcf28875]. These tests are more reliable in diabetes and help identify ischemia missed by ABI, guiding the need for revascularization [^7266aa83] [^a6b76a6b].

---

## Limitations of ABI in diabetic patients

ABI is a useful screening tool, but in diabetic patients it has **important limitations**:

- **Medial arterial calcification**: Common in diabetes, causing noncompressible arteries and falsely elevated ABI [^707a3a7f] [^b52d310b].
- **False negatives**: ABI 0.92 can mask significant peripheral artery disease (PAD) and ischemia [^notfound].
- **Poor correlation**: ABI correlates poorly with wound healing in diabetic foot ulcers [^82d51f09].

---

## Recommended additional perfusion tests

Given these limitations, **guidelines recommend additional perfusion tests** to assess distal perfusion and healing potential:

| **Test** | **Rationale and clinical utility** | **Guideline recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Toe pressure/TBI with waveforms | - Digital arteries are less affected by calcification <br/> - TBI ≤ 0.70 is abnormal <br/> - Toe pressure < 30 mmHg indicates severe ischemia and poor healing [^3a30e47d] [^dcf28875] | - Class IIa <br/> - Strongly recommended in diabetes with tissue loss [^f2042906] [^b9434ebb] |
| Transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) | - Directly measures tissue oxygenation <br/> - TcPO2 < 25 mmHg predicts poor healing and higher amputation risk <br/> - TcPO2 > 30 mmHg suggests better healing potential [^3a30e47d] [^dcf28875] | - Class IIa <br/> - Recommended for wound healing assessment [^f2042906] [^271c7c71] |
| Skin perfusion pressure (SPP) | - Measures microcirculatory perfusion <br/> - SPP < 40 mmHg indicates poor healing <br/> - SPP ≥ 40 mmHg suggests better healing potential [^3a30e47d] [^dcf28875] | - Class IIa <br/> - Useful when toe pressure/TBI cannot be performed [^f2042906] [^271c7c71] |

---

## Clinical thresholds and interpretation

These tests have **established thresholds** that guide prognosis and management:

- **Toe pressure/TBI**: Toe pressure < 30 mmHg or TBI ≤ 0.70 indicates severe ischemia and poor healing; consider revascularization [^3a30e47d] [^dcf28875].
- **TcPO2**: TcPO2 < 25 mmHg predicts poor healing; TcPO2 > 30 mmHg suggests better healing potential [^3a30e47d] [^dcf28875].
- **SPP**: SPP < 40 mmHg indicates poor healing; SPP ≥ 40 mmHg suggests better healing potential [^3a30e47d] [^dcf28875].

---

## Integration with clinical assessment

These perfusion tests should be integrated with clinical assessment and the **WIfI classification** (wound, ischemia, foot infection) to guide decisions on revascularization and wound care [^fef95168] [^4b63923f]. Low perfusion values increase the likelihood of healing failure and amputation, supporting early vascular intervention [^7266aa83] [^06899ac9].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In a diabetic patient with a nonhealing foot ulcer and an ABI of 0.92, **additional perfusion testing is essential** to accurately assess ischemia and healing potential. Recommended tests include toe pressure/TBI with waveforms, TcPO2, and SPP, which are more reliable in diabetes and provide critical information for management decisions [^f2042906] [^b9434ebb]. These tests help identify ischemia missed by ABI and guide the need for revascularization, improving the likelihood of wound healing and limb salvage [^7266aa83] [^06899ac9].

### Perfusion assessment in critical limb ischemia: principles for understanding and the development of evidence and evaluation of devices: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^ac2ce136]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

There are > 12 million patients with peripheral artery disease in the United States. The most severe form of peripheral artery disease is critical limb ischemia (CLI). The diagnosis and management of CLI is often challenging. Ethnic differences in comorbidities and presentation of CLI exist. Compared with white patients, black and Hispanic patients have higher prevalence rates of diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease and are more likely to present with gangrene, whereas white patients are more likely to present with ulcers and rest pain. A thorough evaluation of limb perfusion is important in the diagnosis of CLI because it can not only enable timely diagnosis but also reduce unnecessary invasive procedures in patients with adequate blood flow or among those with other causes for ulcers, including venous, neuropathic, or pressure changes. This scientific statement discusses the current tests and technologies for noninvasive assessment of limb perfusion, including the ankle-brachial index, toe-brachial index, and other perfusion technologies. In addition, limitations of the current technologies along with opportunities for improvement, research, and reducing disparities in health care for patients with CLI are discussed.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) diagnostic testing — In patients with history and physical examination suggestive of peripheral artery disease (PAD) with rest pain, nonhealing wound, or gangrene, the algorithm uses ankle-brachial index (ABI) categories and branches accordingly: noncompressible arteries ABI: > 1.40 to toe-brachial index (TBI), and normal ABI: 1.00–1.40 or borderline ABI: 0.91–0.99 with nonhealing wound or gangrene to perfusion assessment. Additional perfusion assessment, particularly if ABI > 0.70, includes TBI with waveforms, transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2), and skin perfusion pressure (Class IIa), with the notes "TBI with waveforms if not already performed" and "Order based on expert consensus". After the perfusion decision node labeled "Normal" or "Abnormal", abnormal results lead to anatomic assessment with duplex ultrasound, CTA or MRA, or invasive angiography (Class I), and the flow also includes branches to search for alternative diagnosis (Tables 6 and 7).

### The intersocietal IWGDF, ESVS, SVS guidelines on peripheral artery disease in people with diabetes mellitus and a foot ulcer [^dcf28875]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) bedside perfusion testing — ankle-brachial index (ABI), toe pressure (TP), toe-brachial index (TBI), transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2), and skin perfusion pressure (SPP) — is described with prognostic thresholds. TP and TBI assess distal blood flow, and with TP ≥ 30 mmHg the pre-test probability of healing was increased by up to 30%, while a value < 30 mmHg increases the probability of major amputation by approximately 20%; evidence for TBI predicting healing or major amputation was inconsistent and insufficient. For TcPO2, the majority of available studies (n = 7) reported predictive utility for DFU healing; with a TcPO2 ≥ 25 mmHg the pre-test probability of healing is increased by up to 45%, and a value < 25 mmHg increases the probability of major amputation by approximately 20%. An SPP (≥ 40 mmHg) increased the pre-test probability of healing by up to 30% in one low-quality study, and there are insufficient data on SPP and amputation to formulate a recommendation. Across studies, the ABI seemed to have the best predictive capacity for major amputation, while the TP and TcPO2 seemed better for wound healing; based on current evidence no test has convincingly been shown to perform better than other tests as a prognostic indicator of both healing and amputation, and in the opinion of the Writing Committee multiple tests should be used.

Ankle brachial index

The ankle brachial index (ABI) is a simple bedside tool to diagnose lower extremity PAD. The ABI of each leg is the highest ankle systolic blood pressure (SBP) (obtained by blood pressure cuff above the ankle and Doppler of both the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries) divided by the highest arm SBP. A low ABI (< 0.9) is indicative of obstructive disease, and a very elevated ABI (> 1.4) represents arterial stiffening from calcification. In patients with claudication symptoms, exercise treadmill ABI or pedal plantarflexion (toe raises) ABI increase the sensitivity of the test.

In patients who are elderly or with diabetes or chronic kidney disease (CKD), ABI is often elevated due to medial calcification. If there is suspicion that ABI is artificially elevated, toe brachial index (TBI) should be measured because the digital arteries are rarely non-compressible. A TBI of < 0.7 is generally considered to be abnormal. Due to high likelihood of falsely elevated ABI in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI), TBI should always be obtained in patients with lower extremity wounds. Other measurements of perfusion, such as transcutaneous oxygen pressure and skin perfusion pressure, can help guide revascularisation in patients with CLTI.

### Challenges in the treatment of chronic wounds [^83f51a19]. Advances in Wound Care (2015). Low credibility.

Depth, extent (size), location, general appearance, odor, and notation of exudates are all essential components of wound evaluation and need to be recorded at baseline. Probing the wound will determine its depth of penetration and any tracking along tendon sheaths or tissue planes. A positive probe-to-bone (PTB) test has a high predictive value for underlying osteomyelitis even in the absence of acute signs of deep infection (Fig. 2C). A neurological evaluation should be performed to assess the presence and extent of neuropathy since this factor not only predisposes a patient to DFUs but is also a major risk factor for diabetes-related lower extremity amputation.

A vascular examination is important for any type of chronic wound, but assessment of arterial perfusion is especially important for DFU patients since this parameter will drive all subsequent therapies and outcomes. Palpation of pulses commences initially, recognizing that this assessment can be highly variable among different clinicians. Medial arterial calcification renders pulse palpation to be difficult even in the presence of adequate perfusion to the foot. Nonetheless, ankle–brachial indices (ABI) should be obtained at baseline for most patients for whom there is any question of a pulse deficit. Despite the falsely elevated ABI levels that medial arterial calcification produces, the American Diabetes Association has recommended that this diagnostic test be performed on diabetic patients over 50 years of age and whenever clinical circumstances (such as in the case of DFU) dictate this evaluation. Regardless, when the ABI is below 0.9, the patient should be considered to have impaired arterial perfusion. To augment ankle–brachial studies, toe blood pressure readings, pulse volume recordings, transcutaneous oxygen measurements, and skin perfusion pressure measurements have been recommended as valid benchmarks for the prediction of wound healing. Whenever peripheral arterial disease is suspected or confirmed by the noninvasive tests above, a referral to a vascular surgeon or interventionist is indicated for angiography and revascularization. Limb salvage rates have been reported as high as 80% for ischemic foot ulcers undergoing revascularization.

### Assessment of foot perfusion in patients with a diabetic foot ulcer [^a02a4d57]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Assessment of foot perfusion is a vital step in the management of patients with diabetic foot ulceration, in order to understand the risk of amputation and likelihood of wound healing. Underlying peripheral artery disease is a common finding in patients with foot ulceration and is associated with poor outcomes. Assessment of foot perfusion should therefore focus on identifying the presence of peripheral artery disease and to subsequently estimate the effect this may have on wound healing. Assessment of perfusion can be difficult because of the often complex, diffuse and distal nature of peripheral artery disease in patients with diabetes, as well as poor collateralisation and heavy vascular calcification. Conventional methods of assessing tissue perfusion in the peripheral circulation may be unreliable in patients with diabetes, and it may therefore be difficult to determine the extent to which poor perfusion contributes to foot ulceration. Anatomical data obtained on cross-sectional imaging is important but must be combined with measurements of tissue perfusion (such as transcutaneous oxygen tension) in order to understand the global and regional perfusion deficit present in a patient with diabetic foot ulceration. Ankle-brachial pressure index is routinely used to screen for peripheral artery disease, but its use in patients with diabetes is limited in the presence of neuropathy and medial arterial calcification. Toe pressure index may be more useful because of the relative sparing of pedal arteries from medial calcification but may not always be possible in patients with ulceration. Fluorescence angiography is a non-invasive technique that can provide rapid quantitative information about regional tissue perfusion; capillaroscopy, iontophoresis and hyperspectral imaging may also be useful in assessing physiological perfusion but are not widely available. There may be a future role for specialized perfusion imaging of these patients, including magnetic resonance imaging techniques, single-photon emission computed tomography and PET-based molecular imaging; however, these novel techniques require further validation and are unlikely to become standard practice in the near future.

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) diagnosis in nonhealing wounds or gangrene with normal or borderline ABI — in patients with normal (1.00–1.40) or borderline (0.91–0.99) ABI, it is reasonable to diagnose CLI by using toe-brachial index (TBI) with waveforms, transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2), or skin perfusion pressure (SPP); thresholds noted include TBI ≤ 0.70 considered diagnostic of PAD, the likelihood of wound healing decreases with toe pressure < 30 mm Hg, TcPO2 > 30 mm Hg has been used to predict ulcer healing, and SPP ≥ 30 to 50 mm Hg is associated with increased likelihood of wound healing.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^b10d2833]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot — vascular evaluation states that noninvasive arterial studies should be performed to determine lower extremity perfusion, including Doppler segmental arterial pressures and waveform analysis, ankle-brachial indices (ABI), toe blood pressures, and transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2). If the history and physical examination suggest ischemia (ie, absent pedal pulses) or if a nonhealing ulcer is present, further evaluation in the form of noninvasive testing is warranted. Indications for vascular consultation include an ankle brachial index of less than 0.7, toe blood pressures less than 40 mmHg, or TcPO2 levels less than 30 mmHg. Ankle-brachial indices may be misleading because ankle pressures can be falsely elevated due to medial arterial calcinosis and noncompressibility. Toe blood pressures and TcPO2 are highly predictive of wound healing failure at levels below 25 mmHg, and laser Doppler skin perfusion pressure (SPP) can be highly predictive of critical limb ischemia and wound healing failure at levels less than 30 mmHg. Vascular consultation should be considered in the presence of abnormal noninvasive arterial studies or a nonhealing ulceration; arteriography with clearly visualized distal runoff allows appropriate assessment for potential revascularization, and magnetic resonance angiography or CT angiography are alternatives for evaluation of distal arterial perfusion.

### Determining end points for critical limb ischemia interventions [^50383b21]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Critical limb ischemia is a condition that has increased in prevalence and carries a high degree of morbidity. Although endovascular therapy for treatment of patients with critical limb ischemia has undergone significant advances with improved outcomes over the past decade, these patients often have multilevel disease, and it may take weeks or months for ulceration healing. For this reason, the acceptable therapeutic end points during and immediately following revascularization remain somewhat obscure. There are multiple tools available to guide the treating vascular specialist in this regard. Establishment of in-line flow to the foot and the angiosome containing the ulceration, appearance of a "wound blush", restoration of pulses, and bleeding at the ulcer site are basic tenets intraprocedurally. Postprocedural noninvasive testing including the ankle-brachial and toe-brachial indices, segmental pressure measurements, pulse volume recordings, transcutaneous oxygen tension, skin perfusion pressures (SPPs), and toe pressures all play a role in determining the likelihood of clinical improvement. Newer technologies such as two-dimensional (2D) perfusion angiography, fluorescence angiography, and tissue oxygen saturation mapping may allow better real-time assessment of flow restoration. In combination with close clinical follow-up and wound care, these tools provide treating physicians with a better grasp of the necessary end points to optimize patients for clinical improvement.

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) diagnostic testing — suspected cases with a history and physical examination suggestive of peripheral artery disease (PAD) with rest pain, nonhealing wound, or gangrene undergo ankle-brachial index (ABI) testing (Class I), with search for alternative diagnosis if not suggestive. ABI branches include non-compressible arteries ABI: > 1.40 leading to toe-brachial index (TBI) (Class I) with thresholds Normal (> 0.70) versus Abnormal (≤ 0.70); Normal ABI: 1.00–1.40 and Borderline ABI: 0.91–0.99 prompt evaluation for nonhealing wound or gangrene, and if present, perfusion assessment — TBI with waveforms, TcPO2, or skin perfusion pressure (Class IIa); Abnormal ABI: ≤ 0.90 warrants additional perfusion assessment, particularly if ABI > 0.70 (Class IIa). Anatomic assessment options (Class I) include duplex ultrasound, computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and invasive angiography; terminology is defined as follows: ABI indicates ankle-brachial index; CLI, critical limb ischemia; CTA, computed tomography angiography; MRA, magnetic resonance angiography; TcPO2, transcutaneous oxygen pressure; and TBI, toe-brachial index.

### Interpretation and significance of ankle-brachial systolic pressure index [^fe2055e7]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The ankle-brachial systolic pressure index (ABI) is an underutilized, easy-to-perform, physiologic test to diagnosis atherosclerotic lower-limb arterial occlusive disease. Testing requires a sphygmomanometer and continuous-wave Doppler probe to measure the ratio of ankle and brachial systolic blood pressures. The ABI measurement has been standardized by use of the highest ankle and brachial systolic pressure for the calculation; abnormal threshold value is ≤ 0.9. The ABI is used to diagnosis and screen for peripheral arterial disease, which is a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis and a predictor of cardiovascular events. A lower ABI value correlates with severity of limb ischemia and decreased survival. Measurement of ABI is recommended as the initial diagnostic test for patients with exertional leg pain (claudication), to assess the healing potential of foot lesions, after blunt extremity trauma to detect occult arterial injury, and as part of the routine health assessment of patients with diabetes and peripheral arterial disease.

### Early ABI testing may decrease risk of amputation for patients with lower extremity ulcers [^a6058ccd]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with lower extremity wounds from diabetes mellitus or peripheral artery disease (PAD) have a risk of amputation as high as 25%. In patients with arterial disease, revascularization decreases the risk of amputation. We aimed to determine if the early assessment of arterial perfusion correlates with the risk of amputation.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed patients referred to the vascular clinic over 18 months with Rutherford Grade 5 and 6 chronic limb-threatening ischemia to determine if patients had a pulse exam done at the time the wound was identified and when ankle brachial index (ABI) testing to evaluate perfusion was performed. Kaplan Meier analysis was used to determine if the timing of ABI testing affected the time to revascularization, wound healing, and risk of amputation.

Results

Ninety-three patients with lower extremity wounds were identified. Of these, 59 patients (63%) did not have a pulse exam performed by their primary care provider when the wound was identified. Patients were classified by when they underwent ankle brachial index testing to assess arterial perfusion. Twenty-four had early ABI (< 30 days) testing, with the remaining 69 patients having late ABI testing. Patients in the early ABI group were more likely to have a pulse exam done by their PCP than those in the late group, 12 (50%) vs. 22 (32%), P = 0.03. Early ABI patients had a quicker time to vascular referral (13 days vs. 91 days, P < 0.001). Early ABI patients also had quicker times to wound healing than those in the late group (117 days vs. 287 days, P < 0.001). Finally, patients that underwent early ABI were less likely to require amputation (Fig. 1), although this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07).

Conclusions

Early ABI testing expedites specialty referral and time to revascularization. It can decrease the time to wound healing. Larger cohort studies are needed to determine the overall effect of early ABI testing to decrease amputation rates.

Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Perfusion assessment in peripheral artery disease (PAD) and chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) identifies diagnostic and wound-healing thresholds: A toe-brachial index (TBI) of ≤ 0.70 is considered abnormal and absolute toe pressures < 30 mm Hg indicate severe ischemia associated with poor healing; a TcPO2 of > 30 mm Hg or an SPP of > 40 mm Hg can predict wound healing. In established CLTI with nonhealing wounds or gangrene, additional perfusion assessments including toe pressures/TBI, TcPO2, and SPP have shown ability to assess local perfusion and determine wound-healing potential and amputation risk. Improvement in the pedal acceleration time (180 ms) after revascularization in CLTI has been associated with limb salvage in a single-center study.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of tests to predict wound healing in diabetic foot [^82d51f09]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This systematic review summarized the evidence on noninvasive screening tests for the prediction of wound healing and the risk of amputation in diabetic foot ulcers.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus from database inception to October 2011. We pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and compared test performance.

Results

Thirty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight tests were used to predict wound healing in this setting, including ankle-brachial index (ABI), ankle peak systolic velocity, transcutaneous oxygen measurement (TcPo2), toe-brachial index, toe systolic blood pressure, microvascular oxygen saturation, skin perfusion pressure, and hyperspectral imaging. For the TcPo2 test, the pooled DOR was 15.81 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.36–74.45) for wound healing and 4.14 (95% CI, 2.98–5.76) for the risk of amputation. ABI was also predictive but to a lesser degree of the risk of amputations (DOR, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.65–5.05) but not of wound healing (DOR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.40–2.64). It was not feasible to perform meta-analysis comparing the remaining tests. The overall quality of evidence was limited by the risk of bias and imprecision (wide CIs due to small sample size).

Conclusions

Several tests may predict wound healing in the setting of diabetic foot ulcer; however, most of the available evidence evaluates only TcPo2 and ABI. The overall quality of the evidence is low, and further research is needed to provide higher quality comparative effectiveness evidence.

### Performance of non-invasive bedside vascular testing in the prediction of wound healing or amputation among people with foot ulcers in diabetes: a systematic review [^7266aa83]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The presence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) confers a significantly increased risk of failure to heal and major lower limb amputation for people with diabetes-related foot ulcer (DFU). Determining performance of non-invasive bedside tests for predicting likely DFU outcomes is therefore key to effective risk stratification of patients with DFU and PAD to guide management decisions. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the performance of non-invasive bedside tests for PAD to predict DFU healing, healing post-minor amputation, or need for minor or major amputation in people with diabetes and DFU or gangrene.

Methods

A database search of Medline and Embase was conducted from 1980 to 30 November 2022. Prospective studies that evaluated non-invasive bedside tests in patients with diabetes, with and without PAD and foot ulceration or gangrene to predict the outcomes of DFU healing, minor amputation, and major amputation with or without revascularisation, were eligible. Included studies were required to have a minimum 6-month follow-up period and report adequate data to calculate the positive likelihood ratio (PLR) and negative likelihood ratio for the outcomes of DFU healing, and minor and major amputation. Methodological quality was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool.

Results

From 14,820 abstracts screened 28 prognostic studies met the inclusion criteria. The prognostic tests evaluated by the studies included: ankle-brachial index (ABI) in 9 studies; ankle pressures in 10 studies, toe-brachial index in 4 studies, toe pressure in 9 studies, transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO 2) in 7 studies, skin perfusion pressure in 5 studies, continuous wave Doppler (pedal waveforms) in 2 studies, pedal pulses in 3 studies, and ankle peak systolic velocity in 1 study. Study quality was variable. Common reasons for studies having a moderate or high risk of bias were poorly described study participation, attrition rates, and inadequate adjustment for confounders. In people with DFU, toe pressure ≥ 30 mmHg, TcPO 2 ≥ 25 mmHg, and skin perfusion pressure of ≥ 40 mmHg were associated with a moderate to large increase in pretest probability of healing in people with DFU. Toe pressure ≥ 30 mmHg was associated with a moderate increase in healing post-minor amputation. An ABI using a threshold of ≥ 0.9 did not increase the pretest probability of DFU healing, whereas an ABI < 0.5 was associated with a moderate increase in pretest probability of non-healing. Few studies investigated amputation outcomes. An ABI < 0.4 demonstrated the largest increase in pretest probability of a major amputation (PLR ≥ 10).

Conclusions

Prognostic capacity of bedside testing for DFU healing and amputation is variable. A toe pressure ≥ 30 mmHg, TcPO 2 ≥ 25 mmHg, and skin perfusion pressure of ≥ 40 mmHg are associated with a moderate to large increase in pretest probability of healing in people with DFU. There are little data available evaluating the prognostic capacity of bedside testing for healing after minor amputation or for major amputation in people with DFU. Current evidence suggests that an ABI < 0.4 may be associated with a large increase in risk of major amputation. The findings of this systematic review need to be interpreted in the context of limitations of available evidence, including varying rates of revascularisation, lack of post-revascularisation bedside testing, and heterogenous subpopulations.

IWGDF, ESVS, SVS guidelines — assessment and management pathway for a person with diabetes, peripheral artery disease (PAD), and a foot ulcer begins with wound care and vascular assessment, then branches by perfusion and waveform findings. Start with "Wound care and offloading as recommended by IWGDF", "Palpate pulses and examine for signs of ischaemia", and "Evaluate pedal doppler waveforms, perform ABI and TBI to diagnose or exclude PAD", then "Use WIfI to stratify healing likelihood and amputation risk". If "ABI 0.9–1.3; TBI ≥ 0.70, triphasic or biphasic pedal doppler waveforms", the pathway is to "persist with wound care and treatment of infection as needed". If "PAD, ulcer with infection or gangrene", proceed to "Urgent consultation by vascular specialist". If there are "Absent pulses, monophasic or absent pedal doppler waveforms or ankle pressure < 100 mm Hg or TP < 60 mm Hg", then "Consult vascular specialist unless urgent amputation indicated". When severe ischaemia thresholds apply — "ABI < 0.4, ankle pressure < 50 mm Hg, TP < 30 mm Hg or TcPO2 < 30 mm Hg or monophasic or absent pedal doppler waveforms" — "Urgent revascularisation procedure should be considered, consult vascular specialist".

### Global vascular guidelines on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^efe3de68]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Level of amputation — perfusion assessment and TcPO2 indicate that preoperative tissue perfusion assessment can make it possible to lower the level of amputation, but there is no accurate method to predict the optimal level of amputation. In particular, TcPO2 has been extensively evaluated, and it has been shown that wound complications increase as TcPO2 levels fall below 40 mm Hg, and currently there is still no single definitive method of evaluating tissue perfusion that can accurately predict the wound healing potential or failure at the site of amputation.

### Performance of prognostic markers in the prediction of wound healing or amputation among patients with foot ulcers in diabetes: a systematic review [^7445d36c]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Prediction of wound healing and major amputation in patients with diabetic foot ulceration is clinically important to stratify risk and target interventions for limb salvage. No consensus exists as to which measure of peripheral artery disease (PAD) can best predict outcomes. To evaluate the prognostic utility of index PAD measures for the prediction of healing and/or major amputation among patients with active diabetic foot ulceration, two reviewers independently screened potential studies for inclusion. Two further reviewers independently extracted study data and performed an assessment of methodological quality using the Quality in Prognostic Studies instrument. Of 9476 citations reviewed, 11 studies reporting on 9 markers of PAD met the inclusion criteria. Annualized healing rates varied from 18% to 61%; corresponding major amputation rates varied from 3% to 19%. Among 10 studies, skin perfusion pressure ≥ 40 mmHg, toe pressure ≥ 30 mmHg (and ≥ 45 mmHg) and transcutaneous pressure of oxygen (TcPO2) ≥ 25 mmHg were associated with at least a 25% higher chance of healing. Four studies evaluated PAD measures for predicting major amputation. Ankle pressure < 70 mmHg and fluorescein toe slope < 18 units each increased the likelihood of major amputation by around 25%. The combined test of ankle pressure < 50 mmHg or an ankle brachial index (ABI) < 0.5 increased the likelihood of major amputation by approximately 40%. Among patients with diabetic foot ulceration, the measurement of skin perfusion pressures, toe pressures and TcPO2 appear to be more useful in predicting ulcer healing than ankle pressures or the ABI. Conversely, an ankle pressure of < 50 mmHg or an ABI < 0.5 is associated with a significant increase in the incidence of major amputation.

Physiological testing — recommendations: Toe-brachial index (TBI) should be measured to diagnose patients with suspected PAD when the ABI is greater than 1.40. Patients with exertional non–joint-related leg symptoms and normal or borderline resting ABI (> 0.90 and ≤ 1.40) should undergo exercise treadmill ABI testing to evaluate for PAD. In patients with PAD and an abnormal resting ABI (≤ 0.90), exercise treadmill ABI testing can be useful to objectively assess functional status. In patients with normal (1.00–1.40) or borderline (0.91–0.99) ABI in the setting of nonhealing wounds or gangrene, it is reasonable to diagnose critical limb ischemia (CLI) by using TBI with waveforms, TcPO2, or SPP. In patients with PAD with an abnormal ABI (≤ 0.90) or with noncompressible arteries (ABI > 1.40 and TBI ≤ 0.70) in the setting of nonhealing wounds or gangrene, TBI with waveforms, TcPO2, or SPP can be useful to evaluate local perfusion.

Discussion

In the current study, ABPI was estimated by ankle ultrasound (eABPI) as previously described, and it is the first study to investigate post-procedural eABPI as a predictive biomarker of outcome after angioplasty. We have demonstrated that improved eABPI early after interventions (1 month) predicts favourable 1-year clinical outcomes and may help to answer the question as to what level of perfusion is required to achieve optimal clinical outcome in patients with CLTI. Our data show that all clinic outcomes, namely wound healing, survival, AFS, freedom from MALE, cdTLR, and major amputation were significantly better in patients with ≥ 0.7. All outcomes except for survival remained significant after adjustment for baseline eABPI, age, sex, number of-comorbidities, number of intervened segments, WIfI wound score, and WIfI foot infection scores where age, co-morbidities, and foot infection were the major significant drivers of survival. Importantly, our data indicate that ≥ 0.7 may not be enough because post-procedural eABPI of < 0.9 was still associated with lower wound healing and higher MALE and cdTLR as compared to ≥ 0.9 and this remained significant after adjustment for confounding variables.

Previous studies have shown that an ABPI of ≤ 0.90 is independently and robustly associated with increased risk of severe ischaemic leg outcomes, supporting ABPI ≤ 0.90 as a threshold for diagnosing PAD. A meta-analysis also indicated that a low ABPI is associated with an increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality. Our sensitivity analysis did not show that pre-procedural eABPI predicted the outcome. This contrasts with a previous study that reported pre-procedural ABPI values of < 0.5 were a strong predictor of adverse outcome after angioplasty. In that study, post-procedural values were not measured making it hard to compare with our work. Future studies need to address whether an early angioplasty eABPI result of < 0.7 or < 0.9 can be accepted, or should trigger further interventions in particular if wounds appear clinically static. The next step could be the implementation of 'on table' perfusion monitoring, e.g. with eABPI or similar approach, aiming at perfusion target values of > 0.7 or > 0.9 for revascularisation and taking the qualitative 'straight-line flow to the foot' paradigm to the next logical and quantitative level. This needs to be addressed in future studies.

### Lower extremity arterial disease in patients with diabetes: a contemporary narrative review [^b52d310b]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2018). Low credibility.

Ankle–brachial index testing

Ankle–brachial index has emerged as the relatively simple, non-invasive, and inexpensive tool for LEAD diagnosis. The ADA recommends the assessment of ABI as a first line non-invasive test in patients with symptoms or signs of LEAD. It is computed as a ratio of systolic blood pressure at the ankle to the systolic blood pressure in the upper arm. ABI is normal in 1.0–1.4 range, suspicious in 0.9–1 range, and obviously pathologic under 0.9. An ABI over than 1.4 is also considered as abnormal, reflecting calcified and stiffed arteries. ABI was also reported as a marker of CVD and death, but the latest US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation (Table 1) has underlined the lack of evidence supporting the ABI use to screen for LEAD and cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic adult people. The performance of ABI for LEAD screening is particularly inconsistent in people with diabetes. A comprehensive systematic review showed a variable performance: the sensitivity of ABI < 0.9 ranged from 29 to 95% (median at 63%), and its specificity varied between 58 and 97% (median 93%). The addition of ABI > 1.3 did not improve the discrimination. The measurement of ABI is also dependent on operator skills. The performance is particularly affected by the presence of peripheral diabetic neuropathy, medial arterial calcification, and incompressible arteries. In these situations, the toe brachial index may be more effective (pathological if < 0.70). The quality of studies evaluating alternative diagnostic techniques for the screening of LEAD in individuals with diabetes is poor. Otherwise, the toe pressure and the transcutaneous pressure of oxygen (TcPO2) are recommended for the diagnosis of lower limb critical ischemia (see below), and the estimation of the likelihood of wound healing or a requirement of amputation.

12. Evidence Gaps and Future Research Directions

In performing the evidence review and in developing the present guidelines, the writing committee identified the following critical evidence gaps and future directions for PAD-related research:
Basic science and translational studies to better understand the vascular biology of endovascular therapies and bypass grafting and to develop new methods for preventing restenosis after revascularization.
Determination of risk factors for progression from asymptomatic PAD to symptomatic disease, including CLI.
RCTs needed to determine the value of using the ABI to identify asymptomatic patients with PAD for therapies to reduce cardiovascular risk (eg, antiplatelet agents, statins, and other therapies).
Advancement in PAD diagnostics, such as technologies for simplified yet highly accurate measurement of the ABI and tools for more reliable noninvasive perfusion assessment in CLI.
Comparative-effectiveness studies to determine the optimal antiplatelet therapy (drug or drugs and dosage) for prevention of cardiovascular and limb-related events in patients with PAD.
Development of additional medical therapies for claudication–an area of unmet medical need with a currently limited research pipeline.
Studies to investigate the role of dietary intervention, in addition to statin therapy, to improve outcome and modify the natural history of PAD.
Additional research to identify the best community-or home-based exercise programs for patients with PAD to maximize functional status and improve QoL, as well as the role of such exercise programs before or in addition to revascularization.
Development and validation of improved clinical classification systems for PAD that incorporate symptoms, anatomic factors, and patient-specific risk factors and can be used to predict clinical outcome and optimize treatment approach. An example of a recently developed classification system is the Society for Vascular Surgery limb classification system, based on wound, ischemia, and foot infection (WIfI), which has been validated in different populations and may permit more meaningful prognosis in patients with CLI. –
Comparative- and cost-effectiveness studies of the different endovascular technologies for treatment of claudication and CLI, including drug-coated balloons and DES. Studies should include patient-centered end-points, such as functional parameters, time to wound healing, and QoL, in addition to standard patency-focused outcomes. These studies could then be incorporated into value-based clinical algorithms for approach to revascularization for claudication and CLI.
Additional studies to demonstrate the impact of multisocietal registries on clinical outcomes and appropriate use. At present, these include the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI), the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Peripheral Vascular Intervention Registry™ (PVI Registry™), and the National Radiology Data Registry for Interventional Radiology (NRDR). These registries provide an opportunity to obtain "real-world" data on surgical and endovascular procedures for PAD and to improve quality by providing feedback to participating centers. Future efforts should incorporate these registries into interventional RCTs and postmarketing studies of PAD-related devices.

Summary — Initial evaluation and imaging sequencing in CLTI prioritize noninvasive assessment and staged imaging. "All patients presenting with CLTI should have a full history and physical examination followed by noninvasive hemodynamic testing". "The authors recommend that all patients undergo limb staging by a classification system, such as WIfI, that integrates multiple key elements (eg, wound, ischemia, infection) and correlates with the risk of amputation and the likelihood of wound healing". "The next step in appropriate candidates (Section 6) is to obtain high-quality diagnostic images to guide revascularization". "Where it is available, DUS is the preferred first noninvasive imaging modality". "However, for more complete noninvasive anatomic imaging, either MRA or CTA can be considered".

### Assessing the utility of toe arm index and toe pressure in predicting wound healing in patients undergoing vascular intervention [^9c3fe056]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Objective measures of perfusion such as an ankle-brachial index (ABI) and toe pressure remain important in prognosticating wound healing. However, the use of ABI is limited in patients with incompressible vessels and toe pressure may not be comparable across patients. While a toe arm index (TAI) may be of value in this setting, its role as clinical indicator of perfusion for healing in patients with lower-extremity wounds has not been well established.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed of all vascular patients with lower-extremity wounds that underwent peripheral vascular intervention between 2014–2019. Data regarding patient demographics, comorbidities, TAI, ABI, toe pressures, and the wound, ischemia, and foot infection (WIfI) score were collected. Associations between patient variables and wound healing at various time points were evaluated.

Results

A total of 173 patients (67.7 ± 10.9 years; 71.1% male) were identified with lower-extremity wounds. Most patients underwent endovascular intervention (77.5%). Patients were followed for a median of 416 (IQR 129–900) days. Mean postoperative TAI was 0.35 ± 0.19 and mean WIfI score was 2.60 ± 1.17. Nine percent (15) of patients healed within 1 month, 44.8% (69) healed within 6 months, and 65.5% (97) healed within 1 year of revascularization without need for major amputation. Those that healed within 1 year without any major amputation did not differ from those that did not heal based on age, gender, race, comorbidities, periprocedural medications, or procedures performed. However, patients that healed without major amputation had a higher postoperative TAI (0.38 vs. 0.30, P = 0.02), higher toe pressure (53 vs. 40 mm Hg, P = 0.004), and lower WIfI score (2.26 vs. 3.12, P < 0.001). Patients that healed with 1 year without requiring any amputation had similar associations with postoperative TAI, toe pressure, and WIfI. Additionally, they were more likely to be White (P = 0.019) and have an open surgical procedure (P < 0.001) and less likely to have chronic kidney disease (P = 0.001) or diabetes (P = 0.008). A Youden index was calculated and identified a TAI value of 0.30 that optimized sensitivity and specificity for wound healing. The area under the curve for TAI as a predictor of wound healing was 0.62.

Conclusions

Higher postoperative TAI is associated with higher odds of wound healing without need for major amputation. Toe arm index is therefore a useful tool to identify patients with adequate arterial perfusion to heal lower-extremity wounds. However, the area under the curve is poor for TAI when used as a sole predictor of wound healing potential suggesting that TAI should be one of multiple factors to considered when prognosticating wound healing potential.

### Performance of prognostic markers in the prediction of wound healing or amputation among patients with foot ulcers in diabetes: a systematic review [^06899ac9]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical outcomes of patients with diabetes, foot ulceration, and peripheral artery disease (PAD) are difficult to predict. The prediction of important clinical outcomes, such as wound healing and major amputation, would be a valuable tool to help guide management and target interventions for limb salvage. Despite the existence of a number of classification tools, no consensus exists as to the most useful bedside tests with which to predict outcome. We here present an updated systematic review from the International Working Group of the Diabetic Foot, comprising 15 studies published between 1980 and 2018 describing almost 6800 patients with diabetes and foot ulceration. Clinical examination findings as well as six non-invasive bedside tests were evaluated for their ability to predict wound healing and amputation. The most useful tests to inform on the probability of healing were skin perfusion pressure ≥ 40mmHg, toe pressure ≥ 30mmHg, or TcPO 2 ≥ 25mmHg. With these thresholds, all of these tests increased the probability of healing by greater than 25% in at least one study. To predict major amputation, the most useful tests were ankle pressure < 50mmHg, ABI < 0.5, toe pressure < 30mmHg, and TcPO 2 < 25mmHg, which increased the probability of major amputation by greater than 25%. These indicative values may be used as a guide when deciding which patients are at highest risk for poor outcomes and should therefore be evaluated for revascularization at an early stage. However, this should always be considered within the wider context of important co-existing factors such as infection, wound characteristics, and other comorbidities.

### Global vascular guidelines on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^5c516fab]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Hemodynamic criteria for limb-threatening ischemia — Although previous guidelines have suggested a range of AP and toe pressure (TP) thresholds for defining limb-threatening ischemia, such thresholds must be used with great caution and considered in the clinical context because of multiple confounding factors and the lack of a clear and reliable relationship to outcomes. Patients with limb-threatening ischemia should be defined primarily in terms of their clinical presentation, supplemented by physiologic studies that demonstrate a degree of ischemia sufficient to cause pain, to impair wound healing, and to increase amputation risk, and individuals with very severe PAD who are at increased risk for development of CLTI in the foreseeable future should be monitored closely for clinical disease progression.

### Venous leg ulcers: a review of published assessment and treatment algorithms [^8c5d6807]. Advances in Wound Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Alavi et al. published in 2016 a Continuing Medical Education (CME) document in two parts on the evaluationand treatmentof VLUs and presented an algorithm for evaluation and initial management, which considers the possible presence of diabetes in addition to vascular disease, and complements the ABPI measurement with the toe pressure measurement. The reason for this is that ABPI may be unreliable in patients with arterial calcification and advanced atherosclerosis caused by diabetes, and a direct toe systolic pressure (or toe brachial index, TBI) is more reliable because the digital arteries are rarely heavily calcified. The TBI was shown to be more reliable in patients with noncompressible arteries, medial artery calcinosis, and/or neuropathy.

The 2020 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes from the American Diabetes Associationrecommends at least one additional test beyond ABPI in diabetic patients with a foot ulcer and peripheral arterial disease: skin perfusion pressure (≥ 40 mmHg), toe pressure (≥ 30 mmHg), or transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO 2 ≥ 25 mmHg). In these patients, urgent vascular imaging and revascularization should be considered if ankle pressure is < 50 mmHg, toe pressure < 30 mmHg, or TcPO 2 < 25 mmHg.

Gould et al. published their algorithm in 2016 37 based on a combination of society guidelines, Cochrane reviews, and over 80 primary articles with high-level evidence for an integrated approach to treating patients with venous ulcers. This one includes a statement to consider venous ablation to prevent recurrence after ulcer healing and to reassess every 6 months.

Finally, the last algorithm identified in our search came from a 2016 publicationthat translated in English the guidelines for the management of lower leg ulcers/varicose veins published in 2011 in the Japanese Journal of Dermatology by the Japanese Dermatological Association. The evidence reviewed covered the period of January 1980 to December 2008, and the objective was to "properly guide the diagnosis and treatment of lower leg ulcers/varicose veins by systematically presenting evidence-based recommendations that support clinical decisions", with dermatologists in mind since patients often consult first with this specialty. This algorithm includes varicose vein considerations in addition to lower leg ulcers; it proposes compression therapy as the most important element but also shows the selection of surgery and sclerotherapy options. Table 3 offers a summary listing the decision points proposed in the various algorithms found in the literature.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) diagnostic testing — algorithm: History and physical examination suggestive of PAD without rest pain, nonhealing wound, or gangrene proceed to ankle-brachial index (ABI) with or without segmental limb pressures and waveforms (Class I). Noncompressible arteries (ABI: > 1.40) route to toe-brachial index (TBI) measurement. Patients with normal ABI 1.00–1.4 or borderline ABI 0.91–0.99 who have exertional non–joint-related leg symptoms should undergo exercise treadmill ABI testing to evaluate for PAD, whereas abnormal ABI ≤ 0.90 can undergo Exercise ABI (Class IIa). When lifestyle-limiting claudication persists despite guideline-directed management and therapy (GDMT) with revascularization considered, options include anatomic assessment with Duplex ultrasound + computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) (Class I) or anatomic assessment with invasive angiography (Class IIa). The algorithm advises not to perform invasive or noninvasive anatomic assessments for asymptomatic patients (Class III: Harm).

### Prognostic and predictive value of ultrasound-based estimated ankle brachial pressure index at early follow-up after endovascular revascularization of chronic limb-threatening ischaemia: a prospective, single-centre, service evaluation [^2aa6812a]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI) is an advanced stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD) with lower limb rest pain, gangrene, and/or ulceration. Patients affected by CLTI are at extremely high risk of mortality and amputation. Revascularisation plays a major role in the treatment of CLTI as it can promote wound healing and improve amputation-free survival. Whereas the 'success' of revascularisation appears inherently critical to achieve optimal outcomes, it is often challenging to quantify, for both clinicians and patients.

The ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) is the first-line test to diagnose PAD and assess the severity. However, it has not been adopted widely in healthcare systems. In high risk patient groups such as diabetes and renal failure, media sclerosis may result in both false positive and false negative results- missing up to 39% of PAD in patients (sensitivity 61%). Furthermore, ABPI measurement is time-consuming, uncomfortable for patients, and heavily operator-dependent. In patients with diagnosed PAD and in particular CLTI having undergone revascularisations, non-invasive testing with ABPI is a recommended part of surveillance programs to provide an objective assessment of the success of PAD interventions, detect restenosis and monitor disease progression. There are no published studies that have directly assessed the value of post-procedural ABPI measurements in this context, i.e. directly demonstrated whether post-angioplasty ABPI can predict the clinical outcome and the optimal value to prevent adverse outcomes. Due to the lack of evidence, recommendations for ABPI measurement and surveillance after endovascular revascularisations in clinical guidelines are un-graded and classified as 'good practice statements'.

We have recently demonstrated that ABPI can be estimated more accurately than standard compression ABPI with ultrasound, based on the acceleration index in the arteries at the ankle (eABPI). The performance was excellent, achieving a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) ≥ 0.98, sensitivity of 97% and specificity 96–100% (using an eABPI cut-off of ≤ 0.9). This included patients with CLTI, diabetes, and media sclerosis, using vascular duplex ultrasound and computed tomography angiography as imaging reference standards. Its utility in post-procedural assessment of patients has not been investigated.

Whether eABPI can provide important prognostic information in the context of surveillance after endovascular revascularisations is not clear. Here, we evaluate the prognostic value of eABPI measured during pre- and post-procedural ultrasound exams to predict the clinical outcome after endovascular revascularisations.

Conclusions

In conclusion, among maintenance hemodialysis patients, in contrast to a J-shaped association for ABI, TBI showed a robust and independent dose-response association with mortality. Moreover, TBI classified the risk of mortality in hemodialysis patients with normal/high ABI. Our results support the importance of evaluating TBI in addition to ABI in this clinical population.

Lower extremity endovascular therapy (EVT) follow-up — The optimal frequency and method for follow-up after EVT for lower extremity arterial occlusive disease have not been established, and a follow-up program should be founded on patient-based clinical outcomes, hemodynamic status, and anatomic assessment. Mounting evidence suggests that optimizing medical management of patients with peripheral arterial disease will improve bypass graft or EVT patency as well as improve mortality, and in patients with critical limb ischemia suboptimal medical therapy can increase the risk of major amputation or death by a factor of 8. Clinical assessment consists of a focused history, physical examination with evaluation of peripheral pulses, evaluation of existing wounds, inspection of arterial access sites, and ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement, and patients at higher risk for contrast-induced nephropathy — those with a preintervention serum creatinine concentration > 1.5 mg/dL or estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 and those with diabetes mellitus — should have repeated laboratory testing at the first follow-up visit.

Lower extremity PAD — chronic limb-threatening ischaemia

CLTI is an advanced form of peripheral artery disease encompassing rest pain, lower limb ulceration or gangrene. It is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and healthcare resource utilisation. The term CLTI is the preferred term over the older nomenclature critical limb ischaemia (CLI). The burden of obstructive disease in patients with CLTI often can involve multiple levels (aorto-iliac, fem-pop and tibial vessels) with complex and calcified occlusions. An active wound requires a high level of blood flow to heal adequately, so the primary goal of revascularisation is to achieve direct inline flow to the wound bed.

For patients with CLTI, the Fontaine and Rutherford classification systems have traditionally been used to stratify patients from asymptomatic to tissue loss. While they are easy to use at the bedside to classify risk of amputation, both scales are insufficient in determining optimal therapy. The Wound, Ischaemia and Foot Infection (WIFI) classification system, developed by the Society for Vascular Surgery, was designed to provide more granular data and to also function as a clinical decision-making tool.WIFI gives a composite score to predict amputation risk and determine benefit of revascularisation. Multiple other classification systems exist for diabetic foot ulcer, but WIFI appears to be the most robust and widely used system currently.

Revascularisation is the mainstay of therapy for CLTI, but it is still uncertain which patients and which anatomy benefit from an 'endovascular first' approach or 'surgical bypass first' approach. To help answer this question, BEST-CLI (best endovascular versus best surgical therapy in patients with critical limb ischemia) band BASIL-2 (bypass versus angioplasty in severe ischaemia of the leg) are two ongoing RCTs comparing endovascular revascularisation with surgical bypass in patients with CLTI. If there is significant tissue necrosis or infectious gangrene, amputation may be necessary to remove necrotic tissue. However, major amputation leads to a significant decline in functional status and is associated with dramatically reduced survival. Revascularisation should be attempted in all patients with CLI before amputation (Figure 4).

### Objective outcome measures for trials in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia across 2 decades: analysis and recommendations [^5ebfb52b]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is prevalent and associated with morbidity and mortality. The published research concerning CLTI therapeutics is evolving. The goals of this review are to: 1) summarize the endpoints that are being used in trials assessing interventions for patients with CLTI; and 2) review gaps and discrepancies in current outcome definitions. A search was conducted of the PubMed database and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify studies published between January 2000 and March 2020 that evaluated treatment options for patients with CLTI. Meta-analyses, case series, case reports, abstracts, and expert opinion were excluded. Forty-nine studies (n = 11,667) were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most trials reported clinical outcomes (mortality, 69.4%; limb events, 87.8%; target lesion revascularization, 83.7%). Mean follow-up duration was 23.7 months. In investigational device exemption trials, total follow-up and follow-up to primary outcomes were discordant (12 months vs 6 months; P = 0.0018). Hemodynamic testing was reported in 71.4%, usually ankle-brachial index. Patency was assessed in 89.8% of trials; ultrasound was used in 65.3% and invasive angiography in 85.7%, at baseline and/or during follow-up. Wound assessment was performed in 49.0% of studies, qualitative in 28.6% and quantitative in 20.4%. Finally, quality of life assessment was performed in 55% of studies. Definitions for many outcomes varied across studies. Consensus regarding which outcomes to study, uniform definitions, and optimal methods to measure some of these outcomes are yet to be established. A comprehensive effort by all stakeholders is needed to move the field of CLTI forward.

### Toe-brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease [^a6b76a6b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Role of index test(s)

Health care providers use the TBI to identify PAD in addition to other diagnostic testing methods, such as the ABI. The TBI is most frequently performed in populations in which medial arterial calcification is suspected or in the event of an elevated ABI result, or where an ABI is contra‐indicated. TSBPs are also used in combination with other vascular testing methods, such as the ABI. TSBPs are used to identify the presence of PAD, often in a more severe form, and to predict wound‐healing capacity in patients with lower extremity wounds.

Alternative test(s)

Alternative tests include the ABI, laser Doppler, skin perfusion pressure (SPP), Doppler velocity waveform analysis, pulse volume recording and transcutaneous oximetry (TCPO2). The diagnostic accuracy of alternative tests is not a subject of this review.

Rationale

Accurate diagnosis of PAD is essential to effectively manage the disease and to prevent associated morbidity and mortality. TSBP and TBI measurements are simple, inexpensive and low‐risk diagnostic tests for PAD that can be performed by a broad range of health care providers in various settings. International guidelines currently recommend the TBI for the diagnosis of PAD when medial arterial calcification is suspected (Aboyans 2018; Gerhard‐Herman 2016), or in people with diabetes as part of routine clinical assessment (Fitridge 2023).

### SensiLase studycast system: a platform for critical limb diagnostics and electronic referral program [^9d9d899e]. Advances in Wound Care (2012). Low credibility.

Problem

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and critical limb ischemia (CLI) impede lower extremity wound healing. The highest-risk patient populations have foot ulcers, ischemic disease, diabetes mellitus, and/or compromised kidney function. Optimal wound healing protocols require evaluation of both tissue and arterial perfusion. The most widely known test, ankle brachial index (ABI), has general but limited utility in foot ulcer patients. False negatives secondary to medial artery calcification are common and ABI alone is not considered predictive of wound healing. As many high-risk patients consider their medical home to be their primary care physician (PCP) not a limb preservation center (LPC), high-risk patients can be underserved secondary to inadequate awareness of the disease, limited diagnostics, and inefficient referral.

Solution

Access to clinically appropriate, tissue-diagnostic tools for high-risk populations coupled with health information transfer (HIT) between PCP and LPCs provides the opportunity to bring PAD/CLI expertise to a patient's medical home. Coordinated data management coupled with PAD/CLI protocols can promote timely and appropriate referral and subsequent intervention.

New Technology

SensiLase ® Studycast ® System provides a noninvasive diagnostic and data management system specifically designed for high-risk patients. Studycast software automates and simplifies HIT between the PC and critical limb care experts at the LPC. Data can be integrated with existing electronic medical record systems.

Indications For Use

SensiLase Studycast is indicated for perfusion assessment in patients at high risk for peripheral ischemia.

Caution

Results of SensiLase System testing should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic information in formulating therapeutic plans.

Clinical pathway

Management of risk factors following a diagnosis of PAD is used to reduce associated cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events and lower limb complications, including foot ulceration and amputation (Gerhard‐Herman 2016). Clinicians may use numerous different methods to detect PAD in practice, and current evidence suggests that what clinicians do is sometimes inconsistent with guidelines (Tehan 2015; Tehan 2019). Assessing for PAD entails taking a complete medical history, looking for signs and symptoms of PAD, pulse palpation and, if indicated, performing non‐invasive vascular diagnostic tests (Aboyans 2018; Fitridge 2023; Gerhard‐Herman 2016). Health care providers use the TBI to identify PAD in conjunction with other diagnostic testing methods, such as the ankle‐brachial index (ABI). The TBI is most frequently performed in populations in which medial arterial calcification is suspected or in the event of an elevated ABI result (Gerhard‐Herman 2016). TSBPs are also used in combination with other vascular testing methods, such as the ABI. TSBPs are used to identify the presence of PAD, often in a more severe form, and to predict wound‐healing capacity in patients with lower extremity wounds (Forsythe 2019).

Based on the results of these non‐invasive tests, patients are triaged into ongoing monitoring or referred for further intermediate testing, such as colour duplex ultrasound (CDU) and, if required, aggressive risk factor modification. Endovascular, hybrid or open surgical revascularisation techniques may be used when there is a negative impact on the quality of life or if the limb is at risk of amputation (Gerhard‐Herman 2016).

Prior test(s)

In patients suspected to have PAD, a thorough history and physical examination is recommended (Gerhard‐Herman 2016). History taking is focused on eliciting whether symptoms of claudication, impaired walking function or ischaemic rest pain are present. Physical examination consists of lower extremity pulse examination, auscultation of vascular bruits, observation of any non‐healing wounds, gangrene or other physical findings such as elevation pallor or dependent rubor. Further cursory tests may include capillary refill, changes in skin temperature and colour, hair loss or atrophy (Vriens 2018). The most commonly recommended initial bedside testing method in patients with suspected PAD is the ABI (Gerhard‐Herman 2016).

### Prognostic and predictive value of ultrasound-based estimated ankle brachial pressure index at early follow-up after endovascular revascularization of chronic limb-threatening ischaemia: a prospective, single-centre, service evaluation [^c8703597]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

As this is a single-centre observational study, further external validation studies are required to ensure generalisability of results. We have recently validated the ankle-Doppler based eABPI approachand it is now routinely used for ABPI assessment in our institutions. As standard ABPI was not measured in the current study, we cannot compare the performance of eABPI to predict clinical outcome with standard ankle compression ABPI. Although the majority of patients received eABPI measurements after endovascular procedures, some data were missing (11%). This is unlikely to have affected the results of our analyses in a major way. The patients with missing data had low eABPI at baseline, a large proportion of non-successful procedures, and overall worse outcome than patients with complete data. Furthermore, the numbers of patients with claudication (n = 20) and events in claudicants (n = 2 deaths) were too low to assess the prognostic value of eABPI after interventions in this group. Therefore, we focused the main analyses and conclusions of the current study on CLTI. The assessment of wound healing was based on electronic notes of podiatry and vascular clinic appointments. Therefore, the true timepoint of wound closure may slightly differ from the reported results. Besides ABPI, other factors like inflammation and wound size may influence the outcome in CLTI. At the time of prospective data gathering, we did not have data available on limb threat severity (e.g. WIfI score) as they were not routinely documented in the electronic patient records during the time of the study. However, we were able to retrospectively gather wound and foot infection scores. As this component of the analysis was retrospective it may carry some uncertainty. Future studies need to take this into account. Finally, the study results cannot address one of the most important questions, if (e)ABPI is superior to clinical monitoring alone. We believe that clinical monitoring may be sufficient when patients with CLTI present with clear ischaemic rest pain or present with typical claudication. However, patients with CLTI and tissue lesions are often more difficult to evaluate and the expected ischaemic tissue healing time is long, even after successful revascularisation (overall median healing time 168 days). However, failure to improve or recurrent symptoms surely require repeated assessment. Whether repeated eABPI measurements beyond the early phase after intervention - with triggered secondary procedures - are effective to improve outcome of patients, needs to be shown.

### Evaluating the prognostic performance of bedside tests used for peripheral arterial disease diagnosis in the prediction of diabetic foot ulcer healing [^4b875d4e]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic foot ulceration (DFU) is a common, costly, and challenging complication of diabetes mellitus. It is estimated that up to one in four patients with diabetes mellitus develop DFU in their lifetime. Even if healing is achieved, DFUs recur in 40% of patients within 1 year. This has huge implications as DFUs are associated with a poor quality of lifeand very high rates of mortality and major amputation, to the extent that DFUs are the leading cause of non-traumatic lower limb amputation.

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a key risk factor in the development of DFU and is also associated with delayed healing, increased risk of infection and subsequent amputation. The accurate and timely diagnosis of PAD in patients with DFU is an important aspect of the diabetic foot assessment. However, it is also necessary to evaluate the degree to which PAD may affect the chances of wound healing. This process of risk stratification can inform decisions regarding revascularization, wound management, ulcer prevention strategies, and medical therapy for optimization of cardiovascular risk, potentially facilitating new referral pathways, improvement in clinical outcomes, and substantial healthcare cost savings.

The recent Testing for Arterial Disease in Diabetes (TrEAD) study compared the diagnostic performance of bedside tests for the diagnosis of PAD in diabetes. The results demonstrated that the visual waveform assessment is the most accurateand cost-effectivediagnostic modality as compared with commonly used tests. However, the prognostic value of these tests in predicting wound healing remains unclear and has not been subject to a side-by-side comparison in the same group of patients.

This study aimed to determine the prognostic value of ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI), ankle pressure (AP), toe brachial pressure index (TBPI), toe pressure (TP), transcutaneous pressure of oxygen (TcPO 2) and ankle visual waveform assessment using point-of-care vascular ultrasound (podiatry ankle duplex scan; PAD-scan) in predicting wound healing at 12 months of follow-up.

Prognosis — ankle pressures and ankle brachial index: In a person with diabetes and a foot ulcer or gangrene, consider performing ankle pressures and ankle brachial index (ABI) measurements to assist in the assessment of likelihood of healing and amputation. Ankle pressure and ABI are weak predictors of healing. A low ankle pressure (e.g., < 50 mmHg) or ABI (e.g., < 0.5) may be associated with a greater likelihood of impaired healing and greater likelihood of major amputation.

### Prediction of wound healing after minor amputations of the diabetic foot [^a01b356a]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

To identify any significant differences in physiological test results between healing and non healing amputation sites.

Methods

A single center prospective non-experimental study design was conducted on fifty subjects living with type 2 diabetes and requiring a forefoot or toe amputation. Subjects underwent non-invasive physiological testing preoperatively. These included assessment of pedal pulses, preoperative arterial spectral waveforms at the ankle, absolute toe pressures, toe-brachial pressure index and ankle-brachial pressure index. After 6 weeks, patients were examined to assess whether the amputation site was completely healed, was healing, had developed complications, or did not heal.

Results

There was no significant difference in ABPI between the healed/healing and the non-healing groups. Mean TBI (p = 0.031) and toe pressure readings (p = 0.014) were significantly higher in the healed/healing group compared to the non healing group. A significant difference was also found in ankle spectral waveforms between the two groups (p = 0.028).

Conclusions

TBIs, toe pressures and spectral waveforms at the ankle are better predictors of likelihood of healing and non-healing after minor amputation than ABPIs. ABPI alone is a poor indicator of the likelihood of healing of minor amputations and should not be relied on to determine need for revascularization procedures before minor amputation.

### Prognostic and predictive value of ultrasound-based estimated ankle brachial pressure index at early follow-up after endovascular revascularization of chronic limb-threatening ischaemia: a prospective, single-centre, service evaluation [^67592a18]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Whereas current clinical PAD guidelines cautiously recommend that ABPI should be measured after endovascular revascularisation as part of the surveillance program during a follow-up visit together with a clinic exam, no studies to date have directly investigated the value of ABPI after endovascular revascularisation to predict the clinical outcome. We were not able to identify a single study that has evaluated the prognostic value of the (e)ABPI value achieved after angioplasty. However, the validity of our approach, based on Doppler wave form characteristics, is supported by recent work of others showing that post-procedural acceleration time in pedal or distal crural arteries can predict limb salvage and wound healing. Of note, our approach to estimate eABPI is based on an empirical non-linear relationship between acceleration index and ABPI in patients without media sclerosis. In the previous paper, we had also performed regression analyses to find the best–fit curve to estimate ABPI not only testing the acceleration index, but also evaluated peak velocity and acceleration time. We had chosen acceleration index over acceleration time and peak velocity because it was the strongest predictor of eABPI and performed better than the other characteristics. The major advantage of the mathematical transformation of acceleration index into ABPI-units and reporting as eABPI is that the units are more accessible to clinicians and can be directly integrated into current practise as an alternative or even replacement for standard ABPI as it is independent of media sclerosis. To improve dissemination and implementation of our results, the mathematical transformation of acceleration index into eABPI could be simply integrated into automatically calculated functions in the ultrasound machine's onboard software. While this is also theoretically possible with acceleration time, the accuracy to predict ABPI is likely lower based on our previous work. The advantage of the pedal acceleration time over our current ankle based eABPI approach is that it also assesses perfusion further distal below the ankleand may pick up remaining foot lesions and not only leg ischaemia potentially similar to toe brachial index.

Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) — comparison of noninvasive testing methods: AP or ABI provides data to predict wound healing and limb survival but, because of incompressible tibial arteries, may be falsely elevated or normal in patients with diabetes, renal insufficiency, or advanced age and does not provide localization of the disease; TP or TBI is useful in noncompressible tibial arteries but generally requires a hallux and does not provide localization of the disease; segmental pressures are useful in initial anatomic localization of CLTI disease but are not accurate in noncompressible tibial arteries; TcPO2 is useful to assess microcirculation and can predict wound healing but has limited accuracy in the presence of edema or infection and requires skin heating to ≥ 40°C; skin perfusion pressure is useful to assess microcirculation and wound healing potential and may be useful for monitoring efficacy of revascularization, can be measured in a shorter time compared with TcPO2, but probe size and shape may affect measurements and data validation is limited.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Peripheral artery disease key term definitions — claudication, acute limb ischemia (ALI), tissue loss, and critical limb ischemia (CLI) — are provided with explicit clinical features and time thresholds. Claudication is fatigue, discomfort, cramping, or pain of vascular origin in the lower extremity muscles induced by exercise and consistently relieved by rest within 10 min. ALI is acute (< 2 wk) severe hypoperfusion with pain, pallor, pulselessness, poikilothermia, paresthesias, and paralysis; one of these categories of ALI is assigned: I Viable with no sensory loss or muscle weakness and audible arterial and venous Doppler; II Threatened with mild-to-moderate sensory or motor loss, inaudible arterial Doppler, and audible venous Doppler only, subdivided into IIa (marginally threatened) or IIb (immediately threatened); III Irreversible with major tissue loss or permanent nerve damage inevitable, profound sensory loss and muscle weakness or paralysis, and inaudible arterial and venous Doppler. Tissue loss is classified as Minor (nonhealing ulcer, focal gangrene with diffuse pedal ischemia) or Major (extending above transmetatarsal level; functional foot no longer salvageable). CLI is characterized by chronic (> 2 wk) ischemic rest pain, nonhealing wound/ulcers, or gangrene in 1 or both legs attributable to objectively proven arterial occlusive disease; arterial disease can be proved objectively with ankle–brachial index (ABI), toe–brachial index (TBI), TcPO2, or skin perfusion pressure, and supplementary parameters such as absolute ankle and toe pressures and pulse volume recordings may also be used; a very low ABI or TBI does not necessarily mean the patient has CLI, and the term CLI implies chronicity and is to be distinguished from ALI.

Maintain long-term surveillance after surgical or catheter-based revision of a vein graft, including DUS graft scanning where available, to detect recurrent graft-threatening lesions. Consider arterial imaging after endovascular intervention for failure to improve (wound healing, rest pain) or a recurrence of symptoms to detect restenosis or progression of pre-existing disease. Consider reintervention for patients with DUS-detected restenosis lesions > 70% (PSV ratio > 3.5, PSV > 300 cm/s) if symptoms of CLTI are unresolved or on a selective basis in asymptomatic patients after catheter-based interventions.

### Toe-brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease [^15308b10]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

International guidelines recommend that people with clinical signs and symptoms of PAD, those considered clinically at risk due to co‐existing conditions including chronic kidney disease and diabetes, individuals over 50 years of age with a family history of PAD or smoking history, and individuals over 65 years have an annual assessment for PAD (Aboyans 2018; Fitridge 2023; Gerhard‐Herman 2016). This assessment involves taking a complete medical history, inspecting for clinical signs and symptoms of PAD, measuring blood pressure and palpating pulses (Aboyans 2018; Fitridge 2023; Gerhard‐Herman 2016). If features of PAD are identified, an ankle‐brachial index is recommended. However, in cases where the ankle‐brachial index is elevated beyond the normal range (i.e. > 1.4) secondary to medial arterial calcification, TSBP or the TBI is indicated (Aboyans 2018; Gerhard‐Herman 2016).

Many different health professionals utilise TSBP and the TBI in their practice, including nurses, podiatrists and physicians (Tehan 2015; Tehan 2019). TSBP and TBI can be measured using a variety of manual or automated techniques, including continuous wave Doppler, mercury strain‐gauge or photo plethysmography (Venermo 2012). The great toe or second toe can be used interchangeably to measure TSBP (Bhamidipaty 2015). Normal values for the TBI reported in the literature vary and include > 0.6, > 0.7 and > 0.75 (Hoyer 2013); there is no current evidence to determine which values are most commonly used in clinical practice. Some of the variation relates to whether the test is being used to establish the presence of PAD or predict the healing of a wound. A variety of thresholds for TSBP are reported in the literature as indicating pathology; however, these are frequently reported in the context of identifying severe PAD in the form of critical limb ischaemia or determining wound‐healing capacity (Linton 2020; Sonter 2014; Tay 2019). Inter and intra‐tester reliability of TSBP and TBI has been demonstrated to be acceptable; however, measurement error is broad (Pahlsson 2008; Romanos 2010; Sonter 2015). A diagnosis of PAD is generally based on a combination of signs and symptoms and an abnormally low result from an objective test, such as the ankle‐brachial index or TBI, or both.

IWGDF/ESVS/SVS DFU prognosis — Recommendation 6: In a person with diabetes and a foot ulcer or gangrene, consider performing ankle pressures and ankle brachial index (ABI) measurements to assist in the assessment of likelihood of healing and amputation; ankle pressure and ABI are weak predictors of healing, and a low ankle pressure (e.g., < 50 mmHg) or ABI (e.g., < 0.5) may be associated with greater likelihood of impaired healing and greater likelihood of major amputation.

### Noninvasive assessment of lower extremity hemodynamics in individuals with diabetes mellitus [^beb26a62]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The timely and accurate noninvasive assessment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a critical component of a limb preservation initiative in patients with diabetes mellitus. Noninvasive vascular studies (NIVS) can be useful in screening patients with diabetes for PAD. In patients with clinical signs or symptoms, NIVS provide crucial information on the presence, location, and severity of PAD, as well as an objective assessment of the potential for primary healing of an index wound or a surgical incision. Appropriately-selected NIVS are important in the decision-making process to determine whether and what type of intervention might be most appropriate, given the clinical circumstances. Hemodynamic monitoring is likewise very important following either an endovascular procedure or a surgical bypass. Surveillance studies, usually with a combination of physiologic testing and imaging with duplex ultrasound, accurately identify recurrent disease prior to the occurrence of thrombosis, allowing targeted reintervention. NIVS can be broadly grouped into three general categories: physiologic or hemodynamic measurements; anatomic imaging; and measurements of tissue perfusion. These types of tests and suggestions for their appropriate application in patients with diabetes are reviewed.

### Evaluating the prognostic performance of bedside tests used for peripheral arterial disease diagnosis in the prediction of diabetic foot ulcer healing [^7d96c949]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Follow-up

Follow-up was performed prospectively for 12 months by regular quarterly review of electronic health records. This method of follow-up was possible as patients with DFU are reviewed regularly, and progress is documented on standardized electronic proformas by clinical care teams. This methodology also made it possible to continue follow-up despite overlap with the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The primary clinical outcome of interest was ulcer healing. Ulcer healing was defined as complete healing with full skin epithelialization (intact skin). Healing of a minor (below the level of the ankle) or major (above the level of the ankle) amputation wound was not considered as healing in this definition. We also collected data on the occurrence of minor and major amputations, revascularization, non-fatal major adverse cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction or heart failure requiring hospital admission) and all-cause mortality.

Endpoint

The primary endpoint was sensitivity for predicting healing status at 12 months following initial recruitment. Secondary endpoints of interest were specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios. Likelihood ratios were interpreted based on their described effect on probability of disease.

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using R (V.3.3.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria;).

Intergroup statistical comparisons were performed using the χ 2 test for categorical data and t-test for continuous data. All p values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant.

For tests that generate more than one output, that is, tests that involve assessment of more than one vessel (ie, waveform assessment, ABPI and AP), the worse result was used for analysis. For each test, a 2×2 contingency table consisting of true positive, false positive, true negative and false negative values, based on concordance between the index tests and the presence of an unhealed ulcer at 12 months of follow-up, was generated. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), positive diagnostic likelihood ratio (PDLR) and negative diagnostic likelihood ratio (NDLR) were calculated for different index test cut-off values using the R package DTComPair.

Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) management emphasizes noninvasive vascular testing and comprehensive wound assessment, while recognizing limitations and the need for multidisciplinary care. Noninvasive vascular testing is essential in patients with CLTI, yet in a large cohort of more than 10,000 revascularized CLTI patients the ankle–brachial index (ABI) was normal in 24%, supporting combined clinical and objective evaluation. Wound assessment is an integral component of CLTI management, and basic tenets of wound and podiatric care are essential for endovascular specialists after revascularization. In summary, revascularization is an important component of CLTI care, but outcomes depend on timely and appropriate delivery of numerous other therapies.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) screening in diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) — organized care model under the Society for Vascular Surgery Guidelines* specifies that all lower extremity ulcers in those with diabetes will undergo screening for peripheral arterial disease by ankle brachial index, toe brachial index, or skin perfusion pressure, and positive tests will be referred to the vascular specialist for evaluation. The quality assurance target is that 90% of patients with lower extremity ulcers and diabetes will have a screening test. If the QA measure is not met, start a performance improvement plan to assess outcomes to determine impact, determine where is the breakdown in compliance, reorient staff to the CPP, Policy, and QA expectations, retrain staff on performance and documentation of screening tests, and reassess compliance in 3 months.

### Noninvasive arterial studies including transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurements with the limbs elevated or dependent to predict healing after partial foot amputation [^4aa99050]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Noninvasive arterial studies have been used to determine level of amputation. The objective of this study was to examine each component of the noninvasive arterial studies to determine optimal cut points to predict healing and to evaluate whether physiologic maneuvers could improve the utility of transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) values to predict healing of partial foot amputation.

Design

The authors conducted a retrospective, observational study of 307 patients who underwent partial foot amputation and had noninvasive arterial studies in the perioperative period.

Results

The TcPO2 values were significantly predictive of healing. Specifically, a cut point TcPO2 value of 38 mm Hg had a sensitivity and a specificity of 71% for predicting healing or failure. The optimal cut point was mostly unaffected by patient characteristics. The addition of noninvasive arterial studies recorded in a position with the limb elevated improved prediction in the subgroup with supine TcPO2 values of 38 mm Hg or lower.

Conclusions

The findings of this study validate previous reports and confirm that TcPO2 measurements are valuable to more accurately determine the correct amputation level and, in turn, obtain better outcomes. TcPO2 measurements may provide better prognostic value than do ankle-brachial indices for healing after partial foot amputation. TcPO2 measurements are useful but should not be used in isolation to make treatment decisions regarding amputation level.

### Current accepted hemodynamic criteria for critical limb ischemia do not accurately stratify patients at high risk for limb loss [^767afd6a]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) has been defined as rest pain or tissue loss in patients who have an ankle-brachial index (ABI) ≤ 0.50, ankle pressure (AP) < 70 mm Hg, or toe pressure (TP) < 50 mm Hg. Data suggesting that these patients are at high risk for limb loss without successful revascularization are limited. This study was designed to identify limb loss and mortality rates in patients who did not respond to revascularization or who were not revascularized to determine whether CLI hemodynamic criteria accurately identify patients at high risk for limb loss.

Methods

Between 2008 and 2010, all patients undergoing lower extremity arterial duplex ultrasound testing at our hospital were identified. Those with ABI < 0.50, AP < 70 mm Hg, or TP < 50 mm Hg were retrospectively reviewed to determine whether they had symptoms of rest pain, ischemic ulceration, or gangrene qualifying them for analysis in the database. Patients who underwent revascularization and subsequently had postrevascularization ABI, AP, or TP greater than the CLI criteria were removed from the cohort. Demographic factors, wound healing, amputation rates, and mortality were obtained and analyzed in relation to the initial APs and TPs. Outcomes were measured by Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis and Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

In 381 patients identified in the study, 443 limbs met CLI criteria. After revascularization, 98 limbs with ABI or TP that improved to > 0.5 and > 50 mm Hg, respectively, were removed from the study cohort. In 45 limbs, patients did not respond to initial revascularization as their ABI, AP, or TP remained within CLI criteria. These limbs remained in the patient cohort, yielding a final group of 296 patients and 345 limbs. Mean follow-up was 2 years. In the entire patient cohort, limb loss occurred in 24% at 1 year and in 31% at 3 years. Mortality was 32% at 1 year and 56% at 3 years. Amputation-free survival was 54% at 1 year and 28% at 3 years. Lower TPs were associated with a statistically higher incidence of amputation. Among those with an initial TP ≤ 10 mm Hg (n = 85), limb loss occurred in 46% at 1 year and 60% at 3 years. This limb loss was significantly greater than limb loss among those with a TP of 31 to 50 mm Hg (n = 115; 18% at 3 years; P < .001) Amputation-free survival in patients with a TP ≤ 10 mm Hg was 8% at 3 years.

Conclusions

CLI is associated with a high mortality, but not all patients with currently defined hemodynamic criteria for CLI are at high risk of limb loss. Patients with a TP between 31 and 50 mm Hg (41% of the cohort) and not receiving revascularization or not responding hemodynamically to revascularization experienced a low risk of limb loss. We recommend revising the hemodynamic criteria for CLI to better identify patients at high risk for limb loss who require intervention to improve outcomes.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^d95303c4]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Wound healing and ischemia evaluation in diabetic foot — unrecognized ischemia will also impair wound healing and must be diagnosed prior to debridement of infection or ischemic necrosis of the ulcer; when no progress or enlargement of the wound has taken place, re-examination of the vascular status of the extremity is warranted and should include arterial Doppler segmental pressures with waveforms, digital arterial pressures, or measurement of transcutaneous oxygen partial pressures (TcPO2), with vascular surgical consultation also considered for further evaluation and treatment. Other parameters critical to wound healing should also be addressed, including the need for further debridement or a change in off-loading modality; nonadherence to prescribed treatments or off-loading can be especially problematic in patients with peripheral neuropathy, additional concerns may include renal insufficiency, biochemical imbalances, chronic anemia, nutritional deficiencies, or ulceration due to nondiabetic etiologies, and biopsy of chronic, nonhealing wounds should always be considered.

Key Points for Practice
- Those with diabetes mellitus should have an annual foot evaluation using the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test to assess for peripheral neuropathy.
- A total contact cast or irremovable fixed ankle walking boot should be used for offloading in patients with plantar diabetic foot ulcers.
- Magnetic resonance imaging is recommended when more sensitive or specific imaging is needed, particularly if soft tissue abscess is suspected or the diagnosis of osteomyelitis is uncertain after standard imaging.
- Patients with diabetic foot ulcers and concomitant peripheral arterial disease should be referred to a vascular subspecialist to be assessed for revascularization. From the AFP Editors. The diabetic foot is a key area of morbidity associated with diabetes mellitus.

The Society for Vascular Surgery collaborated with the American Podiatric Medical Association and the Society for Vascular Medicine to create evidence-based guidelines to improve the care of patients with a diabetic foot. Although there is limited high-quality evidence, the guidelines use the best available evidence and consider patient preference and clinical context. The authors used the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system to rate the evidence, which identified stronger recommendations for which the benefits outweigh the risks and weaker recommendations for which the ratio of benefits to risks is dependent on the clinical scenario. Prevention of Diabetic Foot Ulcers STRONGER RECOMMENDATIONS Patients with diabetes should have an annual foot evaluation performed by a physician or clinician with training in foot care. The evaluation should include the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test to assess for peripheral neuropathy.

Patients and families should be educated about preventative foot care. Custom therapeutic footwear is recommended for high-risk patients, such as those with significant neuropathy, foot deformities, or previous amputations. Prophylactic arterial revascularization is not recommended for preventing diabetic foot ulcers. WEAKER RECOMMENDATIONS Custom therapeutic footwear is not recommended for average-risk patients. To lower the risk of diabetic foot ulcers, glycemic control should be maintained, with strategies to minimize hypoglycemia. Offloading for Patients with Diabetic Foot Ulcers STRONGER RECOMMENDATIONS A total contact cast or irremovable fixed ankle walking boot should be used for offloading in patients with plantar diabetic foot ulcers. In patients with nonplantar wounds, any modality that relieves pressure at the ulcer site can be used, such as a surgical sandal or heel relief shoe.

To prevent recurrence after a healed diabetic foot ulcer in high-risk patients, those with a history of diabetic foot ulcer, partial foot amputation, or Charcot foot, therapeutic footwear with pressure-relieving insoles is recommended. WEAKER RECOMMENDATIONS If frequent dressing changes are required, a removable cast walker can be used. Postoperative shoes and standard or customary footwear should not be used for offloading plantar ulcers. Diagnosis of Diabetic Foot Osteomyelitis STRONGER RECOMMENDATIONS If more sensitive or specific imaging is needed, particularly if soft tissue abscess is suspected or the diagnosis of osteomyelitis is uncertain after standard imaging, magnetic resonance imaging is recommended. In patients at high risk of diabetic foot osteomyelitis, the diagnosis should be confirmed using bone culture and histology findings; a sample can be taken when the bone is debrided.

### Additional prognostic value of toe-brachial index beyond ankle-brachial index in hemodialysis patients [^de017393]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

There are some other limitations in our study. First, ABI and TBI were measured during hemodialysis therapy. Hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis therapy may have affected the ABI and TBI measurements. However, the ABI and TBI are determined by the ratios of blood pressure in the ankle and toe, respectively, relative to arm blood pressure, with the blood pressures usually obtained contemporaneously. Therefore, any effect of systemic hemodynamic change on the ABI and TBI is likely to be smaller than the effect on each of brachial, ankle, and toe blood pressures. Second, the analysis is based on a single measurement of ABI and TBI which is prone to non-differential misclassification. Nonetheless, such a misclassification usually biases results towards the null. Third, the measurement of ABI and TBI was based on clinical indication, and thus the generalizability of our results should be carefully evaluated. Fourth, we did not have information on leg vascular procedures and thus cannot infer whether the interpretation of ABI and TBI should be different before and after leg revascularization. Finally, there is the possibility of residual confounding (unmeasured covariates such as parathyroid hormone and triglycerides or unknown confounding).

### Near-instant noninvasive optical imaging of tissue perfusion for vascular assessment [^e85355f1]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Noninvasive vascular tests are critical for identifying patients who may benefit from surgical revascularization, but current tests have significant limitations in people with diabetes. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI), an optical imaging method capable of measuring tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2) and tissue hemoglobin, to assess lower extremity blood supply.

Methods

Ankle-brachial index, toe-brachial index, pedal Doppler waveforms, and SFDI images were prospectively evaluated in 47 consecutive patients with and without diabetes in whom there was concern for peripheral artery disease (PAD). SFDI is a noncontact optical imaging technology that uses structured illumination to quantify subsurface (2–3 mm in depth) StO 2 and tissue hemoglobin in the dermal microcirculation (HbT 1) and macrocirculation (HbT 2) over a large field of view (15 × 20 cm) within 10 seconds.

Results

This demonstrates the ability of SFDI to capture reliable clinical measurements of perfusion in plantar aspects of the feet. SFDI StO 2 values differentiate nondiabetic patients with and without arterial disease, defined as ankle-brachial index < 0.9 (P = 0.06), but are limited in those with diabetes (P = 0.43). An elevated StO 2 and reduced HbT 1 are observed in people with diabetes compared with nondiabetic patients (P < .05). An SFDI-derived HbT 2 /HbT 1 index differentiates diabetics with PAD vs no PAD (P < .01) using toe-brachial index < 0.7 as a cutoff for PAD in diabetes.

Conclusions

SFDI is a feasible, rapid, and easy to use widefield measurement of perfusion in a clinical setting. This first-of-use study suggests that the technology has potential to evaluate lower extremity perfusion in people with and without diabetes. Further studies with increased numbers of patients and end points including wound healing will need to be designed to fully evaluate the applicability of this new technology.

### The effect of percutaneous intervention on wound healing in patients with mixed arterial venous disease [^def6de6f]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Open venous ulcers in patients with combined arterial and venous insufficiency are notoriously hard to treat. Patients with an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 0.5–0.8 have been shown to heal poorly. Because adequate compression therapy is contraindicated in patients with an ABI of < 0.7, we decided to undertake an aggressive approach of percutaneous revascularization for these patients.

Methods

A total of 27 patients with clinical and duplex scan evidence of chronic venous insufficiency, active leg ulcers, and impaired arterial perfusion (ABI: < 0.7) were treated using a protocol that required performing percutaneous revascularization before ambulatory compression therapy. The patients were followed at 2-week intervals (average) before and after revascularization. Wound measurements and time to complete closure were also recorded.

Results

The results of the patients were compared with their own previous wound healing trajectories. Additionally, their healing rate was compared with previously published rates of impaired arterial perfusion venous wound closure; 25% closure at 10 weeks, 50% at 19 weeks. At enrollment, the average ABI and wound sizes were 0.56 and 12 cm(2), respectively. On average, the wounds had remained open for 17 weeks. After the intervention, the average ABI was 0.97, average time taken to complete closure was 10 weeks, closure rate at 10 weeks was 75%, and absolute closure rate was 100%.

Conclusion

Although previous studies have shown that closure of mixed arterial venous ulcers occur without arterial intervention, attaining a near normal ABI allows for timelier wound closure. Therefore, we advocate an aggressive approach of percutaneous revascularization in this population.

### Development of a model to predict healing of chronic wounds within 12 weeks [^69d76e6d]. Advances in Wound Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Although an AUC > 0.70 represents acceptable predictive accuracy of our model, the results point to room for improvement. A logical focus would be information on wound characteristics, as our results show that they are better predictors of healing than patient characteristics. One could explore additional wound level characteristics, such as presence of biofilm, bioburden or activity patterns of metalloproteases, as those have been shown to impact wound healing.

In addition, as our results indicate that wound dimensions are an influential predictor of healing, increasing the precision with which they are measured and thus reducing random measurement error might improve predictive accuracy. At the moment, the wound care centers contributing to our data typically estimate surface area based on maximum width and length and approximate depth. Especially for larger and irregularly shaped wounds, this approach can lead to error compared to methods like three-dimensional digital imaging techniques.

Furthermore, more complete documentation of patient-level characteristics could improve predictive accuracy. Body mass index and smoking status, for example, are known predictors of wound healing but were missing in 54% and 31% in our data, respectively. Similarly, measures of metabolic control, like HbA 1c, ankle brachial index for perfusion or skin temperature for inflammation are correlated with wound healing but not yet documented routinely in our data.

Conversely, we have no evidence that increasing the complexity of the model structure will raise predictive accuracy. We tested several interaction effects with only marginal improvement in the AUC. For example, adding interaction terms for wound area × depth and wound location × classification to the final model improved the AUC by only 0.001. Thus, we have no evidence that the interrelationships between predictive variables improve model performance. This result is consistent with the observation that the classification tree model, whose predictive power relies heavily on interactions between predictor variables, had a similar AUC as the final logistic model. Similarly, the use of multi-level models that accounted for clustering of wounds by patients and patients by centers did not improve predictive power meaningfully. In addition, our results suggest that a more parsimonious prediction model using solely wound level characteristics performs comparably to our current model. We tested a logistic model with wound characteristics only, and the model achieved an AUC of 0.689.

### Global vascular guidelines on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^b3cf4158]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) history and examination — ischemic rest pain usually affects the forefoot, is frequently worse at night, and often requires opiate analgesia; if present for > 2 weeks with hemodynamic evidence of severely impaired perfusion (absolute AP < 50 mm Hg and absolute TP < 30 mm Hg), it is diagnostic of CLTI. Ischemic ulceration is frequently located on the toes and forefoot, and gangrene usually occurs on the forefoot; all patients presenting with signs or symptoms of suspected CLTI should undergo a complete vascular assessment. In addition to a carefully documented history of presenting limb complaints, record cardiovascular risk factors, drug history, and previous vascular and endovascular revascularization procedures and amputations, and note that assessment of frailty, functional status, and HRQL is also important. All patients with suspected CLTI should undergo a complete physical examination, and palpation of lower limb pulses can help determine the likely presence and distribution of arterial disease.

### EACTS / STS / AATS guidelines on temporary mechanical circulatory support in adult cardiac surgery [^e720e32e]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Peripheral veno-arterial extracorporeal life support (VA-ECLS) — extremity perfusion monitoring: Antegrade distal perfusion via a separate cannula significantly reduces limb complications and the distal cannula flow may be monitored using an additional sensor; in peripheral VA-ECLS, extremity perfusion should be repeatedly assessed using a multimodal approach (clinical examination, continuous rSO2, Doppler ultrasound, and temperature monitoring), and the establishment of institutional standardized protocols for vascular complication detection and treatment is recommended. Ankle–Brachial Index (ABI) is the ratio of systolic blood pressure in the ankles to that in the arms and during VA-ECLS can evaluate limb perfusion ipsilateral to the femoral artery cannula; interpretive thresholds are: "An ABI between 1.0 and 1.4 suggests normal perfusion; an ABI between 0.9 and 0.99 is considered borderline for PVD; an ABI < 0.9 indicates PVD", but ABI may underestimate ischaemia in non-compressible arteries and therefore should be used in combination with other tools.

### Additional prognostic value of toe-brachial index beyond ankle-brachial index in hemodialysis patients [^e0cb89e4]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Potential reasons behind the prognostic value of TBI beyond ABI warrant discussion. This may be due to the fact that TBI reflects leg ischemia better than ABI in persons with arterial calcification. Since medial arterial calcification is highly prevalent in the hemodialysis and diabetic population, TBI can be an especially useful prognostic marker in these populations. Another possibility is that, theoretically, TBI can capture arterial stenosis above and below the ankles while ABI reflects only stenosis above the ankles. Thus, TBI may more comprehensively represent overall leg ischemia compared to ABI. However, TBI has been rarely researched in a large dataset, and thus will require further investigation.

Our findings have several important clinical and research implications. Although clinical guidelines currently recommend measuring TBI only in individuals with ABI > 1.4, the independent prognostic value of ABI and TBI indicates the usefulness to simultaneously measure ABI and TBI even among those with normal ABI. The additional time to measure TBI after ABI is < 5 min, and thus it seems worth considering this approach, at least in patients on hemodialysis. As noted above, a few major clinical guidelines recommend 0.7 as the threshold of TBI. However, the evidence behind this recommendation is not necessarily robust. In this context, our results support 0.6 over 0.7 in terms of classifying the mortality risk among persons with normal/high ABI. Interestingly, our observation is consistent with a previous study reporting TBI ≤ 0.6 as a reasonable threshold to identify hemodialysis patients with PAD.

### The validity, reliability, reproducibility and extended utility of ankle to brachial pressure index in current vascular surgical practice [^6b811d3c]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the increasing sophistication of vascular surgical practice, more than three decades after its introduction to clinical practice, the ankle to brachial pressure index (ABPI) remains the cornerstone of non-invasive assessment of the patient with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

Aim

To summarise what is known about ABPI and critically appraise its validity, reliability, reproducibility and extended utility.

Methods

A MEDLINE (1966–2004) and Cochrane library search for articles relating to measurement of ABPI was undertaken; see text for further details.

Results

There is considerable disagreement as to how ABPI should be measured. Furthermore, various factors, including the type of equipment used, and the experience of the operator, can result in significant inter- and intra-observer error. As such, care must be taken when interpreting data in the literature. ABPI is valuable in the assessment of patients with atypical symptoms, venous leg ulcers and after vascular and endovascular interventions. However, absolute pressures are probably more valuable in patients with critical limb ischaemia. ABPI is also useful in subjects with asymptomatic PAD where it correlates well with, and may be used in screening studies to quantify, cardiovascular risk.

Conclusions

While its apparent simplicity can beguile the unwary, ABPI will continue to have a key role in the assessment of symptomatic PAD. ABPI is also likely to have extended utility in health screening and institution of best medical therapy in asymptomatic subjects.

Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) — exercise ABI and additional physiological testing — In patients with suspected PAD, toe pressure/toe-brachial index (TBI) with waveforms should be performed when the resting ABI is > 1.40 (noncompressible). Patients with suspected chronic symptomatic PAD (eg, exertional nonjoint-related leg symptoms) and normal or borderline resting ABI (> 0.90 and ≤ 1.40, respectively) should undergo exercise treadmill ABI testing to evaluate for PAD. In patients with PAD and an abnormal resting ABI (≤ 0.90), the exercise treadmill ABI test can be useful to objectively assess the functional status and walking performance. In patients with chronic symptomatic PAD, it is reasonable to perform segmental leg pressures with PVR and/or Doppler waveforms in addition to the resting ABI to help delineate the anatomic level of PAD. In patients with suspected chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI), it is reasonable to use toe pressure/TBI with waveforms, transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2), and/or skin perfusion pressure (SPP) in addition to ABI for assessment of arterial perfusion and to establish the diagnosis of CLTI.

### Once daily bromelain-based enzymatic debridement of venous leg ulcers versus gel vehicle (placebo) and non-surgical standard of care: a three-arm multicenter, double blinded, randomized controlled study [^c694bfb4]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Screening period

Study procedures performed during this period (6–9 days) included recording of demographics and medical history, concomitant medications, vital signs, physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, pain assessment, wound assessments and cultures, and wound photograph assessment. Additionally, arterial insufficiency was ruled out by either; measurement of ankle-brachial index (ABI), toe-brachial index (TBI), skin perfusion pressure (SPP), or transcutaneous oximetry (TCOM). During this week, the wounds were treated by non-surgical standard treatment according to the investigators' choice, and standardized compression therapy with the Coban™ 2 Two-Layer Compression System (3M, St Paul, MN, USA). Patients whose wound surface area decreased by more than 20% as assessed by the eKare inSight™ digital wound management system (eKare Inc. Fairfax, VA, USA) during this period were excluded.

Debridement period

This was a period of up to 2 weeks, where patients arrived for up to 8 daily visits, and were treated according to their randomization.

### Hemodynamic assessment before and After endovascular therapy for critical Limb ischemia and association with clinical outcomes [^ff13c939]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to determine the relationship between change in ankle-brachial index (ABI) and toe-brachial index (TBI) and outcomes following revascularization of critical limb ischemia (CLI).

Background

An increase in ABI of 0.15 after revascularization for peripheral artery disease with claudication is considered significant. However, the utility of using change in ABI or TBI to predict outcomes in patients with CLI is unproven.

Methods

This was an observational study of 218 patients with Rutherford class V or VI CLI that underwent endovascular therapy. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis determined cutpoints in post-procedure ABI and TBI, as well as change in these values for endpoints of wound healing, major adverse limb events (MALE), and repeat revascularization.

Results

After multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis adjusting for age, diabetes, glomerular filtration rate, smoking, Rutherford class, and baseline ABI or TBI, neither static post-procedure ABI nor post-procedure TBI were associated with wound healing (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.77 to 1.89; p = 0.40; HR: 1.49; 95% CI: 0.98 to 2.27; p = 0.065, respectively). However, change in ABI ≥ 0.23 was independently associated with wound healing (HR: 1.87; 95% CI: 1.12 to 3.15; p = 0.018) and less repeat revascularization (HR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.84; p = 0.015), but not MALE. Increase in TBI ≥ 0.21 was independently associated with wound healing (HR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.59; p = 0.039), and reduced MALE (HR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.77; p = 0.014), but not repeat revascularization.

Conclusions

A change in ABI and TBI from pre-procedural values provides prognostic value in determining which patients may have wound healing and reduced MALE.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of physiologic evaluation of extremity arteries [^88f316fe]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Transcutaneous oxygen pressure (tcPO2) and photoplethysmography (PPG) provide noninvasive physiologic assessment of lower-extremity perfusion, as tcPO2 "can be used to assess the delivery of oxygen to the skin in an area of questionable viability", with typical placement "on the foot, ankle, and calf, with a reference point on the chest", prepared by cleaning the skin, applying "a coupling solution such as distilled water", and securing the sensor with "an overlying occlusive adhesive dressing that prevents exposure to room air"; when used for ulcer healing, tcPO2 has had "variable sensitivity and specificity". PPG "is a technique to measure the blood volume changes in a microvascular bed", using digit probes where light sources and receptors "will measure the transmission in the tissue creating waveforms", and these "provide additional information to the perfusion of the measured tissue bed and presence of atherosclerotic disease".

### Additional prognostic value of toe-brachial index beyond ankle-brachial index in hemodialysis patients [^74cb36e8]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ankle-brachial index (ABI), the first-line diagnostic test for peripheral artery disease, can be falsely elevated when ankle arteries are incompressible, showing a J-shaped association with mortality. In this situation, toe-brachial index (TBI) is the recommended test. However, whether TBI provides additional prognostic information beyond ABI in patients on hemodialysis is unknown.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study of 247 Japanese prevalent hemodialysis patients (mean age 66.8 [SD 11.6] years), we evaluated mortality (116 deaths over a median follow-up of 5.2years) related to quartiles of ABI and TBI, as well as three categories of low ABI (≤ 0.9), normal/high ABI (> 0.9)+low TBI (≤ 0.6), and normal/high ABI+normal TBI (> 0.6) using multivariable Cox models.

Results

ABI showed a J-shaped association with mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 2.72 [95% CI, 1.52–4.88] in the lowest quartile and 1.59 [95% CI, 0.87–2.90] in the highest quartile vs. the second highest). Lower TBI showed a potentially dose-response association with mortality (e.g., adjusted hazard ratios 2.63 [95% CI, 1.36–5.12] and 2.89 [95% CI, 1.49–5.61] in the lowest two quartiles vs. the highest). When three categories by both ABI and TBI were analyzed, those with low ABI (≤ 0.9) experienced the highest risk followed by normal/high ABI (> 0.9)+low TBI (≤ 0.6). Among patients with normal/high ABI (> 0.9), the increased mortality risk in individuals with low TBI (≤ 0.6) compared to those with normal TBI (> 0.6) were significant (adjusted hazard ratio 1.84 [95% CI, 1.12–3.02]).

Conclusions

Lower TBI was independently associated with mortality in patients on hemodialysis and has the potential to classify mortality risk in patients with normal/high ABI. Our results support the importance of evaluating TBI in addition to ABI in this clinical population.

### Global vascular guidelines on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^7f84fa9f]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Global vascular guidelines — Imaging evaluation in suspected chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) directs: Measure TP and TBI in all patients with suspected CLTI and tissue loss. Consider using alternative methods for noninvasive assessment of perfusion, such as PVR, transcutaneous oximetry, or skin perfusion pressure, when ankle and toe pressures, indices, and waveforms cannot be assessed. Consider DUS imaging as the first arterial imaging modality in patients with suspected CLTI. Consider noninvasive vascular imaging modalities (DUS, CTA, MRA) when available before invasive catheter angiography in patients with suspected CLTI who are candidates for revascularization. Obtain high-quality angiographic imaging of the lower limb (with modalities and techniques to be determined by local availability of facilities and expertise). This should include the ankle and foot in all patients with suspected CLTI who are considered potential candidates for revascularization.
