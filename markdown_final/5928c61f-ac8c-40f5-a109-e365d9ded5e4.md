## Question

post exposure prophylaxis for invasive group a strep

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for invasive group A Streptococcus (iGAS) in household and other close contacts, including when PEP is indicated, which regimens to use, and how to operationalize this in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline risk of secondary iGAS among close contacts. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for PEP effectiveness and safety. Next, I will review guideline positions and reconcile differences. After that, I need to identify high-risk subgroups where PEP may be reasonable despite uncertain efficacy. Then, I will select evidence-aligned antibiotic regimens and dosing. Finally, I will outline implementation steps, special settings, and a practical decision framework, while double-checking for pitfalls like macrolide resistance and timing constraints.

> Let me first confirm the baseline risk in household contacts, because the absolute risk drives the benefit-risk calculus. Population-based surveillance from the U.S. ABCs/EIP network estimated a secondary attack rate of about 66 per 100,000 household contacts in the 30 days after exposure, which is roughly a 20-fold elevation over background incidence, though with very wide confidence intervals and rare events, so precision is limited [^112tp4tc]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude reported elsewhere; an Australian prospective study found the incidence in contacts was approximately 2000 times higher than the population background, underscoring the relative risk signal but also the heterogeneity and imprecision across settings and methods [^117Sm7VJ]. I should also note that risk appears highest in older adults, with U.S. data showing the highest 30-day risk among those aged 65 years and older, which nudges the threshold toward considering PEP in that subgroup [^116QnDap].

> Next, I should review the evidence on PEP effectiveness, and I need to be careful not to overstate benefits. A large U.S. claims-based analysis of 21,032 close contacts found no statistically significant reduction in subsequent GAS infections among those who received prophylaxis versus nonusers, with an adjusted odds ratio around 0.88 and very wide confidence intervals crossing 1, suggesting no clear benefit signal in routine community settings [^1153ystB]. Hold on, I should verify safety signals; the same study observed a threefold increase in potential adverse drug events with prophylaxis, reinforcing the need to avoid indiscriminate use [^1153ystB]. Let me consider whether any subgroup analyses changed this; the authors note that some high-risk groups might warrant PEP despite uncertain efficacy, but the aggregate data do not demonstrate benefit, which aligns with earlier expert assessments that evidence is insufficient to recommend routine chemoprophylaxis for all household contacts [^116suAyi].

> I will now examine guideline positions to ensure I am not missing a consensus. The CDC's 2002 expert panel concluded that routine screening and chemoprophylaxis for household contacts are not recommended, but clinicians may offer prophylaxis to those at increased risk of sporadic disease or mortality due to GAS, which operationalizes a risk-based approach rather than blanket prophylaxis [^111To4E8]. The UK's 2022 update explicitly recommends offering chemoprophylaxis to close contacts who are older adults (generally ≥ 75 years), pregnant at or beyond 37 weeks, postpartum, neonates, or those with current or recent varicella, reflecting a more permissive stance in defined high-risk groups [^114CVhgd]. But wait, what if guidelines conflict? Yes, they do, and that conflict reflects the paucity of randomized or quasi-experimental effectiveness data and differing risk tolerance across jurisdictions, so shared decision-making and local epidemiology matter [^116suAyi] [^113vxgSM].

> Let me think about which subgroups reasonably merit PEP despite uncertain efficacy, and I should double-check that I am aligning with epidemiology. High-risk groups repeatedly cited include older adults (especially ≥ 65–75 years), pregnant or postpartum women, neonates, persons with varicella, those with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart or lung disease, cancer, HIV, alcohol use disorder, injection drug use, high-dose corticosteroids, and settings of crowding or skin trauma, all of which increase susceptibility to invasive disease and may justify a lower threshold for prophylaxis in some guidelines and expert reviews [^114CVhgd] [^1153ystB]. Hold on, I should verify the neonatal and maternal risk signal; systematic reviews show nontrivial burdens of iGAS in pregnancy and early infancy, supporting heightened vigilance and consideration of PEP in perinatal exposures when risk is high and timing allows [^113XzMif] [^114PjDUG].

> Now, I need to select regimens with a realistic chance of eradicating carriage and a favorable safety profile, and I should confirm resistance patterns before choosing. Penicillin V 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days is a commonly used regimen, with amoxicillin as an alternative, given narrow spectrum and absence of documented penicillin-resistant GAS, though data specific to PEP efficacy are limited and extrapolated from treatment and carriage-eradication principles [^112ACtFT] [^114NsUEg]. Let me verify macrolide cautions; macrolide resistance in GAS can be substantial regionally, so macrolides should be reserved for penicillin allergy and guided by local susceptibility data, and even then, clindamycin may be preferred if susceptibility is confirmed or local resistance is high [^1168oCmq]. I initially thought a single-dose parenteral regimen might be acceptable for convenience, but wait, I should verify; there is no established single-dose PEP regimen for iGAS contacts, so multi-day oral therapy is the pragmatic standard when PEP is pursued, ideally started within 7 days of exposure to maximize potential benefit, acknowledging the evidence gap [^1153ystB] [^117VhnYC].

> Next, I should review operational steps to implement this safely. Education of all close contacts about early signs of invasive disease and when to seek urgent care is essential and consistently recommended, given the rarity but severity of secondary cases and the uncertain impact of prophylaxis [^111To4E8] [^116suAyi]. I need to ensure we document shared decision-making, especially when offering PEP off-label in the absence of proven benefit, and counsel on potential adverse effects and antimicrobial resistance risks, which were more frequent in prophylaxis users in observational data [^1153ystB]. If PEP is declined, I should confirm a plan for symptom surveillance and rapid access to care, and in outbreak or high-risk household contexts, consider culture-based approaches to identify and treat carriers, recognizing that this strategy has been described but not proven superior to risk-based prophylaxis in community settings [^111inMJY].

> I will now examine special settings where thresholds and tactics may differ. In long-term care facilities, clusters carry high mortality and carriage can be common; both targeted and mass chemoprophylaxis have been used, but control often hinges on rigorous infection control and wound care, with mixed evidence on the incremental benefit of prophylaxis alone, so any prophylaxis should be embedded in a comprehensive outbreak response [^111MVono] [^1164z4JP]. In healthcare settings, I should confirm that routine PEP is not recommended for healthcare personnel after exposures; instead, management centers on exclusion rules for infected or colonized staff epidemiologically linked to transmission and targeted chemoprophylaxis only in defined outbreak contexts, reinforcing that infection control is primary [^116DQKYV] [^113jwYSL]. For athletic teams with skin trauma and close contact, some investigations have used screening and prophylaxis selectively, but decisions should be individualized given low-quality evidence and the risk of macrolide resistance emergence [^1168oCmq].

> But wait, what about timing and the window of opportunity for PEP? I should confirm that most guidance and observational frameworks operationalize prophylaxis within about 7 days of the index case's illness onset, balancing biologic plausibility with the reality that many secondary cases occur within 30 days and that delays diminish theoretical effectiveness, even though definitive efficacy data are lacking [^1153ystB] [^117VhnYC]. Hold on, I should verify that this timing aligns with surveillance windows; yes, U.S. household surveillance commonly uses a 30-day follow-up, consistent with the observed risk period, which supports acting promptly when PEP is chosen [^112tp4tc].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I should double-check that it aligns with both evidence and guidelines. For routine household contacts at average risk, do not offer PEP; instead, provide education and ensure access to care if symptoms develop, given the low absolute risk and lack of proven benefit [^111To4E8] [^116suAyi]. For high-risk contacts as defined by age, pregnancy or postpartum status, neonatal exposure, varicella, chronic disease, or high-risk settings, consider PEP after discussing uncertain benefits, potential harms, and resistance concerns, and document shared decision-making [^114CVhgd] [^1153ystB]. In outbreak settings or closed facilities with ongoing transmission, coordinate with public health and consider broader screening and prophylaxis strategies alongside strict infection control, recognizing that evidence for prophylaxis alone is mixed and that lapses in infection control often drive persistence [^111MVono] [^1164z4JP]. Throughout, prioritize penicillin or amoxicillin when PEP is used, avoid macrolides in the absence of confirmed susceptibility, and ensure timely follow-up for adverse effects and symptom surveillance [^112ACtFT] [^1168oCmq].

> Finally, I should confirm key caveats and correct any overstatements. There is no vaccine for GAS yet, so prevention relies on infection control, risk-based prophylaxis in select groups, and early recognition of invasive disease, which underscores the importance of education in all scenarios [^111WJQKa]. I initially implied that a single-dose regimen might be acceptable based on other PEP paradigms, but I need to correct that; unlike meningococcal PEP, there is no validated single-dose iGAS regimen, so multi-day oral therapy is the current standard when prophylaxis is pursued, ideally within 7 days of exposure [^1153ystB] [^117VhnYC]. If new high-quality effectiveness data emerge, these recommendations should be revisited, but for now, individualized risk assessment and transparent counseling are essential to navigate this uncertainty [^116suAyi] [^114CVhgd].

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for invasive group A Streptococcus (iGAS) is **not routinely recommended** for all close contacts [^111To4E8] because the absolute risk of secondary iGAS is low (about 0.66–2.94 per 100,000) [^notfound] and there is no definitive evidence that PEP prevents secondary cases [^116suAyi] [^1153ystB]. PEP may be considered for **high-risk contacts** — older adults (≥ 65 years), pregnant/postpartum women, neonates, those with varicella, immunocompromise, diabetes, chronic disease, or high-risk settings (crowding, outbreaks) [^114CVhgd] [^116QnDap] — using penicillin or amoxicillin; macrolides are not first-line due to resistance [^1168oCmq]. Decisions should balance uncertain benefit against adverse effects and resistance risk, and prioritize education and surveillance for early symptoms [^116suAyi] [^1153ystB].

---

## Epidemiological risk of secondary invasive GAS infection

- **Household contacts**: The risk of secondary iGAS among household contacts is elevated but low, approximately 0.66–2.94 per 100,000 contacts [^notfound].
- **High-risk groups**: Older adults (≥ 65 years), pregnant/postpartum women, neonates, immunocompromised individuals, and those with chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease) have higher risk [^116QnDap] [^113XzMif].
- **Outbreaks**: Clusters in closed settings (e.g. long-term care facilities, hospitals) increase risk, prompting targeted interventions [^111WJQKa] [^112HrC9S].

---

## Evidence for effectiveness of PEP

Evidence for PEP effectiveness is **limited and inconclusive** [^116suAyi]; no randomized controlled trials demonstrate benefit [^notfound], and observational data show no clear reduction in secondary cases [^1153ystB]. Given this, routine PEP for all close contacts is not recommended [^111To4E8].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Organization** | **Recommendation** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| CDC (USA) | - Routine PEP not recommended <br/> - Consider for high-risk contacts | - Low absolute risk <br/> - No definitive evidence of benefit [^111XkndR] |
| UK Health Security Agency | - Routine PEP not recommended <br/> - Consider for high-risk groups (≥ 75 years, pregnant/postpartum, neonates, varicella, immunocompromise) | - Limited evidence <br/> - Balanced risk-benefit approach [^114CVhgd] |
| WHO | No specific PEP recommendations for iGAS | Insufficient evidence |

---

## Risk-benefit analysis of PEP

### Potential benefits

Potential benefits include a **theoretical reduction** in secondary iGAS among high-risk contacts and prevention of severe outcomes (e.g. necrotizing fasciitis, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome) [^117Sm7VJ].

---

### Potential risks

- **Adverse effects**: Allergic reactions, gastrointestinal disturbances, antibiotic-associated colitis [^1143USJw].
- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Increased resistance in GAS and other pathogens [^111RAdMQ].
- **Unnecessary antibiotic use**: Low absolute risk may lead to overtreatment [^114c6DWG].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens for PEP

When PEP is indicated, **preferred regimens** include:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Duration** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Penicillin V | 500 mg orally twice daily | 10 days | First-line agent |
| Amoxicillin | 500 mg orally three times daily | 10 days | Alternative to penicillin |
| Benzathine penicillin G | 1.2 million units IM single dose | Single dose | Alternative for adherence issues |
| Macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin) | Variable | 5–10 days | Use only if penicillin allergy; consider resistance [^114NsUEg] |

---

## Situations where PEP may be considered

- **High-risk contacts**: Older adults, pregnant/postpartum women, neonates, immunocompromised individuals, chronic diseases [^114CVhgd] [^1153ystB].
- **Outbreaks**: Clusters in closed settings (e.g. long-term care facilities, hospitals) [^111WJQKa] [^112VE4Lw].
- **High-risk settings**: Crowded environments, recent varicella exposure, skin trauma [^1153ystB].

---

## Situations where PEP is not recommended

Situations where PEP is not recommended include **low-risk contacts** — immunocompetent individuals without chronic diseases or recent varicella — and sporadic cases in the general community with low transmission risk [^111WJQKa] [^1153ystB].

---

## Alternative preventive measures

Alternative preventive measures include **education** on early signs of iGAS and prompt medical care [^116suAyi], strict infection control with hand hygiene and personal protective equipment [^111WJQKa], and surveillance for early symptoms in close contacts [^116suAyi].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **Routine PEP**: Not recommended for all close contacts due to low absolute risk and lack of definitive evidence [^111To4E8] [^116suAyi].
- **Selective PEP**: Consider for high-risk contacts, balancing uncertain benefits against potential harms [^114CVhgd].
- **Preferred antibiotics**: Penicillin or amoxicillin; macrolides only if penicillin allergy, with resistance considerations [^112ACtFT] [^114NsUEg].
- **Education and surveillance**: Essential for early detection and management of secondary cases [^111XkndR] [^111To4E8].

---

PEP for iGAS is **not routinely recommended** for all close contacts; it may be considered for high-risk individuals or in outbreak settings, with decisions individualized based on risk-benefit assessment, antibiotic selection, and surveillance for early symptoms.

### Prevention of invasive group A streptococcal disease among household contacts of case patients and among postpartum and postsurgical patients: recommendations from the centers for disease control and prevention [^111To4E8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hosted a workshop to formulate recommendations for the control of invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) disease among household contacts of persons with invasive GAS infections and for responding to postpartum and postsurgical invasive GAS infections. Experts reviewed data on the risk of subsequent invasive GAS infection among household contacts of case patients, the effectiveness of chemoprophylactic regimens for eradicating GAS carriage, and the epidemiology of postpartum and postsurgical GAS infection clusters. For household contacts of index patients, routine screening for and chemoprophylaxis against GAS are not recommended. Providers and public health officials may choose to offer chemoprophylaxis to household contacts who are at an increased risk of sporadic disease or mortality due to GAS. One nosocomial postpartum or postsurgical invasive GAS infection should prompt enhanced surveillance and isolate storage, whereas ≥ 2 cases caused by the same strain should prompt an epidemiological investigation that includes the culture of specimens from epidemiologically linked health care workers.

### Invasive group A streptococcal disease: should close contacts routinely receive antibiotic prophylaxis? [^116suAyi]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2005). Medium credibility.

Group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes) causes a wide range of illnesses from non-invasive disease — eg, pharyngitis — to more severe invasive infections — eg, necrotising fasciitis and toxic shock-like syndrome. There remains uncertainty about the risk of secondary cases of invasive disease occurring among close contacts of an index case and how best to manage that risk. We do not consider that currently available evidence justifies the routine administration of chemoprophylaxis to close contacts. We suggest that the appropriate response should be to routinely inform all household contacts of a patient with invasive group A streptococcal disease about the clinical manifestations of invasive disease and to seek immediate medical attention if they develop such symptoms.

### Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis for close contacts of invasive group A Streptococcus in community settings: evidence review [^114CVhgd]. The Journal of Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Revised UK guidelines for the management of contacts of invasive group A Streptococcus (iGAS) infection in community settings were published in December 2022. We present the findings of a narrative review which informed the public health recommendations around the provision of antibiotic chemoprophylaxis detailed in the updated guidelines.

Methods

We conducted a literature review of studies reporting the risk of iGAS infection associated with specific risk factors.

Results

There was strong epidemiological evidence for an increased risk of iGAS infection in contacts who are older individuals, post-partum women, neonates and individuals with chickenpox infection; evidence on the impact of influenza co-infection, injecting drug use or being homeless in increasing risk of iGAS infection was less robust.

Conclusions

The guidelines made recommendations to offer chemoprophylaxis to close contacts of iGAS cases who are aged ≥ 75 years, pregnant ≥ 37 weeks gestation, post-partum, neonates or those with a recent history of, or current chickenpox infection. Systematic data collection evaluating the use of chemoprophylaxis and other control measures is recommended.

### Choosing wisely: effectiveness and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis in close contacts of invasive group A streptococci infection [^116mLQoP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Infection by Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci [GAS]) causes a wide range of syndromes including invasive GAS (iGAS), such as bacteremia, pneumonia, necrotizing fasciitis, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. iGAS causes significant morbidity and mortality in both children and adults, with increasing incidence being reported by multiple countries across the globe. In 2005–2012, the United States had an estimated 9557 cases (3.8 cases/100 000 persons per year) with 1116 deaths (case-fatality rate, 11.7%).

Based on biological plausibility and expert opinion, public health guidelines, such as those in the United States, recommend the use of antibiotic prophylaxis among all close contacts of people with iGAS, mainly confirmed severe cases (eg, necrotizing fasciitis, meningitis, or other conditions resulting in death). However, there is a lack of evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylactics in preventing GAS in people closely exposed to someone with iGAS. Given increasing concerns about antibiotic overuse and the development of antibiotic resistance, this is a key knowledge gap that we aimed to study.

### Management of contacts of patients with severe invasive group A streptococcal infection [^111inMJY]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Conflicting recommendations regarding antibiotic prophylaxis for contacts of patients with invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) infection exist. Close contacts of patients with such severe and rapidly progressive disease often strongly appeal to the treating clinicians for antimicrobial treatment to prevent additional cases. We aimed to use an approach based on pharyngeal culture testing of contacts and targeted antibiotic prophylaxis.

Methods

A large throat swab survey including 105 contacts was undertaken after a fulminant and fatal case of GAS necrotizing fasciitis. GAS strains were characterized by emm typing and antimicrobial susceptibility to 7 antibiotics. The presence of 30 virulence determinants was determined by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing.

Results

The GAS isolate recovered from the index patient was an M1T1 GAS clone susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested. The same clone was present in the throat of 36% of close contacts who had exposure to the index patient (family households and classroom contacts) for > 24 hours/week, whereas the strain was present in only 2% of the other contacts.

Conclusions

Although the study does not allow firm conclusions to be drawn as to whether antibiotic prophylaxis is effective, we describe a practical approach, including an educational campaign and targeted antibiotic treatment to close contacts who have been exposed to an index patient for > 24 hours/week before the initial disease onset.

### Modalities of group A streptococcal prevention and treatment and their economic justification [^111jqS6w]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Supporting decision makers with clear, economic justification for strategies to prevent the burden of Strap A infection is hindered by a range of issues. First, almost half of the economic evaluations did not state the perspective of the analysis. The analysis perspective defines the key decision maker, or payer, that the evaluation is aimed at, the related costs and consequences included in the analysis, and other factors. Analyses from a healthcare sector perspective would include all costs and consequences relevant to, for example, a health minister when allocating public funding to health technologies and services, while a societal perspective would include a broader range of costs and consequences relevant to, for example, a finance ministerwho considers broader health, economic, and social outcomes. Because of ill-defined perspective, and possibly differences in treatment guidelines between regions, the resources required to implement interventions and manage disease varied across studies. Second, the impact of post infectious sequala on quality-of-life within a health economic framework (e.g. QALY weights) have never been measured or validated. This is particularly important for ARF or RHD as diagnosis of these condition implies up to a decade of prophylaxis, which is recognised to be painful and have significant administrative burdens. Third, evaluations focused on primary prevention of ARF alone did not include the benefit of reducing duration of acute illness through appropriate antibiotic treatment. Given the frequency of sore throat compared to ARF, reducing duration of illness may be an important factor in the economic case for primary prevention. Forth, many evaluations considered population-level interventions and, therefore, missed the differential impacts on groups with variable risks within those populations. Indigenous and other minority groups that are marginalised in several high-income countries have high rates of severe invasive infections and ARF and RHD. These groups can have diagnostic and treatment strategies that differ to the rest of the population, and economic evaluations should be conducted separately for these risk-based strategies.

### Risk for severe group A streptococcal disease among patients' household contacts [^115Vfg8v]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

The working group concluded that a single study with four case-pairs was inadequate for establishing national recommendations for chemoprophylaxis for subsequent invasive GAS illness and emphasized the need for additional data on the risk of subsequent GAS disease among household contacts. We conducted surveillance to quantify the subsequent attack rates for both confirmed invasive GAS disease and severe GAS-compatible disease with no known etiology among household contacts in four geographic areas in the United States.

### Risk for severe group A streptococcal disease among patients' household contacts [^111XkndR]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

This study provides important information for healthcare practitioners and public health personnel to help guide their responses to invasive GAS cases. The results of this study and the Canadian study, the potential impact of chemoprophylaxis, data on possible effectiveness of chemoprophylactic regimens, and the overall epidemiology of invasive GAS infections were recently reviewed by the Prevention of Invasive Group A Streptococcal Infections Working Group. The group concluded that although the risk for subsequent invasive GAS disease in household contacts is higher than the risk among the general population, routine administration of chemoprophylaxis to all household contacts of persons with invasive disease is not recommended given the infrequency of these infections and the lack of a known effective chemoprophylactic regimen. Clinicians and public health professionals should inform household members of persons with invasive GAS infections about the early clinical manifestations of pharyngeal and invasive GAS disease.

### Management of invasive group A streptococcal infections [^112NXKoo]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) disease in children includes deep soft tissue infection, bacteraemia, bacteraemic pneumonia, meningitis and osteomyelitis. The expression of toxins and super antigens by GAS can complicate infection by triggering an overwhelming systemic inflammatory response, referred to as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). The onset and progression of GAS disease can be rapid, and the associated mortality high. Prompt antibiotics therapy and early surgical debridement of infected tissue are essential. Adjunctive therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin and hyperbaric therapy may improve outcomes in severe disease. Nosocomial outbreaks and secondary cases in close personal contacts are not uncommon; infection control measures and consideration of prophylactic antibiotics to those at high risk are important aspects of disease control. To reduce a substantial part of the global burden of GAS disease, an affordable GAS vaccine with efficacy against a broad number of strains is needed.

### Are invasive group A streptococcal infections preventable by antibiotic therapy? a collaborative retrospective study [^112ubg5T]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The great majority of patients did not have a missed opportunity for antibiotic treatment preceding their iGAS disease. Therefore, based on our study and considering all limitations, withholding antibiotic treatment for suspected local GAS infections does not seem to be a risk factor for consecutive invasive GAS disease. The invasive GAS disease appears to be an independent event rather than following the preceding local GAS disease. Therefore, wisely chosen outpatient antibiotic treatment of suspected or proven noninvasive GAS disease in children remains justified and should be reinforced by current recommendations even in time periods of surging iGAS infections.

### Group B streptococcal disease: from trials and tribulations to triumph and trepidation [^111fyAac]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Group B streptococci garnered attention during the 1970s when they surpassed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus to become the principal causes of sepsis in early infancy. During the 1980s, several clinical trials demonstrated that administration of antimicrobial agents during labor could interrupt vertical transmission and prevent invasive disease in the first week of life (i.e., early-onset disease). However, prophylaxis was not widely used during the next 10 years. On the basis of efforts by clinician-researchers, professional organizations, community-based parent advocacy groups, and the public health community, consensus recommendations for group B streptococcal prophylaxis were finally issued in 1996. By the end of 1999, the incidence of early-onset disease in selected counties within the United States had decreased by 70%, and the gap between black and white persons with disease narrowed by 75%. This recent triumph leaves the professional community treading lightly, alert to the need to monitor for unintended consequences that may threaten recent progress.

### WHO guidelines on meningitis diagnosis, treatment and care [^117XZMVc]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for acute bacterial meningitis, more specifically with respect to post-exposure prophylaxis, WHO 2025 guidelines recommend to administer single-dose parenteral ceftriaxone or oral ciprofloxacin for antibiotic prophylaxis to close contacts of clinically suspected cases of meningococcal disease during large-scale epidemics, in accordance with known antimicrobial susceptibility patterns.

### Choosing wisely: effectiveness and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis in close contacts of invasive group A streptococci infection [^1153ystB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1 summarizes baseline characteristics of close contacts (n = 21 032) of index cases (n = 17 078). Crude GAS infection rates per 1000 person-years were similar in those who used antibiotics (13.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.9–93.7; n = 1/935) versus non-users (14.8, 95% CI: 9.9–22.1; n = 24/20 097). In multivariate logistic regression (adjusted for sex, age, comorbidity, steroid use, and recent infection), we did not observe a clear difference in GAS infection among those who used antibiotics as prophylaxis compared to those non-users (odds ratio of 0.88, 95% CI:.12–6.51). On the other hand, we observed a 3-fold increase in potential unintended harm. The incidence of potential adverse drug events was 39.6/100 person-years (95% CI: 27.7–56.6) in those receiving antibiotic prophylaxis and 10.6/100 person-years (95% CI: 9.1–12.3) in those not receiving prophylaxis (Supplementary Material — Table 2).

Table 1.
Baseline Characteristics of Close Contacts of Index Cases of iGAS

A systematic review showed that there is still scant evidence to confidently confirm the benefit-risk of antibiotics use in preventing subsequent GAS. Antibiotic prophylaxis may be warranted in some high-risk groups, such as older adults (≥ 65), during pregnancy, and those with cancer, chronic lung disease, diabetes, heart disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, skin trauma, varicella infection, alcohol use disorder, injection drug use, or using high-dose steroids. However, the relatively high rate of subsequent infections in family members seen in our data suggests the importance of education and maintenance of heightened suspicion for family member infections after the diagnosis of the index case. In addition to avoiding adverse drug effects and cost savings, avoiding the use of antibiotics when unnecessary may help slow the emergence of resistant GAS strains, an increasing concern. For all of these reasons, tailoring guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis in close contacts of GAS infections may be beneficial.

### Risk for severe group A streptococcal disease among patients' household contacts [^114c6DWG]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

From January 1997 to April 1999, we determined attack rates for cases of invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) disease in household contacts of index patients using data from Active Bacterial Core Surveillance sites. Of 680 eligible index-patient households, 525 (77.2%) were enrolled in surveillance. Of 1,514 household contacts surveyed, 127 (8.4%) sought medical care, 24 (1.6%) required hospital care, and none died during the 30-day reference period. One confirmed GAS case in a household contact was reported (attack rate, 66.1/100,000 household contacts). One household contact had severe GAS-compatible illness without confirmed etiology. Our study suggests that subsequent cases of invasive GAS disease can occur, albeit rarely. The risk estimate from this study is important for developing recommendations on the use of chemoprophylaxis for household contacts of persons with invasive GAS disease.

### Risk factors for severe pediatric invasive group A streptococcal disease [^115s9K5U]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This cohort study found that a marked increase in pediatric iGAS cases occurred in the Netherlands in the post–COVID-19 pandemic period, similar to reports from several other European countries, Australia, and the US. This followed a very large decline in iGAS cases during the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting the hypothesis that nonpharmaceutical interventions aimed at limiting transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also reduced GAS transmission. Perhaps the lack of exposure to GAS during the COVID-19 pandemic prevented the development of GAS-specific immunity in children (ie, immunity debt). Additionally, the post–COVID-19 pandemic resurgence of viral infections may have increased susceptibility to secondary GAS infections. These factors may, at least partially, explain the international post–COVID-19 pandemic surge. It remains unclear whether these factors contribute to the increased severity because severity varied by country. Risk factors for severe iGAS and differences between pre–COVID-19 and post–COVID-19 pandemic iGAS cases remain poorly understood.

### Risk for severe group A streptococcal disease among patients' household contacts [^111GwVWR]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Group A streptococcus (GAS) causes a wide range of illnesses from noninvasive disease such as pharyngitis and pyoderma to more severe invasive infections (e.g. bacteremia, pneumonia, and puerperal sepsis). In the 1980s, invasive GAS infections received increasing attention from the medical community and the public because of necrotizing fasciitis (NF) and the emergence of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). Based on results of the Active Bacterial Core Surveillance (ABCs)/Emerging Infections Program network, a population-based surveillance system, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that, in 1999, the annual invasive GAS incidence was 3.5 cases per 100,000 population, yielding approximately 9,400 cases and 1,200 deaths in the United States each year.

The severity of GAS disease, coupled with a number of case clusters reported in communities and families and several anecdotal reports of subsequent cases of invasive GAS infection in close contacts, causes concerns about the spread of disease among close contacts and questions about whether chemoprophylaxis to prevent illness in close contacts is warranted. Using data from active surveillance in Ontario, Canada, where the baseline rate of sporadic invasive GAS disease was 2.4 per 100,000 population (pers. comm.), investigators estimated that the attack rate of disease among household contacts of patients with invasive GAS disease was higher than the rate of invasive disease among the general population (294.1/ 100,000 population).

In October 1995, the Working Group on Prevention of Invasive GAS Infections, composed of streptococcal experts from a variety of clinical and public health organizations, CDC, and various academic institutions, held a meeting to examine existing data and to determine if these data were sufficient to recommend widespread use of chemoprophylaxis to prevent subsequent invasive GAS disease among close contacts of index patients. Four specific criteria were used: severity of disease, virulence of the strain (,–), increased risk for subsequent disease, and availability of an effective chemoprophylaxis regimen. Both the severity of invasive GAS disease and the virulence of GAS strains had been well documented. However, at that time, limited data existed regarding the risk for subsequent GAS disease among household contacts and an optimal regimen for chemoprophylaxis.

### Prevention of viridans group streptococcal infective endocarditis: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112wDTSh]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2007, the American Heart Association published updated evidence-based guidelines on the recommended use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent viridans group streptococcal (VGS) infective endocarditis (IE) in cardiac patients undergoing invasive procedures. The 2007 guidelines significantly scaled back the underlying conditions for which antibiotic prophylaxis was recommended, leaving only 4 categories thought to confer the highest risk of adverse outcome. The purpose of this update is to examine interval evidence of the acceptance and impact of the 2007 recommendations on VGS IE and, if needed, to make revisions based on this evidence.

Methods and Results

A writing group was formed consisting of experts in prevention and treatment of infective endocarditis including members of the American Dental Association, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, in addition to the American Heart Association. MEDLINE database searches were done for English language articles on compliance with the recommendations in the 2007 guidelines and the frequency of and morbidity or mortality from VGS IE after publication of the 2007 guidelines. Overall, there was good general awareness of the 2007 guidelines but variable compliance with recommendations. There was no convincing evidence that VGS IE frequency, morbidity, or mortality has increased since 2007.

Conclusions

On the basis of a review of the available evidence, there are no recommended changes to the 2007 VGS IE prevention guidelines. We continue to recommend VGS IE prophylaxis only for categories of patients at highest risk for adverse outcome while emphasizing the critical role of good oral health and regular access to dental care for all. Randomized controlled studies to determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis is effective against VGS IE are needed to further refine recommendations.

### Invasive group A streptococcal disease: risk factors for adults [^114uWqbi]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations. The statistical power of this study to detect the association between GAS infection and certain known risk factors, such as concomitant varicella infection, was limited. Because we matched subjects in terms of socioeconomic status, we were unable to examine socioeconomic variables in our analysis. This study included only people who have phones, and risk factors for invasive GAS disease may differ between people who do not have phones and those who do.

The results from this risk factor study can shape current and future strategies to prevent invasive GAS disease. Currently, these findings may help refine recommendations for prophylaxis of close contacts of persons with invasive GAS disease. Vaccines for GAS disease are being developed. Identifying those at greatest risk of invasive GAS disease is important in developing vaccination recommendations. Our data suggest that vaccination should be considered for those with history of injecting drug use, HIV infection, diabetes mellitus, cardiac disease, cancer, and use of corticosteroids. Our data also suggest that vaccination will provide benefits to those who receive the vaccine and to those with whom they live.

### Safety of Streptococcus pyogenes vaccines: anticipating and overcoming challenges for clinical trials and post-marketing monitoring [^115VWbf8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (Strep A), a human pathogen, afflict more than 800 million people each year and result in an estimated 639 000 deaths, most attributable to rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and invasive infections. Clinical manifestations vary from mucosal diseases (pharyngitis, tonsillitis, superficial skin infections) to locally invasive and systemic diseases (bacteremia, meningitis, puerperal sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome) and immune-related sequelae including acute rheumatic fever (ARF), acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and RHD. While most manifestations of S. pyogenes infection can be treated with penicillin, the lack of prevention strategies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), leads infection to progress to severe disease and death. Hence, the 71st World Health Assembly asked the World Health Organization (WHO) in May 2018 to prioritize the development of a safe and effective S. pyogenes vaccine.

Data synthesis and analysis

We compared and contrasted studies evaluating strategies aimed at similar points in the aetiological pathway between Strep A exposure and death. To do that, we broadened the traditional framework used to categorise prevention strategies for ARF and RHD to cover strategies for all diseases and sequalae caused by Strep A (Fig. 2). In our framework, categories closely but not strictly follow level of care and studies that evaluated strategies from multiple categories were summarised in the most up-stream category (e.g. studies evaluating both primary and secondary prevention strategies were summarised in the primary prevention category). Our categories were defined as follows
Primordial prevention: strategies aimed at preventing infection (e.g. hygiene measures, social distancing, and vaccination). Preventing infection prevents acute disease and down-stream outcomes and the need for related down-stream prevention and treatment strategies.
Primary prevention: strategies aiming to reduce duration or severity of illness from superficial Strep A infections and/or prevent sequalae, generally by appropriate treatment. Duration of illness can be reduced through antibiotic treatment and relieved through analgesics. Prevention of ARF and other sequelae, such as quinsy and plausibly APSGN, can be achieved by prompt antibiotic treatment of Strep A infection. Preliminary review of the literature indicated three subcategories among economic evaluations of primary prevention strategies. They were evaluations of strategies that Reduce duration or severity of illness only Reduce duration of illness and prevent sequalae (e.g. ARF, APSGN, quinsy) Prevent development of autoimmune sequalae only Like primordial prevention, primary prevention may prevent down-stream complications and the need for associated prevention and treatment strategies.
Secondary prevention: strategies to prevent infection and illness or worsening of an established condition. These strategies typically involve antibiotic prophylaxis and were summarised as those that targeted ARF and direct sequelae Other Strep A diseases
Secondary prevention for other Strep A diseases included antibiotic prophylaxis in patients at risk of recurrent cellulitis and among close contacts of people with invasive infection –. It also included tonsillectomy among people suffering frequently recurrent episodes of tonsillitis. Tertiary prevention: strategies aimed at preventing mortality among those with severe disease, such as cardiovascular complications from RHD or sepsis from invasive infection.

Revised Recommendations for Preventing Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease

Data developed through ABCs provided a basis for revising recommendations for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease. Since its emergence in the 1970s, GBS disease has been the leading invasive bacterial infection associated with illness and death among newborns in the United States. Surviving infants may have long-term developmental disabilities, such as mental retardation or hearing and vision loss. Newborns at increased risk for GBS disease are those born to women who are colonized with GBS in the genital or rectal areas. Although the use of intrapartum prophylaxis has led to a 70% decline in the incidence of GBS disease during the 1990s (Figure 2), early-onset GBS disease (in infants < 7 days old) remains a leading cause of illness and death among newborns. Guidelines issued in 1996 recommended either screening pregnant women for GBS colonization by means of prenatal cultures (screening approach) or assessing obstetric risk factors intrapartum (risk-based approach) to identify candidates for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis.

### Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for group B. streptococcus: has the time come to wait more than 4 hours? [^112C84Ve]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Despite progress in preventing infant group B streptococcal disease, group B streptococcus remains the leading cause of early-onset neonatal sepsis in the United States. Fortunately, most women who are colonized with group B streptococcus receive therapy and antibiotic prophylaxis is effective. However, the only factor associated with missed chemoprophylaxis is the short duration of time between hospital admission and delivery. Although antibiotic prophylaxis given for at least 2 hours shows some pharmacological benefit, the most effective method of preventing early-onset group B streptococcus disease is 4 hours of therapy. Intrapartum management strategies might be modified to improve the efficacy of antibiotic exposure. Obstetricians should consider strengthening the beneficial effect of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for infants exposed to group B streptococcus by providing at least 4 hours of treatment coverage.

ABCs Effect on Other Prevention-Related Policies and Practices

ABCs and a precursor surveillance system for GBS were used to define the need for guidelines for providing antimicrobial drugs to pregnant women during delivery to prevent early-onset GBS in their newborns; such guidelines were published in 1992 and 1996. Without evidence as to which strategy was better, the 1996 guidelines recommended that health care providers could use either a screening or risk-based approach to decide which women should receive prophylaxis during delivery. An ABCs-based cohort study that sampled from a population of ≈600,000 live-born infants at 8 sites demonstrated the value of screening over the risk-based approach. Specifically, universal prenatal screening of pregnant women for vaginal/rectal colonization with GBS and providing antimicrobial drugs during delivery to those who were colonized was ≈50% more effective at preventing early onset GBS than providing prophylaxis to pregnant women on the basis of certain risk factors. This finding led to issuance of new guidelines in 2002 and revised guidelines in 2010, which resulted in further reductions in disease. Since the early 1990s, ABCs has documented a > 80% decline in the incidence of early-onset GBS infection and prevention of an estimated 70,000 cases of early-onset GBS infection (Figure 3).

Guidelines for the prevention of invasive GAS infections were also informed by ABCs surveillance and special studies. An ABCs study found an increased risk for severe GAS infection among household contacts of index patients. These data, coupled with data that were collected from routine surveillance on the frequency of GAS infection in postpartum women and postsurgical patients provided the foundation for the development of CDC policy guidance in households and health care settings. ABCs surveillance data on the risk for GAS infections among long-term care facility patients also helped inform prevention and control strategies for those settings.

Although universal screening at 35–37 weeks of gestation and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis continue to be the basis of the prevention strategy, these new guidelines contain important changes for clinical practice. The Committee on Obstetric Practice endorses the new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations, and recognizes that even complete implementation of this complex strategy will not eliminate all cases of early-onset group B streptococcal disease.

### Modalities of group A streptococcal prevention and treatment and their economic justification [^115Tt6RL]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

The protracted etiological pathway from superficial Strep A infection to chronic sequelae or death present a wide range of potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention. For the prevention of ARF and RHD, interventions are generally codified into four broad categories: primordial, primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. Primordial prevention traditionally focuses on preventing infection, and therefore ARF and RHD, by reducing Strep A exposure and transmission through hygiene and social distancing. Primary prevention is treatment of superficial infection and is intended to minimize the risk of ARF. Secondary prevention is antibiotic prophylaxis intended to prevent infection and recurrent ARF in people with a history of ARF or RHD. Tertiary prevention is intended to improve duration or quality of life through medical or surgical management, such a heart valve surgery for people with severe RHD.

The technology for almost all these Strep A mitigation strategies has existed for decades. However, there is little consensus about how clinicians or policy-makers in different settings should choose between different strategies. Nor is there guidance about how to consider potentially transformative technology, such as development of a Strep A vaccine for primordial prevention. Economic modelling can support decision making on these issues by outlining the costs and benefits of different Strep A control strategies. Economic models are most useful to decision makers when they are clear about their scope, data inputs, assumptions, uncertainties, and limitations. However, clarity on these issues is more achievable for near-term clinical therapies than for long-term or large-scale public health strategies. This may lead to systematic bias if strategies that are readily evaluated are published more than strategies that are uncertain or complex. Selection and publication bias is particularly significant for Strep A because of the diversity of clinical manifestations and their variable latency (spanning weeks, months, or years), as well as the breadth of potential interventions. These factors also amplify the interactions and externalities of Strep A control strategies; for example, primary prevention may have a measurable near-term impact on morbidity but a less-certain, long-term impact on incident chronic kidney disease. Therefore, policy makers addressing Strep A need access to both economic evaluation of individual strategies and to contextual analysis of how each approach fits into broader disease control goals and opportunities.

### Choosing wisely: effectiveness and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis in close contacts of invasive group A streptococci infection [^117VhnYC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Merative™ MarketScan® Commercial and Medicare (2010–2019) claims from the United States (Supplementary Material A) were used to evaluate the effectiveness and unintended harm of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing infection in families within 30 days of an initial (index) iGAS case. We identified index iGAS infections using International Classification of Diseases Ninth and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM) diagnostic codes recorded in physician billing and hospitalization records, as well as laboratory testing (including GAS bacterial growth) in a subset of cases (Supplementary Material — Table 1). We assumed that family members enrolled under a single health plan are close contacts of the index case. We determined whether family members received antibiotic prophylaxis within 7 days of index infection, in keeping with guidelines for prophylactic use of antibiotics, defined as the dispensation of cephalosporins, macrolides, penicillin, and clindamycin in the drug claims database. To characterize antibiotic use as prophylaxis, we further required that the antibiotic was not initiated within 7 days after a diagnosis of any infection (ICD-9-CM codes 001–139 and ICD-10-CM codes A00–B99). We evaluated if antibiotic use was associated with a lower incidence of GAS infection in family members within 30 days from the index case day (effectiveness) and unintended harm was the occurrence of an adverse reaction within the same 30 days (Supplementary Material — Table 2).

### Invasive group B streptococcal infections in Finland: a population-based study [^1143USJw]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

A common concern in the risk-based prevention approach is that a large number of women would receive unnecessary antibiotics. Widespread use of antibiotics can lead to an increase in allergic reactions, emergence of resistant strains, and cases of antibiotic colitis. The use of intrapartum antibiotics in the United States has doubled from 1996 to 1999, coinciding with GBS prevention implementation. We were unable to obtain information on how widely prophylaxis is currently used in Finland because data on type, dose, and time of administration of intrapartum antibiotics are not documented in hospital databases. Unnecessary antibiotic use could be reduced by not offering GBS prophylaxis to women who are not carriers. A recent study suggested that screening may be more effective in prevention than the risk-based approach. Screening reaches a broader population, and persons who are screened are more likely to receive prophylactic antibiotics. However, wide-scale screening for GBS colonization may be difficult to implement.

The results of our study should be used to develop and implement national guidelines for prevention of perinatal GBS. Such guidelines would standardize prevention practices, rationalize the use of intrapartum antibiotics, and reduce the incidence of perinatal GBS disease. Further studies should be done to investigate the reasons for incidence increase among elderly women.

Priorities for StrepA disease surveillance

As outlined in the WHO technical road map, the most immediate priority is to progress to vaccine efficacy studies using StrepA pharyngitis and skin infections as primary endpoints, and pharyngitis is a suitable first target indication, endorsed by WHO. Vaccine effectiveness against endpoints such as ARF, RHD, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and invasive disease will require post-licensure evaluation; hence, a priority is to establish reliable ongoing surveillance mechanisms for these conditions in a range of settings, ready for when licensed vaccines become available.

The priority areas that must be addressed in order to establish quality StrepA disease surveillance includes understanding the disease pathogenesis, epidemiology and transmission dynamics, clinical trials, post-licensure studies, efforts to harmonisation protocols and data collection, antimicrobial considerations such as antibiotic use, and economic evaluation (figure 1).

Figure 1
Research priorities for surveillance sites.

Hence the most urgent priority is to progress to vaccine efficacy studies using StrepA pharyngitis and skin infections as primary endpoints and to establish reliable ongoing surveillance mechanisms for StrepA in a range of settings is a priority.

Gaps

To address the barriers identified above, several research gaps have been identified including:

Need to improve global estimates of disease burden and characterisation of StrepA epidemiology.
Need to improve the understanding of StrepA-related secondary immune mediated diseases.
Need to understand the ramifications of StrepA associated antibiotic use and the potential impacts of vaccine use on antibiotic consumption and antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
Need to build global networks to facilitate the above activities.

Opportunities

In alignment with these goals, the PPWG-VAX recognises the following opportunities:

Implement standardised surveillance protocols to promote data harmonisation between sites.
Characterise immunological surrogates/COP during clinical trials.
Develop guidance documents for the appropriate use of safety monitoring tools in vaccine trials.
Develop effectiveness and safety platforms for postimplementation surveillance.
Define appropriate clinical trial design adapted to near-term (pharyngitis) and long-term (ARF/RHD) endpoints.

### Editorial commentary: step on the GAS: are we almost there for clindamycin and intravenous immunoglobulin? [^113vxgSM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Recent outbreaks of scarlet fever, and increased maternal deaths due to invasive streptococcal disease are poignant reminders that group A Streptococcus (GAS) remains a global threat to human health. Thankfully, GAS remains susceptible to penicillin, which is usually sufficient for the majority of patients infected with GAS. However, what to do in the minority of patients who develop severe invasive GAS (iGAS), typified by streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and necrotizing fasciitis, remains an enigma. The questions facing treating physicians are what adjunctive therapy should be administered, and at what point during the course of the illness? Two particular therapies for severe iGAS infection have been debated over the last 2 decades: clindamycin and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). The other area of ambiguity is whether clinicians should provide antibiotics for close contacts of patients with iGAS. Secondary iGAS may have devastating consequences; however, there is much variation in the recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis. A study by Carapetis et al, in the current issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases, hopes to clarify these controversies. The authors admirably set out to answer 3 questions: (1) Does the addition of clindamycin to a β-lactam antibiotic improve mortality? (2) Does additional IVIG improve mortality? (3) Does the risk of secondary iGAS in close contacts justify use of prophylaxis?

### Antibiotic prophylaxis and infective endocarditis incidence following invasive dental procedures: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Hegjy]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

The association between antibiotic prophylaxis and infective endocarditis after invasive dental procedures is still unclear. Indications for antibiotic prophylaxis were restricted by guidelines beginning in 2007.

Objective

To systematically review and analyze existing evidence on the association between antibiotic prophylaxis and infective endocarditis following invasive dental procedures.

Data Sources

PubMed, Cochrane-CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, Proquest, Embase, Dentistry and Oral Sciences Source, and ClinicalTrials.gov were systematically searched from inception to May 2023.

Study Selection

Studies on the association between antibiotic prophylaxis and infective endocarditis following invasive dental procedures or time-trend analyses of infective endocarditis incidence before and after current antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Study quality was evaluated using structured tools. Data were extracted by independent observers. A pooled relative risk (RR) of developing infective endocarditis following invasive dental procedures in individuals who were receiving antibiotic prophylaxis vs those who were not was computed by random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The outcome of interest was the incidence of infective endocarditis following invasive dental procedures in relation to antibiotic prophylaxis.

Results

Of 11 217 records identified, 30 were included (1 152 345 infective endocarditis cases). Of them, 8 (including 12 substudies) were either case-control/crossover or cohort studies or self-controlled case series, while 22 were time-trend studies; all were of good quality. Eight of the 12 substudies with case-control/crossover, cohort, or self-controlled case series designs performed a formal statistical analysis; 5 supported a protective role of antibiotic prophylaxis, especially among individuals at high risk, while 3 did not. By meta-analysis, antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with a significantly lower risk of infective endocarditis after invasive dental procedures in individuals at high risk (pooled RR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.29–0.57; P for heterogeneity = .51; I², 0%). Nineteen of the 22 time-trend studies performed a formal pre-post statistical analysis; 9 found no significant changes in infective endocarditis incidence, 7 demonstrated a significant increase for the overall population or subpopulations (individuals at high and moderate risk, streptococcus-infective endocarditis, and viridans group streptococci-infective endocarditis), whereas 3 found a significant decrease for the overall population and among oral streptococcus-infective endocarditis.

Conclusions and Relevance

While results from time-trend studies were inconsistent, data from case-control/crossover, cohort, and self-controlled case series studies showed that use of antibiotic prophylaxis is associated with reduced risk of infective endocarditis following invasive dental procedures in individuals at high risk, while no association was proven for those at low/unknown risk, thereby supporting current American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology recommendations. Currently, there is insufficient data to support any benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis in individuals at moderate risk.

### Control measures for invasive group A streptococci (iGAS) outbreaks in care homes [^111MVono]. The Journal of Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The incidence of invasive group A streptococcal infections (iGAS) is increasing in Europe, with a particularly high morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Control of outbreaks in care homes is therefore important; but is unclear how best to manage these incidents. We attempted to identify which control measures are most likely to be effective.

Methods

We undertook literature searches using PubMed and Google Scholar and contacted colleagues in Health Protection Units in England for unpublished outbreaks.

Results

We identified 31 outbreaks; of which 20 had sufficient detail for further analysis. Overall carriage rates of GAS in care home residents identified in outbreak investigations were 4.7%, and in staff 3.2%. In 8 outbreaks mass antibiotic prophylaxis was offered, in 9 selective prophylaxis only and in 3 none at all. Surveillance swabbing had limited influence on decisions regarding prophylaxis. A few papers mentioned the role of environmental contamination and the risk from an affected roommate.

Conclusions

Pooling of results from these outbreaks failed to suggest any clear advantage to either a selective or mass antibiotic prophylaxis strategy in controlling spread. Systematic investigation and data collection from future outbreaks could be of benefit in informing future policy.

### Risk for severe group A streptococcal disease among patients' household contacts [^112tp4tc]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Discussion

During the 2-year study period in a population of 12.1 million, we identified one confirmed subsequent case of invasive GAS disease, resulting in an estimated risk of 66.1 per 100,000 household contacts. This attack rate represents an increased risk for disease among household contacts of index patients when compared to the annual incidence rate of sporadic invasive GAS disease in the United States (average rate 3.5/100,000 population, 1995–1999). Although the risk estimate from this study is lower than the risk previously reported from surveillance in Canada, both risk estimates have extremely wide confidence intervals.

Our study has several strengths, including the large defined population base in four geographically diverse regions in the United States that participated in laboratory-based surveillance. The methods and completeness of case ascertainment of invasive infections for the ABCs system are well established. Also, the charts of all household contacts who reported seeking medical care during the 30-day reference period were reviewed for invasive or severe GAS infections.

The baseline rate of sporadic invasive GAS disease in this U.S. study was higher than that observed in the Canadian population, while the risk for subsequent GAS disease was lower than found in the Toronto study. Given the wide confidence intervals, a comparison of the risk estimate of subsequent infections between the two studies is not warranted. Further complicating a comparison of the studies are differences in physician management and frequency of blood culturing, factors that may affect the reported rate of sporadic invasive GAS disease.

Our study was limited in the lack of information on the use of chemoprophylaxis. We did not directly ask the household contacts or the physicians about the use of prophylactic antibiotics. Thus, we were unable to consistently determine the number of household contacts who received prophylactic antibiotics specifically for the prevention of GAS disease from their physicians during the reference period. Another limitation of the study is related to the reasons why household contacts sought medical care. Although the chart abstraction form asked about chief complaints, it did not specifically ask if the contacts were asymptomatic and sought medical care simply because a family member had been ill with invasive GAS. We were therefore unable to consistently differentiate between household contacts who sought medical care for actual symptoms or illness from those who sought medical care simply because a family member had been ill from GAS.

Context

Group B streptococcus is a leading infectious cause of morbidity in newborns and causes substantial disease in elderly individuals. Guidelines for prevention of perinatal disease through intrapartum chemoprophylaxis were revised in 2002. Candidate vaccines are under development.

Objective

To describe disease trends among populations that might benefit from vaccination and among newborns during a period of evolving prevention strategies.

Design and Setting

Analysis of active, population-based surveillance in 10 states participating in the Active Bacterial Core surveillance/Emerging Infections Program Network.

Main Outcome Measures

Age- and race-specific incidence of invasive group B streptococcal disease.

Results

There were 14,573 cases of invasive group B streptococcal disease during 1999–2005, including 1348 deaths. The incidence of invasive group B streptococcal disease among infants from birth through 6 days decreased from 0.47 per 1000 live births in 1999–2001 to 0.34 per 1000 live births in 2003–2005 (P < .001), a relative reduction of 27% (95% confidence interval [CI] 16%-37%). Incidence remained stable among infants aged 7 through 89 days (mean, 0.34 per 1000 live births) and pregnant women (mean, 0.12 per 1000 live births). Among persons aged 15 through 64 years, disease incidence increased from 3.4 per 100,000 population in 1999 to 5.0 per 100,000 in 2005 (χ²(1) for trend, 57; P < .001), a relative increase of 48% (95% CI, 32%-65%). Among adults 65 years or older, incidence increased from 21.5 per 100,000 to 26.0 per 100,000 (chi2(1) for trend, 15; P < .001), a relative increase of 20% (95% CI, 8%-35%). All 4882 isolates tested were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin, and vancomycin, but 32% and 15% were resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, respectively. Serotypes Ia, Ib, II, III, and V accounted for 96% of neonatal cases and 88% of adult cases.

Conclusions

Among infants from birth through 6 days, the incidence of group B streptococcal disease was lower in 2003–2005 relative to 1999–2001. This reduction coincided with the release of revised disease prevention guidelines in 2002. However, the disease burden in adults is substantial and increased significantly during the study period.

### Invasive group A streptococcal disease in pregnant women and young children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113XzMif]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Summary

Background

The incidence of invasive disease caused by group A streptococcus (GAS) has increased in multiple countries in the past 15 years. However, despite these reports, to the best of our knowledge, no systematic reviews and combined estimates of the incidence of invasive GAS have been done in key high-risk groups. To address this, we estimated the incidence of invasive GAS disease, including death and disability outcomes, among two high-risk groups — namely, pregnant women and children younger than 5 years.

Methods

We did a systematic review and meta-analyses on invasive GAS outcomes, including incidence, case fatality risks, and neurodevelopmental impairment risk, among pregnant women, neonates (younger than 28 days), infants (younger than 1 year), and children (younger than 5 years) worldwide and by income region. We searched several databases for articles published from Jan 1, 2000, to June 3, 2020, for publications that reported invasive GAS outcomes, and we sought unpublished data from an investigator group of collaborators. We included studies with data on invasive GAS cases, defined as laboratory isolation of Streptococcus pyogenes from any normally sterile site, or isolation of S pyogenes from a non-sterile site in a patient with necrotising fasciitis or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. For inclusion in pooled incidence estimates, studies had to report a population denominator, and for inclusion in pooled estimates of case fatality risk, studies had to report aggregate data on the outcome of interest and the total number of cases included as a denominator. We excluded studies focusing on groups at very high risk (eg, only preterm infants). We assessed heterogeneity with I 2.

Findings

Of the 950 published articles and 29 unpublished datasets identified, 20 studies (seven unpublished; 3829 cases of invasive GAS) from 12 countries provided sufficient data to be included in pooled estimates of outcomes. We did not identify studies reporting invasive GAS incidence among pregnant women in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) nor any reporting neurodevelopmental impairment after invasive GAS in LMICs. In nine studies from high-income countries (HICs) that reported invasive GAS in pregnancy and the post-partum period, invasive GAS incidence was 0.12 per 1000 livebirths (95% CI 0.11 to 0.14; I² = 100%). Invasive GAS incidence was 0.04 per 1000 livebirths (0.03 to 0.05; I² = 100%; 11 studies) for neonates, 0.13 per 1000 livebirths (0.10 to 0.16; I² = 100%; ten studies) for infants, and 0.09 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 0.07 to 0.10; I² = 100%; nine studies) for children worldwide; 0.12 per 1000 livebirths (95% CI 0.00 to 0.24; I² = 100%; three studies) in neonates, 0.33 per 1000 livebirths (−0.22 to 0.88; I² = 100%; two studies) in infants, and 0.22 per 1000 person-years (0.13 to 0.31; I² = 100%; two studies) in children in LMICs; and 0.02 per 1000 livebirths (0.00 to 0.03; I² = 100%; eight studies) in neonates, 0.08 per 1000 livebirths (0.05 to 0.11; I² = 100%; eight studies) in infants, and 0.05 per 1000 person-years (0.03 to 0.06; I² = 100%; seven studies) in children for HICs. Case fatality risks were high, particularly among neonates in LMICs (61% [95% CI 33 to 89]; I² = 54%; two studies).

Interpretation

We found a substantial burden of invasive GAS among young children. In LMICs, little data were available for neonates and children and no data were available for pregnant women. Incidences of invasive GAS are likely to be underestimates, particularly in LMICs, due to low GAS surveillance. It is essential to improve available data to inform development of prevention and management strategies for invasive GAS.

### Invasive group A streptococcal infection in high school football players, New York city, 2003 [^1168oCmq]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusions

GAS infections are typically spread through contact with mucus from infected persons or with infected skin lesions. GAS infections in athletic settings could be transmitted by person-to-person contact, airborne or droplet spread, or exposure to shared-use items.

In 2002, guidelines for preventing invasive GAS among household contacts of case-patients were published. These guidelines address the management of household contacts but not of other types of close, physical contacts (e.g. athletic teams). General guidelines exist regarding preventing infectious diseases in athletic settings. However, no specific recommendations have been published regarding prevention strategies after invasive GAS cases have been identified among athletes in contact sports such as football, a setting where spread of GAS is possible because of repetitive and forceful skin-to-skin contact and resultant trauma.

Although the recommendations advise against routine screening and prophylaxis for household contacts, prophylaxis is recommended in certain situations where host factors are associated with increased risk for invasive disease. We hypothesized that teammates are at least as likely to share drinks from common sources and have close, skin-to-skin contact as are household contacts. Moreover, we believed that football teammates of our case-patients were potentially at greater risk for invasive GAS than typical household contacts because of their greater risk for skin trauma. Any resultant skin disruption could provide a portal of entry for a more virulent GAS strain from an infected teammate, potentially leading to invasive GAS disease even among otherwise healthy persons.

Because of the severity of the patients' illnesses and the theoretically increased risk for invasive GAS, we screened and provided antimicrobial prophylaxis to the varsity team during the initial investigation without awaiting final culture results. However, the 8% GAS positivity rate was consistent with published estimates of the overall background colonization rates among schoolchildren (11%–25%) in nonoutbreak settings, and lower than the secondary carrier rate among household contacts of persons with streptococcal illness. Only 1 varsity player carried the same GAS strain as his septicemic teammate. One of the unrelated strains isolated from an asymptomatic player was resistant to erythromycin. This finding emphasizes the possibility that in some situations macrolide antimicrobial agents may not be the most effective for prophylaxis. Given the absence of any additional cases of invasive GAS or increased GAS carriage rates among the varsity team, we screened the junior varsity team but treated only players with positive throat cultures.

### Familial transmission of emm12 group A Streptococcus [^116xxtQx]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Strains isolated from both patients were the same strain of S. pyogenes emm 12 (Technical Appendix Tables 1, 2). The couple were caregivers for their granddaughter, and they met their 2 adult children and son-in-law several days each week, so we evaluated these close contacts. The son and daughter had had a sore throat 9 days before onset of illness in the mother and were treated empirically by their general practitioner with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (1 g 2×/d for 6 d). We prescribed cefuroxime axetil (250 mg 2×/d for 10 d). Buccal swabs cultured remained negative.

The risk for iGAS infection in close contacts of patients was reviewed in 2016: the evidence was based on 13 instances of transmission published in 4 separate studies covering 5,858 household contacts. The annual risk among close contacts was 151 times greater than the risk for sporadic disease and comparable to that estimated for meningococcal disease. However, the benefit from antimicrobial drug prophylaxis is not known, and guidelines vary among countries. In the United Kingdom, prophylaxis is recommended for exposed mothers or babies during the neonatal period, for symptomatic close contacts, or for the entire household if there is > 1 case. In Canada, prophylaxis is recommended for persons who had close contact with a person with a confirmed severe case during a specified period; in France and the United States, prophylaxis is recommended for close contacts with risk factors for invasive infections. In the cases we report here, the second case-patient did not receive prophylaxis because of the short period between the 2 cases.

Both case-patients received NSAIDs during the onset of the disease. The role of these drugs in streptococcal infection outcome is frequently discussed; they seem to cause an increase of severe infection, most probably in children.

These cases highlight that different life-threatening transmissible types of S. pyogenes are circulating in the same area and that transmission can occur rapidly. Clinician and family education about prophylaxis and symptoms requiring medical care is needed.

### Invasive group A streptococcal disease in pregnant women and young children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114PjDUG]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Incidences of invasive GAS are likely to be underestimates, particularly in LMICs, due to low GAS surveillance. It is essential to improve available data to inform development of prevention and management strategies for invasive GAS.

Regarding preventative measures for rheumatic fever, more specifically with respect to primary prevention (chronic GAS carriers), IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend to do not attempt to identify nor administer antimicrobial therapy in patients with asymptomatic group A streptococcus carriage, as they are unlikely to spread GAS pharyngitis to their close contacts and are at little or no risk for developing suppurative or non-suppurative complications, such as ARF.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — outcomes and adverse event definitions prioritize patient-important outcomes including mortality, hospitalization, development of severe disease (e.g., need for non-invasive or invasive ventilation), clinical improvement (disease-oriented outcomes inferred by radiological findings or virologic cure), and severe adverse events leading to discontinuation; serious adverse events are death, life threatening reactions, those that require hospitalization, result in disability or permanent damage or require an intervention to prevent permanent impairment. Critical outcomes varied by population: among hospitalized patients (at any disease severity), critical outcomes included mortality, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, failure of clinical improvement, adverse events, and serious adverse events; among ambulatory populations with COVID-19 infection, hospitalization replaced duration of hospitalization; among persons receiving pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis, outcomes included measures of symptomatic COVID-19 infection.

### Postexposure prophylaxis for common infectious diseases [^113bW8z8]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is effective in preventing illness after potential or documented exposure to a variety of microbial pathogens and in reducing the risk of secondary spread of infection. Guidelines have been published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for proper use of PEP for bloodborne pathogens, for microorganisms transmitted by either airborne or droplet spread or through direct contact, and for infections acquired after traumatic injuries. Depending on the type of exposure, different forms of PEP are available, including vaccines, immune globulins, antibiotics, and antiviral medications. Physicians should assess a patient's potential need for PEP based on several factors, including the type of exposure, the timing and severity of illness in the source patient, the exposed person's susceptibility to infectious diseases of concern, and the relative risks and benefits of the PEP regimen in an individual situation. Immunity to certain infectious diseases can be ensured with prior infection or vaccination, and by serologic testing in patients with a negative or uncertain history. PEP should be given to persons exposed to index cases of pertussis and invasive meningococcal infection regardless of immunization history, and should be given following rabies and tetanus exposure regardless of the length of delay. In general, PEP should be given as soon as possible following a high-risk exposure. Persons exposed to bloodborne pathogens should have baseline testing for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus antibodies, and follow-up testing at six weeks, three months, and six months postexposure.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — post-exposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ): The panel made an explicit decision that the primary outcome driving the decision for any post-exposure prophylaxis is the ability to prevent infection; when the evidence demonstrates a very low likelihood of effective post-exposure prophylaxis, other outcomes become secondary; and when healthy persons are considered for preventive medications (such as would occur in post-exposure settings), a higher threshold for benefits is required and (even putative) harms become more important. The panel agreed that the overall certainty of the evidence against prophylaxis treatment with HCQ was moderate (failure to prevent infection) due to concerns with imprecision, and the panel balanced the lack of clear benefit with the increased risk of harms from the body of evidence reported in the treatment section, in addition to the side effects reported in the trials to make a strong recommendation. The guideline panel recommended against the use of HCQ as post-exposure prophylactic treatment for persons exposed to COVID-19.

### Community-acquired invasive GAS disease among native Americans, Arizona, USA, winter 2013 [^115Xkmmm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Past studies have shown that the risk of secondary iGAS infection among household contacts of patients with iGAS disease is higher than that among the general population but still low. Although Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines do not recommend routine chemoprophylaxis for household contacts of patients with iGAS infection, the guidelines state that providers may choose to offer antimicrobial drug prophylaxis to those household contacts at increased risk for iGAS infection. Because Native Americans have increased rates of iGAS disease, compared with those of the general population, and because households in this investigation were crowded and many contacts had predisposing underlying conditions, we recommended that household contacts receive prophylaxis if given within 30 days of the index case-patient's illness. No additional cases were reported at least 3 months after the investigation and intervention.

### Global economic burden per episode for multiple diseases caused by group A Streptococcus [^114rHpJ1]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

The diseases caused by GAS can be categorized into five disease categories: (1) superficial, (2) locally invasive, (3) invasive and toxin-mediated, (4) immune-mediated, and (5) direct sequelae of immune-mediated. There are more than 20 syndromes which fall into those categories, including pharyngitis and impetigo (superficial), tonsillitis and cellulitis (locally invasive), scarlet fever, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (toxin-mediated), puerperal sepsis, bacteremia, pneumonia, and necrotizing fasciitis (invasive), ARF and acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) (immune-mediated), and RHD and chronic kidney disease (direct sequelae of immune-mediated). Although immunology and genetics of GAS-associated diseases are complex, there is a clear sequential effect of the bacterium over the course of diseases. As an example, if seemingly benign GAS pharyngitis is not treated in a timely and proper manner, the infection can further develop into ARF, which results into heavier health and economic burden. The onset of ARF is typically 2 to 4 weeks after GAS pharyngitisand often recurs, causing heart damage. Due to the linkage identified between the GAS pharyngitis and ARF, countries concerned about preventing ARF recommend that Strep throat infections are treated with an appropriate antibiotic regimen such as the oral antibiotic regimen (Penicillin V or amoxicillin for 10 days), or intramuscular benzathine penicillin G injection as prophylaxis. Likewise, disease progression from ARF to RHD indicates progressive valvular heart disease (VHD) represented by mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation, which eventually leads to permanent heart damage and death. It was estimated that carditis progresses to chronic RHD in 60% of ARF cases.

### Uncertainties in screening and prevention of group B. streptococcus disease [^112aTyDg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

In autumn 2016, the UK Department of Health (now Department of Health and Social Care) convened 2 meetings to discuss how to address research evidence gaps in order to minimize the impact of infant group B streptococcus (GBS) disease in the United Kingdom. At that meeting, a number of research priorities were highlighted, including improving the screening for GBS colonization in pregnant women, offering intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis and point-of-care testing, and understanding the effect of widespread intrapartum antibiotic use on long-term infant health. Further discussions involved investigating the feasibility of a large prospective study of pregnant women and their infants in order to understand the role of antibodies in the protection against GBS disease in infancy following maternal exposure to GBS colonization. Here, we summarize the research uncertainties identified at that meeting.

### Duration of intrapartum prophylaxis for neonatal group B streptococcal disease: a systematic review [^115SLCdK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine published evidence regarding duration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis administered to pregnant women colonized with group B Streptococcus (GBS) to reduce infant colonization with GBS and to prevent early-onset GBS sepsis.

Data Sources

A search was conducted in The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2006), EMBASE (1980 to January 2006), CINAHL (1982 to January 2006), and in protocols and guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Academy of Pediatrics, and American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

Methods Of Study Selection

All randomized controlled trials and observational studies in which duration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is reported relative to subsequent neonatal GBS colonization or sepsis were considered. Case series and study designs using historical cohorts or controls for comparison were excluded.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Three prospective cohort studies and one case-control study met inclusion criteria. Heterogeneity of study design and assembly of cohorts precluded meta-analysis. A systematic review of the individual studies was performed. All studies were rated as fair or poor validity with regard to their ability to evaluate duration of intrapartum prophylaxis and transmission of GBS to the newborn. All 4 studies were largely composed of women with existing risk factors for GBS disease of the newborn. One study supported more than 1 hour of prophylaxis, two studies supported more than 2 hours of prophylaxis, and one was inconclusive.

Conclusion

Despite unequivocal clinical guidelines recommending at least 4 hours of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, there are no well-designed studies examining duration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of early-onset GBS disease of the newborn. We recommend continuing to initiate intrapartum prophylaxis according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines; however, the transmission of GBS to neonates exposed to less than 4 hours of intrapartum prophylaxis and their subsequent management require further study.

### Intrapartum antibiotic chemoprophylaxis policies for the prevention of group B streptococcal disease worldwide: systematic review [^115r3a5Q]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

A maternal GBS vaccine may be the ideal solution to help reduce the burden of neonatal GBS disease in all settings. Implementation of a vaccine is likely to be higher than successful administration of IAP, especially in low- and middle-income settings and will protect against at least 75% of EOGBS. However, in some high-income settings, it may be feasible to combine with IAP when vaccination might be unavailable or suboptimal.

Our study also provides important additional information on national policies through its searches outside of scientific literature. However, responses from individual clinicians may not necessarily be representative of the different levels of healthcare and of health facilities that exist within a country, and we acknowledge the limitations to this approach. In high-income contexts, countries using both microbiological and clinical risk factor–based approaches for IAP had low reported EOGBS incidence. We cannot assume causality, however, as this finding may reflect other differences in healthcare such as access to care. We were also unable to correlate reported EOGBS incidence with the introduction of IAP policy in all of these countries, as policy may have been put into place after EOGBS data were collected. The reliability of data on implementation coverage of policies are hard to verify, and we have therefore categorized them using very broad thresholds (< 50% or > 50%). This is important in terms of understanding the burden of disease; the category influences the risk of EOGBS disease at an individual level, and is thus important in terms of a compartmental approach to modeling disease burden.

In conclusion, local, national, and international policies should be informed by the strongest evidence for the prevention of EOGBS and might require tailored solutions to succeed. Future GBS vaccines may offer the best opportunity to prevent EOGBS in any setting, with better implementation than policies for IAP currently in use (Table 3).

### Epidemiology of invasive early-onset and late-onset group B streptococcal disease in the United States, 2006 to 2015: multistate laboratory and population-based surveillance [^117AvL2N]. JAMA Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Invasive disease owing to group B Streptococcus (GBS) remains an important cause of illness and death among infants younger than 90 days in the United States, despite declines in early-onset disease (EOD; with onset at 0–6 days of life) that are attributed to intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP). Maternal vaccines to prevent infant GBS disease are currently under development.

Objective

To describe incidence rates, case characteristics, antimicrobial resistance, and serotype distribution of EOD and late-onset disease (LOD; with onset at 7–89 days of life) in the United States from 2006 to 2015 to inform IAP guidelines and vaccine development.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study used active population-based and laboratory-based surveillance for invasive GBS disease conducted through Active Bacterial Core surveillance in selected counties of 10 states across the United States. Residents of Active Bacterial Core surveillance areas who were younger than 90 days and had invasive GBS disease in 2006 to 2015 were included. Data were analyzed from December 2017 to April 2018.

Exposures

Group B Streptococcus isolated from a normally sterile site.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Early-onset disease and LOD incidence rates and associated GBS serotypes and antimicrobial resistance.

Results

The Active Bacterial Core surveillance program identified 1277 cases of EOD and 1387 cases of LOD. From 2006 to 2015, EOD incidence declined significantly from 0.37 to 0.23 per 1000 live births (P < .001), and LOD rates remained stable (mean, 0.31 per 1000 live births). Among the mothers of 1277 infants with EOD, 617 (48.3%) had no indications for IAP and did not receive it, and 278 (21.8%) failed to receive IAP despite having indications. Serotype data were available for 1743 of 1897 patients (91.3%) from 7 sites that collect GBS isolates. Among patients with EOD, serotypes Ia (242 [27.3%]) and III (242 [27.3%]) were most common. Among patients with LOD, serotype III was most common (481 [56.2%]), and this increased from 2006 to 2015 from 0.12 to 0.20 cases per 1000 live births (P < .001). Serotype IV caused 53 cases (6.2%) of EOD and LOD combined. The 6 most common serotypes (Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, and V) caused 881 EOD cases (99.3%) and 853 LOD cases (99.7%). No β-lactam resistance was identified; 359 isolates (20.8%) tested showed constitutive clindamycin resistance. In 2015, an estimated 840 EOD cases and 1265 LOD cases occurred nationally.

Conclusions and Relevance

The rates of LOD among US infants are now higher than EOD rates. Combined with addressing IAP implementation gaps, an effective vaccine covering the most common serotypes might further reduce EOD rates and help prevent LOD, for which there is no current public health intervention.

### Centers for disease control and prevention expert panel meetings on prevention and treatment of anthrax in adults [^114s8CCn]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial Selection Considerations for Prevention and Treatment

The approach to prevention and treatment of anthrax differs from that for other bacterial infections. The production of toxin, potential for antimicrobial drug resistance, frequent occurrence of meningitis, and presence of latent spores must be taken into account when selecting postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) or a combination of antimicrobial drugs for treatment of anthrax. In addition, most data on which these antimicrobial drug options are based predate the availability of many of the antimicrobial drugs discussed and are drawn from limited animal studies.

Among patients with inhalation anthrax during 1900–2005, antimicrobial drug combination therapy was more likely to be curative than antimicrobial drug monotherapy. There is also a theoretical benefit for combined use of bactericidal and protein synthesis inhibitor agents. Bactericidal agents have immediate killing effect. However, the high rates of illness and death seen with anthrax are caused, in part, by B. anthracis exotoxin production. In vitro toxin production is inhibited earlier by protein synthesis inhibitors than by bactericidal agents; this characteristic is associated with clinical benefit in streptococcal toxic shock and clostridial sepsis. Combination antimicrobial drug regimens were used in all 8 survivors of inhalation anthrax during 2001–2012; five survivors were also treated with a protein synthesis inhibitor. Patients hospitalized for systemic anthrax should be immediately treated with a combination of broad-spectrum intravenous antimicrobial drug treatment pending confirmatory test results because any delay may prove fatal.

Naturally occurring B. anthracis has variable β-lactam resistance, particularly to cephalosporins. Thus, cephalosporins are contraindicated. In addition, multidrug resistance in naturally occurring B. anthracis infection has been reported and can be induced in vitro. This finding increases concern that a B. anthracis strain could be resistant to ≥ 1 recommended antimicrobial drug options or that use of β-lactams for a strain that was originally β-lactam susceptible could lead to development of β-lactam-resistance during prophylaxis, if adherence to treatment is poor, as was observed among postal workers in 2001. Another concern is that β-lactam use could induce resistance during treatment, especially with the high bacterial loads characteristic of systemic anthrax. Thus, penicillin-based antimicrobial drug use requires a high index of suspicion for emergence of resistance.

### Chorioamnionitis and culture-confirmed, early-onset neonatal infections [^112CTbN2]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines for prevention of neonatal group B streptococcal disease recommend diagnostic evaluations and empirical antibiotic therapy for well-appearing, chorioamnionitis-exposed newborns. Some clinicians question these recommendations, citing the decline in early-onset group B streptococcal disease rates since widespread intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis implementation and potential antibiotic risks. We aimed to determine whether chorioamnionitis-exposed newborns with culture-confirmed, early-onset infections can be asymptomatic at birth.

Methods

Multicenter, prospective surveillance for early-onset neonatal infections was conducted during 2006–2009. Early-onset infection was defined as isolation of a pathogen from blood or cerebrospinal fluid collected ≤ 72 hours after birth. Maternal chorioamnionitis was defined by clinical diagnosis in the medical record or by histologic diagnosis by placental pathology. Hospital records of newborns with early-onset infections born to mothers with chorioamnionitis were reviewed retrospectively to determine symptom onset.

Results

Early-onset infections were diagnosed in 389 of 396,586 live births, including 232 (60%) chorioamnionitis-exposed newborns. Records for 229 were reviewed; 29 (13%) had no documented symptoms within 6 hours of birth, including 21 (9%) who remained asymptomatic at 72 hours. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis exposure did not differ significantly between asymptomatic and symptomatic infants (76% vs 69%; p = 0.52). Assuming complete guideline implementation, we estimated that 60 to 1400 newborns would receive diagnostic evaluations and antibiotics for each infected asymptomatic newborn, depending on chorioamnionitis prevalence.

Conclusions

Some infants born to mothers with chorioamnionitis may have no signs of sepsis at birth despite having culture-confirmed infections. Implementation of current clinical guidelines may result in early diagnosis, but large numbers of uninfected asymptomatic infants would be treated.

### Effectiveness of clindamycin and intravenous immunoglobulin, and risk of disease in contacts, in invasive group a streptococcal infections [^117Sm7VJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The use of clindamycin and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in treatment of invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) infection, and the need for prophylactic antibiotics in close contacts, remains contentious. Controlled trials are unlikely to be conducted, so prospective, observational studies provide the best data to inform practice.

Methods

We conducted population-based, prospective, active surveillance of iGAS infections throughout the state of Victoria, Australia (population 4.9 million), from March 2002 through August 2004.

Results

Eighty-four cases of severe iGAS infection (streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis, septic shock, or GAS cellulitis with shock) were identified. Clindamycin-treated patients had more severe disease than clindamycin-untreated patients but lower mortality (15% vs 39%; odds ratio [OR], 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI].10-.80). Among those who received concurrent IVIG, the fatality rate was lower still (7%). The adjusted point estimate of the OR for mortality was lower in clindamycin-treated patients (0.31; 95% CI, .09–1.12) and clindamycin plus IVIG-treated patients (0.12; 95% CI, .01–1.29) compared with clindamycin-untreated patients. Three confirmed cases of iGAS infection occurred in household contacts of index cases. The incidence rate of iGAS disease in contacts was 2011 (95% CI, 413–5929) times higher than the population incidence in Victoria.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that clindamycin treatment of patients with severe iGAS infections substantially reduces mortality and that this effect may be enhanced by concurrent treatment with IVIG. The dramatically increased risk of iGAS disease among household contacts within 1 month of the index case highlights a potential role for antibiotic prophylaxis.

### Prevention of group B streptococcal early-onset disease in newborns: ACOG committee opinion summary, number 782 [^116qFrhJ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of newborn infection. The primary risk factor for neonatal GBS early-onset disease (EOD) is maternal colonization of the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts. Approximately 50% of women who are colonized with GBS will transmit the bacteria to their newborns. Vertical transmission usually occurs during labor or after rupture of membranes. In the absence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, 1–2% of those newborns will develop GBS EOD. Other risk factors include gestational age of less than 37 weeks, very low birth weight, prolonged rupture of membranes, intraamniotic infection, young maternal age, and maternal black race. The key obstetric measures necessary for effective prevention of GBS EOD continue to include universal prenatal screening by vaginal-rectal culture, correct specimen collection and processing, appropriate implementation of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, and coordination with pediatric care providers. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommends performing universal GBS screening between 36 0/7 and 37 6/7 weeks of gestation. All women whose vaginal-rectal cultures at 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks of gestation are positive for GBS should receive appropriate intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis unless a prelabor cesarean birth is performed in the setting of intact membranes. Although a shorter duration of recommended intrapartum antibiotics is less effective than 4 or more hours of prophylaxis, 2 hours of antibiotic exposure has been shown to reduce GBS vaginal colony counts and decrease the frequency of a clinical neonatal sepsis diagnosis. Obstetric interventions, when necessary, should not be delayed solely to provide 4 hours of antibiotic administration before birth. This Committee Opinion, including Table 1, Box 2, and Figures 1–3, updates and replaces the obstetric components of the CDC 2010 guidelines, "Prevention of Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease: Revised Guidelines From CDC, 2010".

### Are invasive group A streptococcal infections preventable by antibiotic therapy? a collaborative retrospective study [^111gJtyq]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

There are 2 main findings in this study. First, the great majority (87%) of patients did not have any evidence for preceding local GAS disease within a 4-week window leading to a physician visit where prescription of an antibiotic treatment theoretically could have prevented their invasive GAS disease. Second, in 2 of the 4 patients with preceding suspected GAS infection, the disease was severe enough that an antibiotic was prescribed but this did not prevent consecutive invasive GAS disease. There was 1 patient with suspected GAS tonsillopharyngitis who was not treated with an antibiotic, but due to a negative rapid antigen test for GAS, this cannot truly be considered as a missed treatment opportunity.

The portal of entry for invasive GAS infections is often unclear, and invasive dissemination from the throat is still under debate. We found 3 other small pediatric studies where GAS-compatible diseases before invasive GAS infections were described. In a study from France, osteoarticular infections due to GAS were analyzed, and a preceding rhino-pharyngeal GAS infection was present in 7 (35%) of 20 cases. In a study from Australia,15 (54%) of 28 children had been seen as out-patients within 48 hours before the onset of their invasive GAS disease, but only 1 (ie, 4% of the total) of them had local GAS disease (pyoderma) within the month before. In contrast, a study on invasive GAS infections in Greecereported that 19 (20%) of 96 pediatric patients had tonsillopharyngitis in the 4 weeks before hospitalization. Unfortunately, no data about antibiotic treatment of preceding GAS disease is provided in any of these studies. There are 2 other pediatric studies reporting symptoms suggestive of GAS disease, such as sore throat, before invasive GAS disease in 4%and 18%, respectively, but the time interval between GAS infection and invasive GAS diseases is not mentioned.

### Tightly clustered outbreak of group A streptococcal disease at a long-term care facility [^112VE4Lw]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe investigation of a tightly clustered outbreak of invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) disease associated with a high mortality rate in a long-term care facility (LTCF).

Design

Cross-sectional carriage survey and epidemiologic investigation of LTCF resident and employee cohorts.

Setting

A 104-bed community LTCF between March 1 and April 7, 2004.

Patients

A cohort of LTCF residents with assigned beds at the time of the outbreak.

Interventions

Reinforcement of standard infection control measures and receipt of chemoprophylaxis by GAS carriers.

Results

Four confirmed and 2 probable GAS cases occurred between March 16 and April 1, 2004. Four case patients died. The final case occurred during the investigation, before the patient was determined to be a GAS carrier. No case occurred during the 6 months after the intervention. Disease was caused by type emm3 GAS; 16.5% of residents and 2.4% of employees carried the outbreak strain. Disease was clustered in 1 quadrant of the LTCF and associated with nonintact skin. GAS disease or carriage was associated with having frequent personal visitors.

Conclusions

Widespread carriage of a virulent GAS strain likely resulted from inadequate infection control measures. Enhanced infection control and targeted prophylaxis for GAS carriers appeared to end the outbreak. In addition to employees, regular visitors to LTCFs should be trained in hand hygiene and infection control because of the potential for extended relationships over time, leading to interaction with multiple residents, and disease transmission in such residential settings. Specific attention to prevention of skin breaks and proper wound care may prevent disease. The occurrence of a sixth case during the investigation suggests urgency in addressing severe, large, or tightly clustered outbreaks of GAS infection in LTCFs.

### Prevention of rheumatic fever and diagnosis and treatment of acute streptococcal pharyngitis: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association rheumatic fever, endocarditis, and Kawasaki disease committee of the council on cardiovascular disease in the young, the interdisciplinary council on functional genomics and translational biology, and the interdisciplinary council on quality of care and outcomes research: endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics [^114NsUEg]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

Primary prevention of acute rheumatic fever is accomplished by proper identification and adequate antibiotic treatment of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) tonsillopharyngitis. Diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis is best accomplished by combining clinical judgment with diagnostic test results, the criterion standard of which is the throat culture. Penicillin (either oral penicillin V or injectable benzathine penicillin) is the treatment of choice, because it is cost-effective, has a narrow spectrum of activity, and has long-standing proven efficacy, and GAS resistant to penicillin have not been documented. For penicillin-allergic individuals, acceptable alternatives include a narrow-spectrum oral cephalosporin, oral clindamycin, or various oral macrolides or azalides. The individual who has had an attack of rheumatic fever is at very high risk of developing recurrences after subsequent GAS pharyngitis and needs continuous antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent such recurrences (secondary prevention). The recommended duration of prophylaxis depends on the number of previous attacks, the time elapsed since the last attack, the risk of exposure to GAS infections, the age of the patient, and the presence or absence of cardiac involvement. Penicillin is again the agent of choice for secondary prophylaxis, but sulfadiazine or a macrolide or azalide are acceptable alternatives in penicillin-allergic individuals. This report updates the 1995 statement by the American Heart Association Rheumatic Fever, Endocarditis, and Kawasaki Disease Committee. It includes new recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of GAS pharyngitis, as well as for the secondary prevention of rheumatic fever, and classifies the strength of the recommendations and level of evidence supporting them.

### Invasive group B streptococcal infections in Finland: a population-based study [^117GGytg]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

All 26 isolates from case of early-onset infection and 4 from cases of late-onset infection were evaluated for antibiotic susceptibility. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin; two isolates (8%) were resistant/intermediate to erythromycin, and one isolate (4%) was resistant to clindamycin.

Surveys

All 20 microbiology laboratories responded. Of the laboratories, 13 (65%) had a specific laboratory request for GBS culture; 9 laboratories also requested cultures from vagina (69%) and 8 (62%) from cervix. None of the laboratories recommended rectal cultures. One laboratory used selective broth media to culture GBS.

All directors of the 38 hospitals with obstetric services responded. Written GBS prevention protocols existed in 30 (79%) hospitals. Most used a combination of risk-based and screening-based strategies; one routinely screened all pregnant women for prenatal GBS carriage. Recommendations for obstetric risk groups include screening patients for GBS when they have one of the following: premature delivery (87%), rupture of membranes without labor (82%), previous delivery of an infant with invasive GBS disease (79%), GBS bacteriuria (66%), and maternal fever during labor (53%). GBS specimens were usually obtained from the vagina (82%) or cervix (45%). No rectal cultures were taken. Culture was used to detect GBS in 82% of laboratories and antigen test in 34%. In 61% of the hospitals, chemoprophylaxis was given to all identified GBS carriers; the remaining 39% of hospitals required the presence of at least one additional obstetric risk factor before prescribing chemoprophylaxis (Table 3). When screening cultures were not performed or the results were not available at labor, chemoprophylaxis was most often given to risk groups with the following obstetric risks: intrapartum fever, previous delivery of an infant with invasive GBS disease, or prolonged rupture of membranes. Intrapartum chemoprophylaxis was given parenterally in 87% of hospitals and orally in 11%. Penicillin was recommended in 69%, cephalosporins in 19%, and aminopenicillins in 11% of hospitals.

### Perinatal group B streptococcal disease prevention, Minnesota [^113cGqR4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Group B streptococci (GBS) emerged as the leading cause of invasive bacterial infections in newborns in the United States in the 1970s. Although the incidence of GBS disease has declined substantially, it remains the leading cause of serious infection in newborns. Perinatal GBS transmission can be reduced dramatically by diagnosing maternal GBS colonization and administering intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis (IAP) during labor and delivery.

In 1996, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published consensus guidelines recommending 2 methods of perinatal GBS disease prevention. The screening-based approach recommends obtaining vaginal and rectal cultures at 35–37 weeks of gestation. Women with GBS-positive cultures are offered IAP during labor. The risk-based approach recommends administering IAP to women with GBS risk factors when they go into labor. These guidelines are believed to have increased use of GBS disease prevention approaches by prenatal care providers, which has led to a decrease in the incidence of GBS disease. A 2002 study further indicated that routine screening for GBS would prevent ≈50% more newborn GBS infections than would a risk-based approach. This study, along with other data, led CDC to publish revised guidelines in August 2002 recommending universal prenatal screening.

As part of the Minnesota Department of Health Emerging Infections Program, prenatal care providers in Minnesota were surveyed in April 1998 to determine strategies to prevent perinatal GBS disease. In November 2002, a similar survey was undertaken to determine the extent to which Minnesota providers have adopted the revised 2002 CDC guidelines.

### Bacterial sexually transmitted infections and related antibiotic use among individuals eligible for doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis in the United States [^111RAdMQ]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Our findings offer a quantitative basis for evaluating potential benefit-risk tradeoffs of differing doxyPEP implementation strategies. Benefits of doxyPEP alongside STI prevention may include alleviation of the medical costs, productivity losses, and stigma associated with STI diagnoses. However, preliminary data have identified increased prevalence of tetracycline resistance in S. aureus, group A Streptococcus, and the gut microbiome among doxyPEP recipients, and in S. aureus infections within populations eligible for doxyPEP use. Ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial resistance in N. gonorrhoeae and other bacterial pathogensremains a priority to understand implications for clinical care.

### Evaluation of universal antenatal screening for group B. streptococcus [^114jbztb]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Group B streptococcal disease is one of the most common infections in the first week after birth. In 2002, national guidelines recommended universal late antenatal screening of pregnant women for colonization with group B streptococcus to identify candidates for intrapartum chemoprophylaxis.

Methods

We evaluated the implementation of the guidelines in a multistate, retrospective cohort selected from the Active Bacterial Core surveillance, a 10-state, population-based system that monitors invasive group B streptococcal disease. We abstracted data from the labor and delivery records of a stratified random sample of live births and of all cases in which the newborn had early-onset group B streptococcal disease (i.e., disease in infants < 7 days of age) in 2003 and 2004. We compared our results with those from a study with a similar design that evaluated screening practices in 1998 and 1999.

Results

We abstracted records of 254 births in which the infant had group B streptococcal disease and 7437 births in which the infant did not. The rate of screening for group B streptococcus before delivery increased from 48.1% in 1998–1999 to 85.0% in 2003–2004; the percentage of infants exposed to intrapartum antibiotics increased from 26.8% to 31.7%. Chemoprophylaxis was administered in 87.0% of the women who were positive for group B streptococcus and who delivered at term, but in only 63.4% of women with unknown colonization status who delivered preterm. The overall incidence of early-onset group B streptococcal disease was 0.32 cases per 1000 live births. Preterm infants had a higher incidence of early-onset group B streptococcal disease than did term infants (0.73 vs. 0.26 cases per 1000 live births); however, 74.4% of the cases of group B streptococcal disease (189 of 254) occurred in term infants. Missed screening among mothers who delivered at term accounted for 34 of the 254 cases of group B streptococcal disease (13.4%). A total of 61.4% of the term infants with group B streptococcal disease were born to women who had tested negative for group B streptococcus before delivery.

Conclusions

Recommendations for universal screening were rapidly adopted. Improved management of preterm deliveries and improved collection, processing, and reporting of culture results may prevent additional cases of early-onset group B streptococcal disease.

### Doxycycline (doxy 100) [^113kTu1p]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Because many strains of the following groups of microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to tetracyclines, culture and susceptibility testing are recommended.

Doxycycline is indicated for treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug:

Escherichia coli.
Enterobacter aerogenes (formerly Aerobacter aerogenes).
Shigella species.
Acinetobacter species (formerly Mima species and Herellea species).
Haemophilus influenzae (respiratory infections).
Klebsiella species (respiratory and urinary infections).

Doxycycline is indicated for treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug:

Streptococcus species:

Up to 44 percent of strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and 74 percent of Enterococcus faecalis (formerly Streptococcus faecalis) have been found to be resistant to tetracycline drugs. Therefore, tetracyclines should not be used for streptococcal disease unless the organism has been demonstrated to be sensitive.

For upper respiratory infections due to group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, penicillin is the usual drug of choice, including prophylaxis of rheumatic fever.

Streptococcus pneumoniae (formerly Diplococcus pneumoniae).
Staphylococcus aureus, respiratory, skin and soft tissue infections. Tetracyclines are not the drugs of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infections.
Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis, including inhalational anthrax (post-exposure): to reduce the incidence or progression of disease following exposure to aerosolized Bacillus anthracis.

When penicillin is contraindicated, doxycycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of infections due to:

Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis.
Treponema pallidum and Treponema pertenue (syphilis and yaws).
Listeria monocytogenes.
Clostridium species.
Fusobacterium fusiforme (Vincent's infection). Actinomyces species.

In acute intestinal amebiasis, doxycycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides.

Doxycycline is indicated in the treatment of trachoma, although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence.

### Intrapartum antibiotic chemoprophylaxis policies for the prevention of group B streptococcal disease worldwide: systematic review [^11258Dac]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Intrapartum antibiotic chemoprophylaxis (IAP) prevents most early-onset group B streptococcal (GBS) disease. However, there is no description of how IAP is used around the world. This article is the sixth in a series estimating the burden of GBS disease. Here we aimed to review GBS screening policies and IAP implementation worldwide.

Methods

We identified data through (1) systematic literature reviews (PubMed/Medline, Embase, Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean [LILACS], World Health Organization library database [WHOLIS], and Scopus) and unpublished data from professional societies and (2) an online survey and searches of policies from medical societies and professionals. We included data on whether an IAP policy was in use, and if so whether it was based on microbiological or clinical risk factors and how these were applied, as well as the estimated coverage (percentage of women receiving IAP where indicated).

Results

We received policy information from 95 of 195 (49%) countries. Of these, 60 of 95 (63%) had an IAP policy; 35 of 60 (58%) used microbiological screening, 25 of 60 (42%) used clinical risk factors. Two of 15 (13%) low-income, 4 of 16 (25%) lower-middle-income, 14 of 20 (70%) upper-middle-income, and 40 of 44 (91%) high-income countries had any IAP policy. The remaining 35 of 95 (37%) had no national policy (25/33 from low-income and lower-middle-income countries). Coverage varied considerably; for microbiological screening, median coverage was 80% (range, 20%-95%); for clinical risk factor-based screening, coverage was 29% (range, 10%-50%). Although there were differences in the microbiological screening methods employed, the individual clinical risk factors used were similar.

Conclusions

There is considerable heterogeneity in IAP screening policies and coverage worldwide. Alternative global strategies, such as maternal vaccination, are needed to enhance the scope of global prevention of GBS disease.

It further states "The 1997 document was notable for its acknowledgment that most cases of IE are not attributable to an invasive procedure but rather are the result of randomly occurring bacteremias from routine daily activities and for acknowledging possible IE prophylaxis failures". The rationale section emphasizes that "the AHA guidelines for IE prophylaxis have been in a process of evolution for more than 50 years" and that "The rationale for prophylaxis was based largely on expert opinion and what seemed to be a rational and prudent attempt to prevent a life-threatening infection".

### Invasive group A Streptococcus outbreaks associated with home healthcare, england, 2018–2019 [^112HrC9S]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Healthcare-associated invasive group A Streptococcus (iGAS) outbreaks are common worldwide, but only England has reported outbreaks associated with home healthcare (HHC). We describe 10 outbreaks during 2018–2019 in England. A total of 96 iGAS cases (range 2–39 per outbreak) and 28 deaths (case-fatality rate 29%) occurred. Outbreak duration ranged from 3–517 days; median time between sequential cases was 20.5 days (range 1–225 days). Outbreak identification was difficult, but emm typing and whole-genome sequencing improved detection. Network analyses indicated multiple potential transmission routes. Screening of 366 HHC workers from 9 outbreaks identified group A Streptococcus carriage in just 1 worker. Outbreak control required multiple interventions, including improved infection control, equipment decontamination, and antimicrobial prophylaxis for staff. Transmission routes and effective interventions are not yet clear, and iGAS outbreaks likely are underrecognized. To improve patient safety and reduce deaths, public health agencies should be aware of HHC-associated iGAS.

Health care personnel (HCP) are at risk of exposure to infectious agents depending on their job duties and other factors. Risks include percutaneous exposure to blood-borne pathogens via sharp injuries (eg, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus); exposure by direct contact, droplet, or airborne transmission of pathogens through direct patient care (eg, pertussis, invasive meningococcus infections, tuberculosis); and through indirect contact transmission related to the contaminated health care environment (eg, Clostridioides difficile). Occupational health programs must effectively identify and respond to potential exposures and provide guidance to HCP on postexposure prophylaxis.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^117QxipC]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Despite substantial progress in prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease since the 1990s, GBS remains the leading cause of early-onset neonatal sepsis in the United States. In 1996, CDC, in collaboration with relevant professional societies, published guidelines for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease (CDC. Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease: a public health perspective. MMWR 1996;45[No. RR-7]); those guidelines were updated and republished in 2002 (CDC. Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease: revised guidelines from CDC. MMWR 2002;51[No. RR-11]). In June 2009, a meeting of clinical and public health representatives was held to reevaluate prevention strategies on the basis of data collected after the issuance of the 2002 guidelines. This report presents CDC's updated guidelines, which have been endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Nurse-Midwives, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Society for Microbiology. The recommendations were made on the basis of available evidence when such evidence was sufficient and on expert opinion when available evidence was insufficient. The key changes in the 2010 guidelines include the following:

- expanded recommendations on laboratory methods for the identification of GBS,
- clarification of the colony-count threshold required for reporting GBS detected in the urine of pregnant women,
- updated algorithms for GBS screening and intrapartum chemoprophylaxis for women with preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes,
- a change in the recommended dose of penicillin-G for chemoprophylaxis,
- updated prophylaxis regimens for women with penicillin allergy, and
- a revised algorithm for management of newborns with respect to risk for early-onset GBS disease. Universal screening at 35–37 weeks' gestation for maternal GBS colonization and use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has resulted in substantial reductions in the burden of early-onset GBS disease among newborns. Although early-onset GBS disease has become relatively uncommon in recent years, the rates of maternal GBS colonization (and therefore the risk for early-onset GBS disease in the absence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis) remain unchanged since the 1970s. Continued efforts are needed to sustain and improve on the progress achieved in the prevention of GBS disease. There also is a need to monitor for potential adverse consequences of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g., emergence of bacterial antimicrobial resistance or increased incidence or severity of non-GBS neonatal pathogens). In the absence of a licensed GBS vaccine, universal screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis continue to be the cornerstones of early-onset GBS disease prevention.

### Biphasic outbreak of invasive group A Streptococcus disease in eldercare facility, New Zealand [^1164z4JP]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

As was the case for other reported outbreaks in long-term care facilities, improved infection control measures and chemoprophylaxis were the cornerstones of outbreak control in this outbreak. Although infection control measures are undoubtedly of utmost importance, the evidence as to whether targeted or mass chemoprophylaxis is preferable in eldercare settings is conflicting, because risk for secondary invasive GAS infection is higher among elderly persons than among other contacts. Authors of a recent UK study demonstrated a considerably increased risk for invasive GAS infection among household contacts, particularly for persons > 75 years of age, for whom the fatality rate for secondary cases was 19%. They suggested that, even in nonoutbreak settings, targeted chemoprophylaxis for elderly household contacts of invasive GAS patients should be considered. It is conceivable that the targeted chemoprophylaxis undertaken during the first phase of this outbreak prevented some cases, yet the occurrence of the second phase suggests that this approach alone was not sufficient. A 2007 review of 17 GAS outbreaks in long-term care facilities similarly found that in 3 facilities, targeted chemoprophylaxis was insufficient for achieving outbreak control and that control was achieved only after the facilities initiated mass chemoprophylaxis to augment existing infection control measures. More recently, mass chemoprophylaxis was insufficient for halting a multiphase outbreak in 2 long-term care facilities in the United States. In that study, mass chemoprophylaxis was initiated for all residents and consenting staff; prophylactic coverage was wider than that in our study. Nevertheless, mass chemoprophylaxis in the US outbreak was still only partially effective, and outbreak persistence was attributed mostly to continued lapses in infection control practices. During a GAS outbreak in another long-term care facility, breaches in infection control practices were also noted; prospective assessment of staff members' wound care and hand hygiene practices found several lapses in each. In our study, improved infection control practices were initiated, but direct observation of staff undertaking wound care and hand hygiene may have further helped to identify exactly where lapses might have been occurring.

### Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis in the Northern territory of Australia: a review of data from 2009 to 2016 and comparison with the literature [^111Uhx3H]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

The previous trends of five yearly outbreaks are not evident since 2005, with the outbreak in 2014 "overdue", occurring 9 years after the previous outbreak of 98 cases in 2005. Rather, recent trends show a consistently higher number of notifications annually with less frequency of outbreaks. Not enough time has elapsed to determine if this is a long-term trend.

The seasonal variation noted in the present study contrasts with that reported by Marshall et al. Previously, Central Australia had similar frequency of cases across winter/summer seasons, whereas the Top End had significantly more during the dry season than the wet. Since 2009, the trend has reversed, indicating APSGN may not be reliably associated with seasonality in the NT.

Our study indicates that even though APSGN incidence has declined substantially around the world, there remains a high disease burden among the Aboriginal population in NT. Group A streptococcal infection and its sequelae diseases represent social disadvantage, poverty, remoteness, and overcrowding. Multiple approaches have been used in the past to tackle GAS infections and their sequelae with varying degrees of success. These include setting up community health-care programs that focus on prevention of skin diseases, establishing APSGN as a notifiable disease with subsequent public health action, and for acute rheumatic fever/rheumatic heart disease prevention providing secondary prophylaxis with long-acting penicillins. The reduction in worldwide prevalence of APSGN has coincided with improvement in living conditions and use of benzathine penicillin chemoprophylaxis for streptococcal pharyngitis in closed adult populations. –

Further planning is needed to build capacity in Aboriginal communities with community workers and clinicians to reduce the burden of GAS infection, to enhance data collection to look carefully at long-term outcomes of APSGN, and work to improve living conditions of the Aboriginal population. A multipronged approach to control GAS infection with improved hygiene, education, and living conditions of Aboriginal populations along with continued research into vaccine development is needed.

### Dental procedures, antibiotic prophylaxis, and endocarditis among people with prosthetic heart valves: nationwide population based cohort and a case crossover study [^115Ytuuz]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This study, combining analyses of a large cohort of patients with prosthetic heart valves and of a case crossover study, shows that invasive dental procedures may contribute to the development of infective endocarditis in this population of patients known to present a high incidence of this disease and to be at high risk of morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. However, a statistically significant reduction in the rate of developing infective endocarditis after such procedures was not observed among those participants receiving antibiotic prophylaxis.

The cohort was large, comprising 138 876 participants with prosthetic heart valves, which represents approximately two thirds of the corresponding French population based on our previous estimations. The availability of a large cohort is of particular importance in the study of infective endocarditis in view of the low incidence of this disease. External comparison is difficult because no similar information is available from other sources or other countries. Given the selection process, there is no reason to believe that this study population is not representative of the entire population with prosthetic heart valves; the results of this study can therefore be extrapolated to the larger population.

The analysis of the cohort provides original data in this population of participants with prosthetic heart valves, with high exposure to dental procedures (396 615 procedures) but which varied considerably from one participant to another, as only half of the cohort received dental care during the mean follow-up of 1.7 years, despite the recommendation to visit a dentist twice yearly.

In addition, only one half of invasive procedures (one quarter of all dental procedures) were associated with antibiotic prophylaxis, despite recommendations. This is a low proportion but consistent with other reports in France.

In this cohort of participants with prosthetic heart valves, the incidence of infective endocarditis, regardless of the microorganism (840 cases per 100 000 person years, data not shown) and the risk of developing oral streptococcal infective endocarditis after an invasive dental procedure (1.4 out of 10 000), were both in the same range as the incidence rates reported in the literature.

### The potential global cost-effectiveness of prospective strep A vaccines and associated implementation efforts [^1148eRDE]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

While no vaccine against Strep A exists yet, antibiotics such as oral and intramuscular penicillin have been widely used to treat patients with Strep A infections. For example, if a patient is confirmed positive for Streptococcal pharyngitis, antibiotics are prescribed to treat patients and prevent prognosis to ARF. In addition, intramuscular antibiotics can be used as a prophylaxis to prevent recurrent ARF. Nonetheless, existing prevention strategies may result in unnecessary consumption of antibiotics (i.e. false positives or prescription without any tests). A previous study also pointed out that it was challenging to increase patients' compliance with the recommended schedule of injections over a long period of time.

To address the unmet global health need for a vaccine against Strep A, the development of a Strep A vaccine has been discoursed and prioritized by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2014, followed by the Product Development for Vaccines Advisory Committee (PDVAC) in 2016. One of the aims of the Strep A Vaccine Global Consortium (SAVAC) is to evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical Strep A vaccine to generate evidence useful for vaccine development and policy decision-making at the global- and national-levels. Given the absence of GAS vaccines and the scarcity of economic evaluations for GAS infections in broader geographical units, the main aim of the current study lies in estimating the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical GAS vaccine against selected GAS infections and estimating the threshold cost per fully vaccinated person to be cost-effective by income group.

### Dental procedures, antibiotic prophylaxis, and endocarditis among people with prosthetic heart valves: nationwide population based cohort and a case crossover study [^116xz7jm]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Interestingly, for the first time in this population the cohort provides an estimate for the incidence of oral streptococcal infective endocarditis in relation to everyday life bacteraemia (ie, oral hygiene habits such as tooth brushing, use of toothpicks, flossing, or chewing) during non-exposure periods. The microtrauma caused by these everyday activities has been identified to induce oral streptococcal bacteraemia, in fairly similar proportions to those of invasive oral procedures for which antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended. The fact that the cumulative non-exposure periods were much longer than the exposure periods (248 544 person years v 36 490 person years, ie, seven times higher) strongly suggests that most cases of infective endocarditis are due to everyday life bacteraemia, which is consistent with the results of the case crossover study, reporting a history of dental procedures in the three months preceding infective endocarditis in only a small number of participants.

### Invasive group a streptococcal infections, Israel [^113LAEuf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

As in other studies, we found that asymptomatic carriers were mostly young children. Whether the index patients were infected from an asymptomatic carrier or vice versa is impossible to determine. The reasons for one person remaining an asymptomatic carrier while another has a severe, sometimes lethal infection have not been clarified. Whether there are any genetic differences between the index patient/contact pair of bacterial isolates or whether varying virulence genes of GAS are expressed under different clinical conditions remains to be determined. Further studies of GAS epidemiology and pathogenesis are required to determine the reasons for acquiring severe invasive GAS diseases in specific hosts. This knowledge will allow a more accurate definition of the risk factors for these infections and may lead to development of effective intervention strategies.

### Doxycycline prophylaxis for skin and soft tissue infections in naval special warfare trainees, United States [^111mnmRf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The nature and intensity of NSW training places the subjects of this study at particularly high risk for SSTIs, both from common causes like S. pyogenes and S. aureus and from rarer saltwater-associated organisms, such as Vibrio spp. and S. algae. The reasons for this higher risk are multifactorial. NSW trainees during Hell Week experience substantial and often diffuse skin breakdown and extremity edema because of the intensity of the physical training and near-constant exposure to ocean water. In addition, NSW trainees might have a component of functional immune impairment as a result of minimal sleep, high stress, and frequent transmission of more minor communicable illnesses. Antibiotic prophylaxis in such settings is not novel; chemoprophylaxis has long been used to target invasive infections from group A Streptococcus in military training populations. The doxycycline prophylaxis analyzed in this study was specifically started in 2015 to limit severe invasive infections caused by saltwater-associated gram-negative pathogens such as Vibrio spp. and S. algae in the setting of a previous outbreak. Doxycycline is still considered a first-line agent for treating Vibrio spp. SSTIs with minimal documented resistance. Invasive S. algae infections are uncommon in otherwise young and healthy persons, as discussed in a recent case series from our center. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns are less well studied, but data from some areas show high rates of susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, tetracycline, and aminoglycosides.

### A population-based comparison of strategies to prevent early-onset group B streptococcal disease in neonates [^117VAMxa]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

Guidelines issued in 1996 in the United States recommend either screening of pregnant women for group B streptococcal colonization by means of cultures (screening approach) or assessing clinical risk factors (risk-based approach) to identify candidates for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis.

Methods

In a multistate retrospective cohort study, we compared the effectiveness of the screening and risk-based approaches in preventing early-onset group B streptococcal disease (in infants less than seven days old). We studied a stratified random sample of the 629,912 live births in 1998 and 1999 in eight geographical areas where there was active surveillance for group B streptococcal infection, including all births in which the neonate had early-onset disease. Women with no documented culture for group B streptococcus were considered to have been cared for according to the risk-based approach.

Results

We studied 5144 births, including 312 in which the newborn had early-onset group B streptococcal disease. Antenatal screening was documented for 52 percent of the mothers. The risk of early-onset disease was significantly lower among the infants of screened women than among those in the risk-based group (adjusted relative risk, 0.46; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.60). Because women whose providers had no strategy for prophylaxis may have been misclassified in the risk-based group, we excluded all women with risk factors and adequate time for prophylaxis who did not receive antibiotics. The adjusted relative risk of early-onset disease associated with the screening approach in this secondary analysis was similar — 0.48 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.37 to 0.63).

Conclusions

Routine screening for group B streptococcus during pregnancy prevents more cases of early-onset disease than the risk-based approach. Recommendations that endorse both strategies as equivalent warrant reconsideration.

### Efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis for intrafamilial transmission of group A β-hemolytic streptococci [^114wW6Tp]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The role of chemoprophylaxis for household contacts of patients with acute streptococcal disease is uncertain.

Methods

The subjects were 1440 sibling contacts of 1181 index patients with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis. Instances of subsequent GABHS pharyngitis in sibling contacts who received chemoprophylaxis and in a control group without prophylaxis were compared.

Results

Of the 948 siblings in the prophylaxis group, 507 were treated with cephalosporins and 441 were treated with penicillins for 3 to 5 days. Subsequent GABHS pharyngitis occurred within 30 days in 28 (3.0%) of the 948 siblings in the prophylaxis group and in 26 (5.3%) of the 492 siblings in the control group. Among siblings in the prophylaxis group, subsequent GABHS pharyngitis occurred in 9 (1.8%) of the 507 siblings in the cephalosporin prophylaxis group and in 19 (4.3%) of the 441 siblings in the penicillin prophylaxis group. When these data were each compared with that in the control group (5.3%), a significant statistical difference was seen in the cephalosporin prophylaxis group (P = 0.003) but not in the penicillin prophylaxis group (P = 0.542). Only 5-day cephalosporin prophylaxis showed significant reduction in the rate of subsequent GABHS pharyngitis compared with that in the control group (P = 0.002).

Conclusions

In view of the low incidence of subsequent GABHS pharyngitis in the nonprophylaxis group, the usual self-limited nature of GABHS pharyngitis, the cost of prophylaxis and the risk for selecting resistant flora, routine chemoprophylaxis against GABHS pharyngitis for sibling contacts is not recommended.

### Infective endocarditis after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: the worst that can happen [^112HD7wy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Preventing TAVR Endocarditis

If we cannot cure all TAVR‐IE patients with surgery, the best we can do is to try to prevent TAVR‐IE. Although guidelines recommend that antibiotic prophylaxis be considered for patients with any prosthetic valve, including a transcatheter valve, in case of dental procedure risk, 13 streptococcal infection is very rare in TAVR‐IE, as shown in the current study and in others. 4 Conversely staphylococcal and, more important, enterococcal infections, mostly nosocomial, are the most frequent in this population. This underscores the crucial need to focus on prevention rather than prophylaxis in those patients who have high exposure to healthcare procedures, older age, and foreign material. 4 This work should include aseptic measures during the insertion and manipulation of venous catheters and during any invasive procedures, including TAVR, 13 and use of antibiotics adapted to these microorganisms for prophylaxis during TAVR procedures. 4

Regarding preventative measures for influenza virus infection, more specifically with respect to post-exposure prophylaxis, IDSA 2018 guidelines recommend to consider post-exposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis for asymptomatic patients ≥ 3 months of age who are at very high risk of developing complications from influenza, including:

- patients who are severely immunocompromised

- patients in whom influenza immunization is contraindicated or unavailable

- patients in whom influenza immunization is expected to have low effectiveness after household exposure to influenza.

### Group A Streptococcus | Infection control… [^116DQKYV]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendations
- Postexposure prophylaxis and work restrictions are not necessary for healthcare personnel who have an exposure to group A Streptococcus.
- For healthcare personnel with known or suspected group A Streptococcusinfection, obtain a sample from the infected site, if possible, for group A Streptococcusand exclude from work until group A Streptococcusinfection is ruled out, or until 24 hours after the start of effective antimicrobial therapy, provided that any draining skin lesions can be adequately contained and covered.
- For healthcare personnel with group A Streptococcuscolonization who are epidemiologically linked to transmission of the organism in the healthcare setting:

- Administer chemoprophylaxis in accordance with CDC recommendations AND
- Exclude from work until 24 hours after the start of effective antimicrobial therapy AND
- Obtain a sample from the affected site for group A Streptococcus testing 7 to 10 days after completion of chemoprophylaxis; if positive, repeat administration of chemoprophylaxis and again exclude from work until 24 hours after the start of effective antimicrobial therapy. Occupational Transmission There are no recommended actions, such as administering postexposure prophylaxis or work restrictions, after HCP exposure to GAS. Contact or dispersal of respiratory secretions are the major modes of transmission of GAS in healthcare settings. HCP who were GAS carriers have been linked to outbreaks of surgical site, postpartum, and burn wound infections.

In these outbreaks, GAS carriage was documented in the pharynx, the skin, the rectum, and the female genital tract of the colonized HCP. Persons with GAS pharyngitis who are treated with an appropriate antibiotic are generally non-infectious after the first 24 hours of treatment. Postexposure Prophylaxis Although PEP is not routinely administered after HCP exposure to GAS, if clinical symptoms compatible with GAS infection develop, GAS infection may be the underlying etiology and testing and treatment may be indicated. 14 When screening of HCP is performed, sites from which specimens are obtained and cultured include the throat, anus, vagina, and any skin lesions. Colonization with GAS does not necessitate treatment unless the carrier is epidemiologically linked to GAS transmission in the healthcare setting. Information regarding dosage and administration of chemoprophylaxis for GAS-colonized HCP who are epidemiologically linked to transmission is available in the document.

### Outbreak control measures… [^111WJQKa]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

The problem Group A strep bacteria can cause clusters and outbreaks of invasive disease. Invasive disease refers to when bacteria invade parts of the body, like blood, that are normally free from germs. Invasive group A strep disease can include:

- Cellulitis with bloodstream infection
- Necrotizing fasciitis
- Pneumonia
- Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. In long-term care facilities The most common clusters and outbreaks investigated in the United States occur in LTCFs. In other settings Other types of investigations include:

- Healthcare-associated infections, such as postpartum and post-surgical infections
- Clusters of strep throat or scarlet fever among school-age children
- Foodborne outbreaks of strep throat, although these are rare in the United States These clusters or outbreaks often require urgent public health action.

Outbreak control measures State, tribal, local, and territorial public health officials may investigate clusters or outbreaks of invasive group A strep infections. The goal is generally to determine what measures can control spread, thus preventing future infections. Control measures vary depending on the setting. Infection control practices In healthcare settings, including home health care, infection prevention and control are critical for preventing group A strep outbreaks. Strengthening infection control practices is key to interrupting transmission of group A strep in ongoing outbreaks. Prophylaxis Most people exposed to someone with a group A strep infection don't require prophylaxis. However, in some situations, prophylaxis may be recommended for someone exposed to an invasive group A strep infection. Vaccination There is currently no vaccine to prevent group A strep infections.

Several vaccines are in development though. A coordinated approach CDC is available to assist state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments with group A strep outbreaks. This is true particularly for persistent, large, or severe outbreaks. For assistance, contact gasoutbreaks@cdc. gov. CDC's Streptococcus Laboratory serves U. S. health departments with characterizing streptococcal isolates for outbreak support. There are requirements for submitting testing requests. For Everyone StreptococcusLaboratory.

### Clinical guidance for group A streptococcal pharyngitis… [^112ACtFT]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Negative RADT Children older than 3 years: Healthcare providers should follow up a negative RADT with a throat culture. Have a mechanism in place to contact the family and initiate antibiotics if the back-up throat culture is positive. Giving antibiotics to children with confirmed group A strep pharyngitis can reduce their risk of developing acute rheumatic fever. All other ages: Throat culture after a negative RADT isn't routinely indicated. Acute rheumatic fever is very rare in these age groups. Recommended antibiotics Penicillin or amoxicillin is the antibiotic of choice to treat group A strep pharyngitis. Penicillin V, oral Children: 250 mg twice daily or 3 times daily for 10 days Adolescents and adults: 250 mg 4 times daily or 500 mg twice daily, for 10 days.

Amoxicillin, oral
- 50 mg/kg once daily for 10 days Alternate: 25 mg/kg twice daily for 10 days Benzathine penicillin G, intramuscular Weight less than 27 kg: 1 dose Weight 27 kg or more: 1 dose. Prevention Hand hygiene Good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette can reduce the spread of group A strep bacteria. Antibiotic treatment Treatment with an appropriate antibiotic for 12 hours or longer limits a person's ability to transmit group A strep bacteria. People with group A strep pharyngitis should stay home from work, school, or daycare until both of the following are met:

- They are afebrile
- At least 12–24 hours after starting appropriate antibiotic therapyA. Treatment recommendations Adult outpatient treatment recommendations CDC Be Antibiotics Aware Program Pediatric outpatient treatment recommendations CDC Be Antibiotics Aware Program.

CDC
- Per the American Academy of Pediatrics Red Book 2024–2027, children with group A strep infections should not return to school or a childcare setting until well appearing and at least 12 hours after beginning appropriate antibiotic therapy. In certain scenarios, such as an infection in a healthcare worker or in a group A strep outbreak setting, staying home for at least 24 hours after beginning appropriate antibiotics should be considered.
