## Question

what CRP, fecal lactoferrin and stool calprotectin level reflect remission in IBD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what CRP, fecal lactoferrin, and stool calprotectin levels reflect remission in IBD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which IBD subtype we are discussing because thresholds and performance differ between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Then, I should verify the highest-quality guideline sources to anchor cutoffs. Next, I will examine the evidence hierarchy and weigh diagnostic accuracy. After that, I need to consider special contexts like postoperative Crohn's disease and pediatric patients. Finally, I will synthesize practical thresholds and highlight caveats and implementation details, ensuring I double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and why these biomarkers matter. In IBD, remission spans clinical, endoscopic, and histologic domains, and noninvasive biomarkers are used to infer mucosal healing and guide treatment decisions, but they are not perfect substitutes for endoscopy, so I need to ensure I contextualize thresholds with symptom status and prior endoscopic confirmation of remission [^d00e7a38] [^829c4f3a].

> I will now examine ulcerative colitis, where the evidence base is strongest. The AGA recommends that in patients with UC in symptomatic remission, fecal calprotectin less than 150 μg/g, normal fecal lactoferrin, and/or normal CRP can be used to rule out active inflammation and avoid routine endoscopic assessment; importantly, this is a conditional recommendation with low to moderate certainty, so I should not overstate precision here [^34e88579] [^56d02a73]. Wait, let me verify the lactoferrin threshold; the AGA operationalizes "normal" fecal lactoferrin as less than 7.25 μg/g, which aligns with the diagnostic accuracy framework used in the guideline, so I should keep that explicit [^dee4942b]. For CRP, "normal" is generally less than 5 mg/L in these contexts, though I should acknowledge that CRP is less sensitive for intestinal inflammation than fecal markers and can be influenced by non-gut sources of inflammation [^70f79bf6] [^c0e2114a].

> Hold on, I should verify whether a lower calprotectin threshold performs better in certain UC scenarios. In patients who recently achieved symptomatic remission after a treatment change, a calprotectin less than 50 μg/g may better reflect endoscopic improvement (Mayo endoscopic subscore 0 or 1) than less than 150 μg/g, though the certainty remains low; this is a nuanced point I should not generalize beyond the specified context [^34e88579] [^dee4942b]. I need to ensure I also note that in mild symptomatic UC, even normal biomarkers cannot reliably exclude active inflammation, so endoscopic assessment is often preferred when symptoms persist or are discordant with biomarkers [^efa64297] [^4358dbd8].

> Next, I should review Crohn's disease, where performance differs and thresholds are less definitive. The AGA suggests that in CD patients in symptomatic remission with recent confirmation of endoscopic remission, fecal calprotectin less than 150 μg/g and/or CRP less than 5 mg/L can be used to rule out active inflammation; however, the certainty is lower, and false negatives occur, so I should be cautious and consider longitudinal trends and assay consistency when interpreting results [^f202c325] [^92ac71ec]. Let me double-check the caveat about assay variability; yes, different calprotectin assays are not interchangeable, and serial monitoring should ideally use the same platform to allow meaningful comparisons over time [^42d09ec2] [^4ff2dfc4].

> I will now examine postoperative Crohn's disease, where biomarkers have a distinct role. In low-risk patients on pharmacologic prophylaxis after ileocolonic resection, a normal fecal calprotectin reliably rules out endoscopic recurrence, with commonly cited thresholds around 50–100 μg/g; however, I should confirm that this applies to the right risk context and that endoscopy remains the gold standard when risk is higher or symptoms suggest recurrence [^829c4f3a] [^ce35f154]. Wait, I initially thought a single universal cutoff of 100 μg/g applied broadly, but I should correct that: while 100 μg/g is supported in several studies, the AGA frames multiple acceptable thresholds (for example, less than 50, less than 150, less than 250 μg/g) and emphasizes that test performance varies with pretest probability and clinical context, so I should avoid implying a single rigid postoperative cutoff [^93bf01ea] [^e6b4a233].

> Let me consider pediatric patients briefly. Very young children may have higher baseline calprotectin, so a higher threshold may be needed; the AGA notes this adjustment for ages 2 years and younger, but I should acknowledge that pediatric-specific cutoffs are less standardized and should be interpreted with pediatric gastroenterology guidance [^c0e2114a].

> I should confirm the evidentiary hierarchy to avoid overreliance on lower-quality data. The AGA UC and CD guidelines represent high-credibility, GRADE-based recommendations, whereas meta-analyses and cohort studies provide supportive but lower-certainty evidence; for example, a meta-analysis showed pooled sensitivity/specificity for calprotectin around 0.88/0.73 for endoscopic activity, but heterogeneity and differing cutoffs limit generalizability, reinforcing the need to align with guideline thresholds and clinical judgment [^70f79bf6] [^829c4f3a] [^3e4f601e].

> Now, I will synthesize practical thresholds while keeping the disease-specific nuances explicit. For UC in symptomatic remission, fecal calprotectin less than 150 μg/g, fecal lactoferrin less than 7.25 μg/g, and/or CRP less than 5 mg/L support biochemical remission and reduce the likelihood of active inflammation; in recently treated remission, calprotectin less than 50 μg/g may better track endoscopic improvement, though certainty is lower [^34e88579] [^dad8bd89]. For CD in symptomatic remission with recent endoscopic remission, fecal calprotectin less than 150 μg/g and/or CRP less than 5 mg/L can be used to rule out active inflammation, recognizing higher false-negative rates and the importance of using the same assay over time [^f202c325] [^42d09ec2]. In postoperative CD on prophylaxis, normal calprotectin (often interpreted as less than about 50–100 μg/g depending on context) helps exclude recurrence, but I should reiterate that this is risk-stratified and not a universal substitute for endoscopy [^829c4f3a] [^ce35f154].

> But wait, what if biomarkers and symptoms disagree? I need to ensure I address the symptom–inflammation disconnect. In both UC and CD, discordance warrants endoscopic evaluation rather than empiric treatment changes, and in mild symptomatic presentations, normal biomarkers cannot fully exclude inflammation, so shared decision-making about repeat biomarkers versus prompt endoscopy is essential [^70f79bf6] [^829c4f3a] [^efa64297]. I should also remind myself that CRP has limited sensitivity for intestinal inflammation and can be normal despite active disease, particularly in UC, which is why fecal markers are preferred when available [^60c3c6ff] [^a2bd8397].

> Finally, I should double-check implementation details that change interpretation. Assay variability matters; use the same calprotectin platform for longitudinal monitoring when possible, and if results are unexpected or borderline, repeat testing or proceed to endoscopy rather than making abrupt treatment changes; also, remember to exclude infections like C. difficile when biomarkers are elevated with compatible symptoms, as this can confound interpretation [^42d09ec2] [^698e6ce4]. In summary, fecal calprotectin less than 150 μg/g is a pragmatic, guideline-endorsed threshold to define biochemical remission in UC and can be used in CD with caution, with lower thresholds such as less than 50 μg/g considered in select UC contexts and postoperative CD settings, always integrated with symptoms and, when uncertain, confirmed endoscopically [^34e88579] [^f202c325] [^829c4f3a].

In IBD, remission is best supported by **fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g** [^34e88579] and/or **CRP < 5 mg/L** [^d00e7a38], which reliably indicate absence of active inflammation and correlate with endoscopic remission [^3e4f601e]. Fecal lactoferrin should be **normal (< 7.25 μg/g)** [^dee4942b] to support remission, but it is less specific and should be interpreted with calprotectin and CRP [^fb7422fa]. In patients recently achieving remission, a lower calprotectin threshold (< 50 μg/g) may better reflect endoscopic improvement [^34e88579] [^dad8bd89]. Persistent elevation of any biomarker, especially calprotectin, should prompt endoscopic evaluation to confirm remission status [^dd9d6c0b] [^b4abeafd].

---

## Fecal calprotectin

Fecal calprotectin is the **most reliable noninvasive marker** of intestinal inflammation in IBD [^e831dfc5] and correlates strongly with endoscopic disease activity [^3e4f601e]. The AGA recommends **< 150 μg/g** [^34e88579] to rule out active inflammation in UC and CD [^829c4f3a]; in patients recently achieving remission, **< 50 μg/g** may better reflect endoscopic improvement (MES 0 or 1) [^34e88579] [^dad8bd89]. Values of 150–250 μg/g represent a gray zone and should be interpreted in clinical context [^42fed68c].

---

## C-reactive protein (CRP)

CRP is a systemic marker of inflammation [^d57c0c5b] and is less specific for intestinal inflammation than fecal calprotectin [^3e4f601e]. A **CRP < 5 mg/L** [^d00e7a38] is generally considered normal and supports remission, though it may be normal in 10–15% of patients with active disease, particularly in UC [^60c3c6ff]. CRP is most useful when combined with fecal calprotectin and clinical assessment [^f0e5a828].

---

## Fecal lactoferrin

Fecal lactoferrin is a neutrophil-derived protein that reflects intestinal inflammation [^fb7422fa]. A **normal lactoferrin level** is **< 7.25 μg/g** [^dee4942b]; elevated levels suggest active inflammation but are less specific than calprotectin [^fb7422fa]. Lactoferrin is best used alongside calprotectin and CRP rather than in isolation [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications of biomarker levels

| **Biomarker** | **Remission threshold** | **Clinical interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| Fecal calprotectin | < 150 μg/g (general) < 50 μg/g (recent remission) | Rules out active inflammation; correlates with endoscopic remission [^34e88579] [^3e4f601e] |
| CRP | < 5 mg/L | Supports remission; less specific for intestinal inflammation [^d00e7a38] [^3e4f601e] |
| Fecal lactoferrin | < 7.25 μg/g | Suggests absence of significant neutrophilic inflammation [^dee4942b] [^fb7422fa] |

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Assay variability**: Different calprotectin assays may yield varying results; use the same assay for longitudinal monitoring when possible [^42d09ec2] [^4ff2dfc4].
- **Symptom–biomarker discordance**: Normal biomarkers do not always exclude active disease, especially in mild or localized inflammation; clinical judgment and endoscopy may be needed [^efa64297] [^4358dbd8].
- **Non-inflammatory causes**: Elevated biomarkers can occur with infections (e.g. C. difficile) or other non-IBD inflammatory conditions; interpret results in clinical context [^698e6ce4].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Fecal calprotectin**: < 150 μg/g to rule out active inflammation; consider < 50 μg/g in recently achieved remission [^34e88579] [^dad8bd89].
- **CRP**: < 5 mg/L supports remission but should be interpreted with fecal calprotectin and clinical assessment [^d00e7a38] [^f0e5a828].
- **Fecal lactoferrin**: < 7.25 μg/g suggests absence of significant inflammation; use with calprotectin and CRP [^dee4942b] [^fb7422fa].

---

Fecal calprotectin **< 150 μg/g** and CRP **< 5 mg/L** are the primary noninvasive markers indicating remission in IBD, with lactoferrin **< 7.25 μg/g** as supportive evidence. Persistent elevation of any biomarker, particularly calprotectin, should prompt endoscopic evaluation to confirm remission status [^dd9d6c0b] [^b4abeafd].

### C-reactive protein, fecal calprotectin, and stool lactoferrin for detection of endoscopic activity in symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3e4f601e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Persistent disease activity is associated with a poor prognosis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therefore, monitoring of patients with intent to suppress subclinical inflammation has emerged as a treatment concept. As endoscopic monitoring is invasive and resource intensive, identification of valid markers of disease activity is a priority. The objective was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin (FC), and stool lactoferrin (SL) for assessment of endoscopically defined disease activity in IBD.

Methods

Databases were searched from inception to November 6, 2014 for relevant cohort and case-control studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of CRP, FC, or SL and used endoscopy as a gold standard in patients with symptoms consistent with active IBD. Sensitivities and specificities were pooled to generate operating property estimates for each test using a bivariate diagnostic meta-analysis.

Results

Nineteen studies (n = 2499 patients) were eligible. The pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates for CRP, FC, and SL were 0.49 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34–0.64) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.72–0.96), 0.88 (95% CI 0.84–0.90) and 0.73 (95% CI 0.66–0.79), and 0.82 (95% CI 0.73–0.88) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.62–0.89), respectively. FC was more sensitive than CRP in both diseases and was more sensitive in ulcerative colitis than Crohn's disease.

Conclusions

Although CRP, FC, and SL are useful biomarkers, their value in managing individual patients must be considered in specific clinical contexts.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^70f79bf6]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Biomarkers are used frequently for noninvasive monitoring and treatment decision making in the management of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). This American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guideline is intended to support practitioners in decisions about the use of biomarkers for the management of UC.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of content experts and guideline methodologists used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework to prioritize clinical questions, identify patient-centered outcomes, and conduct an evidence synthesis on the clinical performance of serum C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin, and fecal lactoferrin as biomarkers of disease activity in patients with established UC in symptomatic remission or with active symptoms. The guideline panel used the Evidence-to-Decision framework to develop recommendations for the use of biomarkers for monitoring and management of UC and provided implementation considerations for clinical practice.

Results

The guideline panel made 7 conditional recommendations. In patients with UC in symptomatic remission, the panel suggests the use of a biomarker- and symptom-based monitoring strategy over a symptom-based monitoring strategy. For patients in symptomatic remission, the panel suggests using fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g, normal fecal lactoferrin, and/or normal CRP to rule out active inflammation and avoid routine endoscopic assessment of disease. In patients with UC with moderate to severe symptoms, the panel suggests using fecal calprotectin > 150 μg/g, elevated fecal lactoferrin, or elevated CRP to inform treatment decisions and avoid routine endoscopic assessment of disease. However, in patients in symptomatic remission but elevated biomarkers, and in patients with moderate to severe symptoms with normal biomarkers, the panel suggests endoscopic assessment of disease to inform treatment decisions. In patients with UC with mild symptoms, the panel suggests endoscopic assessment of disease activity to inform treatment decisions. The panel identified the use of a biomarker-based monitoring strategy over an endoscopy-based monitoring strategy as a knowledge gap. The panel also proposed key implementation considerations for optimal use of biomarkers, and identified areas for future research.

Conclusions

In patients with UC, noninvasive biomarkers, including fecal calprotectin, fecal lactoferrin, and serum CRP can inform disease monitoring and management.

AGA Recommendation 3 — In patients with UC in symptomatic remission but with elevated stool or serum markers of inflammation (fecal calprotectin > 150 μg/g, elevated fecal lactoferrin, elevated CRP), the AGA suggests endoscopic assessment of disease activity rather than empiric treatment adjustment (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). As an implementation alternative, repeat measurement of biomarkers (in 3–6 months) may be reasonable, but if biomarkers remain elevated on repeat evaluation then endoscopic assessment may be warranted.

### Measurement of faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in inflammatory bowel disease [^7a4da467]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic relapsing gastrointestinal conditions characterised by an influx of inflammatory cells to the affected gut mucosa. The mainstay of diagnosing and re-evaluating these conditions in clinical practice and research is by invasive serological, radiological, endoscopic and histological assessment. In clinical trials, disease activity is often evaluated using a combination of the above tests plus clinical indices such as the Crohn's Disease Activity Index and Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index. These tools rely on subjective assessment of symptoms and so, often, do not correlate with mucosal inflammation or mucosal healing, which may be the preferred therapeutic end point for long-term inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management. The faecal biomarkers calprotectin and lactoferrin are neutrophil derived proteins that are stable in faeces and can be detected by quantitative ELISA in small stool samples. Concentrations of both are raised in patients with gastrointestinal mucosal inflammation. They provide a unique, inexpensive, non-invasive method of testing for active inflammatory disease. They can be used to screen for IBD and as a surrogate marker of mucosal healing they are useful in monitoring the response to therapeutic intervention or surgery. They may also predict the clinical course of the disease. This clinical review aims to discuss the current evidence, limitations and potential future uses of these biomarkers in IBD.

Conclusions and the future for faecal biomarkers in IBD

The outlook for faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in clinical practice appears promising.

Potentially in the future faecal biomarker measurement will be standard prior to first gastrointestinal outpatient clinic visit for those with abdominal pain or diarrhoea. This may allow faster triage and assessment of patients and perhaps the avoidance of unnecessary investigation in those with functional diarrhoea or IBS.

As surrogate markers of mucosal healing in IBD, calprotectin and lactoferrin may allow objective mapping of an individual patient response to treatment and quantify the likelihood of future relapse. If these tests can be used to demonstrate an adequate response to biological therapy, they may aid decisions regarding dose escalation, shortening of dosage interval, switching to an alternative agent or ultimately withdrawal of unnecessary immunosuppression for those in sustained deep remission. Equally future trials may tell us whether consistent suppression or elevation of calprotectin and lactoferrin convey prognostic significance in terms of hospitalisation, the need for surgery and an effect on quality of life.

In summary, faecal biomarkers will never fully replace colonoscopy and radiology which are necessary to obtain tissue samples and investigate the complications of IBD. However, in a society where patient satisfaction, risk minimisation, cost reduction and hospitalisation avoidance are a priority, these non-invasive, inexpensive, reproducible and clinically significant measurements are likely to have a greater role in our future diagnostic and therapeutic pathways.

Key points

▶ Quantification of the faecal biomarkers calprotectin and lactoferrin can provide a non-invasive measure of intestinal inflammation.
▶ The clinical use of faecal biomarkers in inflammatory bowel disease includes screening for active mucosal inflammation, longitudinal disease monitoring and predicting the risk of relapse.
▶ In the correct clinical context, faecal biomarkers may avoid the need for invasive radiological or endoscopic investigation and inform treatment decisions.

### Measurement of faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in inflammatory bowel disease [^9809846b]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC) are debilitating chronic relapsing inflammatory conditions for which there is no ideal treatment. There are a growing number of immunological treatments for both diseases, but these carry a risk of side effects and are costly. Consequently, patients must be carefully assessed and counselled about safe and appropriate use of these drugs.

Crohn's disease is often the more clinically challenging of the two conditions to manage. The changing phenotype of the condition often necessitates repeated radiological or endoscopic investigation to evaluate disease activity. These tests are invasive, often uncomfortable, pose risk of short term complications and long-term side effects to the patient, are time consuming and costly.

Historically clinical practice and research trials have relied upon interpretation of symptom activity to determine treatment success in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, over the past 10 years the concept of endoscopic 'mucosal healing' has emerged as a desirable end point of treatment. This suggests that the traditional methods of quantifying clinical activity such as the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and the Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (UCAI), which predominantly rely on a subjective assessment of symptom severity, may need to be revised or replaced by more objective measurements of mucosal disease activity.

### Can 2 different fecal calprotectin assays be used interchangeably in IBD treatment? [^4ff2dfc4]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Fecal Calprotectin (FC) levels can be used as a surrogate marker for disease activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Calprotectin is released into the intestinal lumen from the neutrophils in the mucosa during inflammation, and measuring the levels of FC thus reflects intestinal inflammation. Not only can FC levels be used to discriminate between IBD and functional gastrointestinal disorders in patients with chronic abdominal pain, these measurements also have a prominent place in today's clinical care of patients with IBD; FC is used to discriminate between active and quiescent IBD, and has a higher accuracy than other biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP).

Despite its widespread use, there is currently no consensus on the optimal cutoff value for discriminating active disease from remission in patients with IBD. This lack of consensus is partly caused by questions about the variability between different assays used to measure FC. Several studies have demonstrated varying accuracies when comparing different FC assays head-to-head,–but these studies mainly focused on discriminating between healthy controls and patients with IBD.

As in practice patients frequently switch between different laboratories where different assays are used, we need to know whether different assays classify disease activity in the same way in order to correctly monitor the disease activity of our patients with IBD. This study aimed to answer the following research question: "Can two different FC assays be used interchangeably in IBD monitoring?" Our primary outcome was the agreement between the 2 assays, as assessed with the weighted κ.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^efa64297]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) biomarkers — clinical interpretation indicates that fecal calprotectin < 150 ± 50 μg/g and normal fecal lactoferrin reliably rules out active inflammation, obviating endoscopic assessment; normal serum C-reactive protein (CRP) may rule out active inflammation. In UC in symptomatic remission, elevated fecal calprotectin > 150 ± 50 μg/g, elevated fecal lactoferrin, or elevated CRP may not indicate active inflammation. In UC with mild symptoms (infrequent rectal bleeding and/or increased stool frequency), fecal calprotectin < 150 ± 50 μg/g, normal fecal lactoferrin, or normal CRP cannot rule out active inflammation.

### The role of biomarkers in clinical trials of inflammatory bowel disease [^d620c260]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical trials require valid outcome measures to assess the therapeutic benefit of investigational agents. Recently, regulatory authorities have mandated the use of patient-reported outcomes in combination with an objective measure of disease activity as primary outcome measures in inflammatory bowel disease trials. Endoscopy has commonly fulfilled the latter role; however, due to the costs and complexity of these assessments, interest has emerged in the use of noninvasive biomarkers. The role of C-reactive protein, fecal calprotectin, and fecal lactoferrin in clinical research is discussed.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^34e88579]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA Recommendation 2 — In patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in symptomatic remission, the AGA suggests using fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g, normal fecal lactoferrin, or normal C-reactive protein (CRP) to rule out active inflammation and avoid routine endoscopic assessment of disease activity (Conditional recommendation, very low to low certainty of evidence). For those who recently achieved symptomatic remission after treatment adjustment in the preceding 1–3 months, fecal calprotectin < 50 μg/g may be preferred over < 150 μg/g to detect endoscopic improvement (MES 0 or 1), and normal CRP may be less informative; however, if CRP was elevated at the initial flare, normalization may suggest endoscopic improvement (MES 0 or 1).

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^dad8bd89]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA ulcerative colitis (UC) biomarkers — using markers to rule out inflammation in symptomatic remission — in patients with UC in symptomatic remission, the AGA suggests using fecal calprotectin < 150 µg/g, normal fecal lactoferrin, or normal CRP to rule out active inflammation and avoid routine endoscopic assessment of disease activity; in those who have recently achieved symptomatic remission after treatment adjustment in the preceding 1–3 mo, fecal calprotectin < 50 µg/g may be preferred over < 150 µg/g to detect endoscopic improvement (MES 0 or 1), and normal CRP may be less informative to rule out moderate to severe active endoscopic inflammation, although normalization of CRP after an elevated value at initial flare may suggest endoscopic improvement (MES 0 or 1).

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^13c7eb8a]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA evidence summary — biomarkers in symptomatic ulcerative colitis (UC): In patients with UC with moderate to severe symptoms suggestive of flare, fecal calprotectin > 150 μg/g, elevated fecal lactoferrin, and elevated CRP reliably suggest moderate to severe endoscopic inflammation, obviating routine need for endoscopic assessment (very low to moderate certainty of evidence). In patients with UC who have mild symptoms, fecal calprotectin > 150 μg/g, elevated fecal lactoferrin, and elevated CRP may not suggest moderate to severe endoscopic inflammation (very low certainty of evidence). In patients with UC with moderate to severe symptoms suggestive of flare, fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g, normal fecal lactoferrin or normal CRP may suggest lack of inflammation (very low certainty of evidence).

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^4358dbd8]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA Recommendation 4 — In patients with UC with mild symptoms, with normal stool or serum markers of inflammation (fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g, normal fecal lactoferrin, normal CRP), the AGA suggests endoscopic assessment of disease activity rather than empiric treatment adjustment (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). For mild symptoms such as slight increase in stool frequency and/or infrequent rectal bleeding, proceeding directly with endoscopic assessment rather than testing biomarkers may be reasonable, and for those who prefer to avoid endoscopy or empiric escalation, repeat biomarker measurement (in 3–6 months) may be a reasonable alternative.

AGA guideline — moderate to severe symptomatic ulcerative colitis (UC): In patients with UC with moderate to severe symptoms suggestive of flare, the AGA suggests using fecal calprotectin > 150 μg/g, elevated fecal lactoferrin, or elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) to rule in active inflammation and inform treatment adjustment and avoid endoscopic assessment solely for establishing presence of active disease (Conditional recommendation, very low to moderate certainty of evidence). Patients who place greater value in confirming inflammation and lesser value on the inconvenience, cost, or risk of endoscopy may choose to pursue endoscopic evaluation before treatment adjustment.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^a24e5fc4]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA guideline — patients with established UC in symptomatic remission, or with mild symptoms in whom biomarkers were measured: the PICO question evaluates cutoffs to accurately rule out active inflammation using fecal calprotectin < 50 μg/g, < 150 μg/g, or < 250 μg/g versus > 50 μg/g, > 150 μg/g, or > 250 μg/g; normal fecal lactoferrin (< 7.25 μg/g) versus elevated (> 7.25 μg/g); and normal C-reactive protein (CRP) (< 5 mg/L) versus elevated CRP (> 5 mg/L), with outcomes framed around detection of endoscopic inflammation and reporting benefits (TP rate; TN rate) and harms (FN rate and FP rate as defined).

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^041e76c9]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA guideline on biomarkers in ulcerative colitis — objective, scope, audience, and methods — states that the objective is to provide guidance on "well-established and commonly available biomarkers as surrogate tests for endoscopic assessment of disease or in longitudinal monitoring" of UC in the ambulatory setting, focusing on "serum C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin, and fecal lactoferrin", while "predictive biomarkers for assessment of hospitalized patients with severe colitis is beyond the scope". The target audience "includes primary care and gastroenterology health care professionals, patients, and policy makers", with emphasis that qualifying statements "should never be omitted" and that recommendations "provide guidance for typical patients with UC" while recognizing individual circumstances; discussions of benefits and harms can support shared decision making. Methodologically, this document "represents the official recommendations of the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA)" and "was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework", with development "fully funded by the AGA Institute". The scope defines biomarkers as "biological molecules that are quantifiable in tissue or body fluid (blood, stool, and urine)" and notes that although many have been studied across outcomes such as "assessing disease activity" and "likelihood of colectomy", "most of these studies have been small, lack replication, and use markers that are not readily available outside of a research setting".

### Measurement of faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in inflammatory bowel disease [^197a9afe]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Predicting the clinical course of IBD

An important question is whether single or sequential measurement of faecal biomarkers can predict the future course of IBD? If so, their use in clinical practice is potentially vast, allowing early counselling regarding the need for institution of immunosuppressive or biological drugs, or surgery. Equally biomarker measurement may allow discontinuation of unnecessary drugs in those at high likelihood of staying in remission long term.

A UK study monitored 43 patients with Crohn's disease and 37 patients with UC whom had been in clinical remission for between 1 and 4 months. An index calprotectin > 50 mg/l (an older unit measurement of calprotectin that equates to > 250 μg/g) predicted clinical relapse over the next 12 months with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 83%.

Similarly another study followed up 38 patients with Crohn's disease and 41 patients with UC in clinical remission, again for 1 year. An index calprotectin of > 150 μg/g was a poor indicator of relapse according to CDAI in Crohn's disease, conferring only a twofold risk of relapse, with a sensitivity of 87% but a specificity of only 47%. However, in UC the same calprotectin threshold gave rise to an impressive 14-fold risk of relapse, with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 82%.

### Fecal markers: calprotectin and lactoferrin [^27fea458]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Overall, fecal markers have been found to be more accurate than serum markers. However, fecal markers are not specific for IBD and may be elevated in a range of organic conditions. Fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin can still differentiate inflammatory disease from functional bowel disorders. Comparison studies have found an overall diagnostic accuracy in IBD of 80% to 100% for both calprotectin and lactoferrin. Elevated levels are found in both CD and UC making it difficult to distinguish between these 2 diagnoses from these biomarkers alone. Both markers correlated well to mucosal healing and histologic improvement. Hence, they may be useful in monitoring response to treatment and predicting endoscopic and clinical relapse. Overall, patients with elevated markers were at higher risk of postoperative recurrence than those with normal levels. Fecal markers are useful in predicting pouchitis as well. Fecal markers are helpful as an adjunctive tool in overall evaluation of patients with nonspecific symptoms and as a management tool in those with inflammatory disease to monitor disease activity and possibility of relapse. They are less invasive than colonoscopy and can help guide management in a more cost-effective manner.

### The role and utility of faecal markers in inflammatory bowel disease [^fdf10e58]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are characterized by periods of symptomatic relapse and remission. Diagnosis and assessment of inflammatory bowel disease has so far been based on clinical evaluation, serum parameters, radiology and endoscopy. Faecal markers such as calprotectin or lactoferrin have emerged as new diagnostic tools to detect and monitor intestinal inflammation. This review focuses on their potential clinical applications and limitations in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.

### Biomarkers in inflammatory bowel disease: a practical guide [^bec8e682]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Biomarkers can be collected from sources including serum, urine, stool or tissue. Whilst the number of biomarkers available to clinicians has increased in recent years, particularly driven by the growth of metabolomics, genomics and proteomics, not all biomarkers are useful or available to the practicing clinician in everyday practice. – An ideal biomarker is sensitive and specific to the observed outcome, available without the need for invasive collection, relevant to underlying pathophysiology, responsive to treatment, useful in prognostication, cost-effective and acceptable to the patient. For clinicians, there are also further considerations such as availability, turn-around time for testing and robustness of the analytic method used.

While the search for the optimal biomarker in IBD continues, the most widely available biomarkers in current clinical practice include serum and stool testing with C-reactive protein (CRP) and faecal calprotectin (FCP). The use of other faecal markers, for example faecal lactoferrin, is less widespread. CRP and FCP are frequently used by primary care clinicians to differentiate between IBD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)and by IBD clinicians to evaluate symptoms and monitor response to therapy. There are also newer genetic biomarkers that may have a future role to play in IBD, such as the NUDT15 codon that predicts adverse effects from thiopurines. Despite significant collaborative research efforts towards biomarker identification, the recent PRedicting Outcomes For Crohn's dIsease using a moLecular biomarkEr (PROFILE) trial of a blood-based biomarker did not show clinical utility in identifying patients with CD at risk of a more severe disease course at diagnosis, for example.

All biomarkers have individual strengths and limitations, and effective clinical use requires nuance and careful interpretation. We present a narrative review of the current literature to provide a practical guide to assist clinicians in day-to-day practice and explore the future of biomarker use in IBD.

Mild symptomatic ulcerative colitis with normal biomarkers — In patients with UC with mild symptoms, with normal stool or serum markers of inflammation (fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g, normal fecal lactoferrin, normal CRP), the AGA suggests endoscopic assessment of disease activity rather than empiric treatment adjustment. In patients with UC with mild symptoms and normal biomarkers of inflammation who prefer to avoid endoscopic assessment or empiric treatment escalation, repeat measurement of biomarkers (in 3–6 mo) may be a reasonable alternative.

### Can we change the natural course of inflammatory bowel disease? [^f83f6e70]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

The main goal of managing IBD is to achieve deep and sustained remission, encompassing clinical and endoscopic remission. In the Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (STRIDE)-II guidelines updated recently, the normalization of biomarkers including C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin (FC) has been added as a new therapeutic objective to reach rapidly, reflecting the more and more stringent goals and timelines imposed for the treatment of both CD and UC patients. Moreover, the absence of disability and normalization of quality of life have also been added as therapeutic goals in themselves, reflecting the value that gastroenterologists should provide their patients today in the restoration of a 'normal life'.

Increasing evidence suggests that early intervention with disease-modifying agents within a therapeutic window of opportunity is able to slow down the development of bowel damage in CD compared with a step-up treatment approach. Nevertheless, this is exclusively based on retrospective or post-hoc studies, making it difficult to affirm that this strategy impacts the natural course of CD. Available data on the prevention of disease progression in UC are even more limited than in CD. Thus, whether the timing of initiating IBD-specific therapy impacts the long-term progressive course of CD and UC remains unknown and has to be further explored in prospective disease-modification trials (Figure 1).

### Clinical utility of fecal biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of inflammatory bowel disease [^9a849319]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and monitoring of inflammatory bowel diseases rely on clinical, endoscopic, and radiologic parameters. Inflammatory biomarkers have been investigated as a surrogate marker for endoscopic diagnosis of inflammatory activity. Fecal inflammatory biomarkers such as calprotectin and lactoferrin are direct products of bowel inflammation and provide an accurate and noninvasive diagnostic and monitoring modality for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. This report contains an overview of the currently existing literature pertaining to clinical implications of fecal biomarkers for diagnosis, monitoring, and prediction of outcomes of inflammatory bowel disease.

### Measurement of faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in inflammatory bowel disease [^a9f3db98]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

What are the uses of faecal biomarkers in IBD?

There are three broad areas within which faecal biomarkers in IBD have been studied: diagnostic exclusion of active IBD, longitudinal monitoring of IBD and predicting the clinical course of IBD.

Diagnostic exclusion of active IBD

Abdominal pain and diarrhoea are common presenting symptoms to gastroenterology clinics. Without 'red flag' or specific localising symptoms the diagnostic spectrum is wide, from IBD and colonic cancer to functional diarrhoea and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Patients are often subjected to colonoscopy or radiological imaging. Consequently, faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin have been studied with an aim of separating those patients with inflammatory organic pathology from those with non-inflammatory functional pathology, thereby potentially avoiding the need for more invasive tests.

Faecal biomarkers are a measure of local gut inflammation rather than systemic inflammation which is not always apparent in IBD. It is not surprising therefore, that calprotectin and lactoferrin have been demonstrated as more effective in identifying disease activity than serum measurements of C-reactive peptide, leucocyte count or erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

It has been demonstrated that both calprotectin and lactoferrin levels are significantly higher in patients with active IBD than in healthy controls and those with IBS. In this setting the overall sensitivity and specificity for calprotectin may be as high as 78–100% and 76–100%, respectively, with a similar sensitivity and specificity for lactoferrin of 67–91% and 90–100%, respectively. A meta-analysis of facecal calprotectin studies revealed that at a cut off point of 50 μg/g (ie, above the normal range) calprotectin has a sensitivity and specificity of 89% and 81% in discriminating IBD from non-IBD diagnoses. The same paper shows that at a threshold of 100 μg/g (twice upper limit of normal) the sensitivity and specificity improve to 98% and 91%, respectively. A normal biomarker result in a patient with active symptoms is therefore very reassuring and may be enough, in the correct context where the clinical risk of malignancy is low, to avoid further colonic investigation such as radiology or colonoscopy and allow a positive diagnosis of functional diarrhoea or IBS at first clinic visit.

Fecal calprotectin thresholds in ulcerative colitis are addressed, and the guideline panel felt choosing a single fecal calprotectin cutpoint (< 150 μg/g) is preferable for broad clinical use, while in patients who have recently achieved symptomatic remission after treatment adjustment in the preceding 1–3 months a lower fecal calprotectin < 50 μg/g may be more accurate than < 150 μg/g to rule out moderate to severe active inflammation; in children 2 years or younger, a higher threshold may be needed. The panel did not compare different noninvasive biomarkers due to variable cutoffs, and notes that stool-based tests may be more sensitive for intestinal inflammation compared with serum CRP, although CRP has the convenience of being a blood test.

### Approaches to integrating biomarkers into clinical trials and care pathways as targets for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases [^e71094a9]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

There is no consensus on the best way to integrate biomarkers into inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) research and clinical practice. The International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease aimed to outline biomarker definitions, categories, and operating properties required for their use in registration trials and clinical practice. Using fecal calprotectin as an example, we provide a framework for biomarker development and validation in patients with IBD.

Methods

We reviewed international society guidelines, regulatory agency guidance documents, and standardized reporting guidelines for biomarkers, in combination with publications on fecal calprotectin levels in patients with IBD. We assessed the validity of fecal calprotectin to serve as a surrogate biomarker of IBD activity and outlined a framework for further validation and development of biomarkers.

Results

No endpoints have been fully validated as surrogates of risk of disease complications; mucosal healing is the most valid endpoint used to determine risk of disease complications. Fecal level of calprotectin has not been validated as a biomarker for IBD activity because of lack of technical and clinical reliability, assessment of performance when used as a replacement for endoscopy, and assessment of responsiveness to changes in disease states. The level of fecal calprotectin can be used only as a prognostic factor for disease recurrence in patients in remission after medical or surgical treatment.

Conclusions

We reviewed guidelines, regulatory documents, and publications to identify properties required for the development of biomarkers of IBD activity and areas in need of clarification from regulatory agencies and societies. We propose a path forward for research of biomarkers for IBD.

### Review of fecal biomarkers in inflammatory bowel disease [^302001b2]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

We reviewed potential fecal biomarkers of inflammatory bowel disease and assessed their utility in a range of clinical applications.

Methods

A literature search using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase database was performed, locating all language articles on fecal biomarkers, including calprotectin and lactoferrin. The references of these papers were searched manually for further references.

Results

A wide range of fecal biomarkers have been evaluated in the research setting. Only fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin have translated into useful clinical tools. These biomarkers have demonstrated high sensitivity for organic intestinal disease and good correlation with other measures of disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease.

Conclusions

Fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin are useful triage tools to differentiate organic intestinal disorders from functional disorders. They also have a role in monitoring inflammatory bowel disease activity and predicting relapse.

### Comparison of fecal calprotectin and myeloperoxidase in predicting outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease [^38251ba2]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Although CRP has previously been associated with IBD activity and long-term risk of complications, fecal biomarkers had significantly improved diagnostic precision at identifying a complicated disease course in this cohort. This may be due in part to the lack of specificity of CRP for gastrointestinal inflammation in IBD. The STRIDE-II guidelines support the use of measuring the IBD symptom burden and for normalization of CRP and fCal during clinical assessments. This study reiterates the value of clinical symptom indices (especially in UC), which are simple measures that can be used to guide treatment changes and have an influence on longer-term outcomes in IBD. However, the performance of these indices in prognosticating the longitudinal disease course is significantly improved and augmented by the use of biomarkers. "Normalization" of fCal may be achieved at a target of 250 μg/g given the association of this threshold with disease related complications.

Furthermore, the value of fecal biomarkers in treat-to-target approaches may be significantly greater than serum biomarkers such as CRP. The trade-off in clinical situations, however, is the ease and patient acceptability of obtaining blood sampling compared with fecal analyses and the rapidity of acquiring biomarker results from serum samples. Regardless of these limitations, this study highlights the powerful potential of fCal and fMPO as adjuncts to disease assessment during routine clinical care. Using a combination of fecal biomarkers (either fCal or fMPO), CRP and clinical disease activity provided significant benefit in identifying individuals at risk for developing a more complicated IBD course (Table 4 and Figure 2). This trend remained consistent across a range of risk thresholds for reaching this outcome (Figure 2). Utilizing a combination of clinical disease indices and biomarkers during disease assessment is likely to be helpful in predicting the disease course in individuals who are at low (< 20%) and high (> 50%) risk of achieving disease complications in a 24-month interval (Figure 2). Thus, using the models of care as described in this study may help identify individuals requiring a closer degree of outpatient follow-up and those who may benefit most from escalation of IBD therapies.

### AGA clinical practice update on functional gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: expert review [^60c3c6ff]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Fecal calprotectin (FC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) thresholds — In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), FC levels < 60 μg/g were predictive of deep remission in ulcerative colitis (UC) with 86% sensitivity and 87% specificity, and FC < 40.5 μg/g predicted histological remission with 41% sensitivity and 100% specificity; thresholds of 200–250 μg/g may predict endoscopic remission in both UC and Crohn's disease (CD). FC values < 50 μg/g may be reassuring for a non-IBD etiology of persistent symptoms, whereas 50–250 μg/g can be challenging to interpret; for mild symptoms, serial FC monitoring at 3- to 6-month intervals may be appropriate, and if a flare is suspected, endoscopy with biopsies or dedicated small-bowel imaging in CD should be considered. CRP has poor sensitivity and up to 15% of patients may fail to mount a CRP response.

### Can 2 different fecal calprotectin assays be used interchangeably in IBD treatment? [^753c300e]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Design and Patient Population

This was a single-center cross-sectional study. Consecutive patients of any age with known IBD, in whom FC was requested by their treating physician for general care between January 2017 and April 2017 were included. Feces were collected by patients, brought to the hospital, stored at −20°C upon arrival for 1 to 5 days, and not homogenized before testing, as is common practice in many laboratories. The samples were tested with the following assays: (1) EliA 2 Calprotectin (Thermo Fisher Scientific Phadia, Sweden), which is a commonly used automated fluorescent enzyme immunoassay test; and (2) EK-Cal (Bühlmann Laboratories, Switzerland), which is a manually performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. Samples were tested with both methods on the same day according to the manufacturer's instructions. Baseline characteristics of patients, including clinical disease phenotype and CRP were obtained from their medical charts. The clinical disease phenotype was recorded using the Montreal classification.CRP results were analyzed within 14 days of the FC tests. Disease activity of patients according to their FC level was categorized as follows: (1) low (indicating biochemical remission; FC: 0 to 250 mg/kg), (2) dubious (indicating suspicion of biochemical flare; FC: 250 to 500 mg/kg), and (3) high (indicating a biochemical flare; FC > 500 mg/kg). These cutoff values were based on guidelines for monitoring IBD patients.

Ethical Considerations

This study complied to the declaration of Helsinki. All included patients were informed about the study and got the possibility to withdraw consent for participation. As this study regarded reuse of care data, no official informed consent procedure was required by our ethical committee.

Ulcerative colitis biomarker interpretation — C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin, and fecal lactoferrin may be elevated because of nonintestinal sources of infection or inflammation; in patients with UC who present with elevated biomarkers and disease-related symptoms, stool testing for Clostridioides difficile and other enteric pathogens is important to help rule out other sources of gastrointestinal infections.

### Clinical utility of fecal calprotectin monitoring in asymptomatic patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and practical guide [^dc7c1d15]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In asymptomatic patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), "monitoring" involves repeated testing aimed at early recognition of disease exacerbation. We aimed to determine the usefulness of repeated fecal calprotectin (FC) measurements to predict IBD relapses by a systematic literature review.

Methods

An electronic search was performed in Medline, Embase, and Cochrane from inception to April 2016. Inclusion criteria were prospective studies that followed patients with IBD in remission at baseline and had at least 2 consecutive FC measurements with a test interval of 2 weeks to 6 months. Methodological assessment was based on the second Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) checklist.

Results

A total of 1719 articles were identified; 193 were retrieved for full text review. Six studies met eligibility for inclusion. The time interval between FC tests varied between 1 and 3 months. Asymptomatic patients with IBD who had repeated FC measurements above the study's cutoff level had a 53% to 83% probability of developing disease relapse within the next 2 to 3 months. Patients with repeated normal FC values had a 67% to 94% probability to remain in remission in the next 2 to 3 months. The ideal FC cutoff for monitoring could not be identified because of the limited number studies meeting inclusion criteria and heterogeneity between selected studies.

Conclusions

Two consecutively elevated FC values are highly associated with disease relapse, indicating a consideration to proactively optimize IBD therapy plans. More prospective data are necessary to assess whether FC monitoring improves health outcomes.

### Biomarkers of inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease [^d57c0c5b]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Recent observations suggest that subjective measures of disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are often misleading. Objective measures of inflammation are more closely associated with important long-term outcomes, but often depend upon invasive and costly procedures such as ileocolonoscopy and cross-sectional imaging by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Noninvasive, accurate, and inexpensive measures of intestinal inflammation would allow clinicians to adopt widely the paradigm of adjusting therapies with a goal of controlling inflammation. Blood, stool, and urine markers have all been explored as indicators of intestinal inflammation in IBD, and although none has been universally adopted, some have been well-characterized, and others hold great promise. Serum C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin are among the best-studied noninvasive biomarkers of inflammation in IBD, and their test characteristics have been described in the setting of differentiating IBD from irritable bowel syndrome, for grading inflammation, to describe the response to therapy, and in demonstrating recurrent inflammation after medical or surgically induced remission. High-throughput research platforms, including gene expression arrays, metabolomics and proteomics, are also being applied to the discovery of novel biomarkers of inflammation. It is certain that biomarkers of inflammation will attain growing importance in the clinic as we strive for more effective and cost-effective strategies to treat patients with IBD.

AGA ulcerative colitis (UC) biomarkers — symptomatic remission monitoring strategy — the AGA suggests a monitoring strategy that combines biomarkers and symptoms, rather than symptoms alone; interval biomarker monitoring may be performed every 6–12 mo, fecal biomarkers (fecal calprotectin or fecal lactoferrin) may be optimal for monitoring, and in cases of discrepancy between symptoms and biomarkers, this would generally trigger additional endoscopic testing for confirmation or repeat biomarker testing.

### Fecal calprotectin: current and future perspectives for inflammatory bowel disease treatment [^e831dfc5]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Fecal calprotectin has been widely studied in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) under clinical and therapeutic settings. It showed a good correlation with clinical, endoscopic, and histologic findings. For these reasons, fecal calprotectin is currently one of the most useful tools in IBD care, both in diagnosis and in clinical management. The development of biologic drugs allowed a deeper control of disease, which sometimes reaches histological healing; this is associated with a reduced risk of relapses and complications. The management of IBD treatment is currently carried out with a treat-to-target approach, and mucosal healing is considered at present to be the optimal therapeutic target, but the future is going through histologic remission. Fecal calprotectin is probably the best marker of mucosal healing, but it is correlated also with histologic remission: moreover, it has been recently studied as a possible therapeutic target in the CALM study. We carried out a comprehensive literature review in order to evaluate the role of fecal calprotectin at present and in the future in the management of IBD therapies.

### The utility of biomarkers in the diagnosis and therapy of inflammatory bowel disease [^06e27a3b]. Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Fecal and serologic biomarkers can be used in the diagnosis and management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Fecal markers such as calprotectin and lactoferrin have been studied for their ability to identify patients with IBD, assess disease activity, and predict relapse. Antibodies against Saccharomyces cerevisiae and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic proteins have been used in diagnosis of IBD, to distinguish Crohn's disease (CD) from ulcerative colitis, and to predict the risk of complications of CD. Tests for C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate have been used to assess inflammatory processes and predict the course of IBD progression. Levels of drug metabolites and antibodies against therapeutic agents might be measured to determine why patients do not respond to therapy and to select alternative treatments. This review addresses the potential for biomarker assays to improve treatment strategies and challenges to their use and development.

### Metabolomics facilitate the personalized management in inflammatory bowel disease [^2970a922]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic recurrent inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, is composed of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). These two disorders differ in many respects. CD is characterized by dispersed lesions and transmural inflammation that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract, with the most frequent symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, fistulae, obstruction, and/or perianal lesions. In UC, the lesions are continuous and limited to the mucosal layer of the colon and rectum, which can most commonly lead to bloody diarrhea and rectal bleeding.

The prevalence of IBD is higher in developed countries than developing countries. Nevertheless, the prevalence and incidence of IBD are increasing globally, especially in newly industrialized countries. Therefore, the disease burden will become ever higher in both developed and developing countries. To reduce the disease burden, personalized management, including regular monitoring of disease activity, matching the patients with the proper treatment, and predicting prognosis, is important. Previous studies have referred to a variety of serological and fecal biomarkers, such as serum C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6, fecal calprotectin, and lactoferrin, which serve as surrogate markers for the diagnosis and management of IBD. However, these available biomarkers could only assist with the activity monitoring and prognosis of IBD to some extent, instead of being considered as a gold standard in the personalized management of IBD. Additional studies or techniques are necessary to discover potential and effective biomarkers to guide the management of IBD.

Faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in postoperative Crohn's disease patients correlate well with clinical disease activity as measured by the Harvey Bradshaw Index, whereas the correlation with C-reactive protein was weaker. There was, however, low sensitivity and specificity of the stool tests, particularly in those with mild or moderate clinical symptoms. In addition, this study did not show that faecal calprotectin was predictive of endoscopic (rather than clinical) recurrence. In the POCER trial, faecal calprotectin correlated with endoscopic recurrence, with a level > 100 µg/g stool indicating endoscopic recurrence with a sensitivity of 89% and negative predictive value of 91%. A further multicentre observational cohort study of 86 asymptomatic Crohn's disease patients following ileocaecal resection also identified a cut-off of faecal calprotectin of 100 µg/g as best to discriminate between endoscopic recurrence versus remission. In this study the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value and overall accuracy at 100 µg/g were 95%, 54%, 69%, 93% and 77%, respectively. The TOPPIC trial also showed association of faecal calprotectin with clinical recurrence.TOPPIC also demonstrated the power of faecal calprotectin as a time-dependent variable, in that a 100 µg/g rise in calprotectin led to an 18% increase in the HR for clinical recurrence. It is suggested therefore that the use of faecal calprotectin is most helpful when there is a comparison value for the same patient when in known remission. A rise in the background level in the context of clinical symptoms should trigger further investigation and treatment.

4.10.1.2 Non-inflammatory causes of diarrhoea after ileocolonic resection

Good Practice Recommendation 13. Patients with recurrent symptoms following resection for Crohn's disease, who have no evidence of active inflammation, should have consideration of other diagnoses including bile salt malabsorption, bacterial overgrowth, functional bowel disorders, adhesions, fibrostenotic or anastomotic strictures (Agreement: 97.3%).

Gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with previous surgery for Crohn's disease are not necessarily related to recurrent inflammation. Conversely, minor anastomotic Crohn's disease recurrence is often asymptomatic. Other diagnoses should be considered.

### Fecal biomarkers in the diagnosis and monitoring of Crohn's disease [^5ecb5464]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and monitoring of Crohn's disease has traditionally relied on clinical assessment, serum markers of inflammation, and endoscopic examination. Fecal biomarkers such as calprotectin, lactoferrin, and S100A12 are predominantly derived from neutrophils, are easily detectable in the feces, and are emerging as valuable markers of intestinal inflammation. This review focuses on the role of fecal biomarkers in the diagnosis and monitoring of Crohn's disease, in particular how these biomarkers change with disease activity and remission, how they can be used to monitor the response to medical therapy, their value in predicting clinical relapse, and their role in monitoring the postoperative state.

Biomarkers as targets

Although endoscopic and histological assessments are direct disease measures, they are invasive and costly, and thus noninvasive biomarkers of mucosal healing, treatment response, and/or disease flares are desirable. At the time of STRIDE, there was insufficient evidence supporting the use of biomarkers as surrogate endpoints for treatment optimization. However, data on the clinical utility of biomarkers, particularly FC, have been accumulating. Regular FC monitoring, with treatment escalation in patients with increased levels was associated with a reduced rate of relapse, albeit nonstatistically significant. In addition, mesalamine dose escalation reduced calprotectin levels to < 100 μg/g, and relapse occurred sooner in patients with calprotectin level > 200 μg/g.

New longitudinal observational studies found that escalating FC concentrations may predict relapse in patients with inactive UC as early as 3 months before the presentation of symptoms. Whether FC concentration changes can be used as surrogates of treatment response is still under investigation. Studies have reported that FC concentration reductions may be predictive of endoscopic and histological response to induction therapy and clinical remission (,–). Low FC concentrations also correlate with the absence of mucosal inflammation or structural abnormalities. In addition, reductions in FC during treatment have been found to be dose-responsive. A meta-analysis by Mosli et al. defined an optimum cutoff point for FC as 50 μg/g, but various concentration thresholds have been used across correlative studies. Thus, standardization and validation of a single FC cutoff point is needed to characterize its specificity and sensitivity as a biomarker ready for clinical practice. Because clinical data increasingly support FC as a UC biomarker, the optimal therapeutic target needs to be determined via well-designed disease-modification trials.

Studies are underway to identify and characterize additional promising fecal biomarkers such as leucine-rich α-2 glycoprotein, prostaglandin E-major urinary metabolite, hemoglobin concentration, M2-pyruvate kinase, lactoferrin, and high mobility group box 1 (,–).

There are conflicting data on the utility of serological biomarkers as predictors of disease activity. C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were found to have low accuracy in detecting endoscopic activity in patients with UC. A post hoc analysis of a prospective clinical trial showed that CRP levels failed to discriminate between patients in clinical remission, with endoscopic inflammation and with mucosal healing. In pediatric patients with UC, neither marker was found to be useful in predicting clinical, endoscopic, or histological UC disease activity.

5.5.1.2 Use of faecal calprotectin to inform therapy changes

Statement 113. We suggest that faecal calprotectin is a validated biomarker for endoscopic and histological disease activity. It may therefore be a useful non-invasive parameter to inform decisions on treatment escalation or de-escalation (GRADE: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

There is increasing evidence of the benefits of mucosal healing in reducing future relapse rate. Meta-analyses have shown that faecal calprotectin can discriminate between active and inactive IBD, although accuracy is greater for UC than Crohn's disease. Studies in UC patients in clinical remission show that calprotectin correlates with endoscopic inflammation, and for those with both clinical and endoscopic remission, correlates with histological inflammation. A further study showed that calprotectin levels were a better predictor of relapse over the next year than the presence of histological inflammation.

The information about mucosal inflammation provided by faecal calprotectin levels is a practical means to target increases in drug dosage, and studies are now starting to investigate the value this has in improving long-term outcomes. In UC, patients with clinically inactive disease but raised calprotectin can have levels reduced to those associated with lower risk of relapse by increases in dose. In Crohn's disease the open-label randomised CALM study has shown that calprotectin levels below 250 µg/g stool, CDAI < 150, CRP < 5 mg/L and no prednisolone can be used as a target, with dose escalation of adalimumab and azathioprine at intervals until these levels are reached. At 1 year the 'treat to target' group achieved the primary end-point of a colonoscopic CDEIS score < 4 without deep ulcers in 45.9%, with only 30.3% of the control group achieving this (p = 0.010). Calprotectin may also be useful in predicting the likelihood of future relapse in order to decide who can withdraw therapies. In the STORI study, patients stopping anti-TNF with mucosal healing and a calprotectin ≥ 300 µg/g had a relapse rate of 30%, but those with both mucosal healing and a lower calprotectin had a relapse rate of between 10% and 20%. Serial measurement over time can give a more accurate prediction of the likelihood of relapse.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of Crohn's disease [^829c4f3a]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline on biomarkers for Crohn's disease (CD) reviews the performance of fecal calprotectin, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and the Endoscopic Healing Index across asymptomatic patients, those with varying symptom severity, and those in surgically induced remission, and the guideline panel made 11 conditional recommendations. In CD in symptomatic remission, the panel suggests use of a biomarker- and symptom-based monitoring strategy over symptoms alone, and in this setting a fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g and normal CRP rules out active inflammation, avoiding endoscopic evaluation for assessment of disease activity; however, elevated biomarkers in this setting merit confirmation with endoscopy before treatment adjustment. In CD with mild symptoms, neither normal nor elevated biomarkers alone are sufficiently accurate to determine endoscopic activity, whereas in moderate to severe symptoms, elevated fecal calprotectin or serum CRP suggests endoscopic activity, precluding routine endoscopic assessment for disease activity. In surgically induced remission in low-risk patients on pharmacologic prophylaxis, a normal fecal calprotectin reliably rules out endoscopic recurrence, while in other postoperative settings biomarkers are insufficient for establishing diagnosis of recurrence.

### Measurement of faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in inflammatory bowel disease [^005f77ef]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

A recent meta-analysis from the Netherlands has concluded an impressive potential reduction in the number of adults requiring colonoscopy by 67% and children by 35% through incorporating faecal calprotectin as a screening test for IBD. However the authors do caution that false negative results may lead to delayed diagnosis in 6% of adults and 8% of children.

Faecal biomarkers also have a role in assessing the small intestine, often beyond the reach of conventional colonoscopy as demonstrated by a UK study that compared calprotectin to small bowel barium follow through. Nine of 25 patients with active Crohn's disease had abnormal radiology. In all cases calprotectin was raised to > 60 μg/g and the authors found that a calprotectin < 60 μg/g had a 100% negative predictive value for an abnormal follow through result.

Faecal lactoferrin has also been compared with faecal occult blood (FOB) testing for its predictive capabilities in colorectal disease. A study of 351 patients attending for colonoscopy who gave a stool sample the preceding day found FOB and lactoferrin to have equal specificity (88.7%) in predicting organic pathology including IBD, colorectal cancer and polyps.

Longitudinal monitoring of IBD

For many years treatment success and trial efficacy in IBD has been defined by symptom resolution. When the CDAI was created almost 35 years ago, it was developed as a method of standardising entry into clinical trials but not as a method of individually monitoring patients. Although CDAI and UCAI may give an indirect suggestion of disease activity, they are not direct measures of mucosal inflammation and may be raised by non-inflammatory symptoms. Faecal biomarkers may challenge the supremacy of the CDAI and UCAI by providing a real time indication of disease activity that can be measured longitudinally and that correlates well with clinical, endoscopic and histological activity in IBD.

It has previously been shown that normalisation of calprotectin is a surrogate marker of endoscopic mucosal healing in patients being treated for active IBD. Mucosal healing may be the optimal outcome of therapy in IBD, as it is associated with more sustained clinical remission and a reduced need for surgery. A raised or normal biomarker result in a patient with IBD can therefore be a very useful decision making aid when investigating changing symptoms that may be due to an inflammatory flare of the disease, co-existing IBS, non-inflammatory complications (eg, adhesions), or post operative changes such as bile acid malabsorption or short bowel syndrome.

### Questions and answers on the role of fecal lactoferrin as a biological marker in inflammatory bowel disease [^fb7422fa]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Among the available fecal biomarkers for the diagnosis and monitoring of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), only calprotectin and lactoferrin have translated into useful clinical tools. Lactoferrin can be detected using simple and cheap techniques and it has excellent stability in feces over a long period of time. Fecal lactoferrin has a good diagnostic precision for separating organic and functional intestinal disease. However, a negative fecal lactoferrin test should be interpreted merely as the absence of significant neutrophilic intestinal inflammation. The mean sensitivity and specificity of the fecal lactoferrin determination for the diagnosis of IBD is 80% and 82%, respectively. Some studies have suggested a lower accuracy of lactoferrin when compared with calprotectin for the diagnosis of IBD, indicating that more studies on this topic are necessary. A parallel between fecal lactoferrin levels and IBD activity estimated with clinical, endoscopic, and histological parameters has been confirmed. However, this correlation seems to be lower in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis, mainly when Crohn's disease patients with purely ileal disease are considered. Fecal lactoferrin determination may be useful in predicting impending clinical relapse in IBD patients. Fecal lactoferrin may be a helpful noninvasive diagnostic tool for monitoring therapeutic efficacy, mainly on mucosal healing, as a decreasing concentration of lactoferrin can be interpreted as a marker of therapeutic response. Finally, in patients with Crohn's disease who have undergone ileocolonic resection, those with higher lactoferrin fecal levels might be more prone to postsurgical recurrence.

### Measurement of faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in inflammatory bowel disease [^2864366a]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

A recent study has looked at whether calprotectin can give insight into the symptoms of patients previously labelled as having concomitant IBS and IBD. The study found that 59.7% of patients with Crohn's disease and 38.6% of patients with UC in clinical remission fulfilled the Rome II criteria for IBS. However, they found that in these groups, calprotectin levels were significantly elevated above normal and were higher than in those patients without IBS symptoms. This suggests that some patients may be mislabelled as having concomitant IBS when in fact they have uncontrolled IBD driving their symptoms. Consequently, calprotectin may be able to help identify those patients who may benefit from disease-modifying treatment rather than symptomatic treatment.

Many studies have shown both biomarkers to correlate strongly with invasive methods of determining extent and severity of mucosal inflammation such as 99-technetium white cell scanning and colonoscopy in both adults and children. Equally, overall the biomarkers have been found to correlate well with clinical disease activity. However there have been some exceptions demonstrating poor clinical correlation between CDAI and faecal biomarkers, but good correlation between endoscopic activity and faecal biomarkers. Rather than this representing a flaw in the use of biomarkers, it further highlights the problem that clinical indices of disease activity can underestimate the level of mucosal inflammation.

### Surrogate fecal biomarkers in inflammatory bowel disease: rivals or complementary tools of fecal calprotectin? [^8b9962d7]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current noninvasive methods for assessing intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remain unsatisfactory. Along with C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fecal calprotectin (FC) is the standard test for assessing IBD activity, even though its specificity and accuracy are not optimal and it lacks a validated cutoff. Over the past few decades, several fecal markers released from intestinal inflammatory cells have been investigated in IBD; they are the subject of this systematic review.

Methods

A systematic electronic search of the English literature up to April 2017 was performed using Medline and the Cochrane Library. Only papers written in English that analyzed fecal biomarkers in IBD were included. In vitro studies, animal studies, studies on blood/serum samples, and studies analyzing FC or fecal lactoferrin alone were excluded.

Results

Out of 1023 citations, 125 eligible studies were identified. Data were grouped according to each fecal marker including S100A12, high-mobility group box 1, neopterin, polymorphonuclear neutrophil elastase, fecal hemoglobin, alpha1-antitrypsin, human neutrophil peptides, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, chitinase 3-like-1, matrix metalloproteinase 9, lysozyme, M2-pyruvate kinase, myeloperoxidase, fecal eosinophil proteins, human beta-defensin-2, and beta-glucuronidase. Some of these markers showed a high sensitivity and specificity and correlated with disease activity, response to therapy, and mucosal healing. Furthermore, they showed a potential utility in the prediction of clinical relapse.

Conclusions

Several fecal biomarkers have the potential to become useful tools complementing FC in IBD diagnosis and monitoring. However, wide variability in their accuracy in assessment of intestinal inflammation suggests the need for further studies.

### Faecal calprotectin is the biomarker that best distinguishes remission from different degrees of endoscopic activity in Crohn's disease [^2f7bcced]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hemogram alterations, such as anaemia, may be associated with CD inflammation. The anaemia has multiple origins, such as chronic disease anaemia, nutritional anaemia (deficiency of B12 vitamin, folic acid, and/or iron), or being secondary to medication. Increased platelet count is also an inflammatory activity marker, resulting in increased production of thrombopoietin due to interleukin-6 stimulation. Platelets participate in the perpetuation of the process since they release, in turn, pro-inflammatory mediators.

Faecal markers, such as calprotectin and lactoferrin, are identified and quantified proteins in the faeces, and their measurement is useful since they are noninvasive, low cost, low risk, highly specific for intestinal inflammatory processes, and highly correlated to the endoscopic exam. A review of the literature has shown a correlation between endoscopic scores and faecal calprotectin (fCal). However, few studies have sought to establish cut-off points to define the presence and degrees of inflammatory activities. In the Brazilian population with CD, there are no studies comparing fCal with endoscopic scores. With the increased incidence and prevalence of the disease not only in this country but also throughout Latin America, evaluation of the usefulness of faecal calprotectin in patients in these countries is necessary.

The present study sought to evaluate CD inflammatory activity using clinical and noninvasive laboratory markers (hemogram, C-reactive protein and faecal calprotectin) and correlate them to endoscopic findings, evaluated through the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease – SES-CD. The objective was to determine the ability of markers to discriminate between remission, mild, and moderate to severe activity during colonoscopy.

### Fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin for the prediction of inflammatory bowel disease relapse [^5c54a029]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of the study was to determine the role of fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in the prediction of inflammatory bowel disease relapses, both in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), in a large, long-term, follow-up study.

Methods

The prospective multicenter study included CD and UC patients who had been in clinical remission for 6 months. At baseline, patients provided a single stool sample for calprotectin and lactoferrin determination. Follow-up was 12 months in patients showing no relapse and until activity flare in relapsing patients.

Results

In all, 163 patients (89 CD, 74 UC) were included. Twenty-six patients (16%) relapsed during follow-up. Calprotectin concentrations in patients who suffered a relapse were higher than in nonrelapsing patients (239 ± 150 versus 136 ± 158 microg/g; P < 0.001). Relapse risk was higher in patients having high (> 150 microg/g) calprotectin concentrations (30% versus 7.8%; P < 0.001) or positive lactoferrin (25% versus 10%; P < 0.05). Fecal calprotectin (> 150 microg/g) sensitivity and specificity to predict relapse were 69% and 69%, respectively. Corresponding values for lactoferrin were 62% and 65%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to predict relapse using calprotectin determination was 0.73 (0.69 for UC and 0.77 for CD). Better results were obtained when only colonic CD disease or only relapses during the first 3 months were considered (100% sensitivity). High fecal calprotectin levels or lactoferrin positivity was associated with clinical relapse in Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and both fecal tests were associated with relapse in the multivariate analysis.

Conclusions

Fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin determination may be useful in predicting impending clinical relapse-especially during the following 3 months-in both CD and UC patients.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline — biomarker thresholds to rule out active inflammation in CD in symptomatic remission: in patients with established CD in symptomatic remission with recent confirmation of endoscopic remission (within 3 mo prior, without change in therapy and clinical status) and unknown endoscopic remission status, the PICO evaluates fecal calprotectin, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and EHI cutoffs to accurately rule out active inflammation. The intervention thresholds are fecal calprotectin < 50 μg/g, < 150 μg/g, or < 250 μg/g, normal CRP (< 5 mg/L), and EHI < 20, compared against fecal calprotectin > 50 μg/g, > 150 μg/g, or > 250 μg/g, elevated CRP (> 5 mg/L), and EHI > 20. Outcomes are framed as beneficial detection of endoscopic inflammation with TP rate and TN rate, and harms including FN rate (false reassurance that inflammation has resolved, leading to increased risk of flares due to undertreatment) and FP rate (excess endoscopic procedures to rule out inflammation).

### A meta-analysis of the utility of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fecal calprotectin, and fecal lactoferrin to exclude inflammatory bowel disease in adults with IBS [^c082d15d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is viewed as a diagnosis of exclusion by most providers. The aim of our study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the utility of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fecal calprotectin, and fecal lactoferrin to distinguish between patients with IBS and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and healthy controls (HCs).

Methods

A systematic online database search was performed. Included studies were prospective, adult, diagnostic cohort studies with any of the four tests. The means and s.d. values of biomarker logarithms were estimated based on studies that gave medians and either confidence intervals for the median, interquartile ranges, or ranges. We used a Naive Bayes approach to estimate the probability of being a HC, having IBS, or having IBD based on the biomarker values.

Results

Systematic review identified 1,252 citations. After cross-referencing medical subject headings, detailed evaluation identified 140 potentially relevant journal articles/abstracts for CRP, ESR, calprotectin, and lactoferrin of which 4, 4, 8, and 2 fulfilled our inclusion criteria, respectively. None of the biomarkers reliably distinguished between IBS and healthy controls. At a CRP level of ≤ 0.5 or calprotectin level of ≤ 40μg/g, there was a ≤ 1% probability of having IBD. Individual analysis of ESR and lactoferrin had little clinical utility.

Conclusion

CRP and calprotectin of ≤ 0.5 or 40, respectively, essentially excludes IBD in patients with IBS symptoms. The addition of CRP and calprotectin to symptom-based criteria may improve the confident diagnosis of IBS.

Faecal CP allows evaluation of IBD course

Most clinical studies indicate a strong correlation between faecal CP concentration and clinical or endoscopic disease activity. For example, one study associated faecal CP concentrations, i.e.g.rade 0 (≤ 16 (10–30) μg/g), grade 1 (~35 (25–48) μg/g), grade 2 (~102 (44–159 μg/g), grade 3 (~235 (176–319) μg/g) and grade 4 (~611 (406–868) μg/g), with endoscopic UC activity. Zollner et al compared clinical and endoscopic activity-related correlations between faecal CP and faecal lipocalin-2 in a cohort of 132 patients (72 patients with CD, 40 controls) and confirmed the diagnostic equivalence of both biomarkers in IBD. Analysis by confocal microscopy and immunocytochemistry implicated strong expression of CP in granulocytes, macrophages and to a lesser extent the intestinal epithelium in patients with IBD (see also figure 1). Data generally indicate that faecal CP is significantly decreased in patients with clinical and endoscopic remission and that values of > 150 µg/g are mainly associated with disease relapse. However, other studies reported higher cut-off values of > 200–300 µg/g to implicate disease relapse. Recently published Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (STRIDE-II) recommendations by the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IOIBD) announced faecal CP values of < 150 µg/g as goal reflecting remission, stating that faecal CP values ranging from 150 to 250 µg/g are a grey zone. In contrast, a patient population from China demonstrates a cut-off of 50 µg/g to be suitable for the differentiation between active and inactive UC, such that studies suggest different cut-off values for active disease which may be explained by the definition of remission, assay variability and ethnic differences of faecal CP concentration. Prior to clinically based diagnosis of a flare, faecal CP is reported to be elevated ~8 weeks in advance. In contrast, patients who maintain remission usually present faecal CP concentrations of < 60 µg/g. Notably, Theede et al reported that faecal CP evaluation is sufficient to determine risk of relapse 6 and 12 months in advance and to evaluate mucosal healing in UC. Based on a plethora of studies, clinical decision-making in IBD is indicated in figure 2B. Faecal CP is also used as biomarker to identify postoperative disease recurrence in adultand paediatric patients with IBD. A meta-analysis including nine studies indicated that a faecal CP cut-off of > 150 µg/g is likely to have the best overall accuracy to predict postoperative endoscopic recurrence with a sensitivity of ~70%. Notably, current recommendations suggest endoscopy (rather than sole biomarker screening) to detect postoperative disease recurrence. Clinical trials are necessary to establish faecal CP (rather than endoscopy) to guide therapeutic decisions and to establish treatment algorithms postoperatively. Only then, clinical guidelines may recommend specific faecal CP concentrations to indicate disease activity and the requirement for therapeutic intervention, which is currently being avoided.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of Crohn's disease [^87dd4552]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Rationale and practical use of biomarkers in CD: The panel noted that patients and providers "should incorporate both test performance and the downstream consequence of FP and FN rates", and "there may be instances when patients and providers may be willing to accept higher (> 5%) FN rates". For implementation, "the guideline panel preferred choosing a single fecal calprotectin cutoff (< 150 μg/g) that is applicable to multiple scenarios", while acknowledging acceptable alternatives such as "cutoff of fecal calprotectin < 250 μg/g in asymptomatic patients with known endoscopic remission". In small bowel–dominant CD, "lower fecal calprotectin thresholds, such as < 150 μg/g or < 50 μg/g, may yield lower FN rates". Evidence for serial use was limited, and "in asymptomatic patients with elevated biomarkers… the panel recommended endoscopic assessment before treatment adjustment to minimize likelihood of overtreatment", though "it may be reasonable… to consider serial monitoring of biomarkers". The panel also stated that "the sensitivity of fecal calprotectin was greater when compared with CRP", while "CRP may be more readily measured and integrated into routine clinical practice".

### Comparison of fecal inflammatory markers in Crohn's disease [^3fe5cff0]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Fecal biomarkers are used increasingly to monitor Crohn's disease (CD). However, the relative accuracy of different markers in identifying inflammation has been poorly evaluated. We evaluated fecal calprotectin (FC), lactoferrin (FL), and S100A12 (FS) using endoscopic validation in a prospective study of the progression of CD after intestinal resection.

Methods

Data were collected from 135 participants in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial aimed at preventing postoperative CD recurrence. Three hundred nineteen stool samples were tested for FC, FL, and FS preoperatively and 6, 12, and 18 months after resection. Colonoscopy was performed at 6 and/or 18 months. Endoscopic recurrence was assessed blindly using the Rutgeerts score. C-reactive protein (CRP) and Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) were assessed.

Results

FC, FL, and FS concentrations were elevated preoperatively (median: 1347, 40.9, and 8.4 μg/g, respectively). At 6 months postoperatively, marker concentrations decreased (166, 3.0, 0.9 μg/g) and were higher in recurrent disease than remission (275 versus 72 μg/g, P < 0.001; 5.7 versus 1.6 μg/g, P = 0.007; 2.0 versus 0.8 μg/g, P = 0.188). FC > 135 μg/g, FL > 3.4 μg/g, and FS > 10.5 μg/g indicated endoscopic recurrence (score ≥ i2) with a sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.87, 0.66, and 91%; 0.70, 0.68, and 81%; 0.91, 0.12, and 71%, respectively. FC and FL correlated significantly with the presence and severity of endoscopic recurrence, whereas FS, CRP and CDAI did not.

Conclusions

FC was the optimal fecal marker for monitoring disease activity in postoperative CD and was superior to CRP and CDAI. FL offered modest sensitivity for detecting recurrent disease, whereas S100A12 was sensitive but had low specificity and NPV.

### The value of fecal calprotectin measured by fluorescent immunochromatography assay in evaluating clinical and endoscopic activity in ulcerative colitis [^7d907652]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a subtype of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), characterized by mucosal ulceration. Generally, UC starts in the rectum and can extend continuously and proximally to the entire colon. The Montreal classification of the extent of UC is divided into three subgroups: E1 (ulcerative proctitis), E2 (left-sided UC) and E3 (extensive UC).

The clinical course of UC is characterized by alternating periods of remissions and relapses. To avoid disease progression, regular colonoscopy is necessary, as it remains the gold standard for monitoring endoscopic activity. However, colonoscopy is an invasive and inconvenient procedure. Therefore, serum biomarkers have been explored as indicators of intestinal inflammation in patients with IBD. C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are widely used to monitor inflammation flareups. However, they are elevated in many inflammatory diseases and poorly correlated with intestinal diseases. Fecal biomarkers, on the other hand, can compensate for these deficiencies. They are more specific to intestinal inflammation.

Calprotectin is primarily derived from neutrophils. Since it can be detected in stools, there is a large amount of evidence suggesting that fecal calprotectin (FC) levels correlate well with the activity of intestinal diseases. Currently, it is the most commonly used fecal biomarker for the diagnosis and management of IBD, which helps reduce the frequency of colonoscopy. However, there are still some limitations to using FC in predicting disease activity. As detection methods of FC testing have not been standardized and results vary widely between different methods, there remains no consensus on the optimal cut-off values to define active UC.

Fluorescent immunochromatography assay (FICA) is a method that allows for rapid detection of FC, and there are fewer reports on the optimal FC cut-off values for this method. To define the optimal FC cut-off values measured by FICA would help us to better manage patients with UC. Therefore, the study aimed to assess the correlation between FC levels and disease activity and identify optimal cut-off values for predicting clinical and endoscopic activity in UC using a detection method based on FICA instead of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

### Fecal lactoferrin and calprotectin after ileocolonic resection for Crohn's disease [^6c0f8341]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study was designed to assess the role of fecal lactoferrin and calprotectin as markers of intestinal inflammation in patients with Crohn's disease who have undergone ileocolonic resection.

Methods

Sixty-three patients who had undergone ileocolonic resection for Crohn's disease with a median follow-up of 40.5 (range, 5–102) months were enrolled. Clinical examination and blood test were performed, and fecal lactoferrin and calprotectin levels were dosed. The predictors for fecal lactoferrin and calprotectin levels that resulted to be significant at the univariate analyses were included in two multiple regression analysis models.

Results

The mean lactoferrin level was 21 ± 3.9 microg/g and the mean calprotectin fecal level was 247 ± 22.7 ng/ml. C-reactive protein levels (P < 0.01), calprotectin levels (P < 0.01), and the presence of clinical recurrence (P = 0.04) resulted to be independent predictors of lactoferrin levels. Only lactoferrin levels resulted to be an independent predictor for calprotectin fecal levels (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Crohn's disease patients maintain high fecal levels of lactoferrin and calprotectin at long-term follow-up after resection of the diseased bowel even in case of clinical remission. The significant correlation between the two fecal markers may be the expression of the ongoing intestinal inflammation. Only lactoferrin significantly correlated with C-reactive protein and showed a reliable threshold value for systemic inflammation. Lactoferrin fecal levels may be a reliable indicator for intestinal inflammation influencing the systemic inflammatory status. The third predictor of lactoferrin fecal level was the presence of episodes of clinical recurrence during the postoperative follow-up.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a costly condition in terms of morbidity and healthcare utilization, with an increasing prevalence now approaching 1% in the Western world. Endoscopic assessment of IBD remains the gold standard for diagnosis, evaluation of treatment response and determination of post-operative recurrence, but is expensive and invasive. Biomarkers can facilitate non-invasive disease assessment, with C-reactive protein and faecal calprotectin as the most widely available biomarkers in current clinical practice. This narrative review summarizes the evidence for their use in both UC and CD and offers practical guidance for healthcare providers taking into account the limitations of biomarker interpretation. We present evidence for the future use of novel biomarkers in IBD and discuss how biomarker discovery could deliver the goal of precision medicine in IBD.

### Faecal calprotectin: a marker of inflammation throughout the intestinal tract [^fa378eef]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Only a small proportion of patients with abdominal discomfort have organic disease, but a correct diagnosis can seldom be made by simple clinical examination. Additional diagnostic procedures must be employed, but these are expensive and demanding and carry a certain risk. Assessment of faecal concentrations of the neutrophil granulocyte-derived protein calprotectin can be used as a screening test — an 'ESR of the gut' — to select patients for further examination. The test can be performed on 1–2 g of random stool samples that can be sent to the laboratory by ordinary mail since the protein is remarkably stable in stools. The test has high sensitivities and specificities for gastrointestinal cancers and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Faecal calprotectin levels reflect the disease activity in IBD and can be used to monitor the response to treatment and detect relapses.

5.5.1.1 Faecal calprotectin in the assessment of disease activity in known IBD

Statement 112. We suggest that, in IBD patients where it is unclear if symptoms are due to ongoing inflammation or other non-inflammatory causes (such as bile acid malabsorption, functional bowel disorder or short bowel), faecal calprotectin measurement may be used to provide evidence of mucosal inflammation (GRADE: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.8%).

Faecal calprotectin is a useful surrogate marker of inflammatory activity in IBD. It correlates well with endoscopic inflammation in UCand in Crohn's disease. If it is unclear whether new symptoms represent a relapse or other causes, particularly in Crohn's disease, then calprotectin is useful to confirm active inflammation and can be a non-invasive alternative to flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy and cross-sectional imaging. If relapsing disease is clinically obvious, then measurement is not necessary.

A recent meta-analysis including data for 2822 IBD patients and 298 controls found that a calprotectin cut-off of 50 µg/g had the best sensitivity (90.6%) to detect endoscopically active disease, with specificity performing best (78.2%) at levels > 100 µg/g. A separate meta-analysis has shown that a threshold of 250 µg/g provides better specificity of 82% than thresholds of 100 µg/g and 50 µg/g (specificity of 66% and 60%, respectively) in differentiating active IBD from remission. However, a faecal calprotectin of 250 µg/g had a relatively lower sensitivity of 80% compared with a sensitivity of 84% and 92% at cut-offs of 100 µg/g and 50 µg/g, respectively.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of Crohn's disease [^6645533f]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Biomarkers are used frequently for evaluation and monitoring of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). This American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guideline is intended to support practitioners in decisions about the use of biomarkers for the management of CD.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of content experts and guideline methodologists used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework to formulate patient-centered clinical questions and review evidence on the performance of fecal calprotectin, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and Endoscopic Healing Index in patients with established CD who were asymptomatic, had symptoms of varying severity, or were in surgically induced remission. Biomarker performance was assessed against the gold standard of endoscopic activity, defined as a Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease ≥ 3. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Evidence-to-Decision framework to develop recommendations for use of biomarkers in various settings. Implementation considerations were formulated for each recommendation to inform clinical practice.

Results

The guideline panel made 11 conditional recommendations. In patients with CD in symptomatic remission, the panel suggests use of a biomarker- and symptom-based monitoring strategy over symptoms alone. In patients in symptomatic remission, a fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g and normal CRP rules out active inflammation, avoiding endoscopic evaluation for assessment of disease activity. However, elevated biomarkers in this setting merit confirmation with endoscopy before treatment adjustment. In patients with CD with mild symptoms, neither normal nor elevated biomarkers alone are sufficiently accurate to determine endoscopic activity. In patients with CD with moderate to severe symptoms, elevated fecal calprotectin or serum CRP suggests endoscopic activity, precluding routine endoscopic assessment for disease activity. In patients with CD in surgically induced remission in low-risk patients on pharmacologic prophylaxis, a normal fecal calprotectin reliably rules out endoscopic recurrence. In other postoperative settings, the panel suggests endoscopic assessment for establishing postoperative recurrence.

Conclusions

In patients with CD, fecal calprotectin and serum CRP can inform disease management in both asymptomatic and symptomatic disease. Discordance between symptom assessment and biomarker value may merit endoscopic evaluation for confirmation of status of disease activity.

Fecal calprotectin — cutoffs for ruling out or ruling in endoscopic inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD) symptomatic remission: In patients with known endoscopic remission, there was "moderate certainty of evidence supporting the use of fecal calprotectin cutoffs of < 50 μg/g… and low certainty of evidence supporting the use of fecal calprotectin cutoffs of < 150 μg/g and < 250 μg/g… to rule out endoscopic inflammation", with imprecision noted because "95% CI exceeded the maximal tolerable FN rate of 5%". In patients with unknown endoscopic remission status, certainty was "low for calprotectin < 50 μg/g and very low for cutoffs of < 150 μg/g and < 250 μg/g… because both the point estimate and 95% CI are higher than FN threshold of 5%". For ruling in disease, "in patients with CD in symptomatic remission… there was very low certainty of evidence supporting the use of any proposed cutoff of elevated fecal calprotectin… due to unacceptably high rates of FP… and inconsistency".

### Role of fecal calprotectin as a biomarker of intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease [^4f8046b4]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Calprotectin is an abundant neutrophil protein found in both plasma and stool that is markedly elevated in infectious and inflammatory conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We conducted a systematic review of the published literature regarding fecal calprotectin to evaluate its potential as a noninvasive marker of neutrophilic intestinal inflammation. Reference ranges for fecal calprotectin have been established in healthy adults and children, and elevated concentrations of fecal calprotectin have been demonstrated in numerous studies of patients with IBD. Fecal calprotectin correlates well with histological inflammation as detected by colonoscopy with biopsies and has been shown successfully to predict relapses and detect pouchitis in patients with IBD. Fecal calprotectin has been shown to consistently differentiate IBD from irritable bowel syndrome because it has excellent negative predictive value in ruling out IBD in undiagnosed, symptomatic patients. Fecal calprotectin also may be useful in determining whether clinical symptoms in patients with known IBD are caused by disease flares or noninflammatory complications/underlying irritable bowel syndrome and in providing objective evidence of response to treatment. Although more studies are needed to define fully the role of fecal calprotectin, convincing studies and growing clinical experience point to an expanded role in the diagnosis and management of IBD.

### Faecal calprotectin or lactoferrin can identify postoperative recurrence in Crohn's disease [^77094fd2]. The British Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Identifying Crohn's disease recurrence in symptomatic patients after ileocaecal resection is difficult. The aim of this study was to evaluate faecal concentrations of granulocyte degradation products in this setting.

Methods

A postoperative cohort of 13 patients was followed prospectively for 1 year with regular faecal calprotectin (FC) and lactoferrin (FL) measurements. A second postoperative cohort (median 24 months after resection) of 104 patients provided a single stool sample. Faecal measurements were compared with symptom diaries, the Harvey Bradshaw Index, endoscopic examination, C-reactive protein and platelet measurement.

Results

In the uncomplicated course, both markers normalized within 2 months. Both FC and FL correlated significantly with Harvey Bradshaw Index (P < 0.001). Twenty-eight patients with severely clinically active disease had high mean(s.e.) levels of FC (661.1(119.1) microg/g) and FL (116.6(32.2) microg/g); and 43 with clinically inactive disease had low levels of FC (70.2(27.1) microg/g) and FL (5.9(2.4) microg/g). In patients with mild to moderately clinically active disease, FC and FL identified individuals with and without recurrent inflammatory disease. Faecal markers were more accurate at predicting clinical disease activity than C-reactive protein, platelet count or endoscopic appearance.

Conclusion

FC and FL are non-invasive tests that can help to identify disease recurrence in symptomatic postoperative patients.

### Measurement of faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in inflammatory bowel disease [^b0c24763]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Furthermore it has been shown that calprotectin correlates better with histological disease activity than macroscopic inflammation judged by clinicians at endoscopy. Again this suggests that biomarkers can provide accurate non-invasive information regarding mucosal disease activity, without necessarily the need for colonoscopy.

There are limited but very encouraging studies regarding faecal biomarkers to assess the response to infliximab treatment in Crohn's disease. Faecal lactoferrin has been measured in a paediatric population of five patients with severe Crohn's disease as determined by the paediatric CDAI receiving infliximab induction. Within 7–10 days the concentration of faecal lactoferrin reduced by 93.43 ± 4.49% towards baseline, probably reflecting mucosal healing although endoscopy was not performed to correlate this. A further study endoscopically assessing response to treatment found that in those who achieved endoscopic remission after infusion, faecal biomarkers fell from a pre-infusion mean of 1891 μg/g calprotectin (range 813–2434) and 92.4 μg/g lactoferrin (range 35.5–235.6), to a normal post-infusion mean of 27 μg/g calprotectin (range 13–130) and 1.9 μg/g lactoferrin (range 0.0–2.1), therefore providing a surrogate marker of response and also mucosal healing.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of Crohn's disease [^42d09ec2]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA practical application of biomarkers advises that application of all biomarkers in clinical practice should be guided by downstream implications, including risk of consequent treatment decisions (low-risk treatment adjustment vs high-risk treatment adjustment), and that test performance thresholds (acceptable FP and FN rates) may vary for patient–provider teams depending on the decision. Fecal calprotectin assays may not be interchangeable and the same assay should be used for a given patient to compare performance across time; stool sampling can vary with within-day variation, and when results are borderline or unexpected repeat fecal calprotectin testing or endoscopic evaluation for confirmation may be required. Because there are inter-individual differences in biomarker elevation and in a subset of patients biomarkers may correlate poorly with endoscopic activity, overall performance and confidence may be higher when biomarkers have been longitudinally observed to correlate with the patient's endoscopic disease activity during both active disease and remission.

NASPGHAN inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — laboratory testing and biomarkers: Annual urinalysis and yearly to twice-yearly measurement of serum creatinine is worthwhile in children and young adults receiving aminosalicylate therapy, and a complete blood cell count with inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) may be useful as indicators of subclinical disease activity; annual or biannual aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and total bilirubin may be useful given potential hepatic damage from IBD or its treatments. Noninvasive stool markers (fecal lactoferrin and calprotectin) correlate with clinical and endoscopic indices and elevated levels have been shown near clinical relapse, suggesting a potential to "predict" relapse; however, there are no sufficient data to recommend collection of "surveillance" stool markers during routine office visits.

METHODS

Study Design and Study Population

This retrospective study enrolled 61 patients with UC or CD diagnosed and staged according to established criteria, treated with biologics (infliximab, adalimumab, and vedolizumab), and monitored as standard of care in our IBD center through the measurement of FL levels. Five of these patients were treated with infliximab-dyyb (Inflectra), but no distinction was made between Inflectra and infliximab-Remicade. The FL levels and clinical/laboratory data were collected from the patients' electronic medical records. Data collected involved 2 different groups of patients.

The first group (therapeutic interval group) consisted of patients on maintenance monotherapy in clinical remission; data included FL at baseline (measured within 1 month of initiating therapy) and FL measured at different times during the biologic therapeutic interval (8 weeks for vedolizumab/infliximab, 2 weeks for adalimumab). The objective of this study was to confirm our original observation (obtained with FC) showing that in patients responding to biologics, fecal inflammatory markers mirror mucosal inflammation, which is inversely correlated to serum drug concentrations, in a timely way. It was anticipated that FL fluctuation during the therapeutic interval would not be detected in patients in profound/biologic remission.

### Construct validity of the toronto IBD global endoscopic reporting score compared to inflammatory biomarkers after 12-month follow-up [^93cc07f9]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical indices

Clinical disease activity such as HBI for CD and Mayo 9-point score for UC were recorded at the time of baseline endoscopic assessment and in each clinical visit (3 months, 6 months, 12 months)

A total HBI score > 7 is indicative of moderate-to-severe clinical disease activity.

A total Mayo score > 4 is indicative of moderate-to-severe clinical disease activity.

Inflammatory biomarkers

Inflammatory biomarkers such as FC and CRP were collected at the time of baseline endoscopic assessment and in each clinical visit (3-month, 6-month, 12-month).

Fecal calprotectin (FC): FC levels correlate strongly with clinical and mucosal disease activity in colonic, ileal, ileocolonic CD, and UC. In the current study, fresh stool samples were used to measure FC using a high-range immunoassay. FC was further categorized by levels > 100 μg/g, ≥ 200 μg/g, and ≥ 800 μg/g. FC ≤ 100 μg/g represents inactive disease. Achieving a level of inactive disease would be indicative of effective treatment. Stool samples for FC were collected at each visit.

C-reactive protein (CRP): A CRP level ≤ 0.5 mg/dL is defined as being within the normal range. In this current study, CRP levels were further categorized as levels > 0.5 mg/dL and ≥ 1 mg/dL. Blood samples for CRP were collected at each visit. Achieving a normal level would be indicative of effective treatment.

Patients who continued to have an FC level ≥ 800 μg/g and/or a CRP level ≥ 1.0 mg/dL after the 12-month follow-up despite undergoing advanced therapy and/or requiring steroids based on acceptable standard-of-care guidelines, were defined as refractory to medication. Patients with these exceedingly elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers represent a subset of the total sample population who continue to not respond to therapeutics, continue to have significant disease burden, and experience a loss of response to standard-of-care therapeutics.
