## Question

Syncope versus loss of consciousness.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to distinguish syncope from other causes of transient loss of consciousness and to structure the evaluation, risk stratification, and initial management accordingly. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions of transient loss of consciousness and syncope to anchor the diagnostic frame. Then, I should verify the accepted mechanism-based classification of syncope. Next, I will examine the initial core assessment with history, physical examination including orthostatic blood pressures, and ECG. After that, I need to risk-stratify for short-term adverse outcomes and decide disposition. Then, I should review targeted testing pathways, distinguishing what to do and what to avoid. Finally, I will consider mechanism-specific cues for management and special populations such as older adults, making sure I double-check red flags that point toward arrhythmic or structural causes versus non-syncopal mimics like seizures.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so we do not commit a category error at the outset: transient loss of consciousness is an abrupt, brief, and fully reversible loss of consciousness, of which syncope is the subset due to transient global cerebral hypoperfusion, whereas seizures, psychogenic pseudosyncope, cataplexy, and other entities comprise non-syncopal TLOC; the diagnostic task starts by deciding whether the index event shows the syncopal pattern of sudden onset, short duration, and rapid complete recovery without post-ictal confusion, versus features more typical of seizures such as lateral tongue biting, prolonged post-ictal confusion, or focal deficits, or features of psychogenic episodes such as prolonged apparent unresponsiveness with eyes closed and normal hemodynamics, and I should confirm this structure with multidisciplinary sources and ESC task force definitions to avoid misclassification [^111kTmjw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before we classify syncope properly; syncope itself is mechanism-based into reflex (neurally mediated, including vasovagal, situational, and carotid sinus), orthostatic hypotension (initial, classic, delayed; neurogenic vs non-neurogenic), and cardiac syncope (arrhythmic or due to structural cardiopulmonary disease), and getting the category right determines urgency, monitoring, and therapy, so I should double-check these groupings against ESC 2018 and contemporary reviews before proceeding [^111DXZGp] [^111kTmjw] [^113k4pDA] [^117EM68q].

> I will now examine the core initial assessment because most diagnoses are suggested here: a structured history with eyewitness input if available, a focused examination with orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate measured after 5 minutes supine and again at 1 and 3 minutes upright, and a 12-lead ECG in all patients; I need to ensure I apply the orthostatic thresholds correctly (drop in SBP ≥ 20 mmHg or DBP ≥ 10 mmHg, or SBP < 90 mmHg) and document symptom reproduction, and I should confirm that an initial ECG is universally recommended to screen for conduction disease, ischemia, repolarization abnormalities, pre-excitation, and ventricular hypertrophy [^113k4pDA] [^112DCV2o] [^111kcQ1q] [^114YYgn9].

> Wait, let me verify what the ECG can realistically yield; while some summaries state the initial evaluation diagnoses up to about 50% of cases, that estimate reflects combined history–exam–ECG rather than ECG alone, so I should be careful not to overstate test yield, yet certain ECG findings are red flags that strongly suggest arrhythmic syncope: persistent sinus bradycardia with inappropriate rate, pauses ≥ 3 seconds awake, Mobitz II or third-degree AV block, alternating bundle-branch block, sustained or non-sustained VT, long or short QT, and device malfunction with cardiac pauses, which should trigger monitored care and expedited rhythm evaluation [^112WE9tS] [^111DXZGp].

> Next, I should review bedside features that tilt the pretest probability toward cardiac syncope because that drives disposition; syncope during exertion or in the supine position, absence of prodrome, palpitations at onset, structural heart disease, family history of sudden death, and abnormal ECG elevate risk, whereas a typical vasovagal prodrome with triggers like pain, fear, warm crowded settings, or prolonged standing points to reflex syncope; I need to ensure these heuristics align with evidence that heart disease presence is the strongest predictor of cardiac syncope and that vasovagal features carry benign prognosis in most, while still acknowledging injury risk and quality-of-life impact [^112ZPuWq] [^116mVcFM] [^113M8Dww].

> I should double-check how to risk-stratify disposition in the emergency setting; tools such as the Canadian Syncope Risk Score, San Francisco Syncope Rule, and OESIL can assist but have modest positive likelihood ratios and should not replace clinical judgment, so I will integrate them with bedside assessment to identify high-risk patients for admission to monitored settings and low-risk patients for discharge with follow-up under a syncope pathway [^112JrPbX] [^112rsqeq] [^112Ju25X].

> Let me think about targeted diagnostic testing after the core assessment to avoid low-yield studies; echocardiography is appropriate when history, exam, or ECG suggests structural or valvular disease, but routine cardiac imaging is not recommended without suspicion; prolonged ambulatory rhythm monitoring modality should match event frequency and suspected arrhythmia mechanism; tilt-table testing is useful when reflex syncope or psychogenic pseudosyncope is suspected or to help distinguish convulsive syncope from epilepsy; laboratory tests should be targeted to suspected conditions rather than obtained routinely, and I should be cautious not to overinterpret orthostatic vitals in isolation given their limited standalone diagnostic performance [^117RZSz7] [^1141w9cd] [^111TfzCp] [^111GUy9M] [^115APwqP] [^116utYHs] [^112wpHns].

> But wait, what if the event was actually a seizure or a psychogenic episode; I need to ensure I look for lateral tongue biting, prolonged post-ictal confusion, witnessed tonic–clonic movements with sustained rhythmicity, or features such as prolonged apparent unresponsiveness with closed eyes and preserved hemodynamics for pseudosyncope, and obtain neurological evaluation when epilepsy is suspected so that we do not mislabel non-syncopal TLOC as syncope [^112W9Fhy] [^111kTmjw].

> I should confirm the orthostatic hypotension definitions and subtypes because they guide therapy; classic OH is a sustained drop in SBP ≥ 20 mmHg or DBP ≥ 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing, with delayed OH after 3 minutes often in older adults or autonomic failure, and neurogenic OH is suggested by an inadequate heart rate response; documenting symptom reproduction during the blood pressure fall strengthens the diagnosis and directs management, including reviewing hypotensive medications and addressing volume or autonomic failure mechanisms [^112DCV2o] [^111kcQ1q].

> Now, let me verify the high-risk cardiac cues that demand expedited care; in addition to the ECG red flags, suspect structural causes like severe aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism, left atrial tumor or thrombus, acute aortic syndromes, or ischemia when clinical context supports them, and confirm cardiac ischemia-related syncope when syncope accompanies objective evidence of acute myocardial ischemia, with telemetry and disease-specific management initiated promptly [^117EM68q] [^115EVGRR] [^111DXZGp].

> I need to ensure the mechanism-based initial management is aligned with guidelines; for reflex syncope, patient education about diagnosis and prognosis is foundational, with counseling on trigger avoidance and recognition of prodromes, and for recurrent injurious reflex syncope consider mechanism-specific strategies based on hypotensive versus bradycardic phenotype identified by work-up, whereas for orthostatic hypotension prioritize medication review, hydration, physical countermeasures, and treatment of neurogenic OH as appropriate; cardiac syncope generally mandates admission, monitoring, and disease-targeted therapy including pacing or defibrillation for brady–tachy arrhythmias or intervention for structural disease [^1152XvUp] [^111eKhmZ].

> Hold on, I should verify nuances in older adults because presentation often blurs with falls; syncope may present as unexplained falls due to amnesia for loss of consciousness and short or absent prodromes, so comprehensive geriatric assessment, including cognitive and physical performance evaluation, improves diagnostic yield and reduces unnecessary testing and length of stay, and clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in fallers with compatible red flags [^114u9F4K] [^1158MQhz].

> Next, I should review disposition and systems of care; low-risk patients with likely reflex or orthostatic syncope can be discharged with outpatient follow-up, while high-risk features warrant monitored observation or admission; syncope units staffed by multidisciplinary teams can reduce admissions and unnecessary testing while improving timely diagnosis when implemented with standardized protocols and guideline pathways, though I need to remember that outcomes data are still evolving [^112Ju25X] [^112g5p4N].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I nearly omitted a practical pitfall; not every orthostatic drop equals causality, and orthostatic vital signs alone neither confirm nor exclude orthostatic syncope nor rule out life-threatening causes, so I should always interpret them in the clinical context and avoid anchoring, especially when the story suggests arrhythmic or structural etiologies or when injuries, exertional or supine events, or abnormal ECG are present [^112wpHns] [^112rsqeq].

> Let me reconsider the overall flow: start by confirming TLOC and whether it is syncopal, classify the likely mechanism, complete the core assessment with history–exam including orthostatic measurements and ECG, risk-stratify to determine disposition, and deploy targeted tests rather than routine imaging or labs; anchor on red flags for cardiac causes, treat mechanism-specifically, and tailor the approach for older adults and other special populations, keeping in mind that decision rules complement but do not replace clinical judgment [^113k4pDA] [^1127dNxi] [^112JrPbX] [^117RZSz7] [^1141w9cd] [^114u9F4K].

Syncope is a **transient loss of consciousness** [^111kTmjw] due to **global cerebral hypoperfusion**, with rapid onset, short duration, and complete spontaneous recovery. In contrast, **loss of consciousness (LOC)** is a broader term encompassing syncope as well as seizures, metabolic disturbances, and psychogenic events. Syncope is characterized by brief duration, rapid recovery, and absence of postictal confusion, whereas other LOC causes typically last longer, recover more slowly, and may involve postictal confusion or focal deficits. Accurate diagnosis relies on **detailed history, physical examination, and targeted testing** [^111kTmjw] to identify the cause and guide management [^1127dNxi].

## Definitions and pathophysiology

**Syncope** is a transient loss of consciousness [^111kTmjw] due to global cerebral hypoperfusion [^116N8bZW] [^114EJkZ6], with rapid onset, short duration, and complete spontaneous recovery, whereas **loss of consciousness (LOC)** is a broader term encompassing syncope, seizures, metabolic disturbances, and psychogenic events [^117CxCGN].

---

## Clinical features distinguishing syncope from other LOC causes [^114SshaN] [^115C1bMX]

| **Feature** | **Syncope** | **Seizure** | **Metabolic LOC** | **Psychogenic LOC** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Onset | - Sudden <br/> - Brief | - Sudden <br/> - Longer | Gradual | Variable |
| Duration | Seconds to minutes | Minutes | Minutes to hours | Variable |
| Recovery | - Rapid <br/> - Complete | - Slow <br/> - Postictal | - Slow <br/> - Confusion | - Rapid <br/> - Variable |
| Prodrome | Common (lightheadedness, nausea) | Aura | Variable | Variable |
| Postictal confusion | Absent | Present | Common | Absent |
| Tongue biting | Rare | Common | Rare | Rare |
| Incontinence | Rare | Common | Rare | Rare |

---

## Diagnostic approach

A structured approach is essential for distinguishing **syncope from other causes of LOC** [^117CxCGN]:

- **History and physical examination**: Identify triggers, prodrome, duration, recovery, and comorbidities [^111kTmjw] [^113k4pDA].

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Detect arrhythmias or cardiac abnormalities [^1127dNxi].

- **Orthostatic blood pressure measurements**: Evaluate for orthostatic hypotension [^111kcQ1q] [^112wpHns].

- **Tilt-table testing**: Assess reflex syncope or orthostatic intolerance [^111GUy9M] [^114EJkZ6].

- **Neurological evaluation**: Consider seizures or neurological disorders [^112W9Fhy].

- **Laboratory tests**: Use selectively based on clinical suspicion [^116utYHs].

## Clinical implications and management

**Syncope** management targets the underlying cause (e.g. vasovagal, orthostatic hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias) and often includes education, lifestyle changes, and specific therapies [^1152XvUp] [^114EJkZ6] [^111eKhmZ], whereas **other LOC causes** are managed according to the specific diagnosis (e.g. antiepileptics for seizures, metabolic correction, psychological interventions).

---

## Prognosis

**Syncope** prognosis varies by cause — vasovagal syncope is generally benign, while cardiac syncope carries higher risk [^111g4Q4w] [^113M8Dww] [^114EJkZ6] — whereas **other LOC causes** have a prognosis that depends on the underlying condition and treatment response.

---

Syncope is a specific form of transient LOC due to **cerebral hypoperfusion** [^117CxCGN], with rapid recovery and no postictal confusion, whereas LOC encompasses a broader range of causes. Accurate diagnosis and management rely on a structured clinical approach [^112JrPbX].

### Syncope: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^113xNEBE]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Syncope is an abrupt and transient loss of consciousness caused by cerebral hypoperfusion. It accounts for 1% to 1.5% of emergency department visits, resulting in high hospital admission rates and significant medical costs. Syncope is classified as neurally mediated, cardiac, and orthostatic hypotension. Neurally mediated syncope is the most common type and has a benign course, whereas cardiac syncope is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with presyncope have similar prognoses to those with syncope and should undergo a similar evaluation.

A standardized approach to syncope evaluation reduces hospital admissions and medical costs and increases diagnostic accuracy. The initial assessment for all patients presenting with syncope includes a detailed history, physical examination, and electrocardiography. The initial evaluation may diagnose up to 50% of patients and allows immediate short-term risk stratification. Laboratory testing and neuroimaging have a low diagnostic yield and should be ordered only if clinically indicated. Several comparable clinical decision rules can be used to assess the short-term risk of death and the need for hospital admission.

Low-risk patients with a single episode of syncope can often be reassured with no further investigation. High-risk patients with cardiovascular or structural heart disease, history concerning for arrhythmia, abnormal electrocardiographic findings, or severe comorbidities should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. In cases of unexplained syncope, provocative testing and prolonged electr…

### Mechanism of syncope: Role of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and cardiovascular autonomic function assessment [^114EJkZ6]. European Heart Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Different types of transient loss of consciousness events are defined based on their pathophysiological features. The qualifying criterion for syncope is cerebral hypoperfusion, which differentiates syncope from non-syncopal forms such as epileptic seizure or psychogenic pseudo-syncope. In patients with a diagnosis of syncope, once a cardiac cause (such as primary intrinsic cardiac arrhythmias or structural flow obstruction) can be ruled out, autonomic neural mechanisms are involved in the genesis of non-cardiac forms. Autonomic (non-cardiac) syncope encompasses both reflex (neurally mediated) syncope and syncope due to orthostatic hypotension, as described in the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines. Identifying the haemodynamic mechanism of autonomic syncope is an essential prerequisite for a personalized treatment approach aimed at effectively preventing recurrences.

The possible haemodynamic mechanisms underlying autonomic syncope include primary hypotension and asystole/bradycardia of extrinsic cause, corresponding to two different haemodynamic phenotypes, i.e. the hypotensive and bradycardic phenotypes. The choice of therapy — aimed at counteracting hypotension or bradycardia — depends on the detected syncope phenotype identified during the diagnostic work-up.

Autonomic syncope is a common event in the general population and a frequent reason for seeking medical attention, with a consequent impact on high healthcare costs. Moreover, in a significant proportion of patients, syncope might be disabling due to repetitive episodes and/or severe injuries.

### A guide to disorders causing transient loss of consciousness: Focus on syncope [^111kTmjw]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2009).

Episodes of transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) pose diagnostic difficulties, as the causes are diverse, carry vastly different risks, and span various specialties. An inconsistent terminology contributes to the confusion. Here, we present a classification scheme for TLOC based on ongoing multidisciplinary efforts, including those of the Task Force on Syncope of the European Society of Cardiology. We also discuss the pathophysiology of TLOC and the key clinical features that aid diagnosis.

TLOC is defined as an apparent loss of consciousness with an abrupt onset, a short duration, and a spontaneous and complete recovery. Syncope is defined as TLOC due to cerebral hypoperfusion and is divided into reflex syncope (synonymous with neurally mediated syncope), syncope due to orthostatic hypotension, and cardiac syncope (arrhythmic or associated with structural cardiac disease).

The other major groups of TLOC are generalized epileptic seizures, functional TLOC (psychogenic TLOC mimicking either epilepsy or syncope), and a further group of miscellaneous disorders. The management of patients who experience TLOC requires the recognition of the defining features of each of the major groups and cooperation between different clinical specialties.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope [^111DXZGp]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for syncope, specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria for cardiac syncope (arrhythmic), the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend suspecting arrhythmic syncope in the absence of syncope when periods of Mobitz II second- or third-degree AV block or a ventricular pause greater than 3 seconds occur. This is with the possible exception of young trained persons, during sleep, or rate-controlled atrial fibrillation. Additionally, rapid prolonged paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or ventricular tachycardia (VT) should be detected.

### Anomalous coronary artery found in the syncopal workup of an elderly man [^113hoXaq]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Syncope, defined as a transient loss of consciousness, is seen in 1% of all visits to emergency departments and urgent care clinics in the United States. It is categorized as cardiogenic, neurologic, or psychogenic. Anomalies of the coronary arteries are rare, and these anomalies present as syncope more often in the young than in the elderly; syncope rarely occurs in patients 65 years of age and older.

There are two major variants of coronary anomalies. In the first variant, the left main coronary artery arises from the right aortic sinus. In the second variant, the right coronary artery arises from the left aortic sinus. The risk of sudden death is higher in patients with the left coronary artery arising from the right aortic sinus.

We present a case of an anomalous coronary artery discovered during the syncopal workup in a 66-year-old man because no such cases have been published in the United States. We will discuss the management of anomalous coronary arteries as well as a systematic approach to the diagnosis and management of syncope.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope [^111jJhNG]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for syncope, the 2018 ESC guidelines specifically address diagnostic criteria for cardiac syncope and arrhythmic syncope. They recommend confirming arrhythmic syncope when a correlation between syncope and an arrhythmia (either bradyarrhythmia or tachyarrhythmia) is detected.

### Syncope management unit: Evolution of the concept and practice implementation [^112g5p4N]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Syncope, a clinical syndrome, has many potential causes. The prognosis of a patient experiencing syncope varies from a benign outcome to an increased risk of mortality or sudden death, determined by the etiology of syncope and the presence of underlying disease. Because a definitive diagnosis often cannot be established immediately, hospital admission is frequently recommended as the "default" approach to ensure patient safety and an expedited evaluation. Hospital care is costly, while no studies have shown that clinical outcomes are improved by the inpatient practice approach.

The syncope unit is an evolving practice model based on the hypothesis that a multidisciplinary team of physicians and allied staff, with expertise in syncope management, working together and equipped with standard clinical tools, could improve clinical outcomes. Preliminary data have demonstrated that a specialized syncope unit can improve diagnosis in a timely manner, reduce hospital admission, and decrease the use of unnecessary diagnostic tests.

In this review, models of syncope units in the emergency department, hospital, and outpatient clinics from different practices in various countries are discussed. Similarities and differences of these syncope units are compared. Outcomes and endpoints from these studies are summarized. Developing a syncope unit with a standardized protocol applicable to most practice settings would be an ultimate goal for clinicians and investigators who have interest, expertise, and commitment to improving care for this large patient population.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope [^111kcQ1q]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for syncope, specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria for orthostatic hypotension-induced syncope, the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend suspecting syncope due to orthostatic hypotension when there is a symptomatic fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from the baseline value of ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥ 10 mmHg. Alternatively, a decrease in SBP to < 90 mmHg should be considered, especially in the presence of features from the patient's history suggestive of orthostatic hypotension.

### Syncope in older adults: challenges, approach and treatment [^114u9F4K]. Age and Ageing (2024). High credibility.

Syncope can have devastating consequences, resulting in injuries, accidents, or even death. In our aging society, the subsequent healthcare usage, such as emergency room presentations, surgeries, and hospital admissions, forms a significant and growing socioeconomic burden. Causes of syncope in the older adult include orthostatic hypotension, carotid sinus syndrome, vasovagal syncope, structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiac arrhythmias, and conduction abnormalities.

As stated in the recently published World Falls Guidelines, syncope in older adults often presents as falls, either due to amnesia for loss of consciousness or pre-syncope leading to a fall, especially in those prone to falls with several other risk factors for falls present. This difference in presentation can hinder the recognition of syncope. In patients with unexplained falls or in whom the history comprises red flags for potential syncope, special attention to (pre)syncope is therefore warranted.

When syncope is mistaken for other causes of transient loss of consciousness, such as epileptic seizures, or when syncope presents as falls, patients are often referred to multiple specialists, which may in turn lead to excessive and unnecessary diagnostic testing and costs. Specialist services able to provide a comprehensive assessment can improve diagnostic yield and minimize diagnostic testing, thus improving patient satisfaction. Comprehensive assessment also leads to a reduced length of hospital stay. Increasingly, geriatricians are involved in the assessment of syncope in the older patient.

### Do patients with Ménière's disease have attacks of syncope [^114VkoKk]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence and associated factors for syncope among patients with Ménière's disease (MD). An attack of syncope was defined as a sudden and transient loss of consciousness, which subsides spontaneously and without a localizing neurological deficit. The study used an across-sectional survey design. Information from a database consisting of 961 individuals was collected from the Finnish Ménière Association. The data contained case histories, general health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and impact measurements of the complaints.

In the study sample, syncope occurred in 12.3% of the patients with MD. It was more prevalent among elderly persons and among those with a longer duration of MD. Syncope was significantly associated with disturbances of otolith function reflected as Tumarkin attacks, gait and balance problems, environmental change of pressure, and physical strain. It was also associated with visual blurring; in fact, patients with otolith dysfunction in MD often experience visual field changes. Additionally, syncope was linked with headaches, though not with migraine.

Syncope was experienced as frightening and HRQoL was significantly worsened. Patients had higher anxiety scores and suffered more from fatigue. The results demonstrate that neurally mediated syncope occurs in patients with an advanced form of MD who suffer from Tumarkin attacks due to failure in otolith function. The mechanism seems to be triggered through the vestibular sympathetic reflex when the otolith system fails due to disrupted utricular otolithic membrane function.

### Do orthostatic vital signs have utility in the evaluation of syncope [^112wpHns]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common presentation in the emergency department (ED). The differential diagnosis is extensive and includes both benign conditions and acute life threats, such as dysrhythmias or pulmonary embolism.

- **Objective**: The specific goals of this review are twofold: 1) to define the diagnostic utility of orthostatic vital signs (OVS) as a test for orthostatic syncope, and 2) to determine whether OVS help diagnose or exclude life-threatening causes of syncope in ED patients.

- **Methods**: Three prospective cohort studies and 2017 national guidelines for syncope management were identified, reviewed, and critically appraised.

- **Results**: This literature review found that orthostatic hypotension is common among ED patients with syncope and is often diagnosed as the cause of syncope.

- **Conclusions**: OVS measurements do not, in isolation, reliably diagnose or exclude orthostatic syncope, nor do they appear to have value in ruling out life-threatening causes of syncope.

### Current approach to pediatric syncope [^116kbjQb]. Pediatric Cardiology (2000). Low credibility.

Syncope is the abrupt loss of consciousness and postural tone that reverses without intervention. Typically, syncopal episodes in pediatric patients are brief, lasting seconds (rarely minutes), and are followed by complete recovery without residual neurological sequelae. Syncopal presentations may be dramatic and lead family members and primary care providers to suspect a malignant cardiac condition, prompting referral to a pediatric cardiologist.

Significant advances in the understanding of syncope in infants, children, and adolescents have occurred in the past decade. This review emphasizes neurally mediated syncope, but other etiologies are reviewed to complete the spectrum encountered by pediatric cardiologists. Some clues are provided to distinguish the more common and benign forms of syncope from those due to significant underlying heart disease.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^1156ADPY]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Syncope can have a variety of aetiologies and may result in falls and associated injuries. Syncope is defined as a sudden yet transient complete loss of consciousness in which the individual is unable to maintain postural tone, followed by rapid and spontaneous recovery. Standing for two to three minutes is usually sufficient to observe the fall in blood pressure (BP) associated with syncope; however, in the case presented here, BP was measured after five minutes of standing. Determining the underlying cause of syncopal episodes is an important diagnostic step to appropriately guide management.

- **Potential causes of syncope**:
	- A relatively common cause of syncope is orthostatic hypotension (OH), which is a drop in BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 10 mm Hg diastolic within a few minutes of standing.

Neurogenic OH (nOH; that is, OH resulting from autonomic dysfunction) can be differentiated from non-neurogenic causes of OH (e.g. hypovolemia) clinically by autonomic function tests and by an insufficient compensatory heart rate (HR) increase on standing. Common clinical signs and symptoms of nOH include dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, and falls. Neurogenic OH is frequently comorbid with other disorders associated with autonomic dysfunction, including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, dementia with Lewy bodies, and type 2 diabetes. Neurogenic OH increases the risk of falls, which in turn interferes with activities of daily living and increases the burden of symptoms for patients and their caregivers.

### The emergency department approach to syncope: Evidence-based guidelines and prediction rules [^113soV14]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Syncope is a sudden, transient loss of consciousness associated with an inability to maintain postural tone, followed by spontaneous recovery and a return to baseline neurologic status. Global cerebral hypoperfusion is the final pathway common to all presentations of syncope, but this symptom presentation has a broad differential diagnosis. It is important to identify patients whose syncope is a symptom of a potentially life-threatening condition. This article reviews the status of syncope from the emergency department perspective, focusing on the evidence behind the various clinical decision rules derived during the past decade.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope [^113k4pDA]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syncope, specifically with respect to history and physical examination, the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend eliciting a careful history that concerns present and previous attacks, as well as eyewitness accounts. This can be done in person or through a telephone interview. It is also recommended to perform a physical examination, which includes supine and standing blood pressure measurements, in patients with transient loss of consciousness of suspected syncopal nature.

### Etiology of syncope and unexplained falls in elderly adults with dementia: Syncope and Dementia (SYD) study [^114LrLvd]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Low credibility.

To investigate the etiology of transient loss of consciousness (T-LOC) suspected to be syncope and unexplained falls in elderly adults with dementia, a prospective, observational, multicenter study was conducted. The setting included acute care wards, syncope units, or centers for the diagnosis of dementia. Participants were individuals aged 65 and older with a diagnosis of dementia and one or more episodes of T-LOC of a suspected syncopal nature or unexplained falls during the previous 3 months.

The causes of T-LOC suspected to be syncope and unexplained falls were evaluated using a simplified protocol based on European Society of Cardiology guidelines. Of 357 individuals enrolled, 181 (50.7%) had been referred for T-LOC suspected to be syncope, 166 (46.5%) for unexplained falls, and 10 (2.8%) for both. An initially suspected diagnosis of syncope was confirmed in 158 (87.3%), and syncope was identified as the cause of the event in 75 (45.2%) of those referred for unexplained falls. Orthostatic hypotension was the cause of the event in 117 of 242 (48.3%) participants with a final diagnosis of syncope.

The simplified syncope diagnostic protocol can be used in elderly people with dementia referred for suspected syncope or unexplained falls. Unexplained falls may mask a diagnosis of syncope or pseudosyncope in almost 50% of cases. Given the high prevalence of orthostatic syncope in participants (~50%), a systematic reappraisal of drugs potentially responsible for orthostatic hypotension is warranted.

### New concepts in the assessment of syncope [^115Fuzs3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Significant progress has been made in the past three decades in our understanding of the various causes of loss of consciousness, thanks to the publication of several important studies and guidelines. In particular, the recent European Society of Cardiology guidelines provide a reference standard for optimal quality service delivery. This paper offers brief guidance on managing a patient with syncope, in reference to the above guidelines.

Despite the progress made, managing patients with syncope remains largely unsatisfactory due to a significant gap between knowledge and its application. Two new concepts aimed at bridging that gap are currently under evaluation: syncope facilities with specialist backup and interactive decision-making software. Preliminary data have shown that a standardized syncope assessment, especially when coupled with interactive decision-making software, decreases admission rates and unnecessary testing and improves diagnostic yield, thus reducing the cost per diagnosis. The long-term effects of such a new healthcare model on the rate of diagnosis and survival await future studies.

Regarding medical management for syncope, specifically in relation to the management of vasovagal syncope, the ACC/AHA/HRS 2017 guidelines recommend educating patients with vasovagal syncope about their diagnosis and prognosis.

### Diagnostic value of history in patients with syncope with or without heart disease [^112ZPuWq]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

We sought to establish what historical findings are predictive of the cause of syncope. The clinical features of the various types of syncope have not been systematically investigated. Three hundred forty-one patients with syncope were prospectively evaluated. Each patient was interviewed using a standard questionnaire, and a cause of syncope was assigned using standardized diagnostic criteria.

A cardiac cause of syncope was established in 23% of the patients, a neurally mediated cause in 58%, and a neurologic or psychiatric cause in 1%. In the remaining 18%, the cause of syncope remained unexplained. In a preliminary analysis including age, gender, and the presence of suspected or certain heart disease after the initial evaluation, only heart disease was an independent predictor of a cardiac cause of syncope (odds ratio 16, p = 0.00001), with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 45%. In contrast, the absence of heart disease allowed us to exclude a cardiac cause of syncope in 97% of the patients.

In patients with certain or suspected heart disease, the most specific predictors of a cardiac cause were syncope in the supine position or during effort, blurred vision, and convulsive syncope. Significant and specific predictors of a neurally mediated cause were a time between the first and last syncopal episode of more than 4 years, abdominal discomfort before the loss of consciousness, and nausea and diaphoresis during the recovery phase. In patients without heart disease, palpitation was the only significant predictor of a cardiac cause.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® syncope [^117RZSz7]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). High credibility.

Syncope and presyncope lead to well over one million emergency room visits in the United States each year. Elucidating the cause of syncope or presyncope, which are grouped together given similar etiologies and outcomes, can be exceedingly difficult due to the diverse causes. This challenge is heightened by the fact that some causes, such as vasovagal syncope, are relatively innocuous, while others, such as cardiac-related syncope, carry a significantly increased risk of death.

The mainstay of syncope and presyncope assessment is a detailed history and physical examination. However, imaging can play a role in certain situations. In patients where a cardiovascular etiology is suspected based on the appropriate history, physical examination, and ECG findings, resting transthoracic echocardiography is usually considered appropriate for the initial imaging. Although no imaging studies are usually considered appropriate when there is a low probability of cardiac or neurologic pathology, chest radiography may be appropriate in certain clinical situations.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guidelines' development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies. These include the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific conditions.

### Selecting appropriate diagnostic tools for evaluating the patient with syncope/collapse [^113iy3LK]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The investigation of syncope is challenging, and physicians have an ever-increasing array of diagnostic tools at their disposal. There are two essential goals that drive investigation: risk stratification and identification of etiology. In this review, we outline our approach while providing a synopsis of the available supportive evidence.

The key to syncope is in the story as told by the patient and a bystander since this drives both risk assessment and diagnostic testing. All patients should initially be evaluated with a systematic history and physical examination as well as an ECG. The initial evaluation provides an estimation of risk and directs whether inpatient or outpatient evaluation is appropriate.

In a substantial proportion of patients, the etiology will be evident after the initial evaluation, and no further investigation is required. In the remaining patients, targeted use of additional investigations in the form of cardiac imaging, provocative testing, and/or ambulatory ECG monitoring should be performed. A thoughtful and systematic approach to the investigation of syncope optimizes the diagnostic yield but also ensures efficient usage of limited health care resources.

### Synopsis of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guideline for management of transient loss of consciousness [^117CxCGN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). High credibility.

Transient loss of consciousness (TLoC) is common and often leads to incorrect diagnosis, unnecessary investigation, or inappropriate choice of specialist referral. In August 2010, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence published a guideline that addressed the initial assessment of and most appropriate specialist referral for persons who have experienced TLoC. The guideline focused on correct diagnosis and relevant specialist referral and did not make treatment recommendations. This synopsis describes the principal recommendations concerning assessment and referral of a patient with TLoC.

The National Clinical Guideline Centre developed the guidelines using the standard methodology of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. A multidisciplinary guideline panel generated review questions, discussed evidence, and formulated recommendations. The panel included a technical team from the National Clinical Guideline Centre, which reviewed and graded all relevant evidence identified from literature searches published in English up to November 2009 and performed health-economic modeling. Both guideline development and final modifications were informed by comments from stakeholders and the public.

The panel made clear recommendations regarding the assessment of a person after TLoC, emphasizing the importance of clinical reasoning in diagnosis. Persons with uncomplicated faint, situational syncope, or orthostatic hypotension should receive electrocardiography but do not otherwise require immediate further investigation.

### Syncope [^114CCpXx]. Critical Care Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common clinical presentation. Although it is most commonly benign, it may herald a pathology with a poor prognosis. The work-up of syncope includes a careful history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, risk stratification, and appropriately directed testing. The key factor in the investigation of syncope is the presence or absence of structural heart disease or an abnormal electrocardiogram.

The most useful investigation in unexplained syncope with a normal heart is the tilt table test for evaluating predisposition to neurocardiogenic (vasovagal) syncope. In the setting of structural heart disease or an abnormal electrocardiogram, electrophysiologic studies play a more important role. The utility of noninvasive cardiac monitoring for symptom-rhythm correlation may be limited by infrequent symptoms. The availability of external and implantable loop recorders allows prolonged periods of monitoring to increase diagnostic yield.

The management of patients with syncope may be complex. Early referral to a cardiac electrophysiologist is warranted in patients who are at high risk.

### Evaluation of syncope [^1146a5i6]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Syncope is a transient and abrupt loss of consciousness with a complete return to pre-existing neurologic function. It is classified as neurally mediated (i.e. carotid sinus hypersensitivity, situational, or vasovagal), cardiac, orthostatic, or neurogenic. Older adults are more likely to have orthostatic, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, or cardiac syncope, whereas younger adults are more likely to have vasovagal syncope.

Common non-syncopal syndromes with similar presentations include seizures, metabolic and psychogenic disorders, and acute intoxication. Patients presenting with syncope (other than neurally mediated and orthostatic syncope) are at increased risk of death from any cause.

Useful clinical rules to assess the short-term risk of death and the need for immediate hospitalization include the San Francisco Syncope Rule and the Risk Stratification of Syncope in the Emergency Department rule. Guidelines suggest an algorithmic approach to the evaluation of syncope that begins with the history and physical examination. All patients presenting with syncope require electrocardiography, orthostatic vital signs, and QT interval monitoring.

- **Hospitalization recommendations**: Patients with cardiovascular disease, abnormal electrocardiography, family history of sudden death, and unexplained syncope should be hospitalized for further diagnostic evaluation.
- **Testing and evaluation**: Patients with neurally mediated or orthostatic syncope usually require no additional testing. In cases of unexplained syncope, further testing such as echocardiography, graded exercise testing, electrocardiographic monitoring, and other evaluations may be necessary.

### Pediatric syncope: Is detailed medical history the key point for differential diagnosis [^116yVUJX]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Syncope is a transient loss of consciousness resulting from global cerebral hypoperfusion. Although generally benign, it may indicate underlying pathology. The purpose of this study was to analyze the frequency of syncope due to cardiac, neurocardiogenic, neurologic, situational, psychiatric, and other causes, and to make a differential diagnosis of syncope types based on detailed medical history and further investigations. We prospectively examined 268 children, aged 1 to 18 years, who presented to pediatric polyclinics as well as cardiology and neurology departments, with a primary complaint of syncope.

Cardiac syncope was diagnosed in 12 patients, neurocardiogenic syncope in 232 patients, neurologic syncope in 9, psychiatric syncope in 9, situational syncope in 4, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in 2. The neurologic syncope group included patients later diagnosed with epilepsy after evaluation. In the cardiac syncope group, eight patients were found to have conditions such as long QT syndrome; the remaining patients had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, and a second-degree heart block, all of which can cause sudden death.

In conclusion, syncope is a common issue in childhood that may require hospitalization. Since it can be the initial indication of an underlying malignant cardiac or neurological disease, clinicians must exercise great caution during medical evaluations. An electrocardiogram and a thorough medical history, including details of the event, chronic diseases, and familial diseases, are critical steps toward accurate diagnosis.

### Symptoms and signs of syncope: A review of the link between physiology and clinical clues [^115C1bMX]. Brain (2009). Low credibility.

Detailed history taking is of paramount importance to establish a reliable diagnosis in patients with transient loss of consciousness. In this article, the clinical symptoms and signs of the successive phases of a syncopal episode are reviewed. A failure of the systemic circulation to perfuse the brain sufficiently results in a stereotyped progression of neurological symptoms and signs, culminating in loss of consciousness; when transient, this is known as syncope.

Prior to loss of consciousness, the affected individual tends to exhibit unclear thinking, followed by fixation of the eyes in the midline and a 'frozen' appearance. Narrowing of the field of vision occurs, with a loss of color vision ('greying out'), and eventually a complete loss of vision ('blacking out'). Hearing loss may follow the loss of vision. This process may take as little as approximately seven seconds in cases of sudden complete circulatory arrest (e.g. abrupt asystole), but in other circumstances, it may take longer depending on the rate and depth of cerebral hypoperfusion. Complete loss of consciousness occurs with the 'turning up' of the eyeballs. Profound cerebral hypoperfusion may be accompanied by myoclonic jerks.

### Early and late-onset syncope: insight into mechanisms [^115j3Zkb]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common clinical problem, with approximately 40% of the population experiencing at least one episode in their lifetime. The most common cause is vasovagal syncope (VVS), followed by orthostatic hypotension (OH) and cardiac syncope. The head-up tilt (HUT) test is used in clinical practice for diagnosing hypotensive susceptibility to vasovagal reflex and cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction as syncope aetiology.

Epidemiological studies indicate that syncope has a bimodal incidence through life, with peaks at ages 15–20 and over 70 years. The incidence of syncope rises steeply after 70 years. Syncope aetiology differs with age; in the young, most cases are due to VVS, while cardiac syncope, OH, and effects of medications become more common in old age. Syncope in older patients presents a diagnostic challenge as they tend to have short or absent prodromes and may present with falls where amnesia for the event conceals loss of consciousness. Data point to increased mortality and cardiovascular morbidity following unexplained syncope.

To establish effective diagnostic approaches for syncope, the causes in different age groups and factors associated with the final diagnosis need elucidation. One such factor is the age at which patients experience syncope for the first time. Only a few studies, focused on young adults or patients with an established VVS diagnosis, report the age at first syncope. It is unclear whether the age at first syncope impacts the results of syncope investigation.

### Loss of consciousness in the young child [^11239rSK]. Pediatric Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

In very young children (less than eight years of age), transient loss of consciousness poses a diagnostic and management dilemma for clinicians. While it is most commonly benign, syncope may be due to cardiac dysfunction, which can be life-threatening. It can be secondary to an underlying ion channelopathy, cardiac inflammation, cardiac ischemia, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, or pulmonary hypertension. Patients with genetic disorders require careful evaluation for a cardiac cause of syncope.

Among the noncardiac causes, vasovagal syncope is the most common etiology. Breath-holding spells are commonly seen in this age group. Other causes of transient loss of consciousness include seizures, neurovascular pathology, head trauma, psychogenic pseudosyncope, factitious disorder imposed on another, and other forms of child abuse.

A detailed social, present, past medical, and family medical history is important when evaluating loss of consciousness in very young children.

- **Concerning characteristics of syncope**: Lack of prodromal symptoms, no preceding postural changes, occurring in a supine position, or after exertion or a loud noise. A family history of sudden unexplained death, ion channelopathy, cardiomyopathy, or congenital deafness merits further evaluation. Due to inherent challenges in diagnosis at this age, there is often a lower threshold for referral to a specialist.

### Diagnostic criteria for vasovagal syncope based on a quantitative history [^113zdwZq]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Our goal was to develop historical criteria for the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope.

- **Methods and results**: We administered a 118-item historical questionnaire to 418 patients with syncope and no apparent structural heart disease. The prevalence of each item was compared between patients with positive tilt tests and those with syncope of other known causes. The contributions of symptoms to diagnoses were estimated with logistic regression, point scores were developed, and the scores were tested using receiver operator characteristic analysis. The accuracy of the decision rule was assessed with bootstrapping. Data sets were complete for all subjects. The causes of syncope were known in 323 patients and included tilt-positive vasovagal syncope (235 patients) and other diagnoses such as complete heart block and supraventricular tachycardias (88 patients). The point score correctly classified 90% of patients, diagnosing vasovagal syncope with 89% sensitivity and 91% specificity. The decision rule suggested that 68% of an additional 95 patients with syncope of unknown cause and a negative tilt test have vasovagal syncope.

- **Conclusion**: A simple point score of historical features distinguishes vasovagal syncope from syncope of other causes with very high sensitivity and specificity.

### ACC/AHA/HRS versus ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope: JACC guideline comparison [^112ZrLeC]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Syncope is a commonly encountered and challenging problem in medical practice. Presentations are variable, and the causal mechanism often remains elusive even after extensive (and often expensive) evaluation. Clinical practice guidelines have been developed to help guide the multidisciplinary approach necessary to diagnose and manage the broad spectrum of patients presenting with syncope. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, in collaboration with the Heart Rhythm Society, published its first syncope guidelines in 2017. The European Society of Cardiology released the fourth iteration of its syncope guidelines in 2018. This review highlights the differences and congruencies between the two sets of recommendations, their implications for clinical practice, the remaining gaps in understanding, and areas of future research.

- **Transtelephonic monitoring**: Allows for ongoing monitoring with patient-activated recordings, suitable for less frequent events.

- **External loop recorder**: Provides extended continuous monitoring, capturing pre- and post-event data.

- **Patch recorder**: Offers a less obtrusive option for prolonged monitoring periods.

- **Mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry**: Delivers real-time remote monitoring with immediate arrhythmia detection and notification.

### Pediatric syncope: High-risk conditions and reasonable approach [^115K2cAM]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common presentation to the emergency room. Unlike in the adult population, most pediatric syncope has non-life-threatening causes, and minimal evaluation in the emergency department is appropriate with parental reassurance. Despite this benign prognosis, care must be taken to identify uncommon and potentially fatal causes. The primary purpose of evaluating a patient with syncope is to determine whether the patient is at increased risk for death and needs either admission to the hospital or an expedited outpatient evaluation. This article reviews some of the most dangerous causes of syncope in pediatric patients.

### Transient loss of consciousness with convulsions in two young adults with potentially fatal underlying heart disease: Syncope versus seizures [^111gMSsd]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of syncope versus seizures represents a daily challenge for cardiologists and neurologists. Long Q-T syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are two hereditary arrhythmogenic heart conditions causing syncope in early adulthood. We report the cases of two patients who were reassessed for transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) with convulsions despite treatment. The first patient, a 40-year-old woman, had been diagnosed with epilepsy and was given phenytoin. Her episodes took place while swimming or when in emotional distress and were not followed by post-ictal confusion. An electrocardiogram showed a very prolonged Q-Tc interval. The second patient, a 30-year-old man with HCM in whom a defibrillator had been implanted on the assumption that he was having cardiogenic syncopes, was actually found to have epilepsy. Adequate treatment rendered both patients asymptomatic. In conclusion, the clinical history and 12-lead electrocardiography remain crucial in the management of TLOC, ideally involving both cardiologists and neurologists.

### Syncope is associated with multidimensional frailty in older adults [^113BJcTP]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Analysis of syncope events reveals that the origin of loss of consciousness remained unexplained in 23 out of 107 participants (21.5%). A pathogenic diagnosis was identified in 78.5% of cases, with reflex syncope being the most prevalent cause (37.4%), followed by orthostatic hypotension (OH) (24.3%) and cardiac causes (16.8%).

As the degree of frailty increased, a higher percentage of patients experienced one or more syncopal episodes in the past year. Specifically, 10.9% of individuals with light frailty (n = 10), 13.6% with moderate frailty (n = 34), and 28.9% with severe frailty (n = 63) had experienced syncopal events. Regarding the etiology of syncope:

- **Light frailty**:
	- 30% of episodes were cardiac in origin
	- 40% reflex
	- 20% due to OH
	- 10% of unknown origin

- **Moderate frailty**:
	- 20.6% cardiogenic
	- 41.2% reflex
	- 20.6% due to OH
	- 17.6% unknown

- **Severe frailty**:
	- 12.7% of episodes were cardiac
	- 34.9% reflex
	- 27% attributable to OH
	- 25.4% remained of unknown origin

### New insights in diagnostics and therapies in syncope: A novel approach to non-cardiac syncope [^111eKhmZ]. Heart (2021). Low credibility.

This article aims to provide advice on how to identify and manage patients with syncope who are at risk of severe outcomes, such as trauma, potentially life-threatening episodes, or frequent recurrences that reduce quality of life. The initial step in syncope diagnostic assessment is to identify patients with cardiac syncope. Once established, these patients must receive the appropriate mechanism-specific treatment.

If cardiac syncope is unlikely, reflex (neurally mediated) syncope and orthostatic hypotension are the most common causes of transient loss of consciousness. For these presentations, the efficacy of therapy is largely determined by the mechanism of syncope rather than its etiology or clinical features. The identified mechanism of syncope should be carefully assessed and assigned either to the hypotensive or bradycardic phenotype, which will determine the choice of therapy — either counteracting hypotension or counteracting bradycardia. The results of recent trials indicate that "mechanism-specific therapy" is highly effective in preventing recurrences.

Established mechanism-specific treatment strategies include the withdrawal of hypotensive drugs, applying fludrocortisone and midodrine for the hypotensive phenotype, and cardiac pacing for the bradycardic phenotype.

### Seizure versus syncope [^114SshaN]. The Lancet. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

One of the most common but difficult management problems in medicine is that of patients who present with a paroxysmal loss of consciousness. All too often, the underlying diagnosis remains elusive, resulting in mortality, ongoing morbidity, and financial burdens associated with hospitalization and repeated investigations. We describe a practical approach to this clinical dilemma rooted in adherence to basic principles of history taking and examination. This includes the formulation of a reasonable differential diagnosis, followed by intelligent use of specific investigations and selection of an appropriate treatment.

We also discuss the effect of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy and sudden cardiac death. Despite a careful and thorough approach to the patient with a "seizure versus syncope" problem, many will require repeated assessment before a diagnosis is made.

### Feasibility of blood pressure measurement with a wearable (watch-type) monitor during impending syncopal episodes [^111Zc7Pj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Reflex (neurally mediated) syncope is the most frequent cause of transient loss of consciousness. Traditionally, reflex syncope is identified by its pathogenesis and clinical presentation. Given that the efficacy of therapy is determined by the mechanisms of syncope (either hypotensive or bradycardic phenotype) rather than by its pathogenesis or clinical presentation, careful assessment of these mechanisms is mandatory for proper treatment choice. Recent progress in technology now offers the possibility to characterize spontaneous (pre)syncopal events in daily life, thus improving our ability to diagnose based on the documentation of spontaneous hypotensive or bradycardic events.

While ECG monitoring is a reliable and established method that enables the detection of bradycardia in a substantial proportion of patients affected by cardioinhibitory reflex syncope, documentation of transient hypotension is seldom achieved in patients affected by hypotensive syncope. Conventional ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring (ABPM) has important limitations in this regard because of the short monitoring period (usually 24–48 hours), the frequent unavailability of patients to accept repeated 24-hour recordings, and the intermittent nature of BP measurements (usually every 15–20 minutes). These features do not allow rapid phasic changes in BP occurring erratically in daily life to be identified. For these reasons, 24-hour ABPM is not recommended for the diagnosis of unexplained syncope by syncope guidelines nor by guidelines on arterial hypertension.

### Syncope: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^115FPD6n]. American Family Physician (2023). Low credibility.

Syncope is an abrupt, transient, and complete loss of consciousness associated with an inability to maintain postural tone; recovery is rapid and spontaneous. The condition is common, resulting in about 1.7 million emergency department visits in 2019. The immediate cause of syncope is cerebral hypoperfusion, which may occur due to systemic vasodilation, decreased cardiac output, or both.

- **Primary classifications of syncope**: Cardiac, reflex (neurogenic), and orthostatic. Evaluation focuses on history, physical examination (including orthostatic blood pressure measurements), and electrocardiographic results.

- **Inconclusive findings**: If the findings are inconclusive and indicate possible adverse outcomes, additional testing may be considered. Testing has limited utility, except in patients with cardiac syncope. Prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring, stress testing, and echocardiography may be beneficial in patients at higher risk of adverse outcomes from cardiac syncope.

- **Neuroimaging and laboratory tests**: Neuroimaging should be ordered only when findings suggest a neurologic event or a head injury is suspected. Laboratory tests may be ordered based on history and physical examination findings (e.g. hemoglobin measurement if gastrointestinal bleeding is suspected).

Patients are designated as having lower or higher risk of adverse outcomes according to history, physical examination, and electrocardiographic results, which can inform decisions regarding hospital admission. Risk stratification tools, such as the Canadian Syncope Risk Score, may be beneficial in this decision; some tools include cardiac biomarkers as a component of the evaluation process.

### Diagnostic and societal impact of implementing the syncope guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (SYNERGY study) [^116N8bZW]. BMC Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Syncope is a type of transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) resulting from global cerebral hypoperfusion. It is characterized by a rapid onset, short duration, and complete spontaneous recovery. Syncope is very common, affecting up to 40% of people at least once in their lifetime. It accounts for approximately 1% of all emergency department (ED) visits and is associated with high healthcare costs. The differential diagnosis is broad, with causes ranging from benign to life-threatening conditions. Syncope has a significant impact on quality of life, and effective diagnosis and treatment of the underlying causes may reduce this burden.

There is significant variation in the management of syncope. Diagnosis is often inaccurate, inefficient, delayed, or unknown. Although vasovagal syncope is the most common cause of TLOC, it is not claimed by any specialty nor taught in detail. As a result, specialists often restrict their evaluations to tests for disorders within their own specialties. For example, neurologists may focus on tests for epilepsy, while cardiologists concentrate on tests for arrhythmias and structural heart disease.

The 2018 European Society of Cardiology Syncope (ESC) Syncope Guidelines provide guidance for the initial syncope evaluation, risk stratification, and follow-up. This includes the availability of a dedicated multidisciplinary syncope unit. Implementation of earlier versions of these guidelines in several European countries increased diagnostic yield and accuracy. Such studies are, as yet, lacking the meta.

### Early and late-onset syncope: insight into mechanisms [^11614Fuu]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The first-ever syncope incidence in patients with unexplained syncope has a bimodal lifetime pattern with peaks at 15 and 70 years. The majority of older patients experience their first syncope when they are older, and orthostatic hypotension and carotid sinus syndrome are more common in this group. In older patients with early-onset syncope, prodromes, vasovagal, and complex syncope are more common. A detailed syncope history remains essential in elderly patients evaluated for syncope and impacts the final diagnosis.

### Clinical associations of injuries caused by vasovagal syncope: A cohort study from a tertiary syncope unit [^113M8Dww]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Vasovagal syncope (VVS) manifests as a transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) with loss of postural tone as a result of reduced cerebral blood flow. The lifetime prevalence of VVS is 40% among adults, and it causes 1% to 1.5% of emergency department visits in the United States. VVS is characterized by a spontaneous and rapid recovery, is not associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes, and does not indicate an underlying cardiovascular disease in most circumstances; therefore, it is often considered a benign condition. However, it has been demonstrated that recurrent VVS can significantly reduce the quality of life, and an episode of TLOC portends the risk of falling and traumatic injury.

Recent evidence indicates that patients who present to the hospital with syncope have an 80% higher risk of injury in the following year compared with controls. A 2021 meta-analysis of 23 studies involving 3,593 patients diagnosed with VVS found that 33.5% of individuals reported a history of traumatic syncopal episodes. These observations signify the importance of injury as a clinical outcome in VVS. Despite this importance, there is a paucity of data about predictors and risk factors of VVS-related injuries. The identification of clinical associations of injury is a crucial step in improving the management of VVS and should prompt future research to not only focus on strategies to prevent recurrences but also to find approaches to reduce the risk of injury if VVS occurs.

Herein, we present data from an ongoing cohort of patients with VVS from a tertiary syncope unit.

### Incidence of syncope during pregnancy: Temporal trends and outcomes [^11726J54]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Syncope is the sudden, transient loss of consciousness that occurs as a result of global cerebral hypoperfusion. It is a relatively common clinical problem, presenting in a bimodal distribution, with the highest incidence occurring between ages 10 to 30 and in patients older than 65 years. The most common cause of syncope in adolescents and young adults, including women of childbearing age, is vasovagal syncope.

Syncope may be a manifestation of a number of clinical conditions occurring on a spectrum of severity from deadly underlying heart conditions, such as arrhythmia, to benign conditions such as vasovagal episodes. This is reflected in the prognosis of 1-year mortality estimates ranging from as low as 0% for vasovagal syncope up to 30% in the context of cardiac syncope. Moreover, it has been shown that there is a significant association between syncope and the presence of cardiovascular disease, with the relationship appearing stronger among young people.

The pregnant mother undergoes a number of hemodynamic changes, including reduced systemic vascular resistance, increased blood volume and heart rate, and eccentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle. These changes may predispose her to the development of syncope.

There are currently limited data on the incidence of syncope in pregnancy. Moreover, the effect of a transient fall in blood pressure on maternal and fetal outcomes is not well described. While most case reports suggest a benign course for both mother and child, there are no long-term follow-up data. Given this paucity of evidence, we sought to explore these trends further.

### Neurohormones in vasovagal syncope: Are they important [^1114XEN8]? Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The quest to discover the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to vasovagal syncope (VVS) and to identify biomarkers capable of predicting syncope continues. Torabi et al. have opened our eyes to the potential complexities and dynamic relationships between several neurohormones and VVS. While the roles of epinephrine and vasopressin as possible triggers of VVS are apparent, the mechanisms by which other neuropeptides, such as adrenomedullin and endothelin‐1, influence orthostasis remain unclear.

Studies at the time of writing, including the one by Torabi et al, have focused on correlating hemodynamics with measurements of neurohormones in blood. Most, if not all, of the neurohormones under consideration (e.g. epinephrine, vasopressin, and endothelin) exert multiple actions on multiple target tissues, often binding to receptor subtypes with opposing effects on the heart, vasculature, and nervous system. Future studies investigating the effects of selective neurohormone receptor antagonists on orthostasis are encouraged.

### Falls, faints, fits and funny turns [^1134dkfW]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

In this practically oriented review, we outline the clinical approach for patients experiencing falls due to impairment or loss of consciousness. Following a set of definitions, we describe the salient clinical features of disorders leading to such falls. Among falls caused by true loss of consciousness, we separate the clinical characteristics of syncopal falls — due to reflex syncope, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, or cardiac syncope — from those due to other causes of transient unconsciousness, such as seizures.

Regarding falls caused by apparent loss of consciousness, we discuss the presentation of cataplexy, drop attacks, and psychogenic falls. Particular emphasis is placed on crucial features obtained from history-taking to distinguish between the various conditions that cause or mimic a transient loss of consciousness.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope [^112DCV2o]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

The ESC 2018 guidelines recommend confirming syncope due to orthostatic hypotension when there is a fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from the baseline value by ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by ≥ 10 mmHg. Alternatively, a decrease in SBP to < 90 mmHg that reproduces spontaneous symptoms should also be considered.

### Risk-stratification tools for emergency department patients with syncope: A systematic review and meta-analysis of direct evidence for SAEM GRACE [^112JrPbX]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

As part of SAEM GRACE's evidence-to-decision framework, this systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) synthesizes the best direct evidence regarding the methodological quality and prognostic accuracy of clinical decision rules (CDRs) for managing patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with syncope. After a comprehensive literature search, 13 CDRs met the SRMA's inclusion criteria. Only three of the 13 CDRs — SFSR, CSRS, and OESIL — are validated by more than two studies, with significant overlap in operating characteristics. CSRS has the highest pooled sensitivity and lowest pooled specificity. Comparing the CSRS to the SFSR and OESIL reveals low-quality evidence for predicting all adverse events (a composite outcome measure) in ED patients presenting with syncope. The factors that decrease the certainty of evidence (CoE) include the indirectness of the available evidence and a strong suspicion of a high probability of publication bias.

The findings of this SRMA suggest that CDRs may lack the necessary rigor and predictability to surpass the intuitive judgment of clinicians in risk-stratifying ED syncope patients and predicting adverse events. Most of the CDRs examined in this study demonstrate low-quality evidence for predicting all adverse events in ED syncope patients. As a rule of thumb, a likelihood ratio positive (LR+) below 5 seldom influences the pre-test probability sufficiently to yield an actionable post-test probability. In this SRMA, all three CDRs (SFSR, CSRS, OESIL) validated by more than two studies have an LR+ below 5 for predicting all adverse events. Regarding the likelihood ratio negative (LR−), only a value below 0.1 produces a significant impact.

### Did this patient have cardiac syncope? The rational clinical examination systematic review [^111g4Q4w]. JAMA (2019). Low credibility.

Syncope can result from a reduction in cardiac output due to serious cardiac conditions, such as arrhythmias or structural heart disease, known as cardiac syncope, or from other causes like vasovagal syncope or orthostatic hypotension. This review's objective was to systematically examine studies concerning the accuracy of clinical examinations in identifying patients with cardiac syncope. The studies considered were those involving adults presenting to primary care, emergency departments, or referred to specialty clinics.

Relevant data was extracted from articles in databases until April 9, 2019, with an assessment of methodological quality. The included studies were independently compared to a reference standard. The main outcomes and measures analyzed were sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs).

Eleven studies involving cardiac syncope (total N = 4317) were included. Findings indicated that an age of first syncope of at least 35 years increased the likelihood of cardiac syncope (n = 323; sensitivity, 91% [95% CI, 85%-97%]; specificity, 72% [95% CI, 66%-78%]; LR, 3.3 [95% CI, 2.6–4.1]), whereas an age younger than 35 years decreased this likelihood (LR, 0.13 [95% CI, 0.06–0.25]). A history of atrial fibrillation or flutter was also associated with a higher likelihood of cardiac syncope (n = 323; sensitivity, 13% [95% CI, 6%-20%]; specificity, 98% [95% CI, 96%-100%]; LR, 7.3 [95% CI, 2.4–22]), as was known severe structural heart disease (n = 222; sensitivity range, 35%-51%; specificity range, 84%-93%; LR range, 3.3–4.8; from 2 studies). Symptoms prior to syncope associated with lower likelihood were identified but not detailed here due to truncation of the original text.

### Prazosin hydrochloride [^113sh88c]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

As with all alpha-blockers, prazosin hydrochloride capsules may cause syncope with sudden loss of consciousness. In most cases, this is believed to be due to an excessive postural hypotensive effect, although occasionally the syncopal episode has been preceded by a bout of severe tachycardia with heart rates of 120–160 beats per minute. Syncopal episodes have usually occurred within 30 to 90 minutes of the initial dose of the drug; occasionally, they have been reported in association with rapid dosage increases or the introduction of another antihypertensive drug into the regimen of a patient taking high doses of prazosin hydrochloride capsules. The incidence of syncopal episodes is approximately 1% in patients given an initial dose of 2 mg or greater. Clinical trials conducted during the investigational phase of this drug suggest that syncopal episodes can be minimized by limiting the initial dose of the drug to 1 mg, by subsequently increasing the dosage slowly, and by introducing any additional antihypertensive drugs into the patient's regimen with caution. Hypotension may develop in patients given prazosin hydrochloride capsules who are also receiving a beta-blocker such as propranolol.

If syncope occurs, the patient should be placed in the recumbent position and treated supportively as necessary. This adverse effect is self-limiting and in most cases does not recur after the initial period of therapy or during subsequent dose titration.

Patients should always be started on the 1 mg capsules of prazosin hydrochloride capsules.

### Priorities for emergency department syncope research [^116wCqoG]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

There is limited evidence to guide the emergency department (ED) evaluation and management of syncope. The First International Workshop on Syncope Risk Stratification in the Emergency Department identified key research questions and methodological standards essential to advancing the science of ED-based syncope research.

- **Methods**: We recruited a multinational panel of syncope experts. A preconference survey identified research priorities, which were refined during and after the conference through an iterative review process.

- **Results**: There were 31 participants from 7 countries who represented 10 clinical and methodological specialties. High-priority research recommendations were organized around a conceptual model of ED decision-making for syncope, and they address definition, cohort selection, risk stratification, and management.

- **Conclusion**: We convened a multispecialty group of syncope experts to identify the most pressing knowledge gaps and defined a high-priority research agenda to improve the care of patients with syncope in the ED.

### A 26-year-old woman with recurrent loss of consciousness [^11672wDd]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

This case involves a 26-year-old woman with congenital long QT syndrome and re-arrhythmic syncope, which had been misdiagnosed as a seizure disorder. Useful criteria for differentiating loss of consciousness due to congenital long QT syndrome from that caused by seizure activity are discussed. The multiple potential causes and clinical implications of a prolonged QT interval, along with the clinical features and management of congenital long QT syndrome, are reviewed.

### Pediatric syncope: A systematic review [^112rvSFT]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Low credibility.

Syncope, defined as the transient loss of consciousness and postural tone with a spontaneous recovery, is a common pediatric complaint. One or more syncopal episodes affect approximately 15% of children younger than 18 years. Variability in the clinical presentation of childhood syncope, along with the uncertainty in etiology, often results in costly and unnecessarily detailed inpatient or outpatient evaluations; the uncertainty also generates significant anxiety for both parent and patient alike. The etiologies associated with syncope in the pediatric population range from vasovagal dysfunction to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to seizure disorders. Although many etiologies of syncope and the incidence of each have been identified in previous studies, there has not been a systematic review that combines the data from various institutions in an organized manner that can be useful to clinicians.

The goal of this study was to develop a comprehensive differential diagnosis of childhood syncope. This includes the relative probabilities and 95% credible intervals (CredIs) for each clinical entity using a systematic review of the world's literature and Bayesian meta-analysis. Such a compendium would serve as a guide for the evaluation of pediatric patients with syncope.

### Clinical mimics: An emergency medicine-focused review of syncope mimics [^1172f53A]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Syncope is an event that causes a transient loss of consciousness (LOC) secondary to global cerebral hypoperfusion. The transient nature of the event can make diagnosis in the emergency department (ED) difficult, as symptoms have often resolved by the time of initial presentation. The symptoms and presentation of syncope are similar to many other conditions, which can lead to difficulty in establishing a diagnosis in the ED.

- **Objective**: This review evaluates patients presenting with a history concerning for possible syncope, mimics of syncope, and the approach to managing syncope mimics.

- **Discussion**: Syncope is caused by transient LOC secondary to global cerebral hypoperfusion. Many conditions can present similarly to syncope, making diagnosis in the ED difficult. Some of the most emergent conditions include seizures, stroke, metabolic disorders, and head trauma. Other nonemergent conditions include cataplexy, pseudosyncope, or deconditioning. Many laboratory studies and imaging can be nondiagnostic during ED evaluation. For patients presenting with apparent syncope, immediate treatment should focus on identifying and treating life-threatening conditions. History and physical examination can help guide further diagnostic evaluation and management.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with apparent syncope should be evaluated for potential immediate life-threatening conditions. A thorough history and physical examination can aid in distinguishing syncope from common mimics and help identify and subsequently treat life-threatening conditions.

### Vasovagal syncope [^114ixqkF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Vasovagal syncope is the most common type of syncope and is one of the most difficult types to manage. This article reviews the status of mechanisms, diagnosis, and management of vasovagal syncope.

- **Data sources**: A MEDLINE search was conducted for English-language and German-language articles on vasovagal syncope, published up to June 1999.

- **Study selection**: The study selection included case reports and series, clinical trials, research investigations, and review articles from peer-reviewed journals.

- **Data extraction**: Findings were summarized and discussed individually, with summaries made in table format. Due to differences in patient selection, testing, and follow-up among studies, statistical analysis of combined data was deemed inappropriate.

- **Data synthesis**: The population of patients with vasovagal syncope is highly heterogeneous. Triggers are likely to be diverse, with many potential central and peripheral triggers identified. The specific mechanisms underlying interactions among decreased preload, sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation, vasodilation, and cardioinhibition remain unknown. Tilt-table testing is a widely used diagnostic tool, and test results should be interpreted in the context of patients' clinical presentations and an understanding of the test's sensitivity and specificity. Assessing therapeutic outcomes has been difficult due to patient heterogeneity, the large number of pharmacologic agents available, and the sporadic nature of the syndrome complex.

Conclusions indicate that vasovagal syncope is a common clinical challenge.
