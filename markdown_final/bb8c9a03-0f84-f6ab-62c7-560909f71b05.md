## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to find the smallest positive intersection point of the curves y = (sin x + cos x)⁴ and y = (sin x - cos x)⁴, and then compute the area between them from x = 0 to that point. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about simplifying the expressions for the two curves. Then, I should solve for the next positive intersection after x = 0. Next, I will determine which curve is above the other in the interval of interest. Finally, I will set up and evaluate the definite integral for the area between the curves, and match the result to the given options.

> Let me first simplify the expressions so I can see the periodic structure more clearly. I recall that sin x + cos x = √2 sin(x + π/4) and sin x - cos x = √2 sin(x - π/4), so raising to the fourth power gives y = (√2 sin(x + π/4))⁴ = 4 sin⁴(x + π/4) for the first curve and y = (√2 sin(x - π/4))⁴ = 4 sin⁴(x - π/4) for the second curve. Wait, let me verify the identities before proceeding; yes, those angle-addition forms are correct, and the factor of 4 comes from (√2)⁴ = 4, so the simplification stands.

> Now, I need to find when these curves intersect again after x = 0. Setting the two expressions equal gives 4 sin⁴(x + π/4) = 4 sin⁴(x - π/4), which simplifies to sin⁴(x + π/4) = sin⁴(x - π/4). Taking fourth roots carefully, this implies sin(x + π/4) = ± sin(x - π/4). Let me consider the positive case first: sin(x + π/4) = sin(x - π/4). Using the sine equality condition, this occurs when x + π/4 = x - π/4 + 2πk or x + π/4 = π - (x - π/4) + 2πk. The first equation leads to π/2 = 2πk, which is impossible for integer k, so I should discard it. The second equation gives 2x = π + 2πk, so x = π/2 + πk. For the smallest positive solution, I take k = 0, yielding x = π/2. Hold on, I should verify the negative case too: sin(x + π/4) = -sin(x - π/4) = sin(-x + π/4), which leads to x + π/4 = -x + π/4 + 2πk or x + π/4 = π - (-x + π/4) + 2πk. The first gives 2x = 2πk, so x = πk, and the second gives 0 = π/2 + 2πk, which is impossible. Thus, the next positive intersection after 0 is indeed at x = π/2, so a = π/2.

> Next, I should review which curve lies above the other in the interval (0, π/2). Let me pick a test point, say x = π/4. For the first curve, y = 4 sin^4(π/4 + π/4) = 4 sin^4(π/2) = 4(1)^4 = 4. For the second curve, y = 4 sin^4(π/4 - π/4) = 4 sin^4(0) = 0. So (sin x + cos x)^4 is above (sin x - cos x)^4 on (0, π/2), which means the integrand for the area will be the difference of the first minus the second.

> I will now examine the area integral. The area A is the integral from 0 to π/2 of [4 sin⁴(x + π/4) - 4 sin⁴(x - π/4)] dx. Let me factor out 4 and consider the integral of sin^4 u. I should double-check the reduction formula: sin⁴ u = (sin² u)² = [(1 - cos 2u)/2]² = (1–2 cos 2u + cos² 2u)/4 = (1–2 cos 2u + (1 + cos 4u)/2)/4 = (3/8) - (1/2) cos 2u + (1/8) cos 4u. So the antiderivative of sin⁴ u is (3/8)u - (1/4) sin 2u + (1/32) sin 4u. Applying this to both terms with appropriate shifts, I get A = 4[(3/8)(x + π/4) - (1/4) sin(2x + π/2) + (1/32) sin(4x + π)] evaluated from 0 to π/2, minus 4[(3/8)(x - π/4) - (1/4) sin(2x - π/2) + (1/32) sin(4x - π)] evaluated from 0 to π/2. Wait, let me verify the evaluations carefully to avoid sign errors, especially with the sine terms shifted by π/2 and π.

> Evaluating the first antiderivative from 0 to π/2 gives: at x = π/2, (3/8)(3π/4) - (1/4) sin(π + π/2) + (1/32) sin(2π + π) = 9π/32 - (1/4) sin(3π/2) + (1/32) sin(3π) = 9π/32 + 1/4 + 0; at x = 0, (3/8)(π/4) - (1/4) sin(π/2) + (1/32) sin(π) = 3π/32–1/4 + 0. Subtracting yields (9π/32 + 1/4) - (3π/32–1/4) = 6π/32 + 1/2 = 3π/16 + 1/2. For the second antiderivative, at x = π/2, (3/8)(π/4) - (1/4) sin(π - π/2) + (1/32) sin(2π - π) = 3π/32 - (1/4) sin(π/2) + (1/32) sin(π) = 3π/32–1/4 + 0; at x = 0, (3/8)(-π/4) - (1/4) sin(-π/2) + (1/32) sin(-π) = -3π/32 + 1/4 + 0. Subtracting yields (3π/32–1/4) - (-3π/32 + 1/4) = 6π/32–1/2 = 3π/16–1/2. Now, multiplying each by 4 and subtracting the second from the first, I get A = 4[(3π/16 + 1/2) - (3π/16–1/2)] = 4(1) = 4. Hold on, I should verify that the π terms indeed cancel and the constants combine correctly; yes, they do, and the final area is 4.

> Therefore, the area between the curves from x = 0 to x = π/2 is 4, which corresponds to option C. Let me reconsider the key steps to ensure no mistake: simplification to 4 sin^4 terms, finding the next intersection at π/2, confirming the upper/lower relationship, and integrating using the sin^4 reduction formula all check out, and the arithmetic leads cleanly to 4.

---

The curves intersect next at (x = π/2), so (a = π/2). The area between the curves from (x = 0) to (x = π/2) is **4**.

## Step 1: Simplify the expressions

Use the identities:

sin x + cos x = √2 sin(x + π/4)

sin x − cos x = √2 sin(x − π/4)

Then:

(sin x + cos x)⁴ = 4 sin⁴(x + π/4)

(sin x − cos x)⁴ = 4 sin⁴(x − π/4)

---

## Step 2: Find the next intersection point

Set the expressions equal:

4 sin⁴(x + π/4) = 4 sin⁴(x − π/4)

sin⁴(x + π/4) = sin⁴(x − π/4)

This implies:

sin(x + π/4) = ± sin(x − π/4)

- **Case 1**: (sin(x + π/4) = sin(x − π/4))

x + π/4 = x − π/4 + 2πn or x + π/4 = π − (x − π/4) + 2πn

The first equation gives (π/2 = 2π n), which has no solution; the second gives (2x = π + 2π n), so (x = π/2 + π n).

- **Case 2**: (sin(x + π/4) = −sin(x − π/4))

x + π/4 = −x + π/4 + 2πn or x + π/4 = π + (x − π/4) + 2πn

The first gives (2x = 2π n), so (x = π n); the second gives (0 = π/2 + 2π n), which has no solution.

The smallest positive intersection after (x = 0) is at (x = π/2), so (a = π/2).

---

## Step 3: Determine which curve is above the other

On ((0, π/2)), test (x = π/4):

(sin π/4 + cos π/4)⁴ = (√2)⁴ = 4

(sin π/4 − cos π/4)⁴ = 0⁴ = 0

Thus, ((sin x + cos x)⁴ ≥ (sin x − cos x)⁴) on ([0, π/2]).

---

## Step 4: Compute the area

The area is:

A = ∫₀^π/2 [(sin x + cos x)⁴ − (sin x − cos x)⁴] dx

Expand the integrand:

(sin x + cos x)⁴ − (sin x − cos x)⁴ = 8 sin x cos x (sin² x + cos² x) = 8 sin x cos x = 4 sin 2x

So:

A = ∫₀^π/2 4 sin 2x dx = 4[−1/2 cos 2x]₀^π/2 = −2(cos π − cos 0) = −2(−1 − 1) = 4

---

The area between the curves from (x = 0) to (x = π/2) is **4**.

---

The correct answer is **C. 4**.

### Prompt engineering in consistency and reliability with the evidence-based guideline for LLMs [^112eP6UM]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

However, ROT promoting is not necessarily the best prompt for other LLMs. For instance, for five versions of GPT-3.5, except for P-COT prompting being the best prompt for GPT-3.5-Web, the best prompt for other versions was IO prompting. For Bard, the best prompt was 0-COT. This indicated that we could try different prompting strategies to obtain the best responses.

The ROT prompting asked LLM to return to previous thoughts and examine if they were appropriate, which may improve the robustness of the answer. Furthermore, the ROT-based design can minimize the occurrence of egregiously incorrect answers from the gpt-4-Web. For instance, regarding a 'strong' level suggestion, "Lateral wedge insoles are not recommended for patients with knee osteoarthritis". ROT prompting provided four 'strong' answers and one 'moderate' answer in five responses. Initially, in this 'moderate' response (Supplementary Note 1), two "experts" provided "limited" answers, and one "expert" answered "moderate". After "discussion", all "experts" agreed on a 'moderate' recommendation. The final reason was that even though there was high-quality evidence to support the advice, there might still be slight potential benefits for some individuals. Notably, the reasons given by the two experts for "limiting" seem to be more in line with the statement "Lateral wedge insoles are recommended for patients with knee osteoarthritis". This implies that these two "experts" did not fully understand the medical advice correctly, as "Expert C" mentioned in step five: "Observes that the results are somewhat mixed, but there's a general agreement that the benefits, if any, from lateral wedge insoles are limited". However, after the "discussion", the final revised recommendation and reason were deemed acceptable. Referring to the application of TOT in the 24-point game, the prompt designed in the style of TOT as well as the ROT prompting in this study could offer more possibilities at every step of the task, and LLM could be asked to return to previous thoughts, aiming to induce LLM to generate more accurate answers.

Question 2: Which of the following is a risk factor for development of this condition in this patient?
A. Age over 70
B. Prior history of radiation therapy
C. Prior history of melanoma
D. Prior history of nonmelanoma skin cancer
E. All of the above

Answer:
A. Age over 70 – Incorrect. This is not the best answer given other choices available.
B. Prior history of radiation therapy – Incorrect. This is not the best answer given other choices available.
C. Prior history of melanoma – Incorrect. This is not the best answer given other choices available.
D. Prior history of nonmelanoma skin cancer – Incorrect. This is not the best answer given other choices available.
E. All of the above – Correct. All of the above listed answer choices are risk factors for BP. Based on a recent propensity score-matched case-control study, age greater than 70 years at the time of receiving first immune checkpoint inhibitor cycle, history of melanoma, and history of nonmelanoma skin cancers are all associated with increased risk of developing BP among a cohort of patients treated with ICIs. Radiotherapy is also an independent risk factor for BP. While the underlying pathophysiology is unknown, it has been hypothesized that radiotherapy causes tissue damage, leading to increased antigen exposure and increased autoantibody production. In addition to the risk factor of ICI usage, BP onset in this patient is likely associated with radiotherapy exposure given localized distribution of disease in previously irradiated areas on bilateral cheeks.

### Why questionnaire scores are not measures: a question-raising article [^112ZrCUP]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

The Puzzle of Missing Values

Missing items are common in questionnaires, resulting from different reasons. Typical examples are made by subjects who may inadvertently skip over some questions or may not have enough time to complete the test. Subjects would prefer not to answer if higher penalties are assigned to wrong than missing answers. Sometimes, some items are reserved to some respondents, for example, those who attempted in the past a given activity or have other characteristics such as sex or language.

When missing answers are found, the easiest and most practiced solution would be to transform scores into the percentage of the total score given by the answered items. For example, if a subject misses two items and totals seven on a questionnaire of 10 dichotomous items, the subject's "total score" is 87.5% (7/8). Note that this procedure is equivalent to the common "mean substitution" procedure, assigning the missing items the average score observed in the other items. This method relies on the (strong and unlikely) assumption that questionnaires' items are all indicators of the same quantity of the latent variable of interest and thus exchangeable (i.e. they all share the same difficulty level).

Table 2 provides an example showing why this solution does not work. Suppose 10 items again, each scored 0 or 1, aligned from left to right for increasing difficulty. The "x" symbol flags a missing response. According to traditional psychometrics, subjects A and B are assigned the same score. Subject C, providing two missing answers, is assigned a lower score. However, it seems that subject A's missing response should be given a higher score estimate, given that the subject passed five more difficult items. In contrast, subject B failed three items easier than the missed one. It is doubtful that subject C deserves a lower score than subject B: he/she passed four items more difficult than the missed items.

TABLE 2
Estimation of missing values, based on average scores across answered items

Presumably, subjects A and C were careless in their answers or had not enough time to complete the test.

This example is intentionally simplistic. The treatment of missing data is a complex research field, faced by the whole field of statistics. As far as psychometric statistics is concerned, RA provides a satisfactory answer to this problem.

### Palliative care best practices guidelines [^112M94Br]. ACS (2017). Medium credibility.

Palliative care screening and the "surprise question" — screening for further palliative care needs begins on admission and continues during the first 72 hours. The "surprise question" is one of the best prognostic tools for the seriously ill hospitalized patient, and the answer to this question, "Would you be surprised if this patient were dead in 12 months?" is a helpful part of the screening process; if the answer is NO, this should trigger palliative care pathways and lead to discussion about advance care planning. Screening will identify a group of patients who are primarily young or otherwise healthy with non-life-threatening injuries as "screen negative", requiring pain and symptom management and identification of a health care proxy, while the remaining patients with a positive screen will benefit from early palliative care focused on Goals of Care Conversations and appropriate decision-making. Category 1 positive screens have uncertainty regarding long-term functional recovery or survival due to severe traumatic injuries, age, frailty, comorbidities, or a combination of these factors; the answer to the "surprise question" is a "maybe" or "no", and these patients need advance care planning discussions, clarification of resuscitation preferences, and early Goals of Care Conversations to establish priorities and preferences for ongoing trauma care with a focus on potential complications such as organ failure.

### Harm is all you need? Best interests and disputes about parental decision-making [^115aRKED]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2016). Low credibility.

A growing number of bioethics papers endorse the harm threshold when judging whether to override parental decisions. Among other claims, these papers argue that the harm threshold is easily understood by lay and professional audiences and correctly conforms to societal expectations of parents in regard to their children. English law contains a harm threshold which mediates the use of the best interests test in cases where a child may be removed from her parents. Using Diekema's seminal paper as an example, this paper explores the proposed workings of the harm threshold. I use examples from the practical use of the harm threshold in English law to argue that the harm threshold is an inadequate answer to the indeterminacy of the best interests test. I detail two criticisms: First, the harm standard has evaluative overtones and judges are loath to employ it where parental behaviour is misguided but they wish to treat parents sympathetically. Thus, by focusing only on 'substandard' parenting, harm is problematic where the parental attempts to benefit their child are misguided or wrong, such as in disputes about withdrawal of medical treatment. Second, when harm is used in genuine dilemmas, court judgments offer different answers to similar cases. This level of indeterminacy suggests that, in practice, the operation of the harm threshold would be indistinguishable from best interests. Since indeterminacy appears to be the greatest problem in elucidating what is best, bioethicists should concentrate on discovering the values that inform best interests.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of glomerular diseases [^112Tq1wU]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

KDIGO glomerular disease guideline — reference keys for rating recommendations indicate scope and evidence levels: "Within each recommendation, the strength of recommendation is indicated as Level 1 or Level 2, and the quality of the supporting evidence is shown as A, B, C, or D". Level 1, strong "We recommend" implies for patients that "Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not", for clinicians that "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action", and for policy that "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". Level 2, weak "We suggest" implies for patients that "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", for clinicians that "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences", and for policy that "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined". Evidence grades are defined with meanings: A High — "We are confident that the true effect is close to the estimate of the effect"; B Moderate — "The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different"; C Low — "The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect"; D Very low — "The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often it will be far from the true effect".

### "There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something"-asking questions and searching for answers-the evidence based approach [^116vBBt6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2010). Low credibility.

Evidence based medicine (EBM) consists of four separate processes. Asking a clinical question Locating the evidence Appraising and synthesizing the evidence Applying the evidence Most people are familiar with the third step but not so familiar with the first two. Well-designed clinical questions can help clarify in a clinicians mind exactly what information is being sought and also help with the search. This clinical question can be framed around the PICO format. With a well-structured PICO information can then be located in a timely manner using the concept of Haynes's 5 S's and a range of websites including trial registers and meta-search engines.

### Editorial commentary: at present, chatGPT cannot Be relied upon to answer patient questions and requires physician expertise to interpret answers for patients [^116jjoZr]. Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

ChatGPT is designed to provide accurate and reliable information to the best of its abilities based on the data input and knowledge available. Thus, ChatGPT is being studied as a patient information tool. This artificial intelligence (AI) tool has been shown to frequently provide technically correct information but with limitations. ChatGPT provides different answers to similar questions based on the prompts, and patients may not have expertise in prompting ChatGPT to elicit a best answer. (Prompting large language models has been shown to be a skill that can improve.) Of greater concern, ChatGPT fails to provide sources or references for its answers. At present, ChatGPT cannot be relied upon to address patient questions; in the future, ChatGPT will improve. Today, AI requires physician expertise to interpret AI answers for patients.

### T3 translational science in gastroenterology: getting to best outcomes [^112wptJj]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Achieving the best possible outcomes requires the reliable implementation of best practices for every patient. Specifically, optimizing outcomes requires a spectrum of research spanning basic science, drug development, clinical efficacy and effectiveness, health services, quality improvement, and implementation research. However, our rapid increase in understanding the mechanisms of health and disease and their treatment has far outpaced our ability to reliably provide that care, resulting in poor reliability and enormous variation in care. T3 translational research studies attempt to answer questions surrounding reliable implementation of interventions, decreasing variations in care, and spreading effective therapies. To answer these questions, T3 research may use traditional research methodology such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs); however, various other approaches such as quasiexperimental designs (eg, time-series analysis) are often used. Although uncommon, T3 research has shown promise in not only improving process measures such as correct dosing of medications, but also outcome measures such as improved remission rates in patients with IBD. A more complete integration of T3 translational research into the more traditional research continuum is necessary if we are to achieve the best possible outcomes for our patients.

### Towards evidence based emergency medicine: best BETs from the manchester royal infirmary. BET 2: do wrist splints need to have a thumb extension when immobilising suspected scaphoid fractures? [^114kzBn1]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether wrist splints require a thumb extension when immobilising suspected scaphoid fractures. 63 papers were found using the reported searches, of which 2 presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. It is concluded that while there is no direct evidence to answer the clinical question, the research available strongly suggests that it is reasonable to continue using standard wrist splints to immobilise patients with suspected scaphoid fractures.

### Allergy and immunology practice parameters and guidelines: the new normal [^111fzCPK]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Revised classification (Table 2) — recommendation rating scale with clinical implications specifies: Strong recommendation means the benefits clearly exceed the harms and the quality of evidence is excellent (Grade A or B); clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Moderate recommendation means the benefits exceed the harms but the quality of evidence is not as strong (Grade B or C); clinicians also should generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Weak option means that the quality of evidence that exists is suspect (Grade D) or that well-done studies (Grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage to one approach vs another; clinicians should be flexible in their decision making with patient preference having a substantial influencing role. No recommendation means there is a lack of pertinent evidence (Grade D) and an unclear balance between benefits and harms; clinicians should feel little constraint in decision making and be alert to new published evidence; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Strength categories in this revised schema also include LB (Laboratory based) and NR (Not rated).

- B, C. On an arithmetic-scale line graph, the axes and tick marks should be clearly labeled. For both the x- and y-axis, a particular distance anywhere along the axis should represent the same increase in quantity, although the x- and y-axis usually differ in what is measured. The y-axis, measuring frequency, should begin at zero. But the x-axis, which often measures time, need not start at zero.
- B. Values of 0. 1, 1, 10, and 100 represent orders of magnitude typical of the y-axis of a semilogarithmic-scale line graph.
- C. Both arithmetic-scale and semilogarithmic-scale line graphs can be used to plot numbers or rates.
- B. A bar chart is used to graph the frequency of events of a categorical variable such as sex, or geographic region.
- A, B. A frequency polygon differs from a line graph in that a frequency polygon represents a frequency distribution, with the area under the curve proportionate to the frequency.

Because the total area must represent 100%, the ends of the frequency polygon must be closed. Although a line graph is commonly used to display frequencies over time, a frequency polygon can display the frequency distribution of a given period of time as well. Similarly, the y-axis of both types of graph can measure percentages.
- C. The y-axis of both cumulative frequency curves and survival curves typically display percentages from 0% at the bottom to 100% at the top. The main difference is that a cumulative frequency curve begins at 0% and increases, whereas a survival curve begins at 100% and decreases.
- B. Because a survival curve begins at 100%, the plotted curve begins at the top of the y-axis and at the beginning time interval of the x-axis, i.e., in the upper left corner.
- A. Because a cumulative frequency curve begins at 0%., the plotted curve begins at the base of the y-axis and at the beginning time interval of the x-axis, i.e., in the lower left corner.
- C. Because the y-axis represents proportions, a horizontal line drawn from the 50% tick mark to the plotted curve will indicate 50% survival or 50% cumulative frequency. The median is another name for the 50% mark of a distribution of data.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2015). Medium credibility.

Computed tomography in congenital heart disease — use principles and pre-scan decision questions emphasize that the cardiac CT scan is usually ordered to answer a specific clinical question to help with the medical or interventional management of the patient, and each cardiac CT exam must be tailored to the patient to minimize risk and maximize diagnostic yield; performing cardiac CT for CHD requires an in depth knowledge of the patient history, prior intervention(s), common hemodynamic sequelae, and the clinical question(s) to be answered by the study, and the imaging physician needs to be actively involved in directing patient preparation and image acquisition for each cardiac CT performed for CHD; several questions should be asked prior to selection of CT as the imaging test of choice in CHD: does the study indication justify the risks of CT (radiation and contrast exposure, anesthesia and/or medication for heart rate control when needed), does cardiac CT have the ability to best answer the clinical questions at the least risk to the patient when compared to alternate diagnostic modalities locally available, and will the results provide the information necessary to impact clinical management of the patient.

### An approach to recurrent aneurysms following endovascular coiling [^111U6pAC]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence regarding the most appropriate management of aneurysm recurrences following coiling consists only of uncontrolled case series and the resulting expert opinions, which range from not following coiled patients at all to performing invasive angiography at regular intervals.

Methods

We discuss several current attitudes toward how to manage post-coiling recurrences and outline an approach to finding concrete, practical answers to common clinical questions.

Results

Although some maxims and general statements can be reluctantly offered, in the absence of evidence the best approach is to emphasize proper methods in order to one day find reliable answers. These can only come from randomized clinical trials. The multitude of research questions is an added difficulty. A program of necessary trials is proposed and centers are encouraged to work in a collaborative fashion in order to offer best possible care as well as progress.

Conclusion

Common clinical questions, including how to follow coiled aneurysm patients, if and when to re-treat, and with which treatment modality, are best addressed with the sound scientific methodology of clinical trials.

### Asking a question: linking evidence with practice [^112Q6NFr]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

For clinicians and researchers alike, a clear and answerable question is the starting line of the evidence-based practice process. For clinicians, the question captures the patient and defines the information needed to treat this patient. For researchers, the question directs study design and drives everything from recruitment to reporting. The question is also the anchor point that links clinical practice to research. Engaging in evidence-based practice forces a subconscious process that occurs during assessment of the patient into the conscious mind and makes it explicit. Clearly and concisely defining the question leads directly to the search for relevant research. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2018;48(7):596–597. doi:10.2519/jospt.2018.0702.

### A qualitative inquiry on pregnant women's preferences for mental health screening [^115hHwPb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Thinking things through

A need to think about answers emerged from the interviews with women who preferred this approach. Most participants explained that this approach would give them time to think and to ensure they answered questions accurately, while, others reported that this approach would give them time to think about the answer that they wanted to share. A nulliparous woman commented:

"I can think about what people say to me and I can think about what I want to say back. Whereas a phone conversation is you gotta be quicker than that". (Participant 6)

Some women indicated that they were cautious about how to respond to the questions and would need extra time to provide "the best answer". A 32-year-old woman struggling with obsessive thoughts commented:

"The direct asking the questions I think people might need a bit of time. For me, I'm careful how I like to answer because I'd like to give the best answer kind of thing so. I need a little bit of time to kind of think of what I need to say. For me, the best way is to say while you're here we need you to fill out this questionnaire". (Participant 12)

Clinicians and researchers seek answers to clinical research questions, primarily by accessing the results of clinical research studies. This paper moves the focus of research enquiry from getting answers to developing good clinical research questions. Using worked examples, the steps involved in refining questions drawn from various sources to create 'answerable' clinical research questions using the 'PICO' principle are described. Issues to consider in prioritising clinical research questions are also identified. Theoretical and practical considerations involved in choosing the right study design for a clinical research question are then discussed using the worked examples. These include:

### Three questions to ask before using model outputs for decision support [^1121Rnd7]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

A way forward

Models tend to look right as they are presented with the claim of being realistic enough for their purpose. Looking right, though, has many dimensions, and we suggest the three screening questions presented here as a simple approach for decision makers to disentangle them. Once we know a model's purpose, we can assess whether its organization is meaningful; once we know its purpose and organization, we can assess whether it represents the real system dynamics relevant to a specific problem; once we know which patterns it can reproduce, we can assess whether its model outputs can support decisions; and once we have answered all three questions for a suite of models they can be compared and taken into account to varying degrees. The three questions do not replace more detailed guidelines on GMP, but they provide a simple and effective common language that will allow us to develop models and use their outputs for decision support in a more transparent, robust, and safe way.

It is still important to keep in mind that models can only support decisions. The responsibility for using model outputs lies with decision makers. Answers to the three screening questions allow them to transparently base their decisions on a weight-of-evidence approach, and to update their decisions when new data and updated models are available.

### Everyday norms have become more permissive over time and vary across cultures [^114ZeFxU]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Procedure

The data was collected anonymously online using Qualtrics, with exception for (part of) the data from Mauritius and Benin where the same questions were asked face-to-face by an interviewer who recorded the responses in Qualtrics. To take the survey, participants needed to give their informed consent, make a commitment to give their best answers (see below), and report an age of 18 or above.

To pass the attention check, participants needed to respond correctly to the following survey item: "Many things may affect our judgment of whether a behavior is appropriate or not. We are testing whether or not people read questions. To show us you've read this far, please answer both 'very interested' and 'extremely interested'. (There were five checkboxes labeled from 'not at all interested' to 'extremely interested'. As an additional attention check, we used the commitment pledge, which read "We care about the quality of our survey data. To get the most accurate measures of your opinions, it is important that you thoughtfully provide your best answers to each question in this survey. Do you commit to thoughtfully provide your best answers to the questions in this survey?" Respondents who selected the response option "I will not provide my best answers" did not get to proceed with the survey. Those who selected "I will provide my best answers" (96.2%) or "I can't promise either way" (3.8%) were allowed to participate, but those who selected the latter option were not counted as having passed the attention check (see next section).

Samples used in the analysis

The analysis is performed on three samples: Preregistered, All Data, and Attention Check. The Preregistered sample (N = 17,288) includes data collected until February 28, except for a few societies that did not include certain questions. The All Data sample (N = 25,422) also includes these societies and data collected after February 28. The Attention Check sample (N = 15,599) excludes participants who did not pass the attention check. As shown in Supplementary Table 1, the attention check pass rate varies dramatically between societies. Given this large variance, presenting the results for the attention-checked sample demonstrates that our findings are not driven by societies with lower data quality.

Analysis

All analyses were performed using R version 4.3.1.

### Relations among sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of medical tests based on biomarkers [^115a3Kwi]. General Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Numerical study

In this section, we use some numerical examples to show how these four quantities change. Note that given a cut-off c of the biomarker, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value are all functions of c from which we can identify the changing pattern of each pair of them.

For simplicity, assume the biomarker X has a standard normal distribution. The risk function is assumed to be of the form of the logistic function

From the probability theory, we know that the expected value of the risk function should equal the proportion p of the disease. Given each p, we determine unique parameter β 0 in the risk function by numerical integration. For example, p = 0.1, β 0 = −2.5642; p = 0.2, β 0 = −1.5601; and p = 0.3, β 0 = −1.0187.

Table 2 shows values of Se (c), Sp (c), PPV(c) and NPV(c) for c = −2.5,–2.0, −1.0, 0, 1, 2 and 3. We can see that Se and NPV are increasing functions of c, while Sp and PPV are decreasing functions of c. They are consistent with our conclusion developed above.

### Exenatide (BYDUREON BCise) [^115upGs8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Please keep these instructions to use for your next dose.

Common Questions and Answers

1. Where is the needle?

The needle is attached to the autoinjector and covered by the orange cap.

When you unscrew the orange cap, the green shield keeps the needle covered until you inject.

For more information, please see Figure N in Step 3B in the Instructions for Use.

2. How do I know if the medicine is fully mixed?

After shaking the autoinjector, look through both sides of the window. You should not see any white medicine along the bottom, top, or sides. If you see white medicine, it is unmixed. To mix, shake the autoinjector hard until the white medicine is no longer on the bottom, top, or sides. The medicine should look even throughout.

3. Why do I need to hold the autoinjector upright while removing the orange cap? Holding the autoinjector with the orange cap straight up helps prevent the medicine from leaking. It is normal to see a few drops of medicine inside the orange cap after you unscrew it.

4. Why should I inject my medicine right away after mixing it? If you do not inject your medicine right away after mixing, the medicine may separate, and you will not get your full dose. You can re-mix your medicine if your autoinjector is in the locked position. However, after you unlock it, you must complete the preparation steps right away and inject to get the full dose. You cannot save it for later use.

An initial draft was assessed for face validity by two members of a patient support group and three patient liaison staff members. Improvements to clarity and structure were made in response to feedback. Content validity was established through consultation with two consultant hepatologists with expertise in cirrhosis management.

The final version (see online supplementary file 1) consisted of six single-best-answer questions, one multiple-choice question and one short-written-answer question. The single-best-answer questions had a two-part structure. The first asked whether the participant knew the reason for a particular complication or management strategy, to which they could answer yes or no. If they answered yes, the second part offered them three reasons to choose from, along with a fourth 'other' option that could be written in a box provided. This structure was intended to best represent participants' understanding by discouraging guessing if they did not know the answer and by providing space for them to give a different response if they felt that none of the options given was suitable. The questions assessed participants' knowledge of the reasons for having ultrasound scans, endoscopies and bone mineral density scans; their knowledge of the causes of oesophageal varices and hepatic encephalopathy; their understanding of the reasons for taking laxatives; their awareness of muscle wasting, coagulopathy and liver cancer as being complications of cirrhosis (multiple-choice question) and their knowledge of the functions of the liver (short-written-answer question).

### Training surgeons to do evidence-based surgery: a collaborative approach [^115QUw2z]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Three of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education general competencies contain specific wording indicating that trainees must learn how to locate, appraise, and integrate the best information from the literature into their patient care practices. What is less clear is how to best translate evidence-based concepts into the workday of the resident, fellow, or attending surgeon. In this article we describe our use of the assignment-based training program we developed to ensure that our trainees can actually do what is required to practice evidence-based operations.

Study Design

Our collaborative program draws on the expertise of an attending surgeon, a medical librarian, and a research coordinator. The curriculum is designed so that all residents in our program develop and refine their evidence-based surgery skills in a context relating to their clinical practice. They are given a practice-related clinical question and are asked to demonstrate their competence in finding the best available evidence to answer it. This involves restating the question as a well-formulated clinical question, doing a focused literature search, critically appraising the results to find the best evidence, and integrating the information into practice, if appropriate. Search assignments are evaluated using a structured form and additional training is designed based on the results. Another question is then assigned to assess improvement.

Results

Residents' performance on a first assignment showed specific weaknesses in use of textwords and limiters. Performance was strongly related to a resident's ability to obtain the best evidence in answer to a clinical question (p = 0.011). Substantial improvement was shown on a second assignment after additional training.

Conclusions

Our hands-on, performance-based program allows us to document trainees' progress in developing skills that will allow them to efficiently locate the best evidence available to inform their patient care decisions.

### Survey design: to ask or not to ask? That is the question [^115KrEat]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Surveys are one of the most frequent modes of observation and measurement. Survey research can be exploratory, descriptive, and/or explanatory. Modes of survey administration vary and include face-to-face, telephone, mail, and Internet. There are numerous considerations that that must be taken into account when designing and conducting a survey. Deciding what information is needed and why is important when developing questions for a survey; it is essential to define the purpose of the survey and to be as specific as possible in terms of the data to be collected. Response rate varies by target audience and is influenced by a number of factors such as incentives, survey length, and perceived burden. From question development to survey construction, the goal is to minimize measurement error with systematic planning and execution.

Appendix B — recommendation rating scale defines the levels and their clinician implications as follows: A strong recommendation means benefits clearly exceed harms and evidence quality is excellent; Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. A moderate recommendation means benefits exceed harms but evidence is not as strong; Clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation indicates suspect evidence or little clear advantage among options; Clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. No recommendation reflects a lack of pertinent evidence and unclear benefit–harm balance; Clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision making and be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit vs harm; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

Appendix C — IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) interpretation for chikungunya states that for a single late specimen obtained later than 4–5 days post-onset of symptoms with a positive IgG-ELISA and negative MAC-ELISA, the distinction between current and past infections cannot be made. A negative IgG-ELISA plus a negative MAC-ELISA indicates the lack of any recent or past infections if the sample was collected 7 days post illness onset, whereas a more acute sample cannot rule out infection. P/N interpretation is empirical with a positive P/N cut-off value of 2.0; P/N values between 2.0 and 3.0 should be considered suspect false-positives and further tests should be performed to determine the status. The P/N value at the screening dilution of 1:400 is not an indication of absolute antibody concentration and is not quantitative.

### Influence and critique of the ASTRAL and CORAL trials [^114gsiK1]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Optimal management of renal artery atherosclerotic occlusive disease has been widely debated and studied. Although the accepted invasive treatment has evolved into favoring balloon angioplasty and stenting, the indications for intervention or medical therapy have not been universally agreed upon. The Angioplasty and Stenting for Renal Artery Lesions (ASTRAL) trial was conducted to answer the question of whether medical therapy or angioplasty and stenting is the best treatment for hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis. However, the ASTRAL trial's study design was faulty and therefore did not provide conclusive evidence to answer the question. The Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions (CORAL) trial was designed to answer the same question as to which treatment (medical or angioplasty and stent) is best for renal artery stenosis, and its methodologies took into consideration the weaknesses of the ASTRAL trial. Results are soon to be released.

### Can online networks provide quality answers to questions about occupational safety and health? [^115GzD6q]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess whether experts can provide high-quality answers to occupational safety and health (OSH) questions in online Question & Answer (Q&A) networks.

Methods

The authors evaluated the quality of answers provided by qualified experts in two Dutch online networks: ArboAntwoord and the Helpdesk of the Netherlands Center for Occupational Diseases. A random sample of 594 answers was independently evaluated by two raters using nine answer quality criteria. An additional criterion, the agreement of answers with the best available evidence, was explored by peer review of a sample of 42 answers. Reviewers performed an evidence search in Medline.

Results

The median answer quality score of ArboAntwoord (N = 295) and the Netherlands Center for Occupational Diseases Helpdesk (N = 299) was 8 of 9 (IQR 2). The inter-rater reliability of the first nine quality criteria was high (κ 0.82–0.90, p < 0.05). A question answered by two or more experts had a greater probability of a high-quality score than questions answered by one expert (OR 4.9, 95% CI 2.7 to 9.0). Answers most often scored insufficient on the use of evidence to underpin the answer (36% and 38% for the networks, respectively) and on conciseness (35% and 31%, respectively). Peer review demonstrated that 43%-72% of the answers in both online networks were in complete agreement with the best available evidence.

Conclusions

OSH experts are able to provide quality answers in online OSH Q&A networks. Our answer quality appraisal instrument was feasible and provided information on how to improve answer quality.

### The evaluation of an evidence-based clinical answer format for pediatricians [^113xXhyM]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Table 2
Overall usefulness of the Clinical Answer

A main purpose of our survey was to identify whether each section of the CA contained an appropriate level of detail (Table 3). Between 65% and 89% of respondents felt there was an appropriate level of detail in each section of the CA, with more than 75% of respondents thinking the amount of detail in the 'Question', 'Answer' and 'Included reviews' sections was appropriate. For respondents who did not think the level of detail in each section was appropriate, a significant number thought there was too much detail in the 'Question' (p = 0.04) and 'Linked figures and tables' (p = 0.0002) sections and too little detail in the 'Limitations' section (p = 0.008).

Table 3
Level of detail in each section of the Clinical Answer

* Calculated based on whether the proportion of participants that felt there was too much detail (responses '4' and '5') as opposed to too little detail (responses '1' and '2') was significantly different from 50%

§A significant number of respondents thought there was too much detail in this section of the Clinical Answer

†A significant number of respondents thought there was too little detail in this section of the Clinical Answer^of those who scored 1, 2, 4 or 5

Respondents were asked qualitative questions to determine what type of information they felt should be added to or removed from each section of the CA. Most comments related to four recurring themes in the 'Results' section: 1) there should be additional information about the population (location of trials, ages of participants) and intervention (dose and schedule); 2) the word 'significant' should be replaced with the magnitude of the effect; 3) information about heterogeneity should be provided; and 4) statistical terms should be spelled out in full prior to being abbreviated. With the exception of respondents wanting less detail in the search strategy, the qualitative comments overwhelmingly suggested that our CAs should be slightly more detailed. One respondent stated: "I find myself just wanting more information before I view something like this and make a potential change in the way I approach a given clinical situation". Four respondents also shared the opinion that adding "a short concluding remark on what the authors recommend. would be useful".

### Survey research [^1161zsXS]. Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Surveys provide evidence on practice, attitudes, and knowledge. However, conducting good survey research is harder than it looks. The authors aim to provide guidance to both researchers and readers in conducting and interpreting survey research. Like all research, surveys should have clear research question(s) using the smallest possible number of high-quality, essential, survey questions (items) that will interest the target population. Both researchers and readers should put themselves in the position of the respondents. The survey questions should provide reproducible results (reliable), measure what they are supposed to measure (valid), and take less than 10 min to answer. Good survey research reports provide results with valid and reliable answers to the research question with an adequate response rate (at least 40%) and adequate precision (margin of error ideally 5% or less). Possible biases among those who did not respond (nonresponders) must be carefully analyzed and discussed. Quantitative results can be combined with qualitative results in mixed-methods research to provide greater insight.

### Investigating suspected cancer clusters and responding to community concerns: guidelines from CDC and the council of state and territorial epidemiologists [^115XW2bo]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Step 1: Initial contact and response — purpose and key actions focus on intake, early evaluation, and education. The purpose of Step 1 is to collect information from the inquirer to determine whether the inquiry's concern warrants further follow-up, after which the health agency will need to decide whether to pursue the inquiry further, focusing on obtaining information the inquirer can provide as well as relevant data available to the health agency such as data from cancer registry, census, and environmental databases. The inquirer should be referred quickly to the responsible unit and the problem should not be dismissed prematurely, and although the majority of reports of potential clusters will be closed at the time of initial response because the inquirer's concerns are not consistent with a potential cancer cluster, the first encounter is often the health agency's best opportunity to educate about the nature of cancer and suspected cancer clusters. To be an effective initial responder, the health agency needs to understand the context of the inquirer's concern, the nature of the perceived problem, and the history of how it has or has not been reported to authorities.

### Performance of large language models on medical oncology examination questions [^112Q3aMN]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Large language models (LLMs) recently developed an unprecedented ability to answer questions. Studies of LLMs from other fields may not generalize to medical oncology, a high-stakes clinical setting requiring rapid integration of new information.

Objective

To evaluate the accuracy and safety of LLM answers on medical oncology examination questions.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study was conducted between May 28 and October 11, 2023. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Oncology Self-Assessment Series on ASCO Connection, the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Examination Trial questions, and an original set of board-style medical oncology multiple-choice questions were presented to 8 LLMs.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the percentage of correct answers. Medical oncologists evaluated the explanations provided by the best LLM for accuracy, classified the types of errors, and estimated the likelihood and extent of potential clinical harm.

Results

Proprietary LLM 2 correctly answered 125 of 147 questions (85.0%; 95% CI, 78.2%-90.4%; P < .001 vs random answering). Proprietary LLM 2 outperformed an earlier version, proprietary LLM 1, which correctly answered 89 of 147 questions (60.5%; 95% CI, 52.2%-68.5%; P < .001), and the best open-source LLM, Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1, which correctly answered 87 of 147 questions (59.2%; 95% CI, 50.0%-66.4%; P < .001). The explanations provided by proprietary LLM 2 contained no or minor errors for 138 of 147 questions (93.9%; 95% CI, 88.7%-97.2%). Incorrect responses were most commonly associated with errors in information retrieval, particularly with recent publications, followed by erroneous reasoning and reading comprehension. If acted upon in clinical practice, 18 of 22 incorrect answers (81.8%; 95% CI, 59.7%-94.8%) would have a medium or high likelihood of moderate to severe harm.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study of the performance of LLMs on medical oncology examination questions, the best LLM answered questions with remarkable performance, although errors raised safety concerns. These results demonstrated an opportunity to develop and evaluate LLMs to improve health care clinician experiences and patient care, considering the potential impact on capabilities and safety.

### Overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer: answers to five key questions [^116RCvRe]. Academic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Thyroid cancer fulfills the criteria for overdiagnosis by having a reservoir of indolent cancers and practice patterns leading to the diagnosis of incidental cancers from the reservoir. The occurrence of overdiagnosis is also supported by population-based data showing an alarming rise in thyroid cancer incidence without change in mortality. Because one of the activities leading to overdiagnosis is the workup of incidental thyroid nodules detected on imaging, it is critical that radiologists understand the issue of overdiagnosis and their role in the problem and solution. This article addresses 1) essential thyroid cancer facts, 2) the evidence supporting overdiagnosis, 3) the role of radiology in overdiagnosis, 4) harms of overdiagnosis, and 5) steps radiologists can take to minimize the problem.

### Exposure to common geographic COVID-19 prevalence maps and public knowledge, risk perceptions, and behavioral intentions [^113UYWtv]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Results

After excluding 2062 respondents who did not complete the survey, completed the survey in an unrealistically short time (ie, < 9 minutes), or indicated that they did not provide high-quality answers (ie, respondents who answered "I will not provide my best answers" or "I can't promise either way" to the question "Do you commit to thoughtfully provide your best answers to each question in this survey?"), our final sample included 2676 respondents (completion rate, 57%).

In the final sample, the mean (SD) age was 46 (17) years (range, 18–91 years); 1575 respondents (59%) were women, while 933 respondents (35%) were men, 28 respondents (1%) were transgender or another gender identity, and 140 respondents (5%) did not answer this question. A total of 1663 respondents (62%) were non-Hispanic White, 464 respondents (17%) were Hispanic, 315 respondents (12%) were non-Hispanic Black, 153 respondents (6%) were Asian or Asian American, 34 respondents (1%) were another race, and less than 1% of respondents were American Indian/Alaskan Native or Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander. Thirty-one respondents (1%) did not report their race/ethnicity. Education was heterogenous: 1022 respondents (38%) had a high school education or less, 1254 respondents (47%) had some college or a 2-year degree, and 400 respondents (15%) had a 4-year degree or higher.

### Exploring the potential of chatGPT as a supplementary tool for providing orthopaedic information [^114V4HQW]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Prompting and response collection

It is known that the method of prompting LLMs like ChatGPT can significantly impact on the quality of their responses; thus, a sub-field of study called 'Prompt Engineering' has been developed to provide advice on this craft. Therefore a prompt in line with these guidelines was created, to provide a proper setting for the model to answer the questions to the best of its abilities. Specifically, the model was asked to be an expert orthopaedic surgeon and to answer based on the latest research and best practices. Detailed instructions about the target group and what the model could expect them to know were included, as well as detailed guidelines on the expected form of response (Table 1). The length of responses was limited to avoid risks during assessments, e.g. that our assessors would not be able to locate the core answer in a long response. A shorter response would also induce the model to include more relevant information. However, for the target group of medical doctors, we allowed for a longer response (maximum 7 instead of 5 sentences), since it was anticipated that the use of more precise terms and concepts would lengthen responses. The two prompts used can be seen in Table 1; they share the same prefix and suffix but otherwise differ. As can be seen, the model in zero-shot mode was used, i.e. without providing examples of the type of questions we would pose and the answers we expected. This is a more challenging, but, arguably, also more realistic usage mode than the multiple-choice or few-shot setting of several other benchmarks.

Table 1
Table illustrating the two prompts used in this study

The order of the questions was randomized to negate any potential systemic effects of context and order on the answers given. The same random order was used for the two target groups. After the initial prompt and the response, the response was copied and then prompted again in the format 'My next question is "[QUESTION]"' until all questions of the sequence had been responded to.

After collecting all responses, an online questionnaire per target group was created, which listed the questions and responses to enable assessors to rate the correctness, completeness, and adaptiveness to the target group. Assessors were also permitted to add comments to explain their choices. Detailed instructions were provided that included examples of how to judge the different criteria. Each assessor was then provided with the instructions and links to their two questionnaires. The assessments of all four assessors were extracted and summarized.

### Analyzing the performance of chatGPT in answering inquiries about cervical cancer [^115srH8d]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

All questions were answered by the free version of ChatGPT twice on the same day (October 1, 2023), and a different computer was used for the second query. The answers given by ChatGPT were analyzed by two experienced gynecologists (EY and SO) and answers were scored according to the Global Quality Score (GQS). The GQS was developed to assess quality and usefulness of visual content about diseases. Also, GQS is appropriate and sufficient for the evaluation of the quality of written sources. The quality of content score is between 1 and 5 (worst to best), and a score of 5 indicates the best quality and reliability. If the scores given by the evaluators to the ChatGPT answers were different, the ChatGPT answer was reviewed by two evaluators, and the score was given by the joint decision of the two raters. When scoring the ChatGPT responses to scientific questions, CC guidelines from ESGO, ESTRO, and ESP were taken into consideration.

The repeatability of ChatGPT answers about CC was evaluated by asking each inquiry twice. If the ChatGPT response scored in the same category twice, the answer was considered positive in terms of reproducibility. If the two responses of ChatGPT to the same question scored at different levels, that was accepted as negative for ChatGPT repeatability. Due to the lack of patient data in the present study, informed consent and ethics committee approval were not obtained.

2.1 Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis for the present research was done with the SPSS version 27 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA). Normality analysis for the parameters used the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. GQS for the subheadings of the questions are shown as percentage. Moreover, mean scores from the GQS were compared between FAQs and guideline‐based questions with the independent Student t ‐test.

### Applying design-thinking principles to practice-based pharmacy research [^113LjxDF]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Design thinking is an approach to problem solving that focuses on a solution to a problem. This systematic approach can be applied to practice-based research or implementation projects in your practice setting. It may be useful for starting new projects as well as revisiting past projects that may not have yielded meaningful results. The design-thinking process begins with identifying a problem or knowledge gap and then the steps include: (1) understanding the problem, (2) observing the problem, (3) defining the problem, (4) brainstorming possible solutions, (5) prototyping the best solution, and (6) testing the solution.

### Accuracy of Medicare information provided by state health insurance assistance programs [^113R516B]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has limitations. First, mystery shopping encounters reflect the experience of a beneficiary who knows about and can reach SHIP services, knows Medicare terminology, and can communicate well in English. However, even in these scenarios, we encountered challenges in reaching SHIP counselors and obtaining complete information. Second, scoring relied on shoppers' ability to categorize a counselor's answer into the choice that best described the answer (eAppendix 3 in Supplement 1). Consequently, shoppers may have selected an answer that corresponded with the "accurate" designation even if the answer contained minor incorrect elements. As such, our results for the number of inaccurate answers are conservative. Similarly, evaluating accuracy and completeness relied on publicly available information about each selected plan and available clinicians, which itself is often flawed. Thus, an additional limitation is that the elements of an accurate and complete answer as defined by researchers may not equate to the elements that would adequately assist a beneficiary in selecting coverage that best meets their needs. For example, when posed with a question regarding a particular clinician's network participation, a counselor who directed a shopper to contact the plan would have received a score of "not substantive". However, in practice, this answer may be more helpful to the beneficiary than an "accurate and complete" answer that confirmed a clinician's network status. Additionally, because a SHIP site's address does not necessarily reflect where counselors provide services, we were precluded from comparing differences in accuracy across site characteristics. Further study of such differences may be helpful in directing resources more effectively. Despite these limitations, to our knowledge, this is the most in-depth assessment of the quality of information provided by SHIP sites to date.

It recommends empathetic adherence discussions including, 'In the last 4 weeks, how many days a week have you taken it?', and to confirm the diagnosis of asthma; if there is no evidence of variable airflow limitation, 'consider halving ICS dose and repeating lung function after 2–3 weeks' and 'Consider referring for challenge test'. For modifiable contributors, 'For adults/adolescents, switch to GINA Track 1, if available, to reduce exacerbations and simplify regimen', 'Check for risk factors or inducers such as smoking, beta-blockers or NSAIDs, or occupational or domestic allergen exposure… and address as possible', and 'Check for and manage comorbidities (e.g. rhinitis, obesity, GERD, obstructive sleep apnea, depression/anxiety)'. For therapy, 'Consider short-term (3–6 months) step-up to next treatment level or alternative option on present level', using shared decision-making. For persistent uncontrolled disease, 'If asthma still uncontrolled after 3–6 months on high dose ICS-LABA, or with ongoing risk factors, refer for expert advice', and 'Refer earlier than 6 months if asthma very severe or difficult to manage, or if doubts about diagnosis, or if occupational asthma is suspected'.

### A behavioural science framework for tackling upstream challenges in health systems [^116Yu8NZ]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Phase 1: distill the system-level challenge into priority behaviours

Behavioural science offers insights into what drives behaviour; to apply it to health system challenges, it is necessary first to distill those challenges into one or more priority behaviours. This can be done systematically in four steps:

Identify an outcome of interest

The outcome should typically be defined broadly–to decrease maternal mortality or to reduce inequity in service access, for example. The answer to the question 'how will I define success from this effort?' guides application of the framework to where a behavioural approach may be most impactful.

Describe changes within the system that create a pathway to achieve the outcome

In some instances where programme or policy goals are narrowly defined, this pathway may be apparent from the outset, for example, decreasing the frequency of stock-outs of a commodity, increasing resource allocation to a community health initiative or facilitating adoption of a high-impact practice. In other cases, a range of plausible pathways might be considered. When prioritising between pathways, it is important to consider both the significance of each pathway to the outcome of interest and to what extent it is (or might be) possible to intervene.

Identify the behaviours implicit in the pathway(s)

This means identifying who needs to act and what actions they must engage in to influence the outcome through the prioritised pathway(s). Often, several behaviours will contribute to each pathway, and one behaviour may be necessary or advantageous to encourage another. See figure 2 for an example.

Figure 2
Phase 1 of Framework.

Defining which actors must engage in which actions is critical to seeing a complex challenge through a behavioural lens. No matter how complex the issue or how structural or systemic it may seem, it can be distilled to one or more people who are making decisions and engaging in actions that together contribute to that reality. Defining these behaviours does not reduce the complexity of the problem but offers a way forward to systematically address that complexity.

Prioritise among behaviours

Often, it will not be practical to address all of the relevant behaviours. Prioritisation among behaviours should consider the potential for impact by influencing each behaviour as well as political will, resources, timeline and connections to other priority behaviours. This prioritisation does not indicate a judgement about which behaviours or actors are most important, but instead an assessment of where a careful investigation is likely to generate the greatest value for policy, programme or service changes.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114manjq]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Step 4 — Continue controller treatment and refer for expert assessment — when the Step 3 approach of doubling the initial dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) fails to achieve and maintain good asthma control, the guideline states to "carefully reassess inhaler technique and medication adherence", address environmental factors, and reconsider the diagnosis; as "the best treatment for this population has not been established", "options to consider, with specialist advice, are" to further increase the dose of ICS "for a few weeks", add leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) with counseling on neuropsychiatric adverse effects, add long-acting beta agonist (LABA) in combination with ICS based on data "in children ≥ 4 years of age", add "a low dose of oral corticosteroid (for a few weeks only)", or add "intermittent high-dose ICS at onset of respiratory illnesses" when exacerbations are the main problem, with monitoring for side-effects and re-evaluating the need for additional controller treatment at each visit.

### Testing and interpreting measures of ovarian reserve: a committee opinion [^111D6cft]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Ovarian reserve measures — committee opinion — define ovarian reserve as the number of oocytes remaining in the ovary (quantity of oocytes), and state that markers include hormone levels and parameters measured by ovarian ultrasound; these markers can be very useful as predictors of oocyte yield following controlled ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval, but they are poor predictors of reproductive potential independent of age.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for milk protein allergy, more specifically with respect to follow-up, BSACI 2014 guidelines recommend to consider reintroducing cow's milk graded according to the 'milk ladder' with less allergenic forms offered initially and more allergenic forms then eaten sequentially as tolerated. Consider reintroducing at home or supervised in the hospital.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113CD9Bg]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Making decisions about asthma treatment — Asthma treatment is adjusted in a continual cycle of assessment, treatment, and review of the patient's response in both symptom control and future risk (of exacerbations and side-effects), and of patient preferences. For population-level decisions about asthma medications, the 'preferred' regimens in Steps 1–4 represent the best treatments for most patients based on evidence about safety, efficacy and effectiveness, with emphasis on symptom burden and exacerbation risk, and for Steps 1–5 there are different preferred population-level recommendations for adults/adolescents, children 6–11 years, and children 5 years and younger, with Step 5 also differing by inflammatory phenotype (Type 2 or non-Type 2). For individual patients, shared decision-making about treatment should also consider characteristics, phenotype or environmental exposures that predict risk or response, together with the patient's goals or concerns and practical issues (inhaler technique, adherence, medication access and cost to the patient). Optimize asthma management, including inhaled therapy and non-pharmacologic strategies, to reduce the need for oral corticosteroids (OCS) and their multiple associated adverse effects.

### Guidance on community viral load: a family of measures, definitions, and method for calculation [^116hTmko]. CDC (2011). Medium credibility.

Community viral load sample size calculations — sample size to detect differences in geometric mean (GM) viral load depends on power and standard deviation (S). The table specifies "α = 0.05 and W = 0.8", with S columns 1 to 1.5; for k = 3 the minimum sample sizes by S are 54, 66, 78, 92, 106, and 122, and "1.2 is the standard deviation of national VL data", so at S = 1.2 the needed sample size is 78.

### Bayesian strategy selection identifies optimal solutions to complex problems using an example from GP prescribing [^116MojRA]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Another aspect to be mindful of is that Thompson sampling trades between the type-1 error rate and statistical power, implying that to achieve a greater statistical power (relative to a same sample-size equal allocation trial), it is likely to inflate the type-1 error rate. By not trying the null strategy sufficiently, the type-1 error rate may exceed the acceptable threshold. Thus it is judicious to monitor the type-1 error rate and if it exceeds the significance level, adjustments may be required in the allocation algorithm. Recent workis starting to explore adaptive sampling approaches that can control the type-1 error rate, and further work is required to develop such techniques for a Thompson sampling setting.

We did not assess intervention fidelity, that is, whether the intervention was delivered as conceived and in accordance with the materials and instructions provided to participants. Given that the aims were to measure the effectiveness of the strategies in supporting GP-patient interactions where physical activity was discussed, failure to implement the strategies in consultations was ultimately what was tested, in essence assessing the utility of each strategy.

This case study has demonstrated an efficient process providing clear results in a short period of time. Further work should develop methods to understand interactions and sequencing of various and multiple combinations of interventions. Subsequent lines of investigation should also begin to consider the question of fidelity. Given this study demonstrates a process for supporting conversations about PA between GPs and patients, an important next step is to examine the quality and content of those conversations and their impact on measured patient PA.

While the reasons for low incidence of GP patient interaction about PA are complex, these interactions occur in a relatively stable setting with a clear, well-defined outcomes. Further work on other complex problems in similarly well-defined domains, or further investigations of the GP-patient relationship in expanded settings (i.e. with greater numbers of prioritised actions, or broader participant groups) represent exciting directions for future work.

The new frontier of public health is not what behaviours need to change, but rather how to change them. This study shows how new methods can be used to test and optimise implementation of intervention in multiple settings by engaging key actors in a system and moving quickly to the best set of interventions. For PA specifically, data suggested more than 80% of adults visit their GP at least once per year. Rapid identification of appropriate strategies that increase the discussion of PA between GPs and their patients provides new potential avenues for the improvement of public health.

### Survey research in genetic counseling [^115AzAPS]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 2
Common questionnaire design mistakes.

Another important part of survey development is the consideration of the target audience. The target population should be able to easily access, read, and understand the purpose of the research, as well as the questions and responses. Jargon and technical terms should be avoided and survey questions kept brief, simple, and specific (Indian Health Service; Mittendorf; National Literacy Institute; Wang et al.).

The sequence of questions also should be considered. In general, researchers should group and introduce questions on a similar topic and order questions in a logical flow. The order of questions can influence subsequent responses and thus introduce bias. Placing questions that are most critical for answering the research question toward the beginning of the questionnaire is recommended as respondents may get tired and not respond as well, or at all, to questions toward the end. However, introducing sensitive questions at the beginning of a questionnaire may be considered too invasive and dissuade some individuals from responding at all. Thus, sensitive questions may be better placed in the middle or dispersed throughout the questionnaire. Demographic questions may raise fears about being identified (Bernard,) or concerns about how the data will be used (Aday & Cornelius,) and are often placed at the end of questionnaires. Most important though is that all questions included in a questionnaire be related to answering the research question. If an item does not help to answer the research question, then it likely should not be included.

The sequence of response options can also influence responses. The primacy effect refers to the tendency to choose from among the first response options presented, and the recency effect refers to the tendency to choose from among the later response options presented, regardless of content (Dillman et al.). Randomization of response order can help minimize response order effects, but can also affect the relationship between variables (Dillman et al; Taherdoost).
