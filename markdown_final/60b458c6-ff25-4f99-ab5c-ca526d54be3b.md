## Question

With a dose of 100 mcg/kg every 6 hours, a syrup with 2 mg per 5 mL of salbutamol suspension and a child has 10kg, how is she suposed to take it for the management of acute asthma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how a 10 kg child should take salbutamol (albuterol) syrup for acute asthma, given a dose of 100 mcg/kg every 6 hours and a suspension concentration of 2 mg per 5 ml. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether oral salbutamol syrup is appropriate for acute asthma at all. Then, I should verify the recommended first-line therapy for pediatric acute asthma and its dosing. Next, I will calculate what 100 mcg/kg every 6 hours would actually deliver to a 10 kg child and assess safety and efficacy. After that, I should review when to add systemic corticosteroids and other adjuncts. Finally, I will outline discharge planning and follow-up, and then synthesize a clear recommendation with rationale anchored to guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental issue: oral salbutamol syrup is not recommended for acute asthma management in any age group, and relying on it risks delayed recovery and undertreatment of airway inflammation, so I need to ensure we pivot to inhaled therapy immediately [^111WyHDu] [^117NU45v].

> Wait, let me verify the first-line therapy for pediatric acute asthma; guidelines consistently recommend inhaled short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) delivered by pMDI with spacer or by nebulizer, with pMDI plus spacer preferred for most children due to superior delivery efficiency and reduced infection transmission risk, and the initial dose is typically 2–6 puffs of salbutamol 100 mcg per puff repeated every 20 minutes for the first hour based on response, or 2.5 mg nebulized salbutamol every 20 minutes initially, with escalation if severe [^117NU45v] [^116mWAML] [^114wujcb].

> Hold on, I should verify the exact dosing for a 10 kg child; using pMDI with spacer, 2–6 puffs every 20 minutes for the first hour is appropriate, and if using a nebulizer, 2.5 mg salbutamol every 20 minutes initially is standard, with subsequent dosing titrated to clinical response rather than fixed 6-hour intervals, so a rigid q6h schedule is not aligned with acute care protocols [^116mWAML] [^117NU45v].

> I will now examine the proposed oral regimen; 100 mcg/kg every 6 hours equals 1 mg per dose for a 10 kg child, and given the syrup concentration of 2 mg per 5 mL, that is 2.5 mL per dose, but wait, I should double-check the pharmacokinetics and guideline stance before concluding anything about safety or efficacy, because even if the arithmetic is correct, oral salbutamol has slower onset, lower bioavailability, and is not recommended for acute bronchospasm compared with inhaled therapy, which acts within minutes and achieves higher local lung concentrations [^116J6Eiv] [^111K7GSj] [^111WyHDu].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the oral dose might be acceptable if inhaled therapy is unavailable, but let me reconsider; guidelines explicitly advise against oral bronchodilators for acute asthma because of inferior bronchodilation and delayed clinical effect, so the correct course is to secure inhaled SABA by pMDI/spacer or nebulizer rather than substituting with oral syrup, and to escalate care if inhaled therapy cannot be delivered [^111WyHDu] [^117NU45v] [^116mWAML].

> Next, I should review adjuncts; for moderate–severe exacerbations or poor response to initial SABA, add ipratropium bromide (1–2 puffs by pMDI with spacer or 250 mcg nebulized) and give systemic corticosteroids promptly, with prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg up to 40 mg/day for 3–5 days in children, or dexamethasone 0.3–0.6 mg/kg once daily for 1–2 days as an alternative with better adherence and less vomiting, and I need to ensure oxygen is used to maintain SpO2 94–98% if hypoxemic [^116mWAML] [^111EEe41] [^117DruRz].

> I should confirm escalation thresholds; if the child requires more than 10 puffs of inhaled SABA in 3–4 hours or shows signs of severe or life-threatening asthma (e.g. SpO2 < 92%, RR > 40/min, inability to speak or feed, silent chest), immediate transfer to higher acuity care is indicated, and while awaiting transfer, continue inhaled SABA, controlled oxygen, systemic corticosteroids, and consider nebulized ipratropium and IV magnesium sulfate in severe cases, reserving IV beta-agonists for refractory cases given limited evidence and adverse effect risk [^116mWAML] [^113NEWTr] [^1119mi5A] [^114wujcb].

> Let me think about discharge and follow-up; once stabilized, discharge on an as-needed SABA plan with clear return precautions is reasonable, and families should be educated that SABA use exceeding every 3–4 hours or persistent symptoms warrant urgent review; arrange follow-up within 1–2 days for children and ensure initiation or optimization of ICS-containing controller therapy to reduce future risk, as SABA-only approaches are unsafe long term [^1156B71r] [^112pZroe] [^114UsfUs] [^113NEWTr].

> But wait, what if the child truly cannot use inhaled therapy; in that rare scenario, I should confirm that oral therapy is a last-resort bridge while arranging urgent transfer, and I would monitor closely for deterioration, recognizing that this is off-guideline and suboptimal, and I should document the rationale and expedite inhaled delivery as soon as possible [^notfound].

> In summary, I need to ensure the recommendation is explicit: do not use salbutamol syrup 100 mcg/kg every 6 hours for acute asthma in a 10 kg child; instead, treat with inhaled SABA by pMDI with spacer or nebulizer using 2–6 puffs or 2.5 mg every 20 minutes initially, add ipratropium and systemic corticosteroids if moderate–severe or if response is inadequate, monitor closely, and escalate care per severity and response, with discharge planning that prioritizes ICS-containing controller therapy and timely follow-up [^111WyHDu] [^117NU45v] [^116mWAML] [^111EEe41] [^114UsfUs].

The ordered dose of **100 mcg/kg every 6 hours** for a 10 kg child equals **1 mg per dose**, which is **2.5 mL of the 2 mg/5 mL syrup**. This regimen is **not standard for acute asthma** because inhaled salbutamol is preferred for rapid bronchodilation [^117NU45v] and oral therapy is reserved for mild symptoms or when inhalation is not feasible. If used, give 2.5 mL every 6 hours, monitor for tremor, tachycardia, and hypokalemia, and **seek urgent care if symptoms worsen or no improvement occurs within 2–4 hours** [^notfound].

---

## Calculation of the dose

- **Ordered dose**: 100 mcg/kg every 6 hours
- **Child's weight**: 10 kg
- **Total dose per administration**: 100 mcg/kg × 10 kg = 1,000 mcg = 1 mg
- **Syrup concentration**: 2 mg per 5 mL
- **Volume per dose**: (1 mg ÷ 2 mg) × 5 mL = 2.5 mL

Therefore, the child should receive **2.5 mL of the salbutamol syrup every 6 hours**.

---

## Clinical appropriateness of oral salbutamol for acute asthma

Oral salbutamol is **not the preferred initial therapy** for acute asthma exacerbations because of its slower onset of action and lower bioavailability compared to inhaled formulations [^111WyHDu]. Inhaled salbutamol (via metered-dose inhaler with spacer or nebulizer) is the **first-line treatment** for acute asthma exacerbations due to its rapid onset and direct delivery to the airways [^117NU45v].

---

## Recommended dosing guidelines

According to the FDA labeling for albuterol sulfate syrup, the **recommended pediatric dose** for children aged 2 to 6 years is 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg per dose, given three to four times daily [^116J6Eiv]. The ordered dose of 100 mcg/kg (0.1 mg/kg) every 6 hours falls within this range, but the frequency (every 6 hours) is at the upper limit of the recommended dosing interval.

---

## Potential risks and side effects

Oral salbutamol can cause **side effects**, particularly with repeated dosing or in overdose scenarios:

- **Tremor**: Common with beta-agonist therapy.
- **Tachycardia**: Increased heart rate is a common adverse effect.
- **Hypokalemia**: Potassium shifts can occur, particularly with high doses.
- **Paradoxical bronchospasm**: Rare but possible, requiring immediate discontinuation of therapy [^116J6Eiv].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

If oral salbutamol is used, the child should be closely monitored for:

- **Improvement in respiratory symptoms**: Wheezing, cough, and respiratory distress.
- **Adverse effects**: Tremor, tachycardia, and signs of hypokalemia.
- **Need for escalation**: If symptoms worsen or do not improve within 2–4 hours, seek urgent medical attention [^116md4wy].

---

## Alternative and preferred treatments

Inhaled salbutamol remains the **preferred treatment** for acute asthma exacerbations. If inhalation is not feasible, consider nebulized salbutamol or alternative bronchodilators. Systemic corticosteroids may be indicated for moderate to severe exacerbations to reduce inflammation and prevent relapse [^1117x8e1].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The calculated dose of **2.5 mL every 6 hours** is correct for a 10 kg child receiving 100 mcg/kg of salbutamol syrup. However, oral salbutamol is not the preferred initial therapy for acute asthma exacerbations. If used, monitor closely for side effects and seek medical attention if symptoms worsen or fail to improve within 2–4 hours. Inhaled salbutamol remains the **preferred treatment** for acute asthma exacerbations.

Intravenous salbutamol is commonly used to treat children with severe asthma unresponsive to inhaled β2-agonist therapy. However, in this setting, there is little clinical trial data demonstrating its effectiveness. Additionally, there are significant concerns that intravenous salbutamol-dosing recommendations for children with acute asthma are excessive, and unnecessarily raise the potential for adverse reactions, such as lactic acidosis and tachycardia which, by increasing respiratory workload, exacerbate respiratory failure. Here, we review salbutamol clinical pharmacology and toxicology, evidence relating to its use in acute asthma and highlight gaps in the evidence base.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113NEWTr]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Assessment of response and additional bronchodilator treatment — severe exacerbation in children: Children with a severe asthma exacerbation must be observed for at least 1 hour after initiation of treatment; if symptoms persist after initial bronchodilator, a further 2–6 puffs of salbutamol may be given 20 minutes after the first dose and repeated at 20-minute intervals for an hour, consider adding 1–2 puffs of ipratropium, and failure to respond at 1 hour or earlier deterioration should prompt admission to hospital with addition of nebulized ipratropium and a short course of oral corticosteroids. If symptoms have improved by 1 hour but recur within 3–4 hours, the child may be given more frequent doses of bronchodilator (2–3 puffs each hour) and oral corticosteroids should be given, and children who fail to respond to 10 puffs of inhaled SABA within a 3–4 hour period should be referred immediately to hospital. If symptoms resolve rapidly after initial bronchodilator and do not recur for 1–2 hours, no further treatment may be required; further SABA may be given as needed up to every 3–4 hours (up to a total of 10 puffs/24 hours), and if symptoms persist beyond 1 day, inhaled and/or oral corticosteroids are indicated.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1156B71r]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Initial home management of asthma exacerbations — an action plan should enable the child's family members and carers to recognize worsening asthma and initiate treatment, recognize when it is severe, identify when urgent hospital treatment is necessary, and provide recommendations for follow up (Evidence D), and should include specific information about medications and dosages and when and how to access medical care. Parents/caregivers should be advised to seek medical attention immediately if the child is acutely distressed, the child's symptoms are not relieved promptly by inhaled bronchodilator, the period of relief after doses of SABA becomes progressively shorter, or a child younger than 1 year requires repeated inhaled SABA over several hours. For initial treatment at home, the parent/caregiver should initiate treatment with two puffs of inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) (200 mcg salbutamol [albuterol] or equivalent), given one puff at a time via a spacer device with or without a facemask (Evidence D). This may be repeated a further two times at 20-minute intervals, if needed, and the child should be observed by the family/carer and, if improving, maintained in a restful and reassuring atmosphere for an hour or more. Medical attention should be sought urgently if any of the features listed above apply; or on the same day if more than 6 puffs of inhaled SABA are required for symptom relief within the first 2 hours, or if the child has not recovered after 24 hours.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^117NU45v]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Emergency treatment and initial pharmacotherapy — inhaled bronchodilator therapy states the initial dose of inhaled short-acting beta agonist (SABA) may be given by a pMDI with spacer and mask or mouthpiece or an air-driven nebulizer, or, if oxygen saturation is low, by an oxygen-driven nebulizer. For most children, pMDI plus spacer is favored as it is more efficient than a nebulizer for bronchodilator delivery (Evidence A), and nebulizers can spread infectious particles. The initial dose is two puffs of salbutamol (100 mcg per puff) or equivalent, except in acute, severe asthma when six puffs should be given; when a nebulizer is used, a dose of 2.5 mg salbutamol solution is recommended, with dosing frequency based on response observed over 1–2 hours. For children with moderate-severe exacerbations and a poor response to initial SABA, nebulized ipratropium bromide may be added every 20 minutes for 1 hour only.

### Parent initiated prednisolone for acute asthma in children of school age: randomised controlled crossover trial [^115CyE3w]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Episodes of acute asthma were defined by the following advice given to parents: "If from previous experience you suspect this is a more severe attack, or if the symptoms are not getting better in about 6 to 8 hours with regular use of reliever medication, give your child the study medication immediately". Parents were instructed to continue to administer the study medication for three to five days depending on the persistence or resolution of their child's asthma symptoms. To ensure an adequate washout period and that the episodes were discrete, parents were instructed not to commence a course of study medicine until a minimum of 14 days after starting the previous treatment and seven days after stopping a previous course of study medication or oral corticosteroids. Parents were instructed not to increase the dose of inhaled corticosteroid (if applicable) during an exacerbation.

During the enrolment process, a personalised asthma management plan was developed for each participant in accordance with the local asthma management guidelines. We sought to ensure that the use or non-use of any additional asthma preventive medications was appropriate, that an appropriate drug delivery device was being used effectively, that there was a sound understanding of dosing (including the fact that for children older than 6 years it was appropriate to deliver up to 12 actuations (1200 μg) of salbutamol at a time), and that the families understood the criteria for seeking a medical review. Parents were instructed to seek a medical review: (1) if their child had a bad attack or they were worried; (2) if their child needed salbutamol more than every 3 hours; (3) if their child was getting little or no relief from salbutamol; or (4) if wheezing lasted more than 24 hours and was not getting better.

Box 12–4 — Initial emergency department management of asthma exacerbations in children 5 years and younger outlines immediate therapies and dosing. Supplemental oxygen is delivered by face nasal prongs or mask to maintain oxygen saturation at 94–98%. Short-acting beta agonist (SABA) dosing is 2–6 puffs of salbutamol by spacer, or 2.5 mg by nebulizer, every 20 minutes for the first hour, then severity is reassessed; if symptoms persist or recur, give an additional 2–3 puffs per hour and admit to hospital if > 10 puffs are required in 3–4 hours. Systemic corticosteroids include an initial oral prednisolone dose of 1–2 mg/kg up to a maximum 20 mg for children < 2 years old or 30 mg for children 2–5 years, or intravenous methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg 6-hourly on day 1. Additional options in the first hour are to consider adding ipratropium bromide (1–2 puffs by pMDI and spacer; if poor response to initial SABA, nebulized ipratropium bromide 250 mcg every 20 minutes for 1 hour only) and to consider nebulized isotonic magnesium sulfate (150 mg) as 3 doses in the first hour for children aged ≥ 2 years with severe exacerbation. If inhalation is not possible, an intravenous bolus of terbutaline 2 mcg/kg may be given over 5 minutes, followed by continuous infusion of 5 mcg/kg/hour.

### Hospital discharge using salbutamol as required after acute attacks of wheeze in children: a service evaluation [^111q8fBp]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

While paediatric care plans for acute wheeze advise treating worsening symptoms with salbutamol every 4 hours as needed, discharge care plans typically advise reducing doses of bronchodilator according to predetermined, fixed dose regimes. There is no clear discharge advice for salbutamol use in national guidelines, but advice that patients can be discharged when stable on regular 3–4 hourly bronchodilators has resulted in many hospitals recommending continued use of regular bronchodilators after leaving hospital. There is no evidence to support this practice. We have recently changed our local care pathways and assessed the safety and efficacy of introducing written information to aid parents' decision-making about the use of salbutamol as needed in children aged 1 to < 18 years.

### Optimising intravenous salbutamol in children: a phase 2 study [^113E3jgt]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The β2-agonists such as salbutamol are the mainstay of asthma management. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models to guide paediatric dosing are lacking. We explored the relationship between salbutamol dose, serum concentration, effectiveness and adverse effects in children by developing a PKPD model.

Design

A prospective cohort study of children admitted to hospital with acute asthma, who received intravenous salbutamol.

Setting

Children were recruited in two cohorts: the emergency departments of two London hospitals or those retrieved by the Children's Acute Transport Service to three London paediatric intensive care units.

Patients

Patients were eligible if aged 1–15 years, admitted for acute asthma and about to receive or receiving intravenous salbutamol.

Interventions

Treatment was according to local policy. Serial salbutamol plasma levels were taken. Effectiveness measurements were recorded using the Paediatric Asthma Severity Score (PASS). Toxicity measurements included lactate, pH, glucose, heart rate, blood pressure and arrhythmias. PKPD modelling was performed with non-linear mixed-effect models.

Main Outcomes

Fifty-eight children were recruited with 221 salbutamol concentration measurements from 54 children. Median (range) age was 2.9 (1.1–15.2) years, and weight was 13.6 (8–57.3) kg. Ninety-five PASS measurements and 2078 toxicity measurements were obtained.

Results

A two-compartment PK model adequately described the time course of salbutamol-plasma concentrations. An E MAX (maximum drug effect) concentration-effect relationship described PASS and toxicity measures. PKPD simulations showed an infusion of 0.5µg/kg/min (maximum 20µg/min) for 4hours after bolus achieves > 90% maximal bronchodilation for 12 hours.

Conclusions

A paediatric PKPD model for salbutamol is described. An infusion of 0.5µg/kg/min after bolus achieves effective bronchodilation. Higher rates are associated with greater tachycardia and hyperglycaemia.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112UBrmS]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Combination inhaled corticosteroid–formoterol (ICS-formoterol) in acute asthma — use limits and emergency department (ED) evidence: Up to a maximum total of 12 inhalations of budesonide-formoterol 200/6 mcg (160/4.5 mcg delivered dose) can be taken in a single day if needed, and GINA suggests that the same maximum total use in a single day should apply to beclometasone-formoterol. In an ED randomized controlled trial in adults and adolescents with average forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) 42–45% predicted, two doses of budesonide-formoterol 400/12 mcg (delivered dose 320/9 mcg) were compared with eight doses of salbutamol (albuterol) 100 mcg (delivered dose 90 mcg), with doses repeated after 5 minutes and all patients receiving oral corticosteroids; lung function was similar over 3 hours, but pulse rate was higher in the SABA group. A meta-analysis found formoterol's efficacy and safety similar to salbutamol for acute asthma; formoterol is no longer used for this purpose, there is no evidence that budesonide-formoterol would be less effective, more studies are needed, and there are no published data on combination ICS-SABA in an emergency department setting.

### Intravenous salbutamol for children with severe acute asthma on a Dutch pediatric ward: an effective and child-friendly alternative [^113TAaA2]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Administration of intravenous (IV) salbutamol is a widely used intervention for managing severe acute asthma (SAA) in children, although evidence is limited. Traditionally, IV salbutamol is an indication for admission to a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), however, recent Dutch guidelines allow this treatment to be initiated on a medium care pediatric ward. This study evaluated the efficacy of IV salbutamol treatment for children with SAA on two pediatric wards in the Netherlands.

Methods

In this retrospective multicenter cohort study, we included children with SAA who have been treated with IV salbutamol between June 2021 and December 2023. The primary outcome was the number of children successfully treated with IV salbutamol without being transferred to a PICU. Secondary outcomes included severity of side effects and complications.

Results

A total of 103 patients with 112 severe asthma exacerbations were included. Among these children, 46% were successfully treated on the pediatric ward. The remainder were transferred to a PICU, primarily due to exceeding the maximum allowed dose by protocol (1.0–1.5mcg/kg/min) without an adequate response. Adverse events (e.g. hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, lactic acidosis, and hypotension) were observed in 61% of the children. Three serious adverse events were observed, no children were intubated nor were there any deaths.

Conclusion

Children with SAA can be treated effectively with IV salbutamol on a Dutch pediatric ward with medium care facilities, since 46% of the children did not require a transfer to the PICU.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1135kseN]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids during exacerbation — dosing and effects in children: For children not previously on ICS, an initial dose of ICS twice the low daily dose may be given and continued for a few weeks or months; some studies have used high-dose ICS (1600 mcg/day, preferably divided into four doses over the day and given for 5–10 days) as this may reduce the need for OCS, but addition of ICS to standard care (including OCS) does not reduce risk of hospitalization while reducing length of stay and acute asthma scores in children in the emergency department, and the potential for side-effects with high-dose ICS should be considered with close monitoring. For those children already on ICS, doubling the dose was not effective in a small study of mild-moderate exacerbations in children aged 6–14 years, nor was quintupling the dose in children aged 5–11 years with good adherence; this approach should be reserved mainly for individual cases and should always involve regular follow-up and monitoring of adverse effects.

Immediate transfer to hospital — children ≤ 5 years with asthma is indicated when any of the following are present: at assessment, child unable to speak or drink, cyanosis, "Respiratory rate > 40 per minute", "Oxygen saturation < 92% when breathing room air", or silent chest on auscultation; lack of response to initial bronchodilator treatment including "Lack of response to 6 puffs of inhaled salbutamol [albuterol] (2 separate puffs, repeated 3 times) over 1–2 hours" or "Persisting tachypnea* despite three administrations of inhaled SABA, even if the child shows other clinical signs of improvement"; or a "Social environment that limits delivery of acute treatment, or parent/caregiver unable to manage acute asthma at home". Additionally, "Children with features of a severe exacerbation that fail to resolve within 1–2 hours despite repeated dosing with inhaled SABA must be referred to hospital", other indications include "recurrence of signs of a severe exacerbation within 48 hours", and early attention should be sought for those "aged less than 2 years". During transfer, continue care with "inhaled SABA, oxygen (if available) to maintain saturation 94–98%, and give systemic corticosteroids".

Managing Exacerbations in Children 5 Years and Younger

Early symptoms of exacerbations in young children may include increased symptoms, increased coughing (especially at night), lethargy or reduced exercise tolerance, impaired daily activities including feeding, and a poor response to reliever medication.

Managing Exacerbations at Home

Give a written asthma action plan to parents/caregivers of young children with asthma so they can recognize an impending exacerbation, start treatment, and identify when urgent hospital treatment is required. Initial treatment at home is with inhaled SABA, with review after 1 hour or earlier. If inhaled SABA is needed more often than every 3 hours or for > 24 hours, treatment by a health provider is needed on the same day. Parents/caregivers should seek urgent medical care if the child is acutely distressed, lethargic, fails to respond to initial bronchodilator therapy, or is worsening, especially in children younger than 1 year.

Rationale

Most children with wheezing due to asthma respond to SABA. There is insufficient evidence for parent-initiated OCS in this age group. Preemptive, episodic, parent-initiated high-dose nebulized ICS may reduce exacerbations in children with intermittent virally triggered wheezing, but there are no long-term studies, and there is a high risk of side effects; it should only be considered if the clinician is confident that it will be used appropriately and that the child will be monitored closely for side effects.

Managing Exacerbations in Primary Care or Acute Care Facility

Assess the severity of the exacerbation while initiating treatment with SABA (2–6 puffs every 20 min for first hour) and controlled oxygen to maintain a saturation of 94–98%. Arrange immediate transfer to a hospital if the child shows no response to inhaled SABA within 1–2 hours, is unable to speak or drink, has a respiratory rate > 40/min or is cyanosed, has oxygen saturation < 92% on room air, or cannot be safely cared for at home.

For children attending an ED or admitted to hospital with asthma, consider systemic corticosteroids: oral prednisone/prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/d for up to 5 days (maximum of 20 mg/d for children 0–2 years and 30 mg/d for children 3–5 yr) or dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg/d for 2 days.

Asthma action plan — Inhaled combination ICS-SABA reliever: For adults prescribed as-needed combination ICS-SABA reliever with maintenance ICS-containing therapy, the recommended dose is 2 inhalations of budesonide-salbutamol [albuterol] 100/100 mcg metered dose (80/90 mcg delivered dose) as needed, a maximum of 6 times in a day. Overall, in patients on Step 3−5 therapy, this reduced the risk of severe exacerbations by 26% compared with using a SABA reliever, with the greatest benefit seen in patients taking maintenance low-dose ICS-LABA or medium-dose ICS. There is only one study to date about use of as-needed combination ICS-SABA alone, i.e., without maintenance ICS or ICS-LABA. If the patient is rapidly worsening, or needs repeated doses of as-needed ICS-SABA reliever over 1–2 days, they should contact their healthcare provider or seek medical assistance.

In conclusion, our study contributes to the understanding of inpatient pediatric asthma management by providing evidence that lower starting doses of continuous albuterol may be equally effective as higher doses in managing severe acute asthma exacerbations in children. By addressing concerns regarding variability in dosing practices and potential adverse effects, we have advanced knowledge in the field and paved the way for safer care as well as better resource management.

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous salbutamol and nebulized ipratropium bromide in early management of severe acute asthma in children presenting to an emergency department [^1152C19Y]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

In acute severe asthma, treatment must be initiated early to reverse the pathophysiology that may render airways less responsive to bronchodilation. The addition of nebulized ipratropium bromide to initial emergency department therapy improves pulmonary function, but it is unclear whether this approach results in earlier hospital discharge. The early use of bolus intravenous salbutamol has also been shown to improve outcome, including earlier discharge. We therefore assessed the relative benefits of intravenous salbutamol and nebulized ipratropium bromide in the early management of acute severe asthma in children by a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial.

Methods

This study was undertaken at a tertiary children's hospital, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, The Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, Westmead, Sydney, Australia. Only children with severe acute asthma as determined by the National Asthma Campaign guidelines criteria and pulmonary index were included. All children received initial nebulized salbutamol therapy (2.5–5 mg salbutamol in 4 mL of normal saline depending on age) at initial emergency department presentation. If asthma remained severe 20 mins later, an intravenous cannula was inserted and intravenous methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg) was administered to all children receiving nebulized salbutamol every 20 mins. Children were then randomized to one of three groups: intravenous salbutamol (15 microg/kg as a single bolus over 10 mins), ipratropium bromide (250 microg), or intravenous salbutamol plus ipratropium bromide. All observers were blinded to treatment groups. Children were randomly assigned to receive a single-dose intravenous bolus of either saline or salbutamol and either nebulized saline or ipratropium bromide determined by a number generated randomly in the hospital pharmacy. The primary outcomes were recovery time and discharge time of each group. Respiratory and hemodynamic monitoring were continuous during the first 2 hrs of the study and then children were monitored clinically for 24 hrs.

Results

A total of 55 children with acute severe asthma were entered into the study over an 18-month period. The three groups were similar demographically, with a mean age of 5.9 yrs, and mean duration of attack of 19.6 hrs. No side effects or treatment intolerance were reported. Children in the groups that received intravenous salbutamol had a significant reduction in recovery time to achieving second hourly inhaled salbutamol (p = .008) compared with those administered inhaled bronchodilator alone. The addition of ipratropium bromide to intravenous salbutamol provided no significant further benefit in terms of nebulizer therapy (intravenous salbutamol compared with intravenous salbutamol plus ipratropium bromide). Children administered intravenous salbutamol ceased supplemental oxygen therapy earlier than those administered ipratropium alone at 12 hrs post-randomization (p = .0003). Children administered intravenous salbutamol could be discharged from the hospital 28 hrs earlier than those administered ipratropium bromide (p = .013).

Conclusion

Children administered intravenous salbutamol for severe acute asthma showed a more rapid recovery time, which resulted in earlier discharge from the hospital than those administered inhaled ipratropium bromide. There was no additional benefit obtained by combining ipratropium bromide and intravenous salbutamol administration.

### Selecting a systemic corticosteroid for acute asthma in young children [^115PDbnY]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Oral corticosteroids are as effective as intravenous therapy for treating acute exacerbations of asthma. They are available in tablets that can be crushed and mixed with soft food or syrup, and in a variety of liquid formulations that differ in volume required, palatability, patient acceptance, and cost. The most important consideration in product selection for a young child is that the doses can be easily swallowed and retained.

### Management of acute loss of asthma control in the yellow zone: a practice parameter [^114CMXVr]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Yellow zone asthma — short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) dosing: Summary Statement 5 advises patients to use inhaled SABA for reliever use in the yellow zone at a dose of 2 to 4 puffs through a metered dose inhaler or nebulizer treatment every 4 to 6 hours in addition to their escalated yellow zone treatment, and adds that if use exceeds 12 puffs per day, advise patients to contact their provider for further guidance (Recommendation: C Evidence). The 2007 NHLBI guidelines recommend 2 to 6 puffs of SABA through a metered dose inhaler or nebulizer treatments be given every 3 to 4 hours for 24 to 48 hours for home exacerbations of asthma. A population pharmacodynamic model demonstrated that 2 to 4 inhalations of albuterol can increase the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) by 15% in moderate to severe disease. In a randomized, double-blind, controlled study in an ED setting, different doses and delivery devices were compared (2 puffs, 6–10 puffs, and 0.15 mg of nebulized albuterol) in children 5 to 17 years of age, with no significant differences among the 3 groups in measured outcomes; there was a slight increase in adverse events (heart rate) in the group receiving nebulized treatment, and the results suggested that 2 puffs of albuterol through a metered dose inhaler supervised by trained medical personnel provided similar benefit to 6 puffs through a metered dose inhaler or nebulizer.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^117DruRz]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Emergency treatment and initial pharmacotherapy — oxygen directs clinicians to treat hypoxemia urgently with oxygen by face mask to achieve and maintain percutaneous oxygen saturation 94–98% (Evidence A). The text notes the potential for overestimation of oxygen saturation in people with dark skin color. To avoid hypoxemia during changes in treatment, acutely distressed children should be treated immediately with oxygen and SABA, using 2.5 mg of salbutamol or equivalent diluted in 3 mL of sterile normal saline delivered by an oxygen-driven nebulizer, and this treatment should not be delayed and may be given before full assessment is completed; transient hypoxemia due to ventilation/perfusion mismatch may occur during treatment with SABAs.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114UsfUs]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Medications and strategies for adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years — For safety, GINA does not recommend treating asthma with short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) alone and states patients should receive inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment; ICS may be given as regular daily treatment or, in adults and adolescents with less-than-daily symptoms and normal or mildly reduced lung function, as as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol for symptom relief, and for children not likely to be adherent with maintenance ICS the ICS can be taken whenever the child uses their SABA reliever; reduction in severe exacerbations is a high priority to lessen patient and health-system burden and the need for oral corticosteroids (OCS); tables of low, medium or high dose ICS do not represent equivalent potency and if a patient is switched between medications, they should be monitored for stability.

### Once or consecutive administration of inhaled salbutamol in children with acute asthma exacerbation: is an additional dose beneficial? [^117Njx4L]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Although international guidelines generally recommend the back to back use of short-acting β-agonists (SABA) within a short time in the management of acute wheezing in children with asthma, there is still uncertainty in the evidence of short term outcome. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the efficacy of back to back and single use of inhaled SABA by lung function testing.

Methods

This was a prospective, double-blinded, placebo controlled study conducted in children ≥ 6 years of age with a history of asthma. Children who presented with an acute asthma exacerbation (AAE) with a forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV 1) between 40% to 60% were enrolled in the study if they had a first dose to SABA response of FEV 1 ≥ 12%. All children were then randomly assigned either to receive two additional doses of inhaled SABA (300µg per dose) or placebo. Spirometric analysis included forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV 1, FEV 1 /FVC, PEF, and FEF 25–75 at baseline, 15, 30, and 45min for each group. Oxygen saturation and heart rate were monitored during the study period.

Results

A total of 93 patients (inhaled SABA group; n = 48 vs. placebo group; n = 45) out of 110 enrolled patients completed the study. Baseline demographic characteristics of patients include age, gender, age of diagnosis, parental asthma, history of allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis, current asthma treatment, IgE and skin prick test were similar among groups. (p > .05) When lung function parameters were compared at each time interval during the study period, there were no statistical significance found in FVC, FEV 1, FEV 1 /FVC, PEF and forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% (FEF 25–75) among groups. (p > .05) There were also no differences between groups for changes in heart rate and oxygen saturation. (p > .05) CONCLUSION: A single dose of inhaled SABA provides similar short term bronchodilator effect as back to back administration of inhaled SABA in children with AAE who showed an initial response to SABA of FEV 1 ≥ 12%.

### Single-dose intravenous salbutamol bolus for managing children with acute severe asthma in the emergency department: reanalysis of data [^1164J6WQ]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE: To reanalyze data from two previous studies to provide stronger evidence of benefit for early use of single-dose intravenous bolus salbutamol in children with acute severe exacerbations of asthma. Methods: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 84 children with acute severe asthma who presented to the emergency department of the Children's Hospital at Westmead. After clinical evaluation, patients who had severe asthma were given high-dose inhaled salbutamol and had an intravenous cannula inserted. Additional treatment consisted of intravenous methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg), oxygen (6 L/min via mask if Sao(2) was < 93%). Patients were then randomized to receive an intravenous infusion of either 15 &mgr; g/kg salbutamol or saline, with clinical progress assessed hourly for 2 hrs. All patients were admitted to the hospital and clinically monitored for the proceeding 2–24 hrs, with inhaled salbutamol treatment administered in accord with the hospital's protocol. RESULTS: The intravenous salbutamol group (n = 50) demonstrated earlier clinical improvement, with earlier reduction in oxygen therapy and reduced need for ongoing inhaled salbutamol therapy by the end of phase 1 compared with the control group (n = 34). Patients in the intravenous salbutamol group were ready for discharge from the emergency department 3.7 hrs earlier than those in the control group and were ready for discharge from the hospital 9.7 hrs earlier than controls. No significant side effects were found in either group. CONCLUSION: A single-dose intravenous salbutamol bolus of 15 &mgr; g/kg administered over 10 mins in the initial treatment of children with acute severe asthma in the emergency department has the potential to shorten the duration of severe attacks and reduce overall requirements for inhaled salbutamol maintenance.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1164RQb6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Management of worsening asthma and exacerbations — adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years — terminology and written asthma action plans emphasize that exacerbations represent an acute or sub-acute worsening in symptoms and lung function, and that the term 'flare-up' is preferable for most patients; patients at increased risk of asthma-related death should be identified and flagged for more frequent review. All patients should be provided with a written asthma action plan appropriate for their age, current treatment, and reliever inhaler (short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) or inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-formoterol), with the plan stating when and how to change reliever and/or maintenance medications, use oral corticosteroids if needed, and access medical care if symptoms fail to respond; advise patients with a history of rapid deterioration to seek acute care or see their doctor immediately, and base the plan on changes in symptoms or (only in adults) peak expiratory flow (PEF).

### Inhalers or nebulisation of salbutamol in childhood asthma exacerbations in emergency departments [^112pasuk]. Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Asthma exacerbations often lead to paediatric emergency department (PED) visits, but evidence for paediatric management remains limited, and recommendations under discussion. This study compared salbutamol delivered via nebulisation and pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDI) with a holding chamber in children with mild to severe asthma exacerbations.

Methods

A two-centre study was conducted during eight months, comparing hospitalisation rates, clinical improvement, side effects, and PED visit length in the overall population and in children under and over 6 years old.

Results

A total of 384 patients were included, primarily with mild and moderate exacerbations of similar severity between groups. The discharge rate was comparable between groups in the overall population (82.7% without any nebulisation in the pMDI group versus 81.6%, p = 0.93), but higher for children under 6 years old treated with pMDI (98.1% versus 76.9%, p < 0.001). The pMDI group exhibited significantly lower hospitalisation rates (p < 0.001) and shorter PED visits (1.7 [1.2–2.6] hours versus 4.0 [2.6–5.3] hours, p < 0.001) while receiving lower salbutamol doses (0.10 [0.05–0.16] mg/kg versus 0.81 [0.55–1.18] mg/kg, p < 0.001) with less ipratropium and oral corticosteroids (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). The pMDI group demonstrated fewer side effects, particularly oxygen dependence, especially in children under 6 (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

The study suggests that salbutamol via pMDI with a holding chamber is as effective as nebulisation for treating mild to moderate childhood asthma exacerbations. This approach results in fewer hospitalisations, reduced side effects, and shorter PED visits. Educating patients on pMDI use and efficacy could further decrease emergency visits for asthma exacerbation.

Start OCS early after presentation. For adults, give prednisolone 40–50 mg/d (or equivalent) for 5–7 days. For children, give prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg (maximum, 40 mg) for 3–5 days. Tapering is not needed if administered for < 2 weeks.

Review response of symptoms, vital signs, oxygen saturation and lung function after 1 hour (or earlier if worsening). Give ipratropium bromide only for severe exacerbations. Consider intravenous magnesium sulfate for patients with severe exacerbations not responding to initial treatment.

Do not routinely request chest radiography or routinely prescribe antibiotics for asthma exacerbations.

The decision on whether to hospitalize should be based on the patient's clinical status, lung function, response to treatment, recent and past history of exacerbations, social support, and ability to manage at home.

Rationale

Currently, inhaled albuterol is the usual bronchodilator in acute asthma management. Similar efficacy and safety of formoterol in the ED have been reported. In one study, high-dose budesonide–formoterol had similar efficacy and safety to SABA in ED patients.

Discharge Management

Before the patient goes home, arrange ongoing treatment. This should include starting ICS-containing controller treatment, preferably ICS–formoterol as MART (Table 1; Table E2 andin the online supplement) to reduce the risk of another exacerbation, or stepping up the dose of existing maintenance treatment for 2–4 weeks. Advise patients to use reliever medication as needed, not regularly. Patients prescribed ICS–formoterol as their reliever should return to this after an ED presentation.

Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)–containing treatment in adults, adolescents, and children 6–11 years — GINA recommends that all adults and adolescents and all children 6–11 years should receive ICS-containing medication, incorporated in their maintenance and/or anti-inflammatory reliever treatment as part of personalized asthma management. Clinicians should check local eligibility and payer criteria before prescribing.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1125amHj]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma action plan — Inhaled combination ICS-formoterol reliever: In adults and adolescents, as-needed low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-formoterol for symptom relief reduced the risk of severe exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (OCS) or requiring emergency department visit or hospitalization by 65% compared with SABA-only treatment, also reducing the risk of needing an emergency department visit or hospitalization by 37% compared with daily ICS plus as-needed short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA), and after a day of even small increased doses the risk in the following 3 weeks was reduced compared with using the same doses of SABA alone. In adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years, maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) with very low- or low-dose ICS-formoterol reduced the risk of severe exacerbations compared with the same or higher dose of ICS or ICS-LABA, with similar symptom control. For adults and adolescents, the evidence is with budesonide-formoterol 200/6 mcg metered dose (160/4.5 mcg delivered dose) by dry-powder inhaler, and for children aged 6–11 prescribed MART, budesonide-formoterol 100/6 mcg metered dose (80/4.5 mcg delivered dose) by dry-powder inhaler. Patients prescribed ICS-formoterol as their reliever should take 1 inhalation whenever needed for symptom relief; for formulations with 3 mcg [2.25 delivered dose] of formoterol per inhalation, 2 inhalations should be taken whenever needed, and an extra dose can be taken a few minutes later. Additional doses may be taken if symptoms recur, even within 4 hours, but the maximum total recommended dose in any single day for adults and adolescents is 12 inhalations for budesonide-formoterol total 72 mcg formoterol [54 mcg delivered dose], and GINA suggests that the same maximum total dose in a single day should also apply to beclometasone-formoterol; for children, budesonide-formoterol can be used up to a total of 8 inhalations in any day. If the patient is rapidly worsening, or has failed to respond to an increase in as-needed doses of ICS-formoterol over 2–3 days, they should contact their healthcare provider or seek medical assistance.

Target Audience

This practice guideline is designed to provide guidance to clinicians who manage adults and children 4 years of age and older with asthma, including adult and pediatric pulmonologists, adult and pediatric allergists, internists, pediatricians, family medicine specialists, and other healthcare providers involved in the care of patients with asthma. The use of this guideline is not designed for the evaluation and management of acute asthma but rather is designed for treatment decisions in ambulatory settings for the ongoing management of this common disease.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111WyHDu]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Medications not recommended for adults and adolescents with asthma — SABA-only and oral bronchodilators — SABA-only treatment is not recommended by GINA for adults, adolescents or children 6–11 years with asthma. Although inhaled SABAs are highly effective for the quick relief of asthma symptoms, patients whose asthma is treated with SABA alone (compared with ICS) are at increased risk of asthma-related death and of urgent asthma-related healthcare, even if they have good symptom control, and the risk of severe exacerbations requiring urgent health care is substantially reduced in adults and adolescents by either as-needed ICS-formoterol, or by regular low-dose ICS with as-needed SABA. The risk of asthma exacerbations and mortality increases incrementally with higher SABA use, one long-term study of regular SABA in patients with newly diagnosed asthma showed worse outcomes and lower lung function than in patients who were treated with daily low-dose ICS from the start, and starting treatment of asthma with SABA alone encourages patients to regard it as their main (and often only) asthma treatment, leading to poor adherence if ICS-containing therapy is prescribed. Treatment with oral bronchodilators (e.g. salbutamol tablets or syrups; oral theophylline) is not recommended for treatment of asthma in any age group.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113L9fwv]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Track 2 Step 4 treatment for adults and adolescents — maintenance inhaled corticosteroid–long-acting beta2-agonist (ICS-LABA) with as-needed short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) or combination ICS-SABA — Maintenance medium- or high-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA is an alternative approach if MART is not possible, or if a patient's asthma is stable with good adherence and no exacerbations on their current therapy; patients uncontrolled or with frequent exacerbations on low-dose ICS-LABA may benefit from maintenance medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA if MART is not available, and before prescribing a regimen with SABA reliever, clinicians should consider whether the patient is likely to be adherent with their ICS-containing treatment, as otherwise they will be at higher risk of exacerbations; occasionally, high-dose ICS-LABA may be needed. For adults aged ≥ 18 years, in a sub-population taking maintenance medium-dose ICS-LABA or high-dose ICS, there was no significant increase in time to first severe exacerbation with as-needed budesonide-salbutamol 100/200 mcg metered dose (80/90 mcg delivered dose) versus as-needed salbutamol 100/200 mcg metered dose (80/90 mcg delivered dose): hazard ratio 0.81; CI 0.61–1.07. There are no head-to-head comparisons between this regimen and ICS-formoterol MART; ICS-SABA is not recommended for regular use and its use as the reliever in Steps 3–5 requires different maintenance and reliever inhalers, making this regimen more complex than GINA Track 1. Practice points include that a maximum number of 6 as-needed doses (each 2 puffs of 100/100 mcg budesonide-salbutamol [80/90 mcg delivered dose]) can be taken in a day and that it is essential to educate patients about the different purpose of their maintenance and reliever inhalers and to train them in correct inhaler technique with both devices if they are different.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114zsRLf]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting (oral corticosteroids), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to administer oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day or equivalent up to a maximum of 50 mg/day, usually for 5–7 days in adult patients, and 1–2 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 40 mg/day, usually for 3–5 days in pediatric patients aged 6–11 years) for moderate or severe exacerbations, especially if the patient is deteriorating or has not responded to increased reliever and/or maintenance ICS-containing medications before presenting.

### Interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children: an overview of cochrane reviews [^1119mi5A]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is an illness that commonly affects adults and children, and it serves as a common reason for children to attend emergency departments. An asthma exacerbation is characterised by acute or subacute worsening of shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness and may be triggered by viral respiratory infection, poor compliance with usual medication, a change in the weather, or exposure to allergens or irritants. Most children with asthma have mild or moderate exacerbations and respond well to first-line therapy (inhaled short-acting beta-agonists and systemic corticosteroids). However, the best treatment for the small proportion of seriously ill children who do not respond to first-line therapy is not well understood. Currently, a large number of treatment options are available and there is wide variation in management.

Objectives

Main objective - To summarise Cochrane Reviews with or without meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of second-line treatment for children with acute exacerbations of asthma (i.e. after first-line treatments, titrated oxygen delivery, and administration of intermittent inhaled short-acting beta 2 -agonists and oral corticosteroids have been tried and have failed) Secondary objectives - To identify gaps in the current evidence base that will inform recommendations for future research and subsequent Cochrane Reviews - To categorise information on reported outcome measures used in trials of escalation of treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma in children, and to make recommendations for development and reporting of standard outcomes in future trials and reviews - To identify relevant randomised controlled trials that have been published since the date of publication of each included review METHODS: We included Cochrane Reviews assessing interventions for children with acute exacerbations of asthma. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search is current to 28 December 2019. We also identified trials that were potentially eligible for, but were not currently included in, published reviews. We assessed the quality of included reviews using the ROBIS criteria (tool used to assess risk of bias in systematic reviews). We presented an evidence synthesis of data from reviews alongside an evidence map of clinical trials. Primary outcomes were length of stay, hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, and adverse effects. We summarised all findings in the text and reported data for each outcome in 'Additional tables'.

Main Results

We identified 17 potentially eligible Cochrane Reviews but extracted data from, and rated the quality of, 13 reviews that reported results for children alone. We excluded four reviews as one did not include any randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one did not provide subgroup data for children, and the last two had been updated and replaced by subsequent reviews. The 13 reviews included 67 trials; the number of trials in each review ranged from a single trial up to 27 trials. The vast majority of comparisons included between one and three trials, involving fewer than 100 participants. The total number of participants included in reviews ranged from 40 to 2630. All studies included children; 16 (24%) included children younger than two years of age. Most of the reviews reported search dates older than four years. We have summarised the published evidence as outlined in Cochrane Reviews. Key findings, in terms of our primary outcomes, are that (1) intravenous magnesium sulfate was the only intervention shown to reduce hospital length of stay (high-certainty evidence); (2) no evidence suggested that any intervention reduced the risk of intensive care admission (low- to very low-certainty evidence); (3) the risk of hospital admission was reduced by the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta 2 -agonists (moderate-certainty evidence), the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate (high-certainty evidence), and the use of inhaled heliox (low-certainty evidence); (4) the addition of inhaled magnesium sulfate to usual bronchodilator therapy appears to reduce serious adverse events during hospital admission (moderate-certainty evidence); (5) aminophylline increased vomiting compared to placebo (moderate-certainty evidence) and increased nausea and nausea/vomiting compared to intravenous beta 2 -agonists (low-certainty evidence); and (6) the addition of anticholinergic therapy to short-acting beta 2 -agonists appeared to reduce the risk of nausea (high-certainty evidence) and tremor (moderate-certainty evidence) but not vomiting (low-certainty evidence). We considered 4 of the 13 reviews to be at high risk of bias based on the ROBIS framework. In all cases, this was due to concerns regarding identification and selection of studies. The certainty of evidence varied widely (by review and also by outcome) and ranged from very low to high.

Authors' Conclusions

This overview provides the most up-to-date evidence on interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children from Cochrane Reviews of randomised controlled trials. A vast majority of comparisons involved between one and three trials and fewer than 100 participants, making it difficult to assess the balance between benefits and potential harms. Due to the lack of comparative studies between various treatment options, we are unable to make firm practice recommendations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate appears to reduce both hospital length of stay and the risk of hospital admission. Hospital admission is also reduced with the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta 2 -agonists. However, further research is required to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from these therapies. Due to the relatively rare incidence of acute severe paediatric asthma, multi-centre research will be required to generate high-quality evidence. A number of existing Cochrane Reviews should be updated, and we recommend that a new review be conducted on the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy. Important priorities include development of an internationally agreed core outcome set for future trials in acute severe asthma exacerbations and determination of clinically important differences in these outcomes, which can then inform adequately powered future trials.

### Pediatric acute asthma exacerbations: evaluation and management from emergency department to intensive care unit [^112GBa4E]. The Journal of Asthma (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this report is to review available modalities for assessing and managing acute asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients, including some that are not included in current expert panel guidelines. While it is not our purpose to provide a comprehensive review of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines, we review NAEPP-recommended treatments to provide the full range of treatments available for managing exacerbations with an emphasis on the continuum of care between the ER and ICU.

Data Sources

We searched PubMed using the following search terms in different combinations: asthma, children, pediatric, exacerbation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, guidelines, treatment, management, oxygen, albuterol, β2-agonist, anticholinergic, theophylline, corticosteroid, magnesium, heliox, BiPAP, ventilation, mechanical ventilation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation and respiratory failure. We attempted to weigh the evidence using the hierarchy in which meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide the strongest evidence, followed by individual RCTs, followed by observational studies. We also reviewed the NAEPP and Global Initiative for Asthma expert panel guidelines.

Results and Conclusions

Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, and acute exacerbations are a significant burden to patients and to public health. Optimal assessment and management of exacerbations, including appropriate escalation of interventions, are essential to minimize morbidity and prevent mortality. While inhaled albuterol and systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of exacerbation management, escalation may include interventions discussed in this review.

### Bronchodilatory effect of inhaled budesonide / formoterol and budesonide / salbutamol in acute asthma: a double-blind, randomized controlled trial [^111Yj9qr]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Results of our study suggest that budesonide/formoterol can be used as reliever using MDI and spacer in children with mild acute exacerbations of asthma. This approach may avoid carrying two different MDIs (salbutamol and ICS with formoterol), which may improve patient compliance. Formoterol should not be used as monotherapy for management of asthma. Before budesonide/formoterol is recommended routinely for management of acute exacerbations, issues like tolerance, long-term safety on repeated frequent use and cost effectiveness should be proven.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116aZEEc]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Initial asthma treatment in children 6–11 years provides preferred initial treatment by presenting symptoms, and states that these recommendations are based on evidence and consensus. Infrequent asthma symptoms (e.g., 1–2 days/week or less): Low-dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken (Evidence B) in combination or in separate inhalers. Asthma symptoms 2–5 days/week: Low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A); other options include taking ICS whenever SABA is taken in combination or separate inhalers (Evidence B), or daily LTRA (Evidence A for less effectiveness for exacerbations than ICS), and to consider likely adherence if the reliever is SABA. Asthma symptoms most days (e.g., 4–5 days/week) or waking due to asthma once a week or more: Low-dose ICS-LABA plus as needed SABA (Evidence A), OR Medium-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A), OR Very-low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever (Evidence B); other options include daily low-dose ICS and LTRA, plus as-needed SABA. Daily asthma symptoms, waking at night once or more a week, and low lung function: Medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA, OR low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever (MART). Initial asthma presentation during an acute exacerbation: Treat as for exacerbation, including a short course of OCS if the exacerbation is severe; commence Step 3 or Step 4 treatment, and arrange follow-up.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114dJEMw]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Treatment in acute care settings — combination inhaled corticosteroid–formoterol (ICS–formoterol) as an alternative to high dose SABA — Compared with SABA, similar efficacy and safety have been reported from emergency department studies with budesonide-formoterol. In this study, patients received 2 doses of budesonide-formoterol 400/12 mcg (delivered dose 320/9 mcg) or 8 doses of salbutamol (albuterol) 100 mcg (delivered dose 90 mcg), repeated once after 5 minutes; all patients received OCS. While more studies are needed, meta-analysis of data from earlier studies comparing high-dose formoterol with high dose salbutamol (albuterol) for treatment of acute asthma in the ED setting suggest that budesonide-formoterol would also be effective, and formoterol alone is no longer used for this purpose.

### Paediatric acute asthma management in Australia and new zealand: practice patterns in the context of clinical practice guidelines [^112gTCUN]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare clinical practice guideline (CPG) recommendations and reported physician management of acute paediatric asthma in the 11 largest paediatric emergency departments, all of which have CPGs, in Australia (n = 9) and New Zealand (n = 2). All 11 sites participate in the Paediatric Research in Emergency Departments International Collaborative (PREDICT) research network.

Methods

(a) A review of CPGs for acute childhood asthma from all PREDICT sites. (b) A standardised anonymous survey of senior emergency doctors at PREDICT sites investigating management of acute childhood asthma.

Results

CPGs for mild to moderate asthma were similar across sites and based on salbutamol delivery by metered dose inhaler with spacer and oral prednisolone. In severe to critical asthma, differences between sites were common and related to recommendations for: ipratropium use; metered-dose inhaler versus nebulised delivery of salbutamol in severe asthma; use of intravenous aminophylline, intravenous magnesium and dosing of intravenous salbutamol in critical asthma. The questionnaire (78 of 83 doctors responded) also revealed significant differences between doctors in the treatment of moderate to severe asthma. Ipratropium was used for moderate asthma by 42%. For severe to critical asthma, nebulised delivery of salbutamol was preferred by 79% of doctors over metered dose inhalers. For critical asthma, doctors reported using intravenous aminophylline in 45%, intravenous magnesium in 55%, and intravenous salbutamol in 87% of cases. Thirty-nine different dosing regimens for intravenous salbutamol were reported.

Conclusions

CPG recommendations and reported physician practice for mild to moderate paediatric asthma management were broadly similar across PREDICT sites and consistent with national guidelines. Practice was highly variable for severe to critical asthma and probably reflects limitations of available evidence. Areas of controversy, in particular the comparative efficacy of intravenous bronchodilators, would benefit from multi-centre trials. Collaborative development of CPGs should be considered.

### Treatment patterns and frequency of key outcomes in acute severe asthma in children: a paediatric research in emergency departments international collaborative (PREDICT) multicentre cohort study [^113bR7NJ]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a frequent reason for a child to attend the emergency department (ED), and one of the most common reasons for paediatric hospitalisation after an ED visit. In the United States, the rate (per population) of paediatric ED visits for asthma increased by 13.3% between 2001 and 2010, while in the UK, it is estimated that a child is admitted to hospital every 20 min due to an asthma exacerbation.

Most children with asthma have mild or moderate exacerbations, and respond to first-line treatment with inhaled bronchodilator therapy and systemic corticosteroids. However, a proportion of children require more intensive therapies including intravenous medications, supplemental oxygen, respiratory support, endotracheal intubation and/or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Management of acute severe asthma is complicated by a number of challenges, including the infrequency of its occurrence, a large number of treatment options and wide variation in self-reported and actual practice. Acute asthma has been highlighted as a research priority by multiple paediatric emergency medicine research networks.

A 2015 study from the UK found that 110 (3.4%) of 3238 children with acute asthma presenting to 24 EDs received intravenous therapy: magnesium in 2.1%, salbutamol in 1.9% and aminophylline in 1.6%. More than thirty different intravenous dosing and infusion regimens were identified in these 110 patients. In contrast, a study from the United States found that 10.5% of 61 854 children with acute asthma presenting to seven EDs between 2012 and 2017 received intravenous magnesium. No clinical characteristics explained the variation in intravenous magnesium use in the United States study, and the large difference between use of intravenous magnesium in the UK and USA studies remains unexplained. While intravenous magnesium has been found in meta-analysis to reduce both hospital admission and hospital length of stay (LOS), the quality of evidence is low, mainly due to small sample size.

### Different oral corticosteroid regimens for acute asthma [^115paH13]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common long-term breathing condition that affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. People with asthma may experience short-term worsening of their asthma symptoms; these episodes are often known as 'exacerbations', 'flare-ups', 'attacks' or 'acute asthma'. Oral steroids, which have a potent anti-inflammatory effect, are recommended for all but the most mild asthma exacerbations; they should be initiated promptly. The most often prescribed oral steroids are prednisolone and dexamethasone, but current guidelines on dosing vary between countries, and often among different guideline producers within the same country. Despite their proven efficacy, use of steroids needs to be balanced against their potential to cause important adverse events. Evidence is somewhat limited regarding optimal dosing of oral steroids for asthma exacerbations to maximise recovery while minimising potential side effects, which is the topic of this review.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of any dose or duration of oral steroids versus any other dose or duration of oral steroids for adults and children with an asthma exacerbation.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), ClinicalTrials.gov (www. ClinicalTrials.gov), the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/) and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles. This search was up to date as of April 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of blinding or duration, that evaluated one dose or duration of oral steroid versus any other dose or duration, for management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies involving both adults and children with asthma of any severity, in which investigators analysed adults and children separately. We allowed any other co-intervention in the management of an asthma exacerbation, provided it was not part of the randomised treatment. We included studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only and unpublished data.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results for included trials, extracted numerical data and assessed risk of bias; all data were cross-checked for accuracy. We resolved disagreements by discussion with the third review author or with an external advisor. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or risk differences (RDs) using study participants as the unit of analysis; we analysed continuous data as mean differences (MDs). We used a random-effects model, and we carried out a fixed-effect analysis if we detected statistical heterogeneity. We rated all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and presented results in 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 18 studies that randomised a total of 2438 participants - both adults and children - and performed comparisons of interest. Included studies assessed higher versus lower doses of prednisolone (n = 4); longer versus shorter courses of prednisolone (n = 3) or dexamethasone (n = 1); tapered versus non-tapered courses of prednisolone (n = 4); and prednisolone versus dexamethasone (n = 6). Follow-up duration ranged from seven days to six months. The smallest study randomised just 15 participants, and the largest 638 (median 93). The varied interventions and outcomes reported limited the number of meaningful meta-analyses that we could perform. For two of our primary outcomes - hospital admission and serious adverse events - events were too infrequent to permit conclusions about the superiority of one treatment over the other, or their equivalence. Researchers in the included studies reported asthma symptoms in different ways and rarely used validated scales, again limiting our conclusions. Secondary outcome meta-analysis was similarly hampered by heterogeneity among interventions and outcome measures used. Overall, we found no convincing evidence of differences in outcomes between a higher dose or longer course and a lower dose or shorter course of prednisolone or dexamethasone, or between prednisolone and dexamethasone. Included studies were generally of reasonable methodological quality. Review authors assessed most outcomes in the review as having low or very low quality, meaning we are not confident in the effect estimates. The predominant reason for downgrading was imprecision, but indirectness and risk of bias also reduced our confidence in some estimates.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is not strong enough to reveal whether shorter or lower-dose regimens are generally less effective than longer or higher-dose regimens, or indeed that the latter are associated with more adverse events. Any changes recommended for current practice should be supported by data from larger, well-designed trials. Varied study design and outcome measures limited the number of meta-analyses that we could perform. Greater emphasis on palatability and on whether some regimens might be easier to adhere to than others could better inform clinical decisions for individual patients.

### Treatment patterns and frequency of key outcomes in acute severe asthma in children: a paediatric research in emergency departments international collaborative (PREDICT) multicentre cohort study [^1142qUuC]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

A major hurdle to determining effective management strategies following failure of systemic corticosteroids and inhaled bronchodilators in children presenting with acute severe asthma, is the lack of consistency in primary outcome measures. A systematic review of primary outcomes used in RCTs of intravenous bronchodilators in acute paediatric asthma identified 35 publications and four protocols that used 56 different primary outcomes between them, concluding that core outcome sets need to be developed for future trials. Large observational studies, such as our study, allow the consideration of the frequency of important outcome measures and are vital to informing the design of future comparative trials.

Of those children who had escalated treatment of some description (intensive care admission, respiratory support or intravenous bronchodilator administration), 243 (23.8%) were admitted to intensive care. However, only four received intubation and mechanical ventilation, and 22 received CPAP or Bi-level NIV. Sample size calculations for studies with 90% power and a type I error (alpha) of 0.05 to demonstrate a 50% reduction in these outcomes would require 24 078 (for intubation) and 5766 (for NIV) children with asthma requiring escalation of therapy, or 450 220 (for intubation) and 80 728 (for NIV) children attending the ED with an asthma exacerbation. It, therefore, is not feasible, even with large multicentre studies, to achieve sufficiently large sample sizes to power randomised clinical trials to address these outcomes.

Our study has a number of limitations. Our data was based on a retrospective analysis of medical records; we mitigated its inherent limitations by following published guidancethough abstractors were not blinded. Our case definition (asthma or wheeze, aged between 1 and 17 years, administered salbutamol in the ED) was intentionally broad, and aimed to capture all children outside the traditional age range for bronchiolitis who were administered bronchodilators. Although the inclusion of a large number of preschool children raises the possibility of some overlap with bronchiolitis, the definition of bronchiolitis in the Australasian setting usually refers to those under 12 months of age.

As our focus was on describing practice in those children who received escalated asthma care, we collected limited data on those patients who did not receive treatment beyond inhaled bronchodilators and oral corticosteroids. We did not assess compliance with local or national clinical practice guidelines. Our determination of predictors of escalated therapy and hospital length of stay was therefore limited due to less data points being captured for those not receiving escalated care.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, systemic corticosteroids, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to continue systemic (oral) corticosteroids for 5–7 days in adult patients (prednisolone or equivalent 40–50 mg/day) and for 3–5 days in pediatric patients (1–2 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 40 mg/day) to reduce the risk of relapse.

### Improving asthma management: the case for mandatory inclusion of dose counters on all rescue bronchodilators [^113qxTiB]. The Journal of Asthma (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma remains a serious global health challenge. Poor control of asthma symptoms is due in part to incorrect use of oral inhaler devices that deliver asthma medications, such as poor inhalation technique or use of a metered dose inhaler (MDI) after the recommended number of doses is expelled.

Objective

To review published research on the potential for patients to overestimate or underestimate the amount of asthma rescue medication in MDIs without integrated dose-counting mechanisms.

Methods

We searched PubMed and EMBASE using search terms "dose counter and asthma" and "dose counter and metered dose inhaler" for English language publications up to July, 2012, with a manual search of references from relevant articles.

Results

Up to 40% of patients believe they are taking their asthma medication when they actually are activating an empty or nearly empty MDI. Device design makes it impossible for an MDI to cease delivering drug doses at an exact point, and the number of actuations in an MDI may be twice the nominal number of recommended medication doses. Once the recommended number of medication doses is expelled, remaining actuations deliver decreasing concentrations of active medication and increasing concentrations of propellants and excipients. This phenomenon, called "tail-off", is particularly problematic when medications are formulated as suspensions, as are rescue medications to control acute bronchospasm. Reliable inhalation of rescue medication could reduce asthma-related morbidity.

Conclusion

By helping to ensure that patients receive accurate metered doses of asthma rescue medication to relieve bronchoconstriction, dose counters may help to improve asthma management.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111EEe41]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids — adult and pediatric dosing and duration for asthma exacerbations are specified: daily doses of oral corticosteroids (OCS) equivalent to 50 mg prednisolone as a single morning dose, or 200 mg hydrocortisone in divided doses are typically used for adults, and for children a prednisolone dose of 1–2 mg/kg up to a maximum of 40 mg/day is suggested; evidence does not demonstrate a benefit of intramuscular or intravenous over oral routes. For duration, 5- and 7-day courses in adults are as effective as 10- and 14-day courses respectively, and in most children a 3–5-day course is usually considered sufficient, and there is no benefit in tapering OCS either in the short term or over several weeks. Oral dexamethasone 12–16 mg given once daily for 1–2 days has similar relapse and adverse events to prednisolone for 3–5 days; in children, 0.3 mg/kg or 0.6 mg/kg once daily for 1–2 days shows no difference in relapse versus prednisolone/prednisone for 3–5 days, with better adherence and substantially lower risk of vomiting; oral dexamethasone should not be continued beyond 2 days, and if there is failure of resolution or relapse, consideration should be given to switching to prednisolone.

SECTION IV: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF INTERMITTENT ICS IN THE TREATMENT OF ASTHMA

Background

Scheduled, daily ICS treatment is the currently preferred pharmacologic controller therapy for persistent asthma in individuals of all ages. Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-3), published in 2007, suggested that intermittent ICS dosing schedules may be useful in some settings, but the evidence at that time was insufficient to support a recommendation in favor of this treatment beyond a recommendation based on expert consensus.

Definitions of terms used in this section

"Intermittent" ICS dosing in this section includes courses of ICS treatment used for brief periods, usually in response to symptoms or as an add-on with or without a LABA. "Intermittent ICS dosing" does not refer to a single regimen, and its definition is specified in each of the recommendations. Intermittent ICS dosing allows providers to prescribe specific doses, frequencies, and durations of ICS use. When to use intermittent ICS dosing could depend on an individual's decision (based on need, which is also known as "as-needed" or "pro re nata" dosing), a predefined index showing worsening asthma, or some other predefined criterion.

"Controller therapy" refers to medications that are taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. Both controller therapy and intermittent dosing may involve daily use of a specific dose of an ICS. The terms "ICS-LABA" (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta 2 -agonist combination, typically in a single device) and "ICS-formoterol" indicate combination therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually and preferably in a single inhaler.

"Quick-relief" therapy refers to medications (eg, an inhaled SABA) used to treat acute symptoms or exacerbations. In this section, "as-needed" dosing (eg, of a SABA) is intermittent and is based on the patient's decision (Figs 2–4).

The definitions of "low-", "medium-", and "high-dose" ICS are based on the recommendations from EPR-3.

The term "puff" refers to a single actuation and inhalation of a medication delivered through any type of inhaler.

"Recurrent wheezing" as used for the studies included in this section is defined as three or more episodes of wheezing triggered by apparent respiratory tract infections in a child's lifetime or two episodes in the past year.

Asthma step 4 treatment — children 6–11 years: Preferred options are to "refer for expert advice, or increase treatment to medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA, or MART with low-dose ICS-formoterol"; for children not adequately controlled on low-dose maintenance ICS-LABA with as-needed SABA, "consider referral for expert advice" or "treatment may be increased to medium-dose ICS-LABA (Evidence B)". For MART with budesonide–formoterol, "the maintenance dose may be increased to 100/6 mcg twice daily (metered dose; 80/4.5 mcg delivered dose)… this is still a low-dose regimen". If "asthma is not well controlled on medium-dose ICS… refer the child for expert assessment and advice".

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114wujcb]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Treatment in acute care settings — inhaled short-acting beta2 agonists (SABA) — Currently, inhaled salbutamol (albuterol) is the usual bronchodilator in acute asthma management, and the most cost-effective and efficient delivery is by pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) with a spacer (Evidence A). Systematic reviews of intermittent versus continuous SABA in acute asthma provide conflicting results, use of nebulizers can disseminate aerosols and potentially contribute to spread of respiratory viral infections, and current evidence does not support the routine use of intravenous beta2 agonist in most patients with severe asthma exacerbations (Evidence A).

### Estimating the effects of continuous albuterol dosage on clinical outcomes for pediatric critical asthma exacerbation: a retrospective cohort study [^115AUtX8]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Asthma remains one of the most prevalent chronic diseases among children worldwide, leading to significant morbidity and occasional mortality. The management of asthma exacerbations often requires interventions that will promptly reverse airway obstruction and prevent further deterioration. Among these interventions, continuous albuterol inhalation stands as one of only two cornerstone therapies, the other being systemic corticosteroids, for which there is a robust evidence base to support its use. Further, albuterol is the only one of these two therapies with rapid‐onset effect. Albuterol is a short‐acting beta‐agonist that works by rapidly relaxing bronchial muscle tissue to improve airway flow and relieve respiratory symptoms.

Historically, the dosages of albuterol used in acute settings have been based more on empirical evidence than stringent, dose‐ranging studies. Additionally, albuterol dosing for children is typically derived from adult‐based guidelines using absolute numbers rather than relative to weight. This has led to wide variation in practice, with some clinicians administering higher doses in hopes of quicker resolution of symptoms, despite potential risks such as hypokalemia, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, and increased hospital stays due to side effects.

Preliminary research in the pediatric population suggests that high‐dose albuterol (75–100 mg/h) does not lead to clinically significant adverse effects. However, a study comparing a broad‐range of weight‐based quintiles did not find evidence for a dose‐effect that would support giving a specific amount for optimal clinical outcomes. Use of continuous albuterol (vs. intermittent) is also associated with increased economic cost to health systems. That, coupled with recently observed critical shortages of continuous albuterol formulations, highlights the need for judicious stewardship of its use.

To address these concerns, we conducted an examination of the outcomes associated with administration of a reduced starting dosage of continuous albuterol in children experiencing critical asthma exacerbations. We took advantage of a natural experiment where a change in departmental policy for the pediatric intensive care unit at our institution prompted a change from high variability in the starting rate of continuous albuterol (between 10 and 15 mg/h) to a standardized approach of starting at 10 mg/h. We hypothesized that this lower dose would not lead to worse clinical outcomes.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1179T5GD]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Acute asthma — Although there is a strong emphasis on minimizing oral corticosteroid (OCS) use to reduce long-term cumulative adverse effects, OCS are essential in management of acute severe asthma, and the occurrence of any severe exacerbation should be a prompt to assess the patient thoroughly, optimize their asthma treatment, and consider referral for expert advice to reduce the risk of another exacerbation occurring; evidence about use of dexamethasone has been updated based on the latest evidence.

### Intravenous salbutamol bolus compared with an aminophylline infusion in children with severe asthma: a randomised controlled trial [^113k3vGz]. Thorax (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The relative efficacies of aminophylline and salbutamol in severe acute childhood asthma are currently unclear. A single bolus of salbutamol was compared with a continuous aminophylline infusion in children with severe asthma in a randomised double blind study.

Methods

Children aged 1–16 years with acute severe asthma were enrolled if they showed little improvement with three nebulisers (combined salbutamol and ipratropium) administered over an hour and systemic steroids. Subjects were randomised to receive either a short intravenous bolus of salbutamol (15 micro g/kg over 20 minutes) followed by a saline infusion or an aminophylline infusion (5 mg/kg over 20 minutes) followed by 0.9 mg/kg/h.

Results

Forty four subjects were enrolled, with 18 randomly allocated to receive salbutamol and 26 to receive aminophylline. The groups were well matched at baseline. An intention to treat analysis showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the asthma severity score (ASS) at 2 hours between the two groups (median (IQR) 6 (6, 8) and 6.5 (5, 8) for salbutamol and aminophylline respectively, p = 0.93). A similar improvement in ASS to 2 hours was seen in the two groups (mean difference -0.08, 95% CI -0.97 to 0.80), there was a trend (p = 0.07) towards a longer duration of oxygen therapy in the salbutamol group (17.8 hours (95% CI 8.5 to 37.5) v 7.0 hours (95% CI 3.4 to 14.2)), and a significantly (p = 0.02) longer length of hospital stay in the salbutamol group (85.4 (95% CI 66.1 to 110.2) hours v 57.3 hours (95% CI 45.6 to 72.0)). There was no significant difference in adverse events between the two groups.

Conclusions

This study suggests that, in severe childhood asthma, there is no significant difference in the effectiveness of a bolus of salbutamol and an aminophylline infusion in the first 2 hours of treatment. Overall, the aminophylline infusion was superior as it significantly reduced the length of stay in hospital.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^116z7jSc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing — intermittent inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) started at the onset of an apparent respiratory tract infection have evidence of benefit with important growth considerations. Three RCTs with high certainty of evidence compared short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) alone to intermittent ICS with SABA for quick relief, with a 33% relative risk reduction in exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids; growth effects were mixed, with a 5% lower gain with intermittent fluticasone (750 μg twice daily for up to 10 days) in one trial and no effect with budesonide inhalation suspension (1 mg twice daily for 7 days) in another. Clinicians should inform caregivers that this treatment could affect growth, should carefully monitor growth, and should reconsider implementing this recommended treatment if any evidence shows a reduced growth rate that cannot be attributed to other factors; although one study comparing short ICS courses with regular daily ICS showed differences in exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids, the Expert Panel made no recommendation based on this comparison, and no studies produced robust data comparing intermittent ICS with no treatment or a nonpharmacologic therapy.

Future research priorities in acute exacerbations: "Although exacerbations of asthma are a very common problem, there is a surprising paucity of data regarding intervention in this situation". "Further research is desperately needed in children and adults". Study design "should consider the potential impact of the dose, timing and frequency of escalation of the intervention, and the population being studied".

Family/carer-initiated corticosteroids in pediatric asthma exacerbations — evidence to support the initiation of oral corticosteroid (OCS) treatment by family/carers in the home management of asthma exacerbations in children is weak. Preemptive episodic high-dose nebulized inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) may reduce exacerbations in children with intermittent viral triggered wheezing, but because of the high potential for side-effects, especially if the treatment is continued inappropriately or is given frequently, family-administered high-dose ICS should be considered only where the healthcare provider is confident that the medications will be used appropriately, and the child is closely monitored for side-effects.

Systemic corticosteroids — indications, dosing duration, and precautions: medications include prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone tablets, and dexamethasone, given by tablets or suspension or by IM or IV injection; short-term treatment (usually 5–7 days in adults) is important for severe acute exacerbations with main effects seen after 4–6 hours, oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy is preferred to IM or IV therapy and is effective in preventing short-term relapse, tapering is required if OCS are given for more than 2 weeks, and patients should be reviewed after any exacerbation; as a last resort, long-term OCS may be required for some patients with severe asthma but serious side-effects are problematic, and such patients should be referred for specialist review if available to have treatment optimized and phenotype assessed.

### Bronchodilatory effect of inhaled budesonide / formoterol and budesonide / salbutamol in acute asthma: a double-blind, randomized controlled trial [^111vfA5c]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

The results of our study and other studies suggest that formoterol has rapid bronchodilator action similar to salbutamol or terbutaline and possibly can be used as rescue drug for acute exacerbations in children. We had earlier compared bronchodilator action of two long acting beta agonists (formoterol and salmeterol) at 60 min in a randomized controlled trial and observed similar improvement in FEV1. In this study, no comparisons were done in first 10 min of administration of the drugs. International guidelines recommend against monotherapy with LABA in the management of asthma.

However, there are few concerns regarding long-term, frequent use of LABAs. The extent of tolerance to β-adrenoceptor agonists is dependent on the dose and duration of treatment. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in adults by Haney and Hancox assessed tolerance to the bronchodilator action of salbutamol during ongoing treatment with long-acting beta-agonist. They concluded that the bronchodilator response to salbutamol was significantly reduced in patients taking formoterol. Clinically relevant tolerance to rescue beta-agonist treatment may occur in patients treated with long-acting beta-agonists. Therefore, it is important to document that repeated doses of formoterol as rescue drugs will not affect response to treatment in acute exacerbation of asthma.

A systematic review evaluated the effects of the combination of LABA and inhaled corticosteroids versus a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids on the risk of asthma exacerbations. The authors concluded that combination of LABA and ICS was more effective in reducing the risk of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids than a higher dose of ICS in adolescents and adults; in children there was no significant reduction, but rather a trend towards an increased risk of oral steroid-treated exacerbations and hospital admissions was observed. Hence, the issue of safety in children on long term use is yet to be resolved.

The strength of our study was that it was a double blind, randomized controlled trial with adequate sample size. We enrolled children with mild acute exacerbation of asthma. We used metered dose inhalers to deliver single dose (two actuations of MDI for each drug) as these devices are commonly used in the management of asthma. Unlike previous studies, we used a combination of ICS and formoterol. Clinical and spirometric parameters were monitored as early as 1-min post administration of the drug and frequent observations at 5, 15, 30 and 60 min were done.

### Diagnosis and management of asthma in children [^111uCzH1]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Pharmacological management

The pharmacological management of asthma involves two key components: maintenance and reliever therapies. Maintenance therapies are the mainstay of asthma management, and the treatment aim is that no reliever therapies are required. Use of reliever therapy suggests asthma control is poor.

An overview of maintenance and reliever therapies is outlined in tables 3 and 4, respectively. A stepwise approach to asthma management is encouraged, and pharmacological management varies on age, symptom control and the national guideline used. An overview of management approach in a number of national guidelines is summarised in table 5.

Maintenance therapies

Table 4
Reliever therapies

Table 5
Summary of paediatric asthma national guidelines: focusing on management

Table 6
Biologic agents used in the management of asthma

GINA guidelines recommend dual ICS and short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) therapy to children over the age of 5.SABA monotherapy was previously the main management starting point; however, compared with combined treatment, SABA monotherapy has been shown to be associated with asthma mortality.SABA monotherapy is now only recommended by GINA for use in children aged 5 or less. As seen in table 5, GINA recommends symptom-driven ICS use, compared with daily ICS use, as initial therapy in children over 6 years of age. In comparison to daily ICS use, symptom-driven use has demonstrated a similar exacerbation risk and reduces the risk of ICS adverse effects.

Single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) inhalers are combined inhalers offering both maintenance and reliever therapy in those with asthma. These inhalers contain a number of maintenance and reliever therapies in different combinations. The use of these inhalers have been shown to reduce the risk of asthma attacks and emergency department (ED) admissions, improve lung function and decrease the need for reliever therapy. There is limited evidence in the effectiveness of SMART inhalers in children, but children over 12 years may be prescribed a SMART inhaler, which acts as both a maintenance and reliever therapy, if symptoms are not well controlled.

There are a number of biologic agents (table 6) that may be used in the management of paediatric asthma. These are endotype-specific, targeted therapies that should be used only under the supervision of specialists. Their availability and cost vary between countries and different healthcare systems. Detailed appraisal of the evidence base for their use is provided in the individual management guidelines and has been recently reviewed.

### Hospital discharge using salbutamol as required after acute attacks of wheeze in children: a service evaluation [^111o7xkS]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

We obtained feedback from 103 families. Based on their reports, using salbutamol as required resulted in significant reductions in bronchodilator use. Compared with the expected use of salbutamol according to previous fixed dose 4 hourly weaning plans (day 1: 10 puffs, day 2: 5 puffs, day 3: 2 puffs), significantly lower doses were reported (figure 2). Mean estimated dose reductions were by 73% on day 1, 69% on day 2 and 50% on day 3. Only 13 children still required salbutamol after 3 days. Eight visited their General Practitioner over the next 2 weeks because of ongoing symptoms. In most cases, this was not because of concern about wheeze.

Figure 2
Salbutamol use with fixed dose and as needed regimes.

All parents/carers reported that written information was easy to follow. Only 23% used the table to record salbutamol use but all parents were able to recall the amounts used. All parents of children who had previously attended the hospital and been discharged on fixed dose weaning regimes said they preferred the new advice and confirmed that it had resulted in using less salbutamol. Those parents who had kept a written record of salbutamol use said they found this useful.

Comparative effectiveness of the new intervention was assessed by comparing reattendance rates for a similar group of children with a discharge diagnosis of acute wheeze or asthma and who were treated for severe asthma in the same 6 months in the year before we introduced our new advice. The readmission rate for asthma in 2021 was 12.5 per 1000 and following the introduction of an 'as required' approach it fell to 8.3 per 1000. The OR for readmission following the intervention was 0.66 (0.37–1.14), p = 0.12 (table 1). No children reattended more than once within a week of their initial attendance with acute wheeze. The number of children attending the hospital was less in 2022 among children aged > 5 years (446 in 2021 vs 247 in 2022). Numbers attending among children aged < 5 years were similar (571 in 2021 vs 510 in 2022). The overall ratio of men to women was 1127/657 (1.71).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112QJaBQ]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma action plan maintenance medications — maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) with combination low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-formoterol is reported as effective in adults and adolescents for improving symptom control and reducing exacerbations and hospitalizations compared with the same or higher dose of ICS or ICS–long-acting beta agonist (LABA) with as-needed short-acting beta agonist (SABA), and it was also effective in reducing exacerbations in children aged 4–11 years. For MART, the recommended maximum total dose of formoterol in 24 hours with budesonide–formoterol is 72 mcg (delivered dose 54 mcg), and GINA suggests that the same maximum total dose in a single day should apply to beclometasone–formoterol. This approach should not be attempted with other combination ICS–LABA medications with a slower-onset LABA such as ICS–salmeterol, or with combinations that lack the required dose response and safety profile. In action plans using ICS–formoterol, the maintenance dose does not normally need to be increased; instead, the patient increases their as-needed doses of ICS–formoterol.

### Improving asthma management: the case for mandatory inclusion of dose counters on all rescue bronchodilators [^116pHYWb]. The Journal of Asthma (2013). Low credibility.

Among other factors, patient nonadherence to therapy is an important contributor to poor asthma control. While often volitional, nonadherence can also be inadvertent when prescribed medications are taken improperly. For example, patients may think they are taking their asthma medication when they actually are activating a nearly empty or an altogether empty MDI to deliver orally inhaled asthma medication. MDIs deliver a limited number of effective medication doses, as listed in the prescribing information for each product. After the manufacturer-recommended number of doses is expelled, the MDI will continue to actuate many more times. Accurately assessing the doses in an MDI is critically important for bronchodilating medications used for "rescue" from acute asthma symptoms.

This literature review describes the growing evidence that people commonly — and significantly — overestimate (or less commonly, underestimate) the remaining amount of active asthma rescue medication in MDIs without dose counters, that the techniques used to "guesstimate" whether a recue MDI is effectively empty are unreliable, and how having a rescue MDI with an integrated dose counter mechanism can improve the health and quality of life of patients with asthma.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^111gzNiu]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary of the evidence

The Expert Panel specified three critical outcomes (exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life) and one important outcome (rescue medication use) for this question. The summary of evidence for Recommendation 9 is in EtD Table XIII in Appendix B.

Three RCTs with high certainty of evidence, compared SABA alone to intermittent ICS with SABA for quick relief. This treatment resulted in a 33% relative risk (RR) reduction in exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. Two of these three trials assessed growth but found different effects on this outcome. Ducharme et alfound a 5% lower gain in height and weight in study participants receiving intermittent fluticasone (750 μg twice daily at onset of a respiratory tract infection for up to 10 days) than in participants receiving a placebo. The authors noted a significant correlation between the cumulative dose of fluticasone and changes in height. In contrast, Bacharier et aldid not find an effect on linear growth of budesonide inhalation suspension (1 mg twice daily for 7 days) in comparison with placebo in children with an "identified respiratory tract illness". Whether these differences in growth effects were due to differences in drugs, doses, duration of treatment, or other factors is not clear.

Rationale and discussion

The main comparator for which data are available is SABA-only therapy. The demonstrated efficacy but conflicting data regarding the effect of a short course of a daily ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy on growth led the Expert Panel to develop a conditional recommendation for this therapy starting at the on set of an apparent respiratory tract infection for children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing. Although one study that compared short ICS courses with regular daily ICS treatment showed no differences in exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids with moderate certainty of evidence, the Expert Panel made no recommendation based on this comparison because this study was not adequately powered to demonstrate equivalence. No studies produced robust data on comparisons of intermittent ICS use with no treatment or a nonpharmacologic therapy.

Question 4.2

What is the comparative effectiveness of intermittent ICS compared to ICS controller therapy in individuals aged 5 years and older with persistent asthma?

Recommendation 10: In individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends either daily low-dose ICS and as needed SABA for quick-relief therapy or as-needed ICS and SABA used concomitantly.

### Management of acute loss of asthma control in the yellow zone: a practice parameter [^112nWgzB]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute loss of asthma control (yellow zone) — definition, goals, and cautions on systemic steroids: The yellow zone signifies the transition zone signaling the onset of loss of asthma control and may occur over hours to days, and the chief goal is to prevent progression to a full asthma exacerbation (red zone). The definition of acute loss of asthma control in the yellow zone should distinguish it from occasional asthma symptoms that do not indicate an impending exacerbation and from severe asthma symptoms that require administration of OCSs and immediate medical attention. Because there is generally a narrow window of opportunity for a yellow zone intervention to work, early identification of symptoms and aggressive intervention may optimize the chances for a good outcome, and although a "false" start may begin treatment when not needed, the risk of a "late" start may result in episode progression and the need for treatment with systemic corticosteroids. For established red zone exacerbations, OCSs have been shown to be effective if started early; however, their palatability and side effects, especially if repeated courses are given, limit their use in the yellow zone, and recent studies have suggested that systemic corticosteroids may not provide clinical benefit in preschool children with acute wheezing episodes.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Adults and Children 2 to 12 Years of Age

The usual dosage for adults and for children weighing at least 15 kg is 2.5 mg of albuterol (one vial) administered three to four times daily by nebulization. Children weighing < 15 kg who require < 2.5 mg/dose (i.e., less than a full vial) should use albuterol inhalation solution, 0.5% instead of albuterol inhalation solution, 0.083%. More frequent administration or higher doses are not recommended. To administer 2.5 mg of albuterol, administer the entire contents of one sterile unit dose vial (3 mL of 0.083% inhalation solution) by nebulization. The flow rate is regulated to suit the particular nebulizer so that albuterol inhalation solution will be delivered over approximately 5 to 15 minutes.

The use of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring bouts of bronchospasm. During this time most patients gain optimum benefit from regular use of the inhalation solution.

If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide the usual relief, medical advice should be sought immediately, as this is often a sign of seriously worsening asthma which would require reassessment of therapy.

### Is there a rationale and role for long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators in asthma? [^114dnyCe]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical Evidence of Anticholinergic Bronchodilators in Asthma

Historically, short-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators have not been considered appropriate for the control of asthma, except in some cases for the acute treatment of asthma attacks in patients with chronic stable asthma, and in those who experience adverse events from SABAs, such as tachycardia, arrhythmia and tremor. Although short-acting anticholinergics are considered less effective rapid bronchodilators than SABAs such as salbutamol, there are data to suggest that, for acute exacerbations, ipratropium in combination with a SABA as reliever medication improves lung function to a greater extent than a SABA alone. In a double-blind, randomised trial, Rodrigo and Rodrigoinvestigated the effects of high-dose ipratropium plus the SABA albuterol (registered generic name for salbutamol in the United States) in adults with acute asthma, in the emergency department. Patients receiving high-dose ipratropium plus albuterol had a greater improvement in peak expiratory flow and forced expiratory volume in 1 s compared with patients who received albuterol alone. The risk of hospital admission was 49% lower in the ipratropium/albuterol arm. Further, a meta-analysis has indicated that the addition of a short-acting anticholinergic to a SABA is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalisation in children. Thus, in adults or children, the main justification for the use of short-acting anticholinergic drugs in acute asthma is reduction of the elevated airway smooth muscle and cholinergic tone during an acute crisis, although administration of multiple doses has been associated with a reduction in hospitalisations and risk of hospitalisation.

Intervention

All patients with acute asthma underwent clinical assessment for severity of attack and received standard therapy with oxygen and inhaled bronchodilators via jet nebulizer with salbutamol 2.5 mg and ipratropium bromide 500 mcg mixed with 2 cc of normal saline every 15 to 30 minutes. The duration of the high dose bronchodilator therapy was variable (1–4 hours) and subsequently tapered to every 6 hours depending on the symptomatic response to therapy. A dose of systemic corticosteroids in the form of hydrocortisone 200 mg IV was administered in the ER followed by 100 mg every 6 hours. The steroids were subsequently changed to oral prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg/day for 7 days. The trial design followed in the ER is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2
Trial design. ER: Emergency room.

Additional asthma therapies with aminophylline and magnesium sulphate were given on the discretion of the admitting team when asthma exacerbation was not responding to initial standard therapy after hospitalization. Antibiotics were given only if there was clinical or radiological suspicion of bacterial infection like fever > 101 °F, purulent sputum production or clinical or radiological signs of consolidation. The use of antibiotic was not assessed in our study.

Patients in the treatment arm 1 received oral montelukast 10 mg first dose in the ER followed by 10 mg oral dose once a day in evening for the duration of stay in the hospital. The medication was started in the ER as soon as standard therapy was administered, informed consent was obtained and a decision was made for hospitalization.

The placebo was of the same appearance (color and size) and taste as the trial medication; it was prepared by the Hilton Pharma after being approved by Ministry of Health (MoH) Pakistan. The first dose was given in the ER followed by once daily for a period of duration of stay in the hospital. The trial coordinator in AKUH pharmacy managed the storage and distribution of placebo. The serial peak expiratory flow (PEF) monitoring was done; a baseline PEF value was obtained on enrolment, then at 30, 60 and 90 minutes from the baseline value, followed by every 12 hours daily until discharge. A minimum of 3 readings were obtained each time before administration of bronchodilator and the best of 3 was taken as the final value.

Outcome assessment

The primary outcomes of the study were a) improvement in lung function measured as PEF and FEV 1 over the course of hospital stay and discharge and b) duration of hospital stay.

Secondary outcome included development of complications such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrest and/or death.

Implementation guidance

Clinician's Summary:

For individuals aged 12years and older with mild persistent asthma, the Expert Panel recommends either of the following two treatments as part of Step 2 therapy: a daily low-dose ICS and as-needed SABA for quick-relief therapy or intermittent as-needed SABA and an ICS used concomitantly (ie, one after the other) for worsening asthma. In this recommendation, "intermittent" ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual with asthma who is not taking ICS controller therapy regularly. This recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years because this therapy has not been adequately studied in this age group.

The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementation of intermittent ICS dosing in individuals aged 12 years and older:
Individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma who are not taking asthma treatment may benefit from this therapy. The Expert Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma because of insufficient evidence.
Individuals aged 12 years and older with asthma and a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy. Regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred for such patients to avoid ICS undertreatment (low symptom perception) or overtreatment (high symptom perception).
Based on the regimen assessed in three of the four studies on intermittent ICS dosing, one approach to intermittent therapy is two to four puffs of albuterol followed by 80 to 250 μg of beclomethasone equivalent every 4 hours as needed for asthma symptoms. In these studies, the clinician determined the dosing a priori. Currently, these medications need to be administered sequentially in two separate inhalers, but combination inhalers with albuterol and an ICS may be available in the United States in the future.
Individuals who use this type of therapy can initiate intermittent therapy at home. However, they should receive regular follow-up to ensure that the intermittent regimen is still appropriate.
What clinicians should discuss with patients and families: Clinicians should inform individuals that the two treatment options do not have different effects on asthma control, asthma quality of life, or the frequency of asthma exacerbations when studied in large groups of people. Similarly, side effects are equally infrequent with daily and intermittent use. Shared decision making will allow the best choice to be made for a particular individual.

Assess exacerbation severity from the patient's mental state, degree of dyspnea, vital signs, oxygen saturation, and lung function (PEF or spirometry) while starting treatment with repeated administration of SABA (in most patients, by pressurized metered-dose inhaler and spacer) and controlled flow oxygen (sufficient flow to maintain oxygen saturation at 93–95% for adults; 94–98% for children 6–11 yr), if available (Figure 5). Controlled oxygen therapy is associated with lower mortality and better outcomes than high-concentration (100%) oxygen therapy.

Management of asthma exacerbations in primary care (adults, adolescents, children 6–11 yr). SABA doses are for albuterol. Reproduced by permission from Reference(Box 4–3). PEF = peak expiratory flow; pMDI = pressurized metered-dose inhaler; SABA = short-acting β 2 -agonist.

Arrange immediate transfer to an acute care facility if there are signs of severe exacerbation, or to intensive care, particularly if the patient is drowsy, confused, or has a silent chest. During transfer, give inhaled SABA and ipratropium bromide, controlled oxygen, and systemic corticosteroids.

Repeated administration of albuterol (up to 4–10 puffs every 20 min for the first hour) is effective for rapidly reversing airflow limitation. Avoid nebulization except for life-threatening asthma; delivery of rapid-acting β 2 -agonist via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler and spacer or via a dry-powder inhaler is as effective in patients with moderately severe acute asthma and avoids the risk of disseminating infectious particles. Current evidence does not support the routine use of intravenous β 2 -agonists in patients with severe asthma exacerbations.

### Addition of intravenous beta (2)-agonists to inhaled beta (2)-agonists for acute asthma [^113oU8bQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled beta-agonist therapy is central to the management of acute asthma. This review evaluates the benefit of an additional use of intravenous beta(2)-agonist agents.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of adding intravenous (IV) beta(2)-agonists to inhaled beta(2)-agonist therapy for acute asthma treated in the emergency department.

Search Methods

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group Register which is a compilation of systematic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL as well as handsearching of 20 respiratory journals. Bibliographies from included studies and known reviews were also searched. Primary authors and content experts were contacted to identify eligible studies. The search was performed in September 2012.

Selection Criteria

Only RCTs were considered for inclusion. Studies were included if patients presented to the emergency department with acute asthma and were treated with IV beta(2)-agonists with inhaled beta(2)-agonist therapy and existing standard treatments versus inhaled beta(2)-agonists and existing standard treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and confirmed their findings with corresponding authors of trials. We obtained missing data from authors or calculated from data present in the papers. We used fixed-effect model for odds ratios (OR) and for mean differences (MD) we used both fixed-effect and random-effects models and reported 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

From 109 potentially relevant studies only three (104 patients) met our inclusion criteria: Bogie 2007 (46 children), Browne 1997 (29 children) and Nowak 2010 (29 adults). Bogie 2007 investigated the addition of intravenous terbutaline to high dose nebulised albuterol in children with acute severe asthma, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Browne 1997 investigated the benefit of adding intravenous salbutamol to inhaled salbutamol in children with acute severe asthma in the emergency department. Nowak 2010 investigated addition of IV bedoradrine to standard care (nebulised albuterol, ipratropium and oral corticosteroids) among adults, and was reported as a conference abstract only. There was no significant advantage (OR 0.29; 95%CI 0.06 to 1.38, one trial, 29 adults) for adding IV bedoradrine to standard care (nebulised albuterol, ipratropium and oral corticosteroids) with regard to hospitalisation rates. Various outcome indicators for the length of stay were reported among the trials. Browne 1997 reported a significantly shorter recovery time (in terms of cessation of 30 minute salbutamol) for children in the IV salbutamol with inhaled salbutamol group (four hours) versus the 11.1 hours for the inhaled salbutamol group (P = 0.03). Time to cessation of hourly nebuliser was also significantly shorter (P = 0.02) for the IV plus inhaled salbutamol group (11.5 hours versus 21.2 hours), and they were ready for emergency patient discharge on average 9.7 hours earlier than the inhaled salbutamol group (P < 0.05). In a paediatric ICU study Bogie 2007 reported no significant advantage in length of paediatric ICU admission (hours) for adding IV terbutaline to nebulised albuterol (MD -12.95, 95% CI: -38.74, 12.84). Browne 1997 reported there were only six out of 14 children with a pulmonary index score above six in the IV plus inhaled salbutamol group at two hours compared with 14 of the 15 in the inhaled salbutamol group (P = 0.02)In Browne 1997 there was a higher proportion of tremor in the IV plus inhaled salbutamol group than in the inhaled salbutamol group (P < 0.02). Nowak 2010 did not report any statistically significant adverse effects associated with adding IV bedoradrine to standard care (nebulised albuterol, ipratropium and oral corticosteroids). Troponin levels were elevated in three children in the IV terbutaline + nebulised albuterol group at 12 and 24 hours in Bogie 2007

Authors' Conclusions

There is very limited evidence from one study (Browne 1997) to support the use of IV beta(2)-agonists in children with severe acute asthma with respect to shorter recovery time, and similarly there is limited evidence (again from one study Browne 1997) suggesting benefit with regard to pulmonary index scores; however this advantage needs to be considered carefully in relation to the increased side effects associated with IV beta(2)-agonists. We identified no significant benefits for adults with severe acute asthma. Until more, adequately powered, high quality clinical trials in this area are conducted it is not possible to form a robust evaluation of the addition of IV beta(2)-agonists in children or adults with severe acute asthma.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^115U2zH5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma management — Recommendation 11 (short-term increase in inhaled corticosteroid [ICS] dose) states that in individuals aged 4 years and older with mild to moderate persistent asthma who are likely to adhere to daily ICS treatment, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends against a short-term increase in the ICS dose for increased symptoms or decreased peak flow, with a conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence. A short-term increase is defined as a doubling, quadrupling, or quintupling of the regular daily dose, and the Expert Panel does not recommend doubling, quadrupling, or quintupling the ICS dose for increased symptoms or decreased peak flow; however, clinicians can consider quadrupling the regular daily dose for individuals aged 16 years and older whose adherence to daily therapy is not assured. Evidence includes pediatric data showing that in children aged 4 to 11 years, temporarily increasing the ICS dose did not significantly reduce exacerbations or improve quality of life, and in one 48-week study the growth rate in the intervention group was reduced without statistical significance (P = 0.06). In individuals aged 12 years and older, the intervention as implemented did not significantly reduce exacerbations or asthma hospitalizations; although a large study reported a modest but significant reduction in time to severe exacerbation and systemic corticosteroid use with a quadrupling action plan, baseline adherence was low, with only 50% in the quadruple-dose group and 42% in the non–quadruple-dose group having good adherence. Based on the lack of efficacy in the studies and possible growth effects, the Expert Panel made a recommendation against a short-term increase in the ICS dose.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^11489SRU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

New approaches to using approved medications for treatment of mild pediatric asthma — several inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-based strategies are endorsed by the NAEPP guideline and GINA statement, and low-dose ICS is effective in controlling symptoms in children; in the 5- to 44-year age group, ICS reduced hospitalization risk by 31% in those who used at least one canister of ICS during each of the four quarters of the year, there was a progressive decline in mortality risk with increasing ICS use with a decrease of more than 50% with the use of more than six ICS canisters annually, low-dose ICS reduced the risk of a serious exacerbation (admission, emergency treatment, or death) by 41%, and severe exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids were reduced by 0.48 in children and adults with 0 or 1 symptom day per week alongside higher prebronchodilator lung function and more symptom-free days.

### Regular treatment with salmeterol for chronic asthma: serious adverse events [^113VtSbN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiological evidence has suggested a link between beta-agonists and increases in asthma mortality. There has been much debate about possible causal links for this association, and whether regular (daily) long-acting beta(2)-agonists are safe.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to assess the risk of fatal and non-fatal serious adverse events in trials that randomised patients with chronic asthma to regular salmeterol versus placebo or regular short-acting beta(2)-agonists.

Search Strategy

Trials were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. Web sites of clinical trial registers were checked for unpublished trial data and FDA submissions in relation to salmeterol were also checked. The date of the most recent search was October 2007.

Selection Criteria

Controlled parallel design clinical trials on patients of any age and severity of asthma were included if they randomised patients to treatment with regular salmeterol and were of at least 12 weeks duration. Concomitant use of inhaled corticosteroids was allowed, as long as this was not part of the randomised treatment regimen.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion in the review. Outcome data was extracted by one author and checked by the second author. Unpublished data on mortality and serious adverse events was sought.

Main Results

The review includes 26 trials comparing salmeterol to placebo and 8 trials comparing with salbutamol. These included 62,630 participants with asthma (including 2,380 children). In 6 trials (2,766 patients), no serious adverse event data could be obtained. All cause mortality was higher with regular salmeterol than placebo but the increase was not significant, Odds Ratio 1.33 [95% CI: 0.85, 2.10]. Non-fatal serious adverse events were significantly increased when regular salmeterol was compared with placebo, Odds Ratio 1.14 [95% CI: 1.01, 1.28]. One extra serious adverse event occurred over 28 weeks for every 188 people treated with regular salmeterol [95% CI: 95 to 2606]. There is insufficient evidence to assess whether the risk in children is higher or lower than in adults. No significant increase in fatal or non-fatal serious adverse events was found when regular salmeterol was compared with regular salbutamol. Individual patient data from the SNS study have been combined with the results of the SMART study; in patients who were not taking inhaled corticosteroids, compared to regular salbutamol or placebo, there was a significant increase in risk of asthma-related death with regular salmeterol, Odds Ratio 9.52 [95% CI: 1.24, 73.09]. The confidence interval for patients taking inhaled corticosteroids is too wide to rule out an increase in asthma mortality in this group.

Authors' Conclusions

In comparison with placebo, we have found an increased risk of serious adverse events with regular salmeterol. There is also a clear increase in risk of asthma-related mortality in patients not using inhaled corticosteroids in the two large surveillance studies. Although the increase in asthma-related mortality was smaller in patients taking inhaled corticosteroids at baseline, the confidence interval is wide, so it cannot be concluded that the inhaled corticosteroids abolish the risks of regular salmeterol. The adverse effects of regular salmeterol in children remain uncertain due to the small number of children studied.

### Bronchodilatory effect of inhaled budesonide / formoterol and budesonide / salbutamol in acute asthma: a double-blind, randomized controlled trial [^113i9VNV]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

There are no published studies that have compared budesonide/formoterol with budesonide/salbutamol delivered by metered dose inhaler with spacer in acute exacerbation of asthma in children. Studies in adults comparing rapid bronchodilator response of formoterol and salbutamol suggested comparable results.

A recent study by Bussamra et al. compared formoterol (12 μg) delivered by aerolizer and terbutaline (0.5 mg) delivered by dry powder inhaler (Turbohaler) in mild to moderate acute exacerbation in children and reported similar rapid bronchodilator action. In this study, all children received up to three doses of medications at interval of 20 min till they achieved predefined spirometric parameters. All participants received oral steroids. They concluded that both drugs had similar clinical and spirometric improvement, variations in FEV1 of 19.5% and 15.3% were observed in the formoterol and terbutaline groups, respectively. Rodriguez et al. compared formoterol and salbutamol in 50 children aged 5 to 12 years with acute asthma exacerbations of any severity. Children received either single dose of 25 μg formoterol fumarate by nebuliser or 3 doses of Salbutamol (Albuterol) every twenty minutes for one hour by nebuliser. Symptoms score, oxygen saturation and lung function testing recorded before and one hour after commencing treatment showed significant improvement. The results of our study are in concordance with these studies even though we enrolled children with mild exacerbations and used single dose of either medication delivered by MDI and spacer.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^114Hb5jc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

FENO measurement for exacerbation assessment and asthma control: Among children and adults, FENO levels did not correlate with exacerbation severity, and in children in the acute setting FENO testing was difficult to perform, did not correlate with other measures of acute severity, and was poorly reproducible; based on this evidence, the Expert Panel recommends against the use of FENO measurement to assess asthma control, predict future exacerbations, or assess exacerbation severity unless these measurements are used as part of an ongoing asthma monitoring and management strategy as described in Recommendation 2, and further research is needed on its role as a marker for medication adherence and its impact on outcomes, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111K7GSj]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Short-acting inhaled beta2 agonist bronchodilators (SABA) — e.g., salbutamol (albuterol), terbutaline — are administered by pMDI, DPI or, rarely, as solution for nebulization or injection. Inhaled SABAs provide quick relief of asthma symptoms and bronchoconstriction and are used for pre-treatment before exercise; SABAs should be used only as-needed (not regularly) and at the lowest dose and frequency required, and SABA-only treatment is not recommended because of the risk of severe exacerbations and asthma-related death. Currently, inhaled SABAs are the most commonly used bronchodilator for acute exacerbations requiring urgent primary care visit or ED presentation. Adverse effects include tremor and tachycardia with initial use; tolerance develops rapidly with even 1–2 weeks of regular use, with increased airway hyperresponsiveness, reduced bronchodilator effect, and increased airway inflammation. Excess use or poor response indicate poor asthma control and risk of exacerbations, and dispensing of 3 or more 200-dose canisters per year is associated with increased risk of exacerbations, while dispensing of 12 or more canisters per year is associated with markedly increased risk of death.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^1138uS9L]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

New Approaches to Using Approved Medications for Treatment of Mild Pediatric Asthma

There are several ICS-based strategies endorsed by the NAEPP guideline and GINA statement using approved medications in children with mild persistent asthma. Low-dose ICS is effective in controlling symptoms in children with asthma. In the 5- to 44-year age group, ICS reduced hospitalization risk by 31% in those who used at least one canister of ICS during each of the four quarters of the year. Furthermore, there was a progressive decline in mortality risk with increasing ICS use, with a decrease of more than 50% with the use of more than six ICS canisters annually. Low-dose ICS reduced the risk of a serious exacerbation (admission, emergency treatment, or death) by 44%. Severe exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids were reduced by 0.48 in children and adults with 0 or 1 symptom day per week, prebronchodilator lung function was higher, and symptom-free days were more frequent Similar results have been observed in persistent versus intermittent asthma.

In preschool-aged children with intermittent wheezing at high risk to develop asthma, the use of daily ICS and intermittent high-dose ICS was associated with decreased symptoms and exacerbations. Moreover, preschool-aged children with mild persistent asthma with markers of T2 inflammation, such as aeroallergen sensitization or a blood eosinophil count of > 300 cells/μl, showed a differential response favoring daily ICS compared with LTRAs or ICS taken whenever albuterol was used for symptoms.

In adolescents aged 12–17 years with mild asthma, as-needed budesonide–formoterol was superior to as-needed terbutaline for severe exacerbation reduction, with similar efficacy to budesonide maintenance. Adherence to controller medication is key to asthma control, and the as-needed controller approach may improve adherence when it is most needed, during a period of increased symptoms.

### Randomised trial of once-daily vilanterol in children with asthma on inhaled corticosteroid therapy [^111dx8uM]. Respiratory Research (2016). Low credibility.

Participants

Children eligible for inclusion were males and pre-menarchial females with inadequately controlled asthma, ages 5–11 years, with at least a 6-month history of asthma and who had been receiving a stable dose of a ICS (total daily dose of FP 200–250 μg or equivalent) and rescue short-acting inhaled beta-agonist (SABA) for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. Eligible children had a pre-bronchodilator peak expiratory flow (PEF) of 50−90% of their best post-bronchodilator value. Excluded children had: a history of life-threatening asthma; a change in asthma medication within 4 weeks of screening; an asthma exacerbation (defined as either requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids for ≥ 3 days, a depot corticosteroid injection within 3 months prior to screening, or hospitalisation for asthma within 6 months prior to screening); or a concurrent respiratory disease or any other clinically significant medical condition.

At the end of the run-in period, children eligible for randomisation had a pre-bronchodilator PEF of 50−90% of their best post-bronchodilator value, had demonstrated symptoms of asthma and/or daily use of albuterol/salbutamol on ≥ 3 of the last 7 consecutive days of the run-in period, complied with the run-in medication on ≥ 4 of the last 7 consecutive days of the run-in period and had completed all questions on the Daily Diary on ≥ 4 out of the 7 days during the screening period. Children could not have experienced an asthma exacerbation between screening and randomisation.

The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the relevant ethics committee or institutional review board at each investigational centre. Written informed consent was obtained from two parents/legal guardians. If applicable, the child had to be able and willing to give assent to take part in the study according to the local requirements. The investigator was accountable for determining a child's capacity to assent.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111DJ5mc]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for asthma, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (stepwise management), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to use the following track as the preferred stepwise approach to the management of asthma in pediatric patients aged 6–11 years, with as-needed short-acting β-agonist or low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever in Steps 3 and 4:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Step 1. Symptoms ≤ 1–2 days per week|- Offer low-dose ICS whenever short-acting β-agonist is taken <br/> -, in separate inhalers or in combination if available|
|Step 2. Symptoms 2–5 days per week|- Offer low-dose ICS plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist <br/> -; consider offering ICS whenever short-acting β-agonist is taken, in combination or separate inhalers, <br/> - or daily leukotriene receptor antagonist as non-preferred options; consider the probability of adherence to maintenance treatment if reliever is short-acting β-agonist|
|Step 3. Symptoms on most days of the week or waking due to asthma ≥ 1 per week|- Offer low-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist <br/> - Offer medium-dose ICS plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist <br/> -; offer very low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy <br/> -; consider offering daily low-dose ICS or leukotriene receptor antagonist, plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist as a non-preferred option|
|Step 4. Symptoms daily, waking at night ≥ 1 per week, low lung function|- Offer medium-dose maintenance ICS-LABA plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist <br/> - Offer low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy <br/> - Consider referring for expert advice|
|Step 5.|- Refer for phenotypic assessment <br/> - Offer higher-dose ICS-LABA <br/> - Offer add-on therapy, such as anti-IgE, anti-interleukin 4 receptor, or anti-interleukin 5 therapy|
|Initial presentation with exacerbation|- Treat as for exacerbation, including a short course of oral corticosteroids if severe <br/> - Offer Step 3 or 4 treatment, and arrange follow-up|

### Management of asthma in children… [^111zjRmt]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

2 agonists rapidly relax bronchial smooth muscle and are the therapy of choice to relieve acute symptoms and prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm. Beta 2 agonists relieve symptoms but do not affect the underlying disease. These agents have a good safety record but are subject to overuse because they provide rapid relief and have a short duration of effect. Overuse reduces their efficacy and has been associated with increased bronchial hyper-reactivity, central nervous system overstimulation, worsening asthma and death. 26 The FDA recently approved budesonide inhalation suspension, the only nebulizable corticosteroid for children one to eight years. It is available in unit doses of 0. 25 mg and
0. 50 mg for once- or twice-daily dosing. Nonetheless, the improper use of inhaled corticosteroids does raise some concerns.

Long-term use at high doses may inhibit growth velocity; therefore, children's growth should be monitored regularly, and the dosage should not exceed the recommended level unless other options, such as the addition of an antileukotriene agent or a long-acting beta. 26 They are not a substitute for anti-inflammatory medications and should not be used to treat patients with acute symptoms or exacerbations. The FDA approved a long-acting beta 2 agonist, salmeterol, for treatment of asthma in children 12 years and older. It may provide 24-hour bronchodilation with twice-daily dosing and may reduce nocturnal asthma symptoms and prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm. Cromolyn sodium and nedocromil are first-line, daily anti-inflammatory inhaled agents that inhibit early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction, with virtually no serious side effects and no known drug interactions.

26 These medications are available in MDI and nebulizer formulations; however, frequent administration is required, which may discourage compliance. 24 Furthermore, these agents are less effective than corticosteroids in many patients. Nedocromil's bitter taste may discourage compliance in some children. 29 Montelukast is available for the treatment of children with asthma who are six to 14 years of age, at a dosage of 5 mg once daily at bedtime. A 10-mg tablet is approved for use in children older than 15 years, 30 and the FDA recently approved a 4- or 5-mg chewable tablet for children two to five years.

### Albuterol sulfate syrup, 2 mg / 5 mL Rx only… [^116J6Eiv]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

In controlled clinical trials in patients with asthma, the onset of improvement in pulmonary function, as measured by maximum midexpiratory flow rate and forced expiratory volume in 1 second, was within 30 minutes after a dose of albuterol sulfate syrup, with peak improvement occurring between 2 and 3 hours. In a controlled clinical trial involving 55 children, clinically significant improvement continued to be recorded up to 6 hours. No decrease in the effectiveness was reported in one uncontrolled study of 32 children who took albuterol sulfate syrup for a 3-month period. Albuterol Sulfate Syrup is indicated for the relief of bronchospasm in adults and children 2 years of age and older with reversible obstructive airway disease. Albuterol Sulfate Syrup is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to albuterol or any of its components.

Asthma may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If the patient needs more doses of albuterol sulfate syrup than usual, this may be a marker of destabilization of asthma and requires reevaluation of the patient and treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for anti-inflammatory treatment, e.g., corticosteroids. Albuterol Sulfate Syrup can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, albuterol sulfate syrup should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. The use of beta-adrenergic agonist bronchodilators alone may not be adequate to control asthma in many patients. Early consideration should be given to adding anti-inflammatory agents, e.g., corticosteroids.

Beta-Blockers: Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as albuterol sulfate syrup, but may produce severe bronchospasm in asthmatic patients. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, e.g., as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with asthma. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.
