## Question

Memory problems with effexor

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Effexor (venlafaxine) causes memory problems, how common they are, what mechanisms might explain them, and what to do clinically if they occur. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory labeling and how "memory impairment" is categorized. Then, I should verify the clinical trial data on cognitive outcomes with venlafaxine. Next, I will examine dose-related effects and special contexts like hyponatremia and overdose. After that, I should review mechanistic plausibility. Finally, I will synthesize practical clinical recommendations and monitoring steps, making sure I distinguish transient effects from persistent cognitive deficits and account for confounders like depression itself and concomitant medications.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status so I don't jump to conclusions. The FDA labeling lists "memory impairment" as a common adverse reaction for venlafaxine, which means it has been observed in clinical trials at frequencies generally between 1% and 10%, although exact rates vary by study and population, so I should be cautious about overinterpreting a single number here [^115C1isk].

> Wait, let me verify what the large randomized data actually show about cognition. In the iSPOT-D randomized longitudinal study of 1008 adults with MDD, acute treatment with venlafaxine XR, sertraline, or escitalopram for 8 weeks did not improve verbal memory, working memory, or other key cognitive domains, even among those whose depressive symptoms remitted, suggesting that standard antidepressants, including venlafaxine, do not reliably enhance cognition over that short horizon and that cognitive deficits can persist independent of mood response [^1115vCPu]. Hold on, I should also note that a separate 24-week study comparing escitalopram and duloxetine reported greater improvements in episodic and working memory with the SNRI duloxetine than with the SSRI, hinting that SNRIs may have more favorable cognitive effects in some contexts, though this was not a venlafaxine-specific trial and should be interpreted cautiously [^114jVdTa].

> I need to check dose-related effects next. In a tolerability study of high-dose venlafaxine, patients on doses ≥ 375 mg/day reported "failing memory" more frequently and more severely than those on standard doses, with 44.4% endorsing memory complaints in the high-dose group, which supports a dose-dependent signal for subjective memory problems, even though this was a small, open-label study and not powered for definitive cognitive testing [^1111MBzV]. Let me reconsider: this is low-quality evidence, but it aligns with clinical experience that higher noradrenergic tone and higher overall dose can worsen arousal-related cognitive complaints like concentration and recall [^1111MBzV].

> But wait, what if the memory complaint is actually due to hyponatremia rather than a direct cognitive toxicity. Venlafaxine, like other serotonergic antidepressants, can cause SIADH-related hyponatremia, especially in older adults or those on diuretics, and hyponatremia can present with headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness; severe cases can progress to seizures or coma, so I should always consider checking sodium if a patient on venlafaxine reports new or worsening memory problems, particularly with falls, confusion, or weakness [^113HJTki] [^112zduz6].

> I will now examine rare but serious contexts. Overdose with venlafaxine has been associated with prolonged altered consciousness and, in case reports, persistent cognitive deterioration after recovery from coma, although hypoxic encephalopathy cannot be excluded as a contributor; nonetheless, this underscores that severe toxicity can leave lasting cognitive sequelae and warrants careful neurologic follow-up after significant ingestions [^117GD6hh] [^112nmUiu].

> Let me think about mechanisms so I don't over-attribute to a single cause. Direct serotonergic and noradrenergic modulation can acutely affect arousal, attention, and sleep, which indirectly impairs encoding and retrieval; venlafaxine lacks meaningful anticholinergic activity, so anticholinergic cognitive toxicity is less likely than with TCAs, though not impossible at very high exposures or in vulnerable brains. I should also consider that depression itself causes objective cognitive deficits that may persist despite mood remission, complicating attribution of any residual memory complaints to the medication rather than the illness trajectory [^1115vCPu] [^115vJk9N].

> Next, I should review clinical implications and monitoring. If a patient on venlafaxine reports new-onset or worsening memory problems, I should confirm temporal relation to dose changes, screen for hyponatremia with a basic metabolic panel, review concomitant serotonergic and sedating drugs, and assess for other causes such as sleep apnea, thyroid disease, or substance use. If memory complaints emerge after a dose increase, a trial dose reduction may be reasonable; if they persist and are functionally impairing, switching to an alternative antidepressant with a different mechanism or a more favorable cognitive profile can be considered, with vortioxetine being the only agent with an FDA-recognized indication for cognitive impairment in MDD, though replication and real-world generalizability vary [^111n1Zdm].

> Hold on, I should verify counseling points so we set expectations appropriately. Patients should be advised that transient concentration or memory complaints can occur early in treatment or with dose escalation and often improve with time, but persistent or severe problems warrant evaluation; they should not abruptly stop venlafaxine due to discontinuation syndrome risk, and they should report confusion, unsteadiness, or weakness promptly because these could signal hyponatremia or another serious adverse effect [^116YuoiT] [^113HJTki].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. Yes, venlafaxine can cause memory problems: "memory impairment" is a labeled common adverse effect, subjective memory complaints appear more frequent at higher doses, and large prospective data show no short-term cognitive benefit from venlafaxine in MDD, with cognitive deficits often persisting despite symptom remission; rare but serious hyponatremia and overdose-related encephalopathy can also present with memory impairment, so new cognitive symptoms deserve a structured workup rather than reflexively attributing them to depression alone [^115C1isk] [^1111MBzV] [^1115vCPu] [^113HJTki] [^117GD6hh].

Effexor (venlafaxine) can cause **memory impairment** [^115C1isk] as a common side effect, typically presenting as forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating, or mental fog [^1111MBzV]. This is usually mild and transient, often improving with dose adjustment or after the first few weeks of treatment [^116FuoVg]. Rarely, **severe cognitive effects** may occur, especially with high doses, in older adults, or with hyponatremia [^113HJTki] [^1111MBzV]. If memory problems persist or worsen, discuss with your clinician; strategies include dose reduction, switching antidepressants, or adding cognitive-enhancing therapies [^111n1Zdm].

---

## Prevalence and clinical significance

- **Common side effect**: Memory impairment is listed as a common adverse reaction in clinical trials and postmarketing reports [^115C1isk].

- **Typical presentation**: Patients often report forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating, or mental fog [^1111MBzV].

- **Severity**: Most cases are mild and transient, but some patients experience more persistent or severe cognitive effects [^1111MBzV].

---

## Mechanisms underlying memory impairment

Several mechanisms may explain venlafaxine-associated memory problems:

- **Serotonin and norepinephrine modulation**: Venlafaxine increases serotonin and norepinephrine, which can indirectly affect memory and cognition [^112pibYY].

- **Neurotransmitter interactions**: Altered serotonergic and noradrenergic signaling may disrupt hippocampal function, a key area for memory formation [^112vzcJt].

- **Hyponatremia**: Venlafaxine can cause hyponatremia, especially in older adults, leading to confusion and memory impairment [^113HJTki].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting memory impairment

Multiple studies and case reports document venlafaxine-related memory impairment:

| **Study type** | **Findings** |
|-|-|
| Clinical trials | Memory impairment reported as a common adverse reaction [^115C1isk] |
| Case reports | Severe cognitive deterioration reported after venlafaxine overdose [^117GD6hh] |
| Observational studies | High-dose venlafaxine associated with concentration difficulties and memory complaints [^1111MBzV] |

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing memory impairment

Certain factors increase susceptibility to memory impairment with venlafaxine:

- **Age**: Older adults are more likely to experience cognitive side effects, including memory impairment [^113HJTki].

- **Dose**: Higher doses are associated with increased risk of cognitive side effects [^1111MBzV].

- **Comorbidities**: Hyponatremia, renal impairment, and hepatic impairment increase risk [^113HJTki].

- **Genetic factors**: Genetic variations may influence drug metabolism and susceptibility to side effects [^115NqYev].

---

## Clinical management strategies

When patients report memory impairment while taking venlafaxine, clinicians may consider the following strategies:

- **Dose adjustment**: Lowering the dose may reduce cognitive side effects [^1111MBzV].

- **Medication switch**: Switching to another antidepressant with a different mechanism of action may help [^111n1Zdm].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor cognitive function, especially in older adults or those on high doses [^notfound].

- **Patient education**: Educate patients about potential cognitive side effects and encourage reporting of symptoms [^116YuoiT].

---

## Long-term cognitive effects

Limited evidence suggests that long-term venlafaxine use may be associated with persistent cognitive impairment in some patients, although many experience improvement or resolution of symptoms after discontinuation or dose reduction. Long-term effects remain **incompletely understood** and warrant further research [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other antidepressants

Venlafaxine's memory-related side effects are **generally comparable** to those of other antidepressants, particularly SSRIs and SNRIs [^117CtYay]. Some studies suggest that venlafaxine may have a slightly higher risk of cognitive side effects than certain SSRIs, but overall differences are modest [^notfound].

---

## Patient-reported experiences

Many patients report memory impairment while taking venlafaxine, describing symptoms such as forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating, and mental fog. These experiences are **consistent with clinical trial data** and underscore the importance of monitoring and managing cognitive side effects [^1111MBzV].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the need for **careful monitoring** of cognitive function in patients taking venlafaxine, particularly in older adults or those on higher doses. Clinicians should educate patients about potential cognitive side effects and adjust treatment as necessary [^114EXpPH].

---

Effexor (venlafaxine) can cause **memory impairment**, typically mild and transient, but sometimes persistent or severe. Management includes dose adjustment, switching medications, and regular monitoring.

5.9	Hyponatremia

Hyponatremia can occur as a result of treatment with SNRIs, including Effexor XR. In many cases, the hyponatremia appears to be the result of the Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH) secretion. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SNRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics, or those who are otherwise volume-depleted, may be at greater risk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Consider discontinuation of Effexor XR in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, and institute appropriate medical intervention.

Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.

Adverse Reactions Reported as Reasons for Discontinuation of Treatment

Combined across short-term, placebo-controlled premarketing studies for all indications, 12% of the 3,558 patients who received Effexor XR (37.5–225 mg) discontinued treatment due to an adverse experience, compared with 4% of the 2,197 placebo-treated patients in those studies.

The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in ≥ 1% of the Effexor XR treated patients in the short-term studies (up to 12 weeks) across indications are shown in Table 7.

Common Adverse Reactions in Placebo-controlled Studies

The number of patients receiving multiple doses of Effexor XR during the premarketing assessment for each approved indication is shown in Table 8. The conditions and duration of exposure to venlafaxine in all development programs varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) open and double-blind studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient (Effexor only) and outpatient studies, fixed-dose, and titration studies.

The incidences of common adverse reactions (those that occurred in ≥ 2% of Effexor XR treated patients [357 MDD patients, 1,381 GAD patients, 819 SAD patients, and 1,001 PD patients] and more frequently than placebo) in Effexor XR treated patients in short-term, placebo-controlled, fixed- and flexible-dose clinical studies (doses 37.5 to 225 mg per day) are shown in Table 9.

The adverse reaction profile did not differ substantially between the different patient populations.

8.5 Geriatric Use

The percentage of patients in clinical studies for Effexor XR for MDD, GAD, SAD, and PD who were 65 years of age or older are shown in Table 16.

No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience generally has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients. However, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. SSRIs and SNRIs, including Effexor XR, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

The pharmacokinetics of venlafaxine and ODV are not substantially altered in the elderly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] (see Figure 1). No dose adjustment is recommended for the elderly on the basis of age alone, although other clinical circumstances, some of which may be more common in the elderly, such as renal or hepatic impairment, may warrant a dose reduction [see Dosage and Administration (2.8, 2.9)].

8.6	Hepatic Impairment

Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B), or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment or hepatic cirrhosis [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7	Renal Impairment

Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild (CLcr = 60–89 mL/min), moderate (CLcr = 30–59 mL/min), or severe (CLcr < 30 mL/min) renal impairment, and in patients undergoing hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Venlafaxine hydrochloride (Effexor) [^1169AGzx]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

In a longer-term study, adult outpatients with MDD who had responded during an 8-week open-label study on Effexor XR (75, 150, or 225 mg, once daily every morning) were randomized to continuation of their same Effexor XR dose or to placebo, for up to 26 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the open-label phase was defined as a CGI Severity of Illness item score of ≤ 3 and a HAM-D-21 total score of ≤ 10 at the day 56 evaluation. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as follows: (1) a reappearance of major depressive disorder as defined by DSM-IV criteria and a CGI Severity of Illness item score of ≥ 4 (moderately ill), (2) 2 consecutive CGI Severity of Illness item scores of ≥ 4, or (3) a final CGI Severity of Illness item score of ≥ 4 for any patient who withdrew from the study for any reason. Patients receiving continued Effexor XR treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 26 weeks compared with those receiving placebo (study 4).

In a second longer term trial, adult outpatients with MDD, recurrent type, who had responded (HAM-D-21 total score ≤ 12 at the day 56 evaluation) and continued to be improved [defined as the following criteria being met for days 56 through 180: (1) no HAM-D-21 total score ≥ 20; (2) no more than 2 HAM-D-21 total scores > 10, and (3) no single CGI Severity of Illness item score ≥ 4 (moderately ill)] during an initial 26 weeks of treatment on Effexor [100 to 200 mg per day, on a twice daily schedule] were randomized to continuation of their same Effexor dose or to placebo. The follow-up period to observe patients for relapse, defined as a CGI Severity of Illness item score ≥ 4, was for up to 52 weeks. Patients receiving continued Effexor treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 52 weeks compared with those receiving placebo (study 5).

2.5	Panic Disorder

The recommended starting dose is 37.5 mg per day of Effexor XR for 7 days. Patients not responding to 75 mg per day may benefit from dose increases to a maximum of approximately 225 mg per day. Dose increases should be in increments of up to 75 mg per day, as needed, and should be made at intervals of not less than 7 days.

2.6	Screen for Bipolar Disorder Prior to Starting Effexor XR

Prior to initiating treatment with Effexor XR, screen patients for a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

2.7	Switching Patients from Effexor Tablets

Patients with depression who are currently being treated with Effexor may be switched to Effexor XR at the nearest equivalent dose (mg per day), e.g., 37.5 mg venlafaxine twice a day to 75 mg Effexor XR once daily. However, individual dosage adjustments may be necessary.

2.8	Dosage Recommendations for Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Reduce the Effexor XR total daily dose by 50% in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) to moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. Reduce the total daily dose by 50% or more in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) or hepatic cirrhosis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.9	Dosage Recommendations for Patients with Renal Impairment

Reduce the Effexor XR total daily dose by 25% to 50% in patients with mild (CLcr 60–89 mL/min) or moderate (CLcr 30–59 mL/min) renal impairment. Reduce the total daily dose by 50% or more in patients undergoing hemodialysis or with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min). Because there was much individual variability in clearance between patients with renal impairment, individualization of dosage is recommended in some patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

5.2	Serotonin Syndrome

Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), including Effexor XR, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, meperidine, methadone, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e. MAOIs [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone.

Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).

The concomitant use of Effexor XR with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate Effexor XR in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking Effexor XR, discontinue Effexor XR before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Monitor all patients taking Effexor XR for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with Effexor XR and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of Effexor XR with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.

### Effect of antidepressant treatment on cognitive impairments associated with depression: a randomised longitudinal study [^1115vCPu]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Antidepressant treatment failure is a common problem worldwide. In this study, we assess whether or not an important aspect of depression, cognitive impairment, is untreated by antidepressants by studying the effect of acute antidepressant treatment on a range of cognitive domains.

Methods

In this randomised longitudinal study, which is part of the International Study to Predict Optimized Treatment in Depression (iSPOT-D) trial, we assessed the effects of acute antidepressant treatment in a large patient population, across clinical remission outcomes, on a range of cognitive domains: attention, response inhibition, executive function during visuospatial navigation, cognitive flexibility, verbal memory, working memory, decision speed, information processing speed, and psychomotor response speed. We enrolled patients from primary or specialty care clinics in a multicentre, international, open-label, randomised, prospective trial. Eligible patients (aged 18–65 years) were previously untreated or were willing to undergo a 1-week medication washout before the study start, and could not have had inadequate response to study medications in the past. We enrolled a large population of medication-free (ie, untreated) outpatients in a depressive episode and assessed them for cognitive function at enrolment (pre-treatment), and again after 8 weeks of treatment with one of three antidepressant drugs (escitalopram, sertraline, or venlafaxine extended-release). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of the three antidepressants using a blocked randomisation procedure (block size of 12). As a comparison group, we also simultaneously enrolled matched healthy participants. Healthy participants received no medication or intervention, but were assessed for change in cognitive and clinical measures during the same interval and testing protocol. Therefore, this group acts as a test-retest control for the primary outcome measure examined in this study, change in cognitive measures over 8 weeks of treatment in depressed patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00693849.

Findings

Between Dec 8, 2008, and Sept 30, 2011, we enrolled 1008 eligible people into the study. Impairment in five domains-attention, response inhibition, verbal memory, decision speed, and information processing-showed no relative improvement with acute treatment (controlling for time or repeated testing), irrespective of antidepressant treatment group, even in patients whose depression remitted acutely according to clinical measures. Broader cognitive impairment was associated with greater illness chronicity (earlier illness onset) but not with symptom severity or previous antidepressant failures.

Interpretation

Depression is associated with impairments in higher-order cognitive functions and information processing, which persist independently of clinical symptom change with treatment. We recorded no difference between the three antidepressants tested, with none showing efficacy for these impairments. Although the 8-week treatment period limits interpretation to acute treatment effects, it does highlight cognitive impairment as an untargeted contributor to incomplete treatment success.

### Tolerability of high-dose venlafaxine in depressed patients [^1111MBzV]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2004). Low credibility.

High doses of antidepressants are often used for treatment-resistant depression. Venlafaxine, a dual serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, has been shown to have a tolerable side-effect profile in previous studies using doses of up to 375 mg/day. We investigated the tolerability of higher than currently recommended doses of venlafaxine using the UKU side-effect rating scale. Seventy outpatients fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder were recruited into two demographically matched groups according to their daily dosage of venlafaxine: high dose n = 35 (≥ 375 mg/day, range 375–600 mg, average 437 mg/day) or standard dose n = 35 (< 375 mg/day, range 75–300 mg, average 195 mg/day. Clinical characteristics were noted and the UKU side-effect rating scale was administered to a subsample of patients. The most frequently reported complaints in both groups were increased fatigue (48%), concentration difficulties (48%), sleepiness/sedation (37%), failing memory (44.4%) and weight gain (29.6%). Apart from weight gain, the complaints were found to be experienced significantly more severely by the high-dose group. Six patients discontinued venlafaxine due to intolerable side-effects but only two of these patients were on a high dose. There was a tendency for mildly raised blood pressure in 10% of patients on an average dose of 342 mg/day. However, no difference between the two groups was found. This preliminary open study demonstrates that venlafaxine is tolerated at higher than British National Formulary recommended doses (i.e. up to 600 mg daily). However, increased frequency and severity of reported side-effects in the high-dose group are not associated with increased rates of discontinuation.

### Antidepressant response trajectories and associated clinical prognostic factors among older adults [^1127Mw8y]. JAMA Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

More than 50% of older adults with late-life major depressive disorder fail to respond to initial treatment with first-line pharmacological therapy.

Objectives

To assess typical patterns of response to an open-label trial of extended-release venlafaxine hydrochloride (venlafaxine XR) for late-life depression and to evaluate which clinical factors are associated with the identified longitudinal response patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Group-based trajectory modeling was applied to data from a 12-week open-label pharmacological trial conducted in specialty care as part of the Incomplete Response in Late Life: Getting to Remission Study. Clinical prognostic factors, including domain-specific cognitive performance and individual depression symptoms, were examined in relation to response trajectories. Participants included 453 adults aged 60 years or older with current major depressive disorder. The study was conducted between August 2009 and August 2014.

Intervention

Open-label venlafaxine XR (titrated up to 300 mg/d) for 12 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Subgroups exhibiting similar response patterns were derived from repeated measures of overall depression severity obtained using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale.

Results

Among the 453 study participants, 3 subgroups with differing baseline depression severity clearly responded to treatment: one group with the lowest baseline severity had a rapid response (n = 69 [15.23%]), and distinct responses were also apparent among groups starting at moderate (n = 108 [23.84%]) and higher (n = 25 [5.52%]) baseline symptom levels. Three subgroups had nonresponding trajectories: 2 with high baseline symptom levels (totaling 35.98%: high, nonresponse 1, n = 110 [24.28%]; high, nonresponse 2, n = 53 [11.70%]) and 1 with moderate baseline symptom levels (n = 88 [19.43%]). Several factors were independently associated with having a nonresponsive trajectory, including greater baseline depression severity, longer episode duration, less subjective sleep loss, more guilt, and more work/activity impairment (P < .05). Higher delayed memory (list recognition) performance was independently associated with having a rapid response (adjusted odds ratio = 2.22; 95% CI, 1.18–4.20).

Conclusions and Relevance

Based on the observed trajectory patterns, patients who have late-life depression with high baseline depression severity are unlikely to respond after 12 weeks of treatment with venlafaxine XR. However, high baseline depression severity alone may be neither a necessary nor sufficient predictor of treatment nonresponse.

### Cognitive remission: a novel objective for the treatment of major depression? [^112bghYL]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Direct or indirect effects on cognition?

A number of clinical studies have primarily evaluated the effect of conventional antidepressants on cognitive performance in individuals with MDD, although most of these studies have not evaluated cognitive function as a primary outcome. In addition, the lack of a placebo control and proper statistical control for the effects of clinical severity (i.e. through path analysis) may contribute to inconsistencies across findings. Nevertheless, conventional antidepressants are generally associated with a beneficial effect on cognitive impairment in individuals with MDD, which may be mediated at least in part by improvement in affective symptoms. For example, it was reported that SSRI treatment led to a significant improvement in memory performance (i.e. immediate and delayed verbal, immediate visual, and declarative memory) in individuals with MDD. Moreover, two studies showed that treatment with sertraline is associated with significant improvements in psychomotor speed and executive functions. On the other hand, other findings indicated that sertraline, citalopram, or paroxetine administration, were not associated with significant changes in cognitive performance in a cohort of elderly patients with major depression, whereas a beneficial effect was observed in patients with minor depression, regardless of changes in the severity of depressive symptoms and concomitant benzodiazepine or psychotropic drug use.

In a recent 8-week, double-blind, comparative randomized controlled trial (RCT) of SSRIs (escitalopram) and bupropion on adults with MDD (n = 36), both treatments were significantly associated with improved immediate as well as delayed verbal and non-verbal memory, global function, and measures of work productivity. Moreover, no significant between-group differences were observed in this study, in contrast to data obtained from a cross-sectional naturalistic study that reported a superior effect of bupropion over SSRIs or venlafaxine on cognitive function. However, whereas in this study the SSRI group (n = 27) performed significantly worse than healthy controls in tests of psychomotor and processing speed and cognitive flexibility, and the venlafaxine group performed worse than controls in measures of processing speed, the bupropion group (n = 27) did not differ from healthy controls in any cognitive measure; this aspect limits the generalizability of these findings.

### Serum level of venlafaxine is associated with better memory in psychotic disorders [^115sLnvy]. Schizophrenia Research (2015). Low credibility.

Cognitive impairment is a core feature of psychosis spectrum disorders. Antipsychotics have at best small positive effects on cognitive performance. There is a lack of knowledge regarding the effects of antidepressants on cognitive functioning in these disorders. In the present study cognitive performance was investigated in relation to serum levels of antidepressants in persons with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Serum concentrations of escitalopram, citalopram and venlafaxine plus O-desmethylvenlafaxine were measured in a total of 187 participants with bipolar disorder (N = 74) or schizophrenia spectrum disorders (N = 113), and analyzed in relation to neuropsychological tests performance of verbal learning, verbal memory, attention, working memory, executive functioning and processing speed. Analyses were performed using linear regression adjusting for a range of confounders. There was a significant positive association between the serum level of venlafaxine plus O-desmethylvenlafaxine and verbal memory (immediate recall: Logical Memory Test immediate recall [p = 0.015], and long term delayed recall: Logical Memory Test delayed recall [p = 0.011]). No significant associations were seen between citalopram or escitalopram and verbal memory. There were no significant associations between the tested antidepressants and verbal learning, attention, working memory, executive functioning, or processing speed. Venlafaxine seem to be associated with better verbal memory in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This suggests a possible beneficial role of certain antidepressants on cognitive dysfunction, which may have clinical implications and provide insight into underlying pathophysiology. However, the current findings should be replicated in independent samples.

### Atomoxetine enhances a short-term model of plasticity in humans [^116mQYcN]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the role of 2 noradrenergic drugs in modulating use-dependent plasticity in humans.

Design

Double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled crossover design.

Setting

A laboratory in a hospital.

Participants

A convenience sample of 10 healthy subjects.

Intervention

An established paradigm that measures motor memory as a short-term model of use-dependent plasticity. Subjects attended 3 sessions, separated by at least 1 week to allow drug washout. Subjects received atomoxetine (Strattera), venlafaxine (Effexor), or placebo.

Main Outcome Measure

Increase in the proportion of movements into the training target zone (TTZ), an indicator of enhanced plasticity.

Results

Atomoxetine, but not venlafaxine, significantly increased movements into the TTZ.

Conclusions

These results support a role for norepinephrine in enhancing cortical plasticity and suggest potential benefits in using these drugs for improving motor recovery after stroke.

2. Depression and other serious mental illnesses are the most important causes of suicidal thoughts and actions. Some people may have a particularly high risk of having suicidal thoughts or actions. These include people who have (or have a family history of) bipolar illness (also called manic-depressive illness) or suicidal thoughts or actions.

3. How can I watch for and try to prevent suicidal thoughts and actions in myself or a family member?

Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is very important when an antidepressant medicine is started or when the dose is changed.
Call the healthcare provider right away to report new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings.
Keep all follow-up visits with the healthcare provider as scheduled. Call the healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you have concerns about symptoms.

Call a healthcare provider right away if you or your family member has any of the following symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you:

What else do I need to know about antidepressant medicines?

Never stop an antidepressant medicine without first talking to a healthcare provider.

Stopping an antidepressant medicine suddenly can cause other symptoms.

Visual Problems. Only some people are at risk for these problems. You may want to undergo an eye examination to see if you are at risk and receive preventative treatment if you are.
Antidepressants are medicines used to treat depression and other illnesses. It is important to discuss all the risks of treating depression and also the risks of not treating it. Patients and their families or other caregivers should discuss all treatment choices with the healthcare provider, not just the use of antidepressants.
Antidepressant medicines have other side effects. Talk to the healthcare provider about the side effects of the medicine prescribed for you or your family member.
Antidepressant medicines can interact with other medicines. Know all of the medicines that you or your family member takes. Keep a list of all medicines to show the healthcare provider. Do not start new medicines without first checking with your healthcare provider.

### Cognitive deterioration after venlafaxine overdose [^117GD6hh]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Venlafaxine is an antidepressant whose adverse event profile is similar to that of the SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Serious complications due to venlafaxine overdose have been described. These generally have been resolved with supportive measures alone. However, although patients usually recover even after massive intake of the drug, death may occur in rare cases.

Objective

This article reports a case of dementia after an overdose of venlafaxine.

Case Report

We present a case of severe cognitive deterioration in a 48-year-old woman after venlafaxine overdose in a suicide attempt. She became comatose after the overdose. On recovery from the coma, she suffered irreversible motor and cognitive alterations and seizures. Several factors could justify the possible association of these side effects with venlafaxine overdose: time relationship, severe focal deficit and other neurological signs, symptomatic fluctuation, relationship of serotonin networks with the cognitive functions and deficits related to the network damage, and the potential capacity of venlafaxine to damage the central nervous system. However, other alternatives, especially factors that could implicate a hypoxic encephalopathy as the origin of the dementia, cannot be entirely ruled out.

Conclusion

Venlafaxine seems to have special toxicity vis-à-vis the SSRIs, and this case adds to the literature supporting this. Cognitive function should be monitored after an overdose with venlafaxine.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with Venlafaxine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and Other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for Venlafaxine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking Venlafaxine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets.

17.1	Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.

17.2	Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance

Clinical studies were performed to examine the effects of venlafaxine on behavioral performance of healthy individuals. The results revealed no clinically significant impairment of psychomotor, cognitive, or complex behavior performance. However, since any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that venlafaxine therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities.

14.2	Generalized Anxiety Disorder

The efficacy of Effexor XR as a treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) was established in two 8-week, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose studies (75 to 225 mg per day), one 6-month, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose study (75 to 225 mg per day), and one 6-month, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study (37.5, 75, and 150 mg per day) in adult outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for GAD.

In one 8-week study, Effexor XR demonstrated superiority over placebo for the 75, 150, and 225 mg per day doses as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score, both the HAM-A anxiety and tension items, and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale. However, the 75 and 150 mg per day doses were not as consistently effective as the highest dose (study 1). A second 8-week study evaluating doses of 75 and 150 mg per day and placebo showed that both doses were more effective than placebo on some of these same outcomes; however, the 75 mg per day dose was more consistently effective than the 150 mg per day dose (study 2). A dose-response relationship for effectiveness in GAD was not clearly established in the 75 to 225 mg per day dose range studied.

Two 6-month studies, one evaluating Effexor XR doses of 37.5, 75, and 150 mg per day (study 3) and the other evaluating Effexor XR doses of 75 to 225 mg per day (study 4), showed that daily doses of 75 mg or higher were more effective than placebo on the HAM-A total, both the HAM-A anxiety and tension items, and the CGI scale during 6 months of treatment. While there was also evidence for superiority over placebo for the 37.5 mg per day dose, this dose was not as consistently effective as the higher doses.

Examination of gender subsets of the population studied did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of gender.

### The effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on memory functioning in older adults: a systematic literature review [^116APULX]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methodologic considerations

The strength of this systematic review is the inclusion of studies using study designs of sufficient quality with a broad range of study populations. Nevertheless, there are a number of limitations that needs to be mentioned. The present findings must be interpreted with caution, because there is always a risk of publication bias. Some studies included a small number of patients, which can lead to low statistical power and failure to identify an effect of SSRI treatment (Type II error). There did not seem to be a difference in reported results between studies with small populations versus large populations. Also, the studies used different outcome measures to test memory performance, making direct comparisons of findings difficult. Some tests may be more sensitive for change after treatment with an SSRI. There was heterogeneity in study population and intervention (type of SSRI). Therefore, we also reported the results both for the total study population and per subgroups.

In conclusion, the current systematic review showed that SSRIs do not impair memory performance in older adults and patients. Interestingly, some subgroups may even benefit from long-term SSRI treatment on memory performance. For refining these subgroups, further research is recommended. A randomized placebo-controlled cross-over design in older adults with and without neuropsychiatric vulnerability could be recommended. Long-term effects, possible confounding factors, such as depressive complaints, pre-existing cognitive impairment, gender, and variability in type and dose of SSRI, but also clinically relevant outcome measurements such as quality of life should be taken into account.

### Venlafaxine hydrochloride (venlafaxine) [^112nmUiu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In postmarketing experience, overdose with venlafaxine has occurred predominantly in combination with alcohol and/or other drugs. The most commonly reported events in overdosage include tachycardia, changes in level of consciousness (ranging from somnolence to coma), mydriasis, seizures, and vomiting. Electrocardiogram changes (e.g., prolongation of QT interval, bundle branch block, QRS prolongation), ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, rhabdomyolysis, vertigo, liver necrosis, serotonin syndrome, and death have been reported.

Published retrospective studies report that venlafaxine overdosage may be associated with an increased risk of fatal outcomes compared to that observed with SSRI antidepressant products, but lower than that for tricyclic antidepressants. Epidemiological studies have shown that venlafaxine-treated patients have a higher pre-existing burden of suicide risk factors than SSRI-treated patients. The extent to which the finding of an increased risk of fatal outcomes can be attributed to the toxicity of venlafaxine in overdosage as opposed to some characteristic(s) of venlafaxine-treated patients is not clear. Prescriptions for venlafaxine hydrochloride should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

Management of Overdosage

Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any antidepressant.

Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion or in symptomatic patients. Activated charcoal should be administered. Due to the large volume of distribution of this drug, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. No specific antidotes for venlafaxine are known.

In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center for additional information on the treatment of any overdose. Telephone numbers for certified poison control centers are listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR).

Antidepressant dosing in dementia — elderly patients: Low starting doses, small dose increases, and long intervals between increases are advised; citalopram is started at 5–10 mg/day and increased at several-week intervals to a maximum of 40 mg/day, and sertraline may be started at 12.5–25.0 mg/day and increased at 1–2-week intervals up to a maximum dosage of 150–200 mg/day. If initial agents are ineffective, venlafaxine can be started at 25 mg/day (extended release, 37.5 mg/day) and increased at approximately weekly intervals up to a maximum of 375 mg/day in divided doses (extended release, 225 mg/day), and if venlafaxine is prescribed, careful monitoring of blood pressure is indicated. Mirtazapine can be started at 7.5 mg at bedtime and increased by 7.5-mg or 15-mg increments to 45–60 mg at bedtime; lower dosages have been associated with sedation and appetite increase, and less sedation is found in dosages over 15 mg/day. Bupropion should be used in prescribing with caution for patients with liver dysfunction or renal impairment and for patients who develop signs of delirium; it can be started at 37.5 mg once or twice per day (sustained release, 100 mg/day) and increased slowly to a maximum dosage of 300 mg/day in divided doses (sustained release, 300 mg/day), and no more than 150 mg of immediate release bupropion should be given within any 4- hour period because of the risk of seizures. Duloxetine can be started at 20–40 mg/day and increased slowly to a maximum of 60–80 mg/day, typically in divided doses.

- Eye problems (angle closure glaucoma). Many antidepressant medicines, including desvenlafaxine, may cause a certain type of eye problem called angle-closure glaucoma. Call your healthcare provider if you have changes in your vision or eye pain.

- Discontinuation syndrome. Suddenly stopping desvenlafaxine when you take higher doses may cause you to have serious side effects. Your healthcare provider may want to decrease your dose slowly. Symptoms may include the following, some of which can be severe and last for a long time:
Seizures (convulsions).
Low sodium levels in your blood (hyponatremia). Low sodium levels can happen during treatment with desvenlafaxine. Low sodium levels in your blood may be serious and may cause death. Signs and Symptoms of low sodium levels in your blood may include:
headache
difficulty concentrating
memory changes
confusion
weakness and unsteadiness on your feet which can lead to falls

In severe or more sudden cases, signs and symptoms include:

hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not real)
fainting
seizures
coma

Lung problems. Some people who have taken the medicine venlafaxine which is the same kind of medicine as the medicine in desvenlafaxine have had lung problems. Symptoms of lung problems include difficulty breathing, cough, or chest discomfort. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms.
Sexual Problems (dysfunction). Taking serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), including desvenlafaxine, may cause sexual problems.

### The effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on memory functioning in older adults: a systematic literature review [^112DvUEf]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Dementia and other brain diseases

Results in patients with dementia were mostly pointing toward no effect of SSRI use on memory performance, but three studies indicated possible improvement of memory functioning (see). Interestingly, two studies reported impairment of memory functioning associated with SSRI use. Both studies were performed in dementia with frontal dysfunction. This underlying subtype could potentially be more prone to SSRI-associated memory impairment.

In post-stroke patients, reported improvement of global memory, episodic memory, and short-term memory. Two other studies failed to replicate this finding in global memory functioning.

Healthy controls

Five studies assessed the association between SSRI use and memory functioning in healthy older adults (see). The majority reported no association. however, reported an improvement in global memory functioning in older adults who did not have objective cognitive deficits, but did experience subjective cognitive decline. This could represent an early cognitive vulnerability. One study did report an impairment in global memory functioning. Interestingly, this study did only include women which could indicate a gender effect.

### A double-blind, randomized, 26-week study comparing the cognitive and psychomotor effects and efficacy of 75 mg (37.5 mg b. I.D.) venlafaxine and 75 mg (25 mg mane, 50 mg nocte) dothiepin in elderly patients with moderate major depression being treated in general practice [^1138yW2y]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2004). Low credibility.

To investigate the efficacy and cognitive and psychomotor effects of venlafaxine and dothiepin in elderly patients with moderate major depression. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active comparator controlled study was conducted. Eighty-eight patients (aged ≥ 60 years) were enrolled. Each patient received either venlafaxine (immediate release formulation) 37.5 mg twice per day or dothiepin 25 mg mane followed by 50 mg nocte for 26 weeks. Efficacy was assessed with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. A psychometric test battery to assess cognitive function, activities of daily living and sleep consisted of Critical Flicker Fusion (CFF), Short-term Memory — Kim's Game, Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, Milford Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire, and an Accident Scoring Questionnaire. Quality of Life Questionnaires (Short Form 36 and Quality of Life in Depression Scale) were also administered. Venlafaxine significantly (p < 0.05) raised CFF scores compared to baseline but had no effect on any other measure. Dothiepin significantly (p < 0.05) lowered CFF threshold, and increased ratings of both sedation and difficulty in waking. The results showed that venlafaxine at doses of 37.5 mg b.i.d. in elderly depressed patients is free from disruptive effects on cognitive function and psychomotor performance.

### Neuropsychological markers of antidepressant action: a secondary analysis of the ANTLER randomised controlled trial [^113UuAEj]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Despite the substantial body of research demonstrating associations between emotional memory and antidepressant agents, we did not find evidence that discontinuing long-term maintenance antidepressant treatment affected self-referential recall or that self-referential recall was associated with risk of relapse. The effects of antidepressant discontinuation on other forms of emotional processing have not been comprehensively addressed.

### Venlafaxine ER as a treatment for generalized anxiety disorder in older adults: pooled analysis of five randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials [^114U3ZVA]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

Concerns about the safety of benzodiazepines in older adults may have led investigators and clinicians to underestimate the importance of adequately treating generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in later life. To evaluate the safety and efficacy profile of an alternative treatment in older patients, we conducted a secondary analysis of five randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of extended release venlafaxine (venlafaxine ER, Effexor XR) for adult patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of GAD.

Design

The five multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind, prospectively randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials used similar designs to evaluate short-term efficacy after 8 weeks. In addition, two studies evaluated efficacy and safety over 24 weeks under double-blind conditions.

Setting

Outpatients from both primary care and specialty mental healthcare settings were included. Three studies were conducted in the United States and two in Europe.

Participants

Intention-to-treat analyses included 1,839 adult outpatients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of GAD and total scores of ≥ 18 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA). Ten percent of the patients were aged 60 and older and 5.0% were aged 65 and older.

Intervention

Fixed or flexible doses of venlafaxine ER in the dose range of 37.5 to 225 mg/day or matched placebo were used for 8 weeks in all studies and for 24 weeks in two studies.

Measurements

Primary efficacy variables included the HAMA total score and psychic anxiety factor, the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Scale, and the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I). Secondary efficacy variables included the HAMA somatic anxiety factor, the depression subscale of the HAD, CGI-3 severity, the Covi Scale for Anxiety, and the Raskin Scale for Depression.

Results

On the CGI, 66% of older patients (≥ 60 years) responded to venlafaxine ER, compared with 41% for placebo (P < .01 by logistic regression). For younger patients (< 60 years), comparable figures were 67% and 44%, respectively (P < .001). Analysis of variance showed no main effects for age and no age-by-treatment interactions for any of the primary or secondary efficacy outcome measures for either the 8- or 24-week analyses. Within the older adults subgroup, increasing age did not influence responses. In this cohort of GAD patients, higher levels of depression were associated with decreased responses of anxiety symptoms. In older adults, 23% of venlafaxine ER patients discontinued treatment prematurely versus 31% of those who received placebo; comparable figures for younger adult patients were 27% and 28%, respectively. Discontinuations due to adverse events were 15% versus 14% for venlafaxine ER and placebo, respectively, in older adults compared with 15% versus 8%, respectively, for younger adults.

Conclusion

Venlafaxine ER is equally safe and well tolerated by and shows similar efficacy in younger and older patients in the treatment of GAD.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^111SBqcQ]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alternative antidepressants to SSRIs in dementia — alternative agents include but are not limited to venlafaxine, mirtazapine, and bupropion. The serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system but does not induce or inhibit these enzymes and is less likely to interact with other drugs metabolized through the same system; one side effect more commonly seen with venlafaxine than other antidepressants is an elevation in blood pressure, which may be less likely with the sustained release formulation. Duloxetine is commonly used to treat major depression, but clinical experience with its use in geriatric patients with dementia is limited, and there are no published clinical trials to support its use. Mirtazapine can produce sedation and weight gain, especially at low doses, with rare but potentially serious side effects of liver toxicity and neutropenia. Bupropion has been associated with a risk of seizures, especially at high doses, in patients with anorexia or with structural neurological problems. Trazodone has sedative side effects and can be used when insomnia or severe agitation are prominent; at higher doses, significant side effects include postural hypotension and priapism.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Venlafaxine tablets are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder.

The efficacy of venlafaxine tablets in the treatment of major depressive disorder was established in 6-week controlled trials of adult outpatients whose diagnoses corresponded most closely to the DSM-III or DSM-III-R category of major depression and in a 4-week controlled trial of inpatients meeting diagnostic criteria for major depression with melancholia (see CLINICAL TRIALS).

A major depressive episode implies a prominent and relatively persistent depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks); it should include at least 4 of the following 8 symptoms: change in appetite, change in sleep, psychomotor agitation or retardation, loss of interest in usual activities or decrease in sexual drive, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, and a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation.

The efficacy of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended release capsules in maintaining an antidepressant response for up to 26 weeks following 8 weeks of acute treatment was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial. The efficacy of venlafaxine tablets in maintaining an antidepressant response in patients with recurrent depression who had responded and continued to be improved during an initial 26 weeks of treatment and were then followed for a period of up to 52 weeks was demonstrated in a second placebo-controlled trial (see CLINICAL TRIALS). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use venlafaxine tablets/ venlafaxine hydrochloride extended release capsules for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

### The effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on memory functioning in older adults: a systematic literature review [^115pJ2Mb]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over the last decade, the use of antidepressants seems to be rising. A longitudinal study observed that 6.6% of community-dwelling older adults used a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) at 6 years follow-up. In older adults, indications for antidepressant treatment are the same as they are for younger adults, for example, depression and anxiety disorders. It is well known that depression is often associated with memory impairment, both in adults and older adults. Remission of depression can lead to improvement of cognitive functioning, suggesting a relation between depressive symptoms and cognitive functions. However, it has also been described that cognitive recovery can occur independent of depression treatment response. This finding indicates that antidepressant treatment may have a dissociable effect on depressive symptoms and cognition.

Prevalence of cognitive impairment increases with age and is associated with lower quality of life. Therefore, it is relevant to investigate the effect of commonly prescribed medication, such as SSRIs, on cognitive functioning in older adults. It is plausible to assume that SSRIs affect cognitive functions, since serotonin (5-HT) is involved in attention and (working)memory. Studies in older adults are lacking, but previous serotonergic challenge studies have suggested that SSRI administration is associated with acute improvement of long-term memory and positive information processing in healthy adult volunteers. However, other studies have observed no acute effect on cognitive functioning or even suggested impairment of vigilance after sub-chronic treatment.

With aging, changes in 5-HT functioning occur; receptor expression and binding affinity of multiple 5-HT receptors have been shown to decrease in older adults. Impaired 5-HT neurotransmission in aging has been associated with impaired cognitive processes. Based on these changes, it could be hypothesized that SSRI treatment in older adults may have a different effect than in younger adults.

In conclusion, SSRIs are commonly prescribed to older adults, who already seem vulnerable to memory impairment due to age-related serotonergic changes and neurodegeneration. Therefore, it is important to know the possible effects of SSRIs on memory functioning in older adults. Given the limited amount of studies conducted in older adults, there is a need for a broad and general synthesis of the evidence. The aim of this systematic literature review is therefore to summarize all relevant findings on the effects of SSRIs on all aspects of memory function in older adults.

Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.

Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance

Clinical studies were performed to examine the effects of venlafaxine on behavioral performance of healthy individuals. The results revealed no clinically significant impairment of psychomotor, cognitive, or complex behavior performance. However, since any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that venlafaxine hydrochloride therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities.

Angle-Closure Glaucoma

Patients should be advised that taking venlafaxine tablets can cause mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle-closure glaucoma. Pre-existing glaucoma is almost always open-angle glaucoma because angle-closure glaucoma, when diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy. Open-angle glaucoma is not a risk factor for angle closure glaucoma. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible to angle closure, and have a prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible.

Sexual Dysfunction

Advise patients that use of venlafaxine tablets may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider (see WARNINGS).

Pregnancy

Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy.

Nursing

Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they are breast–feeding an infant.

Social Anxiety Disorder: Approximately 17% of the 277 patients who received venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules in placebo-controlled clinical trials for Social Anxiety Disorder discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with 5% of the 274 placebo-treated patients in those studies. Adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation in a least 2% of drug-treated patients were nausea, insomnia, impotence, headache, dizziness, and somnolence.

Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 5% or More

Major Depressive Disorder: Note in particular the following adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of the patients receiving venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules and at a rate at least twice that of the placebo group for all placebo-controlled trials for the major depressive disorder indication (see Table 6): Abnormal ejaculation, gastrointestinal complaints (nausea, dry mouth, and anorexia), CNS complaints (dizziness, somnolence, and abnormal dreams), and sweating.

In the two U.S. placebo-controlled trials, the following additional reactions occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules (n = 192) and at a rate at least twice that of the placebo group: Abnormalities of sexual function (impotence in men, anorgasmia in women, and libido decreased), gastrointestinal complaints (constipation and flatulence), CNS complaints (insomnia, nervousness, and tremor), problems of special senses (abnormal vision), cardiovascular effects (hypertension and vasodilatation), and yawning.

### The role of serotonin in cognitive function: evidence from recent studies and implications for understanding depression [^113So2Ad]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Symptoms of cognitive impairment such as poor concentration, memory loss and difficulty with decision making are prevalent in patients with depression, but currently are not specific targets for treatment. However, patients can continue to demonstrate cognitive impairments even when apparently clinically recovered. Drugs that potentiate serotonin (5-HT) function, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are the mainstay of treatment for depression. Nevertheless, our understanding of the effects of SSRIs and other conventional antidepressant therapy on cognitive function in healthy humans and depressed patients remains limited.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to provide a concise overview for clinicians on the impact of pharmacological manipulation of 5-HT on cognitive function in healthy humans with additional reference to animal models where human data are lacking, particularly regarding specific 5-HT receptor subtype modulation.

Findings

The most consistent observation following manipulation of serotonin levels in humans is that low extracellular 5-HT levels are associated with impaired memory consolidation. Preclinical data show that agonism and antagonism at specific 5-HT receptors can exert effects in animal models of cognition.

Conclusions

Larger, consistently designed studies are needed to understand the roles of 5-HT in cognition in healthy and depressed individuals. Efforts to target specific 5-HT receptors to improve cognitive outcomes are warranted.

### Selective versus multi-transmitter antidepressants: are two mechanisms better than one? [^1134wA7H]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The issue of selectivity versus efficacy has now reappeared as newer agents have emerged that are less selective than the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) but more selective than the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). This article provides a critical examination of the clinical literature concerning what evidence there is for differential efficacy. Two broad areas will be discussed: (1) comparisons of SSRIs to TCAs and (2) comparisons of the SSRIs to a somewhat more selective compound (by comparison to the TCAs), venlafaxine. This review should caution one in accepting claims of superiority of any agent based on purported mechanism of action.

### Association between first-line antidepressant use and risk of dementia in older adults: a retrospective cohort study [^117FxfSj]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

One out of ten older adults aged ≥ 65 years suffers from dementia in the United States (US), and the prevalence dramatically increases with age. The economic burden of dementia is estimated to be high, exceeding $321 billion (not including $272 billion in unpaid caregiving). As such, dementia is among the leading contributors to the global disease burden, which accounts for 4.3% of the number of years lost due to ill health, disability, or early death (i.e. disability-adjusted life years). Furthermore, depression affects approximately 8.4% of US adults, especially those aged 15–49 years. Patients with early-life depression (i.e. onset before the age of 60) have a 2- to 3-fold higher risk of developing dementia, probably through cerebrovascular changes, an increase in glucocorticoids and proinflammatory cytokines, and a decrease in nerve growth factors that lead to hippocampal atrophy and cognitive impairment.

Psychotherapy and antidepressants are considered the mainstay treatments for depression. Psychotherapy refers to talking with psychologists, psychiatrists, or other providers to relieve mental health issues, and thus is sometimes called "talk therapy". Antidepressants are drugs targeting certain neurotransmitters to modulate mood and behavior, of which the mechanism of action differs slightly by classes. Among the antidepressant classes, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI, e.g. fluoxetine) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI, e.g. venlafaxine) are considered first-line pharmacological pharmacotherapy due to fewer side effects compared to others such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs, e.g. amitriptyline).

Although antidepressants are beneficial for managing depressive symptoms, some studies reported the association between antidepressants and risk of dementia. For example, a meta-analysis found an increased long-term risk (follow-up > 1 year) of dementia associated with antidepressant use compared to no use among older adults. Kodesh et al. also suggested that antidepressant use was associated with a more than 3-fold increased risk of dementia compared to nonusers among older adults, probably due to their anticholinergic side effects. However, the findings were inconsistent in other studies. For instance, Eisch et al. suggested that antidepressants may have cognitive benefits owing to their anti-inflammatory and neurogenic properties in addition to reducing depressive symptoms. Jacob et al. also found that the use of antidepressants was associated with a reduced risk of dementia in patients with moderate or severe depression compared to nonusers of antidepressants.

### Cognitive remission: a novel objective for the treatment of major depression? [^115vJk9N]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Cognitive side effects of antidepressant medication

Long-term therapy with certain antidepressants may also be linked to cognitive side effects in adult subjects with MDD. For instance, treatment with antidepressants has been associated with increased cognitive deficits, such as apathy, inattentiveness, forgetfulness, word-finding difficulty, and mental slowing, in depressed individuals reaching partial or full remission (n = 117). Significant impairment of executive functioning (i.e. phonemic fluency) has also been reported following treatment with SSRIs. Accordingly, another cross-sectional study that investigated the effects of different antidepressants on cognitive performance suggested that class-specific side effects may account, at least in part, for the long-lasting cognitive deficits observed in subjects with MDD in remission. The study used the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised and the Stroop Color and Word Test to assess memory and executive function in depressed subjects treated with tricyclic antidepressants (TCA; n = 29), SSRIs/SNRIs (n = 21), or medication free (n = 19), as well as healthy controls (n = 31). Individuals from both antidepressant groups, but not from the medication-free group, showed poorer performance in visual memory with respect to healthy controls. Regarding executive function, only subjects in the TCA group showed worse performance than the controls. This deleterious effect might be explained at least in part by the anticholinergic effects of some TCAs. Despite evidence of cognitive impairment in medication-free individuals with MDD, different domains of global cognition might be negatively affected by class-specific antidepressant side effects. The pathways whereby this effect occurs are opaque; changes in appetite and energy balance may have negative effects on cognition because interference in the metabolism of glucose may lead to insulin resistance, abnormal neurotransmitter turnover, mitochondrial dysfunction, and energy deficits, as well as changes in neural plasticity. Finally, psychotropic agents may have a similar effect on the immune system and, consequently, on cognitive performance.

Cognitive dysfunction as a target for novel treatments

Despite the recent discovery of compounds with potential therapeutic use in MDD-related cognitive dysfunction, there are still few choices available. However, some compounds under preliminary investigation show promising results with respect to their procognitive potential. There is also great research interest in the development or repurposing of various agents as cognitive enhancers for MDD. Herein, we discuss putative treatment options to conventional treatments that deserve future research consideration (Table 1).

### Venlafaxine hydrochloride, extended release [^1129RmUH]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Social Anxiety Disorder: Approximately 17% of the 277 patients who received venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules in placebo-controlled clinical trials for Social Anxiety Disorder discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with 5% of the 274 placebo-treated patients in those studies. Adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation in a least 2% of drug-treated patients were nausea, insomnia, impotence, headache, dizziness, and somnolence.

Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 5% or More

Major Depressive Disorder: Note in particular the following adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of the patients receiving venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules and at a rate at least twice that of the placebo group for all placebo-controlled trials for the major depressive disorder indication (see Table 6): Abnormal ejaculation, gastrointestinal complaints (nausea, dry mouth, and anorexia), CNS complaints (dizziness, somnolence, and abnormal dreams), and sweating.

In the two U.S. placebo-controlled trials, the following additional reactions occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules (n = 192) and at a rate at least twice that of the placebo group: Abnormalities of sexual function (impotence in men, anorgasmia in women, and libido decreased), gastrointestinal complaints (constipation and flatulence), CNS complaints (insomnia, nervousness, and tremor), problems of special senses (abnormal vision), cardiovascular effects (hypertension and vasodilatation), and yawning.

5. Warnings and Precautions

5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled studies of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with MDD and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.

The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled studies in children and adolescents with MDD, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term studies of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled studies in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term studies (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug versus placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.

### Memory loss in a patient treated with fluoxetine [^111MSXKf]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of severe memory loss in an elderly patient after initiation of fluoxetine.

Case Summary

An 87-year-old white woman was started on fluoxetine for depression, and the dose was titrated to 20 mg/d. She developed progressive memory loss over the next 6 weeks for which she ultimately was hospitalized. Other potential causes for her memory loss were ruled out. After fluoxetine was discontinued, the patient's memory improved significantly over the next 2 months. An objective causality assessment indicated a possible relationship between the memory loss and fluoxetine in this patient.

Discussion

Our report documents a case of severe reversible memory deterioration after initiating fluoxetine. Fluoxetine has a favorable adverse effect profile when compared with older classes of antidepressants. Postmarketing studies and isolated case reports, however, suggest that fluoxetine may harm memory in some patients. Some selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) appear to cause memory loss more frequently than others.

Conclusions

Clinicians should be aware of the possible effects of fluoxetine (and possibly other SSRIs) on memory.

Pharmacological agents targeting primary neurotransmission

SSRIs and SNRIs

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the effects of conventional antidepressant treatment (compared with placebo) on cognitive function in MDD have reported modest positive effect sizes, including improvements across domains of psychomotor speed and delayed recall. However, these analyses pool data from a broad range of pharmacological agents, including the multimodal agent vortioxetine and the cholinergic agent donepezil, which may have inflated the effects seen. Indeed, in one meta-analysis, the effect of antidepressant treatment on cognition became non-significant when vortioxetine studies were excluded. Further, these meta-analyses included heterogenous clinical populations (e.g. depression in Parkinson's disease), and many studies did not use standardised cognitive assessment batteries, instead making use of highly variable cognitive tasks which lack specificity for cognitive domain measured.

More direct evidence from a parallel-cohort randomised clinical trial (RCT) showed 8-weeks of standard antidepressant monotherapy with sertraline, venlafaxine, or escitalopram had no effect on cognitive performance in MDD across standardised assessments. This evidence is particularly compelling given the large sample size (n = 1008), prospective design (with both pre- and post-treatment assessments) and healthy volunteer control group (to control for non-specific effects of repeated testing and symptomatic changes). These findings are consistent with accounts from our consultations with individuals with lived experience of depression, who often reported that antidepressants did not improve their cognitive impairment (Box 2).

Measuring the direct cognitive effects of drugs which primarily affect mood symptoms of depression is challenging. As depression remits, self-report (subjective) and objective cognitive impairments may not improve in parallel. Further, as subjective cognitive impairment is a symptom of depression within ICD-10 and DSM-V diagnostic classifications, and is measured on most standardised outcome measures for MDD, its improvement may contribute to indices of treatment response/remission. Antidepressants may also change non-specific factors such as motivation, which may increase effortful performance in cognitive tasks leading to improvements in task performance that do not reflect genuine gains in cognitive functioning – a methodological limitation known as pseudo-specificity. Such effects are infrequently controlled for in investigations of the cognitive effects of antidepressants.

Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs.

14.1 Major Depressive Disorder

The efficacy of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in two placebo-controlled, short-term, flexible-dose studies in adult outpatients meeting DSM-III-R or DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder.

A 12-week study utilizing venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules doses in a range 75 to 150 mg/day (mean dose for completers was 136 mg/day) and an 8-week study utilizing venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules doses in a range 75 to 225 mg/day (mean dose for completers was 177 mg/day) both demonstrated superiority of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules over placebo on the HAM-D total score, HAM-D Depressed Mood Item, the MADRS total score, the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Severity of Illness item, and the CGI Global Improvement item. In both studies, venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules were also significantly better than placebo for certain factors of the HAM-D, including the anxiety/somatization factor, the cognitive disturbance factor, and the retardation factor, as well as for the psychic anxiety score.

A 4-week study of inpatients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder with melancholia utilizing venlafaxine hydrochloride immediate-release tablets in a range of 150 to 375 mg/day (t.i.d. schedule) demonstrated superiority of venlafaxine hydrochloride immediate-release tablets over placebo. The mean dose in completers was 350 mg/day.

### The effect of desvenlafaxine on cognitive functioning in employed outpatients with major depressive disorder: a substudy of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1159Cq3Q]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this substudy was to examine the effect of desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day compared with placebo on cognitive function in employed outpatients with major depressive disorder. A total of 11/55 (20%) study sites in a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial administered cognitive assessments in memory, attention, and executive functioning domains using the cognitive drug research system. Changes from baseline were subjected to analysis of covariance with baseline levels as covariates, using last observation carried forward data. A significant improvement with desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day (n = 52) compared with placebo (n = 29) was observed on the quality of working memory composite measure (0.081 units (0.005, 0.156); P = 0.0365) at last observation carried forward. Improvement from baseline on the speed of working memory composite was significant for desvenlafaxine (-226.6 msec (-316.7, -136.4); P < 0.0001) and for placebo (-133.3 msec (-257.2, -9.4); P = 0.0354); however, the treatment effect was not significant. No significant differences between groups were observed on composite measures for attention. Treatment of depression with desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day may improve aspects of cognitive functioning, including working memory. Clinical Trial Registry No.: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00824291.

Cholinesterase inhibitors

Cholinergic signalling plays a key role in memory processing and cognitive decline. Meta-analyses have demonstrated that cholinergic agents such as citicoline (cholinergic donor for acetylcholine synthesis) administered in neurological populations (e.g. ischemic stroke) facilitate functional and cognitive recovery, although these effects are not always replicated.

Of the cholinesterase inhibitors investigated within the context of depression, donepezil is among the most promising and frequently studied. A two-year placebo-controlled RCT investigating donepezil administered as an adjunct to antidepressants (escitalopram or duloxetine) reported improved global cognition (visuospatial functioning, language processing, executive functioning, delayed memory and processing speed) after one year in older adults with remitted MDD (N = 130); however, these effects did not persist at year two. Similarly, in a pilot placebo-controlled RCT, donepezil administered as an adjunct to open-label antidepressant therapy improved verbal episodic memory in older adults with MDD (N = 12), although there was no effect on executive functioning or attention. In contrast, another placebo-controlled RCT showed that 16-weeks of donepezil administered as an adjunct to citalopram or venlafaxine did not improve cognitive function. These conflicting results may possibly be explained by the measures of cognition used in each study; cognitive improvements were observed following donepezil pharmacotherapy (i.e.) in studies in which batteries of standardised neuropsychological tests not specific to neurological disease were employed (e.g. WAIS-R). In contrast, studies in which no effects were observed (i.e.) used the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, which may not be sufficiently sensitive to changes in cognitive function in depressed patients and healthy volunteers.

### Venlafaxine hydrochloride (venlafaxine) [^116UAqqC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

While there were no efficacy studies focusing specifically on an elderly population, elderly patients were included among the patients studied. Overall, approximately 2/3 of all patients in these trials were women. Exploratory analyses for age and gender effects on outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of age or sex.

In one longer-term study, adult outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder who had responded during an 8-week open trial on venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules (75, 150, or 225 mg, qAM) were randomized to continuation of their same venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsule dose or to placebo, for up to 26 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the open phase was defined as a CGI Severity of Illness item score of ≤ 3 and a HAM-D-21 total score of ≤ 10 at the day 56 evaluation. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as follows: (1) a reappearance of major depressive disorder as defined by DSM-IV criteria and a CGI Severity of Illness item score of ≥ 4 (moderately ill), (2) 2 consecutive CGI Severity of Illness item scores of ≥ 4, or (3) a final CGI Severity of Illness item score of ≥ 4 for any patient who withdrew from the study for any reason. Patients receiving continued venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsule treatment experienced significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 26 weeks compared with those receiving placebo.

### Effect of antidepressants on spatial memory deficit induced by dizocilpine [^112i1bUW]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

Cognitive deficits are a core symptom of schizophrenia. It is controversial whether antidepressants could improve cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia patients. The present study was designed to identify the therapeutic effect of antidepressants on cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. In the present study, adolescent rats were repeatedly exposed to dizocilpine, which can induce cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. Then these rats were treated by six antidepressants (fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, mirtazapine) or vehicle. The rats in the control group were exposed to vehicle during the study. Lastly, all rats' spatial memory (a major part of cognition) was assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM) test, and the density of hippocampal parvalbumin (PV) interneurons was evaluated to explore possible mechanisms underlying spatial memory change in schizophrenia. The results of the present study supported the hypothesis of a therapeutic effect of fluvoxamine and escitalopram on spatial memory deficit induced by dizocilpine. Additionally, the data of the present study suggested that fluvoxamine and escitalopram remitted hippocampal PV interneuron reduction induced by dizocilpine. The neuroprotective effect of fluvoxamine and escitalopram may partly explain the therapeutic effect of antidepressants on spatial memory deficit in schizophrenia patients.

### The effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on memory functioning in older adults: a systematic literature review [^117CqeU2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Other factors that may have affected results

The studies that were included in which SSRI treatment lasted 12 weeks or longer were slightly more likely to find positive effects than studies reporting results of treatments of 4 weeks or shorter and less likely to find negative results. This could indicate that long-term SSRI use does not have a deleterious effect on brain functions related to memory.

While our results did not show any convincing evidence of a negative effect of SSRI use on memory functioning in older adults, there are some contradictory findings in other studies with adult volunteers. It is suggested that SSRI use could lead to impaired memory functioning in adult volunteers; negative results on learning, episodic memory, and short-term memory have been reported. It should be noted that these acute effects may be dose-dependent. Together with the long-term studies reported in this review, this suggests that SSRI treatment can have an initial deleterious effect on memory but after reaching a steady state, these effects are no longer found. This difference can be explained on basis of the difference of acute- and long-term treatment of SSRIs on the brain.

Another observation was that underlying neuropsychiatric vulnerability appeared to play a role in the effect of SSRI use on memory functioning. This is also suggested by findings of a negative effect of acute tryptophan depletion on global memory (measured by MMSE) only in patients with Alzheimer's disease and remitted depression, but not in healthy older control subjects (although it should be noted that completing the MMSE is a fairly easy task for most healthy older adults, which could lead to failure to notice a more subtle impairment). A possible explanation for these findings is the hypothesis that memory performance relates to 5-HT in an inverted U-curve, implicating that memory performance is optimal at a certain level of 5-HT, but decreases when 5-HT levels increase or decrease from that optimum. Considering impaired 5-HT functioning as an important pathogenic factor in both depression and Alzheimer's disease, it can be understood why patients with these neuropsychiatric disorders are more likely to experience cognitive improvement with SSRI treatment, compared to healthy subjects who are already on the 5-HT optimum.

Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine — PTSD pharmacotherapy is described as inhibiting the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine and may be particularly beneficial for patients with prominent hyperarousal or anxiety symptoms; meta-analyses have supported venlafaxine's efficacy in reducing PTSD symptoms, although it is often considered after selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) due to a higher incidence of side effects such as increased blood pressure and discontinuation syndrome; while SSRIs like sertraline are generally preferred as first-line treatments, venlafaxine remains a valuable option, particularly for patients who do not respond adequately to SSRIs.

### Treatment-related improvement in neuropsychological functioning in suicidal depressed patients: paroxetine vs. bupropion [^1128UgtJ]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

Neuropsychological dysfunction is associated with risk for suicidal behavior, but it is unknown if antidepressant medication treatment is effective in reducing this dysfunction, or if specific medications might be more beneficial. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery was administered at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment within a randomized, double-blind clinical trial comparing paroxetine and bupropion in patients with DSM-IV Major Depressive Disorder and either past suicide attempt or current suicidal thoughts. Change in neurocognitive performance was compared between assessments and between medication groups. Treatment effects on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Scale for Suicide Ideation were compared with neurocognitive improvement. Neurocognitive functioning improved after treatment in all patients, without clear advantage for either medication. Improvement in memory performance was associated with a reduction in suicidal ideation independent of the improvement of depression severity. Overall, antidepressant medication improved neurocognitive performance in patients with major depression and suicide risk. Reduced suicidal ideation was best predicted by a combination of the independent improvements in both depression symptomatology and verbal memory. Targeted treatment of neurocognitive dysfunction in these patients may augment standard medication treatment for reducing suicidal behavior risk.

Dose Dependency of Adverse Events

A comparison of adverse event rates in a fixed-dose study comparing venlafaxine tablets75, 225, and 375 mg/day with placebo revealed a dose dependency for some of the more common adverse events associated with venlafaxine tablets use, as shown in the table that follows. The rule for including events was to enumerate those that occurred at an incidence of 5% or more for at least one of the venlafaxine groups and for which the incidence was at least twice the placebo incidence for at least one venlafaxine tablet group. Tests for potential dose relationships for these events (Cochran-Armitage Test, with a criterion of exact 2-sided p-value ≤ 0.05) suggested a dose-dependency for several adverse events in this list, including chills, hypertension, anorexia, nausea, agitation, dizziness, somnolence, tremor, yawning, sweating, and abnormal ejaculation.

Effects on memory in miscellaneous study populations

We grouped five studies as "miscellaneous". Post-stroke cognitive functioning related to use of SSRI was reported in three studies, one study investigated older adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and one study a population of community-dwelling older adults who used antidepressants. The results are shown in. In post-stroke patients, improvement of global memory, episodic memory, and short-term memory was reported in one study, while the other two studies reported no effect on global memory functioning. In older adults with GAD, no effects were reported on episodic memory, short-term memory, or working memory. In community-dwelling older adults who used antidepressants, no effects were found on global memory or visual memory, but this study had serious risk of bias.

Box 2 Experience with services and lack of effectiveness of standard treatment on cognitive impairment – accounts from individuals with lived experience of depression

According to our lived experience consulatations, cognitive impairment was not discussed or considered by clinicians such as psychiatrists or clinical psychologists during engagement with services. Group members frequently highlighted that their treatment (e.g. SSRIs and psychotherapy) did not help with the cognitive difficulties they experienced.
"My psychiatrist didn't mention cognitive impairment; I wish they had as I would have been able to put coping strategies in place and know that I'm not failing, I'm just not functioning properly".
"SSRIs didn't help with memory and concentration".
"It would have been useful if my issues with concentration could have been addressed with standard treatment".

5-HTR modulators

Selective targeting of serotonin receptor subtypes may hold potential to more directly modify cognitive functioning. Vortioxetine, a multimodal SSRI with significant affinity for various 5-HT receptor subtypes is the only agent recognised by the FDA as indicated for cognitive impairment in MDD. In particular, vortioxetine is a potent antagonist of the 5-HT 3A receptor where it has a 10–38-fold greater affinity compared to the other 5-HT receptor subtypes at which it is active (5-HT 1A, 5-HT 1D, and 5-HT 7); these broad serotonergic effects are thought to result in downstream modulation of glutamatergic signalling. In multiple placebo-controlled RCTs, eight-weeks of vortioxetine monotherapy in MDD improved domains of executive functioning, learning and memory, with particularly well-replicated improvements on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST); the DSST is a highly sensitive measure of cognitive impairment with low cognitive domain specificity. In a study of healthy volunteers (n = 48) and remitted MDD (n = 48), vortioxetine but not placebo improved executive functioning performance; in addition, greater prefrontal and hippocampal activation was observed during a working memory task following vortioxetine administration, although no effect on objective memory performance was found. In contrast, a healthy volunteer study (n = 24) found no increase in cognitive functioning following vortioxetine administration. Although the beneficial effects of vortioxetine on cognition in MDD are well-replicated, further work is needed to further understand the inconsistent cognitive effects observed in healthy volunteers.

### Cognitive remission: a novel objective for the treatment of major depression? [^115AtW1P]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In adults with late-life MDD (n = 177), greater pretreatment verbal memory was associated with better treatment response. Conversely, in elderly subjects (age > 65 years; n = 58) with MDD, executive dysfunction was associated with increased risk of relapse after 16-week therapy with nortriptyline, as well as higher recurrence rates after a 2-year placebo-controlled maintenance phase. Subjects with late-onset depression (i.e. > 60 years old) are likely to experience increased impairment in verbal memory, processing speed, and executive function with respect to depressed adults. In particular, executive deficits in the elderly were found to correlate with increased residual symptomatology, higher recurrence rates, and worse response to antidepressant medication. However, a meta-analysis of 17 studies of late-life MDD indicated that better performance on tests of executive function (i.e. Dementia Rating Scale initiation and perseveration subtest) and non-executive function (including two tests of psychomotor speed, one test of construction, and one test of memory) is associated with response to antidepressant treatment. Thus, the authors concluded that specific cognitive deficits per se do not offer a reliable basis for making clinical judgments about probable illness course, in contrast to the depression-executive dysfunction model, according to which the occurrence of executive dysfunction portends poor response to antidepressant medication.

The confounding effect of age

The major caveat of studies showing the efficacy of antidepressant therapy in treating cognitive deficits is the over-representation of elderly subjects (age > 65 years) in the samples, which limits their external validity. Indeed, the effects of antidepressants on cognitive performance in the elderly are likely negatively influenced by the combined effects of comorbidities and a greater likelihood of side effects. Notwithstanding the paucity of data showing beneficial effects of antidepressants on cognitive performance in non-elderly adult subjects with MDD, converging evidence supports the assumption that the clinical magnitude of antidepressant effects is also small in this population. A systematic review showed that different antidepressant treatments induced smaller changes in measures of executive function and attention, despite clinically perceived changes in verbal learning, memory, verbal fluency, and psychomotor speed. Thus, these factors might represent trait-like markers of MDD.

### The association of antidepressant drug usage with cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112jm5Ex]. Depression and Anxiety (2017). Low credibility.

Similar patterns can be found in the relevant animal literature. For example, acute SSRI regimens have been associated with neuroprotective profiles on pathological markers as well as cognition and memory in mouse models of AD‐like neuropathology (discussed in (Sierksma et al. 2016)), whereas a chronic SSRI regimen is associated with seizures and increased mortality, as observed in males of an AD‐related mouse model (Sierksma et al. 2016). The latter observation is consistent with our findings of a higher, albeit modest, effect estimate in the study with male predominance of participants (current study) as well as our previous report of a higher risk of mortality in demented male patients with a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis (Meng et al. 2012).

Mouse models also indicate an age‐dependent shift in toxicity profile associated with antidepressant drugs. Indeed, studies involving the Down syndrome Ts65DN mouse model (note that Down syndrome and AD share several neuropathological markers and cognitive phenotypes, including dementia and depression) indicate that the SSRI fluoxetine can restore the depletion of serotonin, which appears to prevent the loss of dendritic arborization (Guidi et al. 2013) and the diminished neurogenesis in hippocampus (Bianchi et al. 2010; Clark et al. 2006), and, in turn, mitigates cognitive deficits (Bianchi et al. 2010) in these mice. However, any benefit of SSRI/fluoxetine in these mice is lost with age, given that fluoxetine exacerbates neuropathological phenotypes in older mice (Heinen et al. 2012).

### Executive function predicts antidepressant treatment noncompletion in late-life depression [^111BBQt9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine whether executive function (EF) is associated with nonremission and noncompletion of antidepressant pharmacotherapy in older adults with depression.

Design

In this prospective study (July 2009 to May 2014), older adults (aged ≥ 60 years; n = 468) with a DSM-IV-defined major depressive episode diagnosed via structured interview received 12 weeks of venlafaxine extended release with the goal of achieving remission. A hypothesis was made that worse baseline EF would predict both nonremission and noncompletion (primary outcomes). Treatment-related factors, including side effects and nonadherence, were also studied.

Methods

Baseline EF, including response inhibition and set-shifting, was assessed with subtests of the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System and the semantic fluency subtest of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Attention, immediate memory, delayed memory, visuospatial ability, and global cognition were also assessed with the RBANS.

Results

Of 468 participants, 96 (21%) failed to complete the treatment trial, 191 (41%) completed and remitted, and 181 (39%) completed and did not remit. Univariate analyses indicated that some EFs (set-shifting and semantic fluency) and other cognitive variables (attention, immediate memory, visuospatial ability, and global cognition) predicted treatment noncompletion, whereas no cognitive variables predicted nonremission. In a multivariate logistic regression model, semantic fluency (P = 0.003), comorbid medical burden (P < .001), and early nonadherence (P < .001) were significant predictors of treatment noncompletion.

Conclusions

Poorer EF predicted treatment noncompletion. These findings suggest that EFs of initiation and set maintenance (examined by the semantic fluency task) may allow depressed elderly individuals to engage and stay in treatment. Identification of those at risk for noncompletion may help implementation strategies for personalized care.

### The effect of bupropion XL and escitalopram on memory and functional outcomes in adults with major depressive disorder: results from a randomized controlled trial [^113f26W1]. Psychiatry Research (2014). Low credibility.

Decrements in cognitive function are a common feature of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and whether distinct classes of antidepressants differentially affect memory in these individuals has not been sufficiently evaluated. In this study we sought to determine the effect of escitalopram and bupropion XL on memory and psychosocial function. Forty-one individuals (18–50 years) with MDD were enrolled in an 8-week, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized controlled comparative trial of bupropion XL and escitalopram. Thirty-six participants completed pre and post memory assessments. Verbal, non-verbal and working memory were evaluated with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Psychosocial function was assessed with the Sheehan Disability Scale and Endicott Work Productivity Scale. Escitalopram and bupropion XL significantly improved immediate as well as delayed verbal and nonverbal memory, global function (all p ≤ 0.001), and work productivity (p = 0.045), with no significant between-group differences. Improvement in immediate verbal memory exerted a direct influence on improvement in global function (p = 0.006). Treatment with either escitalopram or bupropion XL was associated with improvement in memory and psychosocial function in adults with MDD.

### Effects of selective serotonin reuptake and dual serotonergic-noradrenergic reuptake treatments on memory and mental processing speed in patients with major depressive disorder [^114jVdTa]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) usually suffer from altered cognitive functions of episodic memory, working memory, mental processing speed and motor response. Diverse studies suggest that different antidepressant agents may improve cognitive functions in patients with MDD. The aim of this work is to study the effects of serotonergic reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonergic-noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) treatments to improve the performance on memory tasks and mental processing speed in MDD. Seventy-three subjects meeting criteria for major depressive disorder were assessed with the Hamilton depression rating scale and a neuropsychological battery. The subjects were medicated with escitalopram (n = 36) or duloxetine (n = 37) for 24 weeks. At the end of the trial, the subjects were assessed again with the same neuropsychological battery used prior to the treatment. Both treatments improved importantly the episodic memory and to a lesser extent, working memory, mental processing speed and motor performance. Our results suggest that cognition is partially independent from improvement in clinical symptoms. Both groups achieved remission rates in the HAM-D-17 after 24 weeks of treatment, but SNRI was superior to SSRI at improving episodic and working memory. Our work indicates that the superiority of SNRI over the SSRI at episodic memory improvement is clinically relevant.

### Cognitive remission: a novel objective for the treatment of major depression? [^116F71yg]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite standard antidepressants, many individuals continue to complain of and/or manifest cognitive deficits contributing to a diminished quality of life and functional outcome. Furthermore, some pilot studies show that cognitive deficits in MDD patients may predict non-response to treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or dual serotonergic-noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), indicating that poor performance in selected cognitive domains may define a patient subgroup that requires complex or additional treatment.

The aim of this opinion article is to summarize evidence of possible procognitive effects of standard antidepressant agents and to describe novel therapeutic targets for the management of neurocognitive impairment in MDD. We briefly review relevant clinical aspects pertaining to the assessment and effect of cognitive impairment in adults with MDD since we have critically evaluated these in a previous article.

### Déj à-vu? Neural and behavioural effects of the 5-HTreceptor agonist, prucalopride, in a hippocampal-dependent memory task [^112vzcJt]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Impairments in cognitive function are present across the spectrum of psychiatric disorders, including affective, psychotic, and neurodevelopmental conditions. These cognitive deficits may appear alongside but seem separate from other coexisting psychopathology, and often are not well treated by interventions that relieve other symptoms of the disorder. This may in part relate to their breadth: cognitive dysfunction is not limited to memory deficits, but also includes impairments in learning, reward, attention, motivation, and language, as well as processing speed. Given the significant impact such impairments can have on quality of life, there is a critical need for the development of treatments that can ameliorate the cognitive deficits associated with psychiatric disorder. While there are some interesting pharmacological targets identified in animal studies, there is an outstanding need to translate this work into humans.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the serotonin 4 (5-HT 4) receptor is a promising treatment target for cognitive impairment. 5-HT 4 is an excitatory G-protein-coupled postsynaptic receptor expressed in brain areas involved in emotion and cognition, such as the basal ganglia, hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. Following 5-HT 4 -receptor agonist administration, rodents demonstrate improved performance during learning and memory tasks, with effects obvious after only a few doses. This is particularly apparent in tasks tapping hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, which likely relates to various downstream effects of 5-HT 4 -receptor activation including increased hippocampal cell proliferation and promotion of learning-induced spine growth, induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, increased release of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, and increased expression of neuroplasticity proteins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Cortical release of acetylcholine also appears to increase the power of hippocampal θ oscillations following 5-HT 4 -receptor agonism; these oscillations have been linked to memory and attentional performance in both animal and human studies. Agonism at the 5-HT 4 receptor also modulates the release of other neurotransmitters relevant for cognition, including GABA, glutamate, dopamine, and histamine. The importance of 5-HT 4 -receptor agonism and the downstream increase in acetylcholine and change in other neurotransmitters for cognition is further demonstrated by two key preclinical findings. First, 5-HT 4 agonist-induced pro-cognitive effects can be blocked by the coadministration of 5-HT 4 -receptor antagonists. Second, anticholinergic-induced cognitive impairments can be reversed by the administration of 5-HT 4 -receptor agonists.

### Venlafaxine [^111u1k4t]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.

Sexual Dysfunction

Advise patients that use of venlafaxine tablets may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider (see WARNINGS).

Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance

Clinical studies were performed to examine the effects of venlafaxine on behavioral performance of healthy individuals. The results revealed no clinically significant impairment of psychomotor, cognitive, or complex behavior performance. However, since any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that venlafaxine tablet therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities.

### Cognitive remission: a novel objective for the treatment of major depression? [^112xq9UQ]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The beneficial effects of mirtazapine on cognition after 3 months of treatment were reported in a study of individuals in an acute MDE. Importantly, improvements in cognitive performance were not correlated with the degree of amelioration of depressive symptoms, suggesting that they were not entirely accounted for by the resolution of the MDE. Finally, tianepine treatment for 3 months significantly improved cognitive functions (i.e. short-term memory and learning, as well as reaction time and attention) in patients with mild and moderate MDD. These designs are, however, unable to disentangle indirect effects related to the resolution of depressive symptoms from direct pro-cognitive effects.

Interventions that target multiple neurochemical systems simultaneously (e.g. SNRIs) might be more likely to improve cognitive performance than treatments targeting only a single system (e.g. SSRIs). For instance, a trial including adults with MDD treated with escitalopram (SSRI; n = 36) or duloxetine (SNRI; n = 37) for 24 weeks showed that SNRIs were superior to SSRIs in ameliorating memory performance. Despite both escitalopram and duloxetine improving measures of working memory, attention, executive function, mental processing and speed, and motor performance, the improvement induced by duloxetine was greater than that induced by escitalopram in episodic and working memory. A caveat, however, is the assessment of cognition as a secondary outcome. Nevertheless, another double-blind RCT investigated the effect of duloxetine treatment on cognition deficits in elderly subjects with recurrent depressive episodes as a primary outcome. Duloxetine treatment for 8 weeks was associated with an increase in a composite cognitive index relative to that measured for a placebo group. This global improvement was indexed by increases in measures of verbal learning and recall, along with greater decreases in depression severity (assessed by HDRS and the Geriatric Depression Scale). Changes in the cognitive composite index were partially independent of improvements in overall depression severity. More recently, the cognitive-enhancing effects of duloxetine have been further supported by a 12-week study including adults presenting MDD with baseline cognitive deficits (n = 30). Path analysis showed that better cognitive performance was determined not only by decreases in depression severity but also by enhancements of verbal learning and memory performance. However, inconsistent with these findings, duloxetine did not differ from a placebo in several assessed cognitive domains in a recent study on elderly individuals with MDD.

A systematic review and position paper by the International Society for Bipolar Disorders targeting cognition task force [^11229Lo8]. Bipolar Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Compounds targeting the serotonin and norepinephrine systems

Three studies investigated the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). In one study, where participants received 3 weeks of escitalopram (10 mg/day) (n = 16) or placebo (n = 20), changes in MRS measures of glutamatergic turnover (Glx/tCr) and associate learningwere investigated. The study revealed escitalopram‐related reduction in hippocampal Glx/tCr ratios in the absence of cognitive change. Of the other two smaller studies, one found increases in medial frontal cortex activation alongside improvement in semantic fluencywith 1 week of the SNRI venlafaxine (75 mg/day) treatment (n = 4, venlafaxine or placebo groups) and another found decreased WM‐related activation in inferior frontal gyrus and increases in the thalamus, caudate, and anterior cingulate activations with SSRI escitalopram (10 mg/day) treatment (n = 10; cross‐over study).

A study of a single dose study of atomoxetine (60 mg), an SNRI used as a non‐stimulant treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) vs. placebo (n = 19; cross‐over study) found an acute increase in PFC, temporal and occipital response and in FC between anterior insula and fronto‐parietal network during high‐load WM. While atomoxetine did not produce cognitive improvement, the treatment‐related increase in insula‐DLPFC connectivity during WM correlated with WM performance increase over time.

### Antidepressants and their effect on cognition in major depressive disorder [^115pNKk7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Cognitive functioning is a symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD) that deserves particular attention by clinicians and researchers. Despite the fact that cognitive dysfunction represents a symptom of MDD as well as a functional outcome measure, cognition has been insufficiently investigated in antidepressant trials. While, until recently, few placebo-controlled trials have measured cognition in MDD, those examples which did have consisted of older adults. Of agents tested thus far in placebo-controlled trials (citalopram, duloxetine, vortioxetine), only the latter has been studied in patients aged 18–65, and only the latter has been shown to be superior to placebo in improving measures of executive functioning and to do so across adult age groups. Both duloxetine and vortioxetine appear to result in greater improvements than placebo in immediate and delayed memory. Clinicians who wish to improve the psychosocial recovery of patients with MDD should be familiar with studies of new options for treatment.

### The association of antidepressant drug usage with cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116DoEaC]. Depression and Anxiety (2017). Low credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

In conclusion, our meta‐analysis suggests that individuals with cognitive impairment or AD/dementia are more likely to have been prescribed an antidepressant drug and that this is more evident if antidepressant drug treatment began before the age of 65. This increased association is strong, is biologically plausible, and is consistent across the various studies examined. The risk‐benefit trade‐offs of antidepressant treatment cannot be fully understood until the etiological basis of this association is more fully elucidated.

### Long-term management of major depressive disorder: are differences among antidepressant treatments meaningful? [^112MJdCz]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Recurrent depression poses a problem for up to 80% of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) during their lifetime. Therefore, the optimal treatment goal established by the American Psychiatric Association and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research is remission and virtual elimination of symptoms. Patients who have a high risk of recurrence often require maintenance therapy and long-term treatment. As a result, identification of antidepressants that are effective in maintaining remission in patients over the long-term and have acceptable tolerability profiles is important. The efficacy of antidepressants in conferring full remission and long-term recovery is an important priority for clinicians. Both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have been examined for use in long-term treatment of MDD. Recently, 2 long-term (6 to 12 months), double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown that venlafaxine is effective in preventing relapse and recurrence. While long-term, head-to-head studies comparing SNRIs with SSRIs are rare, a recent open-label study compared venlafaxine to 4 SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, or citalopram) in outpatients with MDD. The results show that the SNRI venlafaxine is comparable to the SSRIs in terms of remission rates, and venlafaxine may bring patients to remission earlier than SSRIs. Long-term treatment at maximally tolerated doses is also associated with similar incidence of common adverse events between venlafaxine and placebo and tolerability comparable to SSRIs. Thus, there is increasing evidence that venlafaxine and SSRIs are effective and well tolerated in long-term therapy. While it is unclear from the data if continued treatment with SNRIs confers advantages over SSRIs due to an early onset of remission, further studies will provide valuable insights into the efficacy of SNRIs and SSRIs in maintenance therapy.

### ABCB1 genetic effects on antidepressant outcomes: a report from the iSPOT-D trial [^115NqYev]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The ABCB1 gene encodes P-glycoprotein, which limits brain concentrations of certain antidepressants. ABCB1 variation has been associated with antidepressant efficacy and side effects in small-sample studies. Cognitive impairment in major depressive disorder predicts poor treatment outcome, but ABCB1 genetic effects in patients with cognitive impairment are untested. The authors examined ABCB1 genetic variants as predictors of remission and side effects in a large clinical trial that also incorporated cognitive assessment.

Method

The authors genotyped 10 ABCB1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 683 patients with major depressive disorder treated for at least 2 weeks, of whom 576 completed 8 weeks of treatment with escitalopram, sertraline, or extended-release venlafaxine (all substrates for P-glycoprotein) in a large randomized, prospective, pragmatic trial. Antidepressant efficacy was assessed with the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Rated (QIDS-SR), and side effects with a rating scale for frequency, intensity, and burden of side effects. General and emotional cognition was assessed with a battery of 13 tests.

Results

The functional SNP rs10245483 upstream from ABCB1 had a significant effect on remission and side effect ratings that was differentially related to medication and cognitive status. Common homozygotes responded better and had fewer side effects with escitalopram and sertraline. Minor allele homozygotes responded better and had fewer side effects with venlafaxine, with the better response most apparent for patients with cognitive impairment.

Conclusions

The functional polymorphism rs10245483 differentially affects remission and side effect outcomes depending on the antidepressant. The predictive power of the SNP for response or side effects was not lessened by the presence of cognitive impairment.

### The association of antidepressant drug usage with cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111yz5is]. Depression and Anxiety (2017). Low credibility.

A decrease in serotonin availability within the synapse — a core feature of the monoamine theory of depression — can be reestablished by inhibiting monoamine oxidase (MAO, degrades serotonin and other monoamines) or by inhibiting serotonin reuptake/removal from the synapse. Depressed women tend to respond better to MAO inhibitors, while men tend to respond better to reuptake inhibitors (Davidson & Pelton, 1986). Interestingly, doses of SSRIs lower than the smallest available doses might still provide benefit, while reducing side effects and risk (Kauffman, 2009). In contrast, patient noncompliance and an effective "less than daily" dose could actually precipitate dementia and dementia‐related mortality (Rosness et al. 2016). It should be noted that AD/dementia is not associated with all classes of reuptake inhibitors. For instance, the older, tricyclic antidepressants, some of which function as serotonin uptake inhibitors, may be associated with a reduced risk (Lee et al. 2016) or no risk (Kessing et al. 2009) of dementia, whereas non‐SSRI antidepressant drugs, i.e. including MAO inhibitors and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), have been reported to show an intermediate risk (Kessing et al. 2009; Lee et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2015). These tentative findings suggest that the treatment of the depression rather than depression itself may have a powerful impact on cognitive phenotypes.

### Pharmacological targeting of cognitive impairment in depression: recent developments and challenges in human clinical research [^114bxdhx]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Heterogeneity of cognitive impairment in MDD

Cognitive impairment in depression is heterogeneous in presentation, due to the pathophysiology of depression itself and external factors such as effects of medication; impairments in specific domains of cognitive function such as memory, executive function and learning differ case-by-case. In future, a better understanding of the specific effects of pharmacological agents on different cognitive domains, when given alone or as an adjunct to antidepressant treatment, may facilitate the more targeted and personalised treatment of cognitive impairment in depression (Fig. 1). It will also be important to define the conditions necessary for successful clinical use of these agents, and where their clinical practicality lies; in particular, whether these agents are best used as preventative therapy, or as treatment for impaired cognitive function during active MDD episodes, or for residual cognitive impairments in remitted MDD.

Fig. 1
Modular considerations for managing depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment.

Through assessment of both cognitive and psychiatric presentation, future research may provide scope for the identification of appropriate polypharmacy for the individual case.

Efforts to account for the heterogeneity of premorbid intelligence quotients between intervention groups have been made (e.g.), making use of reliable measures of reading and vocabulary, including the National Adult Reading Test; however, as Douglas et al. note, these measures may not generalise to broad metrics of memory, learning and executive function used within studies. A potential solution is subgroup analysis of patient clusters based on cognitive presentations (e.g. working memory impaired vs. intact), although this requires large samples for sufficient power; alternatively, future studies could restrict study inclusion to participants with particular cognitive presentations that align with a priori hypotheses about the cognitive effects of the drug within MDD.

### The association of antidepressant drug usage with cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ntqyB]. Depression and Anxiety (2017). Low credibility.

Finally, as stated above, most cases of AD/dementia are influenced by factors such as advancing age (65+ years), biological sex and whether one carries the ε4 allele of the APOE gene (the only genetic risk unquestionably associated with the late‐onset form of AD). Interestingly, the APOE ε4 status is also associated with clinical depression, but only in women (Muller‐Thomsen et al. 2002), and particularly those with a history of depression prior to developing AD (Delano‐Wood et al. 2008). The interaction of ε4 genotype and depression further increases the risk of incident dementia (Geda et al. 2006). It would be interesting to revisit some of these larger population study datasets — for example, the extensive dataset associated with the Danish study (Meng et al. 2012) — to determine whether biological sex, APOE ε4 genotype (if described in the patient files) and specific antidepressant drug usage (including for off‐label indications (Wong et al. 2016)) interact to impart greater odds of developing a dementia‐related phenotype.

Limitations of note include the small pool of included studies, the presence of clinical and statistical heterogeneity, and the fact that some of the studies did not look at this association as their primary hypothesis. Thus, adjustments were not commonly made for other explanatory variables and therefore, it was difficult to confidently exclude the effect of within study confounding. This latter issue is particularly worrisome in pharmacoepidemiology, where confounding by indication and severity pose serious methodological challenges. Often, questions in pharmacoepidemiology can be addressed by meta‐regression, but such an analysis would normally require approximately 10 studies per determinant of heterogeneity. The paucity of relevant studies in the literature precludes any such study design. The best way to deal with the issue of confounding would be randomization, which, again, would rely on a greater number of studies. Often (when randomized studies are not feasible) advanced methods such as propensity score analysis are necessary to deal with these forms of bias. This is not possible in a meta‐analysis such as this one, in which only unadjusted estimates were consistently available for pooling. An association, in itself, does not confirm causation, but a strong association that is consistently observed, in which temporality of the association is clear and which is biologically plausible may represent an etiologic effect (Hill, 1965). The existence of an association, as confirmed here, creates an urgent need to explore the underlying issue of etiology.

### Desvenlafaxine [^1166Cz3w]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Human Experience with Overdosage

There is limited clinical trial experience with desvenlafaxine succinate overdosage in humans. However, desvenlafaxine (desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets) is the major active metabolite of venlafaxine. Overdose experience reported with venlafaxine (the parent drug of desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets) is presented below; the identical information can be found in the Overdosage section of the venlafaxine package insert.

In postmarketing experience, overdose with venlafaxine (the parent drug of desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets) has occurred predominantly in combination with alcohol and/or other drugs. The most commonly reported events in overdosage include tachycardia, changes in level of consciousness (ranging from somnolence to coma), mydriasis, seizures, and vomiting. Electrocardiogram changes (e.g., prolongation of QT interval, bundle branch block, QRS prolongation), sinus and ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, rhabdomyolysis, vertigo, liver necrosis, serotonin syndrome, and death have been reported.

Published retrospective studies report that venlafaxine overdosage may be associated with an increased risk of fatal outcomes compared to that observed with SSRI antidepressant products, but lower than that for tricyclic antidepressants. Epidemiological studies have shown that venlafaxine-treated patients have a higher pre-existing burden of suicide risk factors than SSRI-treated patients. The extent to which the finding of an increased risk of fatal outcomes can be attributed to the toxicity of venlafaxine in overdosage, as opposed to some characteristic(s) of venlafaxine-treated patients, is not clear.

10.2 Management of Overdosage

No specific antidotes for desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets are known. In managing over dosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. In case of overdose, call Poison Control Center at 1–800–222–1222 for latest recommendations.

### The association of antidepressant drug usage with cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117LntxF]. Depression and Anxiety (2017). Low credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data sources

We conducted a search for peer‐reviewed articles across databases such as Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of science, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane library. Gray literature search was carried out using google scholar. Searches were carried out with a combination of the following key words: Antidepressant, antidepressive agent, thymoleptic, depression medication, depression therapy, depression treatment, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressant, AD, dementia, demented, cognitive impairment, cognitive loss, cognitive deficit (see Fig. 1 for search strategy).

Figure 1
Flow diagram for included studies

The identification of eligible studies began with an examination of titles and abstracts to remove duplicates. Second, two of the authors (CN and JM) reviewed the full‐text articles for relevance and agreement guided by predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Third, methodologic quality was assessed by two reviewers (CN and JM) independently using the Quality of Prognosis Studies in Systematic Reviews (QUIPS) tool (Hayden, Cote, & Bombardier, 2006). There was full agreement between the two reviewers on which studies to include and the interrater variability was high (Cohen's kappa 0.88). If any disagreement was encountered, this was resolved by consensus‐seeking discussion.

2.2 Study selection

An article was included if it met the following inclusion criteria: (a) it was published in the English language, (b) full text was available, (c) it had a comparative design with two groups; one being exposed to antidepressant drug use and the other group being antidepressant naïve (as reported), (d) it was not older than 10 years, and (e) it had quantifiable odds ratios describing the effect size. Articles were excluded from analysis if: (a) it described a study with a single arm or without a comparison group, and/or (b) it did not describe a clear categorization of the outcome as dementia or cognitive impairment.

2.3 Data extraction

Odds ratios and their associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained (if given) or calculated (when not directly available) from the articles. Other relevant information extracted from each study included: the study design, presence of depression at baseline, specific type of outcome (dementia vs cognitive impairment), predominant sex of study participants, average age of study participants and the use of other psychotropic medications.

### Venlafaxine [^117MZvUr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

While there were no efficacy studies focusing specifically on an elderly population, elderly patients were included among the patients studied. Overall, approximately 2/3 of all patients in these trials were women. Exploratory analyses for age and gender effects on outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of age or sex.

In one longer-term study, adult outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder who had responded during an 8-week open trial on venlafaxine hydrochloride extended release capsules (75, 150, or 225 mg, qAM) were randomized to continuation of their same venlafaxine hydrochloride extended release capsules dose or to placebo, for up to 26 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the open phase was defined as a CGI Severity of Illness item score of ≤ 3 and a HAM-D-21 total score of ≤ 10 at the day 56 evaluation. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as follows: (1) a reappearance of major depressive disorder as defined by DSM-IV criteria and a CGI Severity of Illness item score of ≥ 4 (moderately ill), (2) 2 consecutive CGI Severity of Illness item scores of ≥ 4, or (3) a final CGI Severity of Illness item score of ≥ 4 for any patient who withdrew from the study for any reason. Patients receiving continued venlafaxine hydrochloride extended release capsules treatment experienced significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 26 weeks compared with those receiving placebo.

In a second longer-term trial, adult outpatients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for major depression, recurrent type, who had responded (HAM-D-21 total score ≤ 12 at the day 56 evaluation) and continued to be improved [defined as the following criteria being met for days 56 through 180: (1) no HAM-D-21 total score ≥ 20; (2) no more than 2 HAM-D-21 total scores > 10; and (3) no single CGI Severity of Illness item score ≥ 4 (moderately ill)] during an initial 26 weeks of treatment on venlafaxine tablets (100 to 200 mg/day, on a b.i.d. schedule) were randomized to continuation of their same venlafaxine tablet dose or to placebo. The follow-up period to observe patients for relapse, defined as a CGI Severity of Illness item score ≥ 4, was for up to 52 weeks. Patients receiving continued venlafaxine tablet treatment experienced significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 52 weeks compared with those receiving placebo.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Study selection

The initial search parameters identified 4,193 articles. Of these, 1,523 were removed as duplicates. The rest of the studies were carefully screened by title and abstract, and an additional 2,565 were removed for not being relevant to our study. This eventually yielded a pool of 105 articles; the full articles were then retrieved and further screened for relevance. Five of the articles were deemed relevant by both reviewers after the full article screening. These five articles underwent methodology quality review from which all five articles passed and were included in the meta‐analysis (Fig. 1).

3.2 Methodological quality

The methodological quality review of the studies is reported in Table 1. The main methodology deficit noted among the included studies was the absence of blinding among the assessors. Also, most of the studies did not explicitly state if any differences existed between participants included in their study and those not included. Strengths in the methodology of the included studies ranged from adequate description of the source population, adequate outcome data at follow‐up, proper assessment of outcome, avoidance of overfitting issues (i.e. at least 10 participants in the smallest group per predictor and outcome variable), proper statistical analysis, and consideration of important confounders.

### Problems associated with long-term treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [^115wVvvT]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

Although the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are now widely used as a first-line treatment for depression and many other psychiatric conditions, are generally well tolerated, they are not devoid of side effects. Most short-term treatment-related side effects of SSRIs are transient and disappear after a few days or weeks. However, following long-term treatment with the SSRIs, some serious adverse events may occur. Some of them can be difficult to recognise because they can resemble residual symptoms of depression. The most serious can be life threatening. They all have a negative influence on the patient's quality of life and are frequently a prime reason for a lack of long-term compliance with the associated increased risk of recurrence of a depressive episode. This article is an overview of the more common adverse events, which are seen with non-acute treatment with the SSRIs.

### Randomised controlled cognition trials in remitted patients with mood disorders published between 2015 and 2021: a systematic review by the International Society for Bipolar Disorders targeting cognition task force [^11221ETg]. Bipolar Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

4.1 Methodological advancements and suggestions

Most studies (81%) were evaluated as having either moderate or high risk of bias. In addition to relatively small sample sizes, the common sources of risk of bias were the absence of information on procedures in place to ensure that the allocation sequence was masked until treatment allocation and lack of pre‐selection of one primary cognition outcome. In the previous systematic reviews of cognition trials in mood disorders published before 2015, the risk of bias was high for 44% of the RCTs. In contrast, the risk of bias was high for only one study (6%) in the present review. This indicates an overall shift in the field towards stronger methodology. Nevertheless, some challenges remain, the most notable relating to small sample sizes. Indeed, only six (37.5%) studies had sample sizes of ≥ 60 patients, of which three were of CR, and three were of pharmacological treatments with modafinil, pramipexole and vortioxetine, respectively. The large reported effect sizes in the CR studies for the cognitive improvements on either primaryor secondary, outcomes can thus be considered relatively robust. Further, the medium to large effect size for modafinil‐induced improvement in episodic and working memorytherefore also seems robust – as do the negative findings in the pramipexole and vortioxetine studies. In contrast, the remaining 62.5% of trials may have had suboptimal statistical power and their predominantly negative findings should therefore be considered with caution.

### The effect of sertraline on emotional processing: secondary analyses of the PANDA randomised controlled trial [^117TkXsQ]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

According to the cognitive neuropsychological model, antidepressants reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety by increasing positive relative to negative information processing. Most studies of whether antidepressants alter emotional processing use small samples of healthy individuals, which lead to low statistical power and selection bias and are difficult to generalise to clinical practice. We tested whether the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) sertraline altered recall of positive and negative information in a large randomised controlled trial (RCT) of patients with depressive symptoms recruited from primary care.

Methods

The PANDA trial was a pragmatic multicentre double-blind RCT comparing sertraline with placebo. Memory for personality descriptors was tested at baseline and 2 and 6 weeks after randomisation using a computerised emotional categorisation task followed by a free recall. We measured the number of positive and negative words correctly recalled (hits). Poisson mixed models were used to analyse longitudinal associations between treatment allocation and hits.

Results

A total of 576 participants (88% of those randomised) completed the recall task at 2 and 6 weeks. We found no evidence that positive or negative hits differed according to treatment allocation at 2 or 6 weeks (adjusted positive hits ratio = 0.97, 95% CI 0.90–1.05, p = 0.52; adjusted negative hits ratio = 0.99, 95% CI 0.90–1.08, p = 0.76).

Conclusions

In the largest individual placebo-controlled trial of an antidepressant not funded by the pharmaceutical industry, we found no evidence that sertraline altered positive or negative recall early in treatment. These findings challenge some assumptions of the cognitive neuropsychological model of antidepressant action.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^111dVufb]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — dose implementation and switching: Available trial data suggest that higher SSRI doses produce a somewhat higher response rate and somewhat greater magnitude of symptom relief; among nonresponders, raising the dose of an SSRI is associated with enhanced response, although the literature does not allow specification of the chance of response as a function of the number of previously failed adequate SRI trials; clinical experience suggests that patients who do not respond to one SRI may still respond well to another, with response rates to a second trial close to 50%, and a switch to venlafaxine at doses of 225–350 mg/day is also supported by active-comparator trials and open-label studies that suggest its effectiveness in treating OCD.

### Cognition as a treatment target in depression [^115W8CkM]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Cognitive dysfunction in depression is associated with poorer clinical outcomes and impaired psychosocial functioning. However, most treatments for depression do not specifically target cognition. Neurocognitive deficits such as memory and concentration problems tend to persist after mood symptoms recover. Improving cognition in depression requires a better understanding of brain systems implicated in depression. A comprehensive approach is warranted for refined methods of assessing and treating cognitive dysfunction in depression.

### Optimal dose of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine in major depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^112vEbnF]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Depression is the single largest contributor to non-fatal health loss worldwide. Second-generation antidepressants are the first-line option for pharmacological management of depression. Optimising their use is crucial in reducing the burden of depression; however, debate about their dose dependency and their optimal target dose is ongoing. We have aimed to summarise the currently available best evidence to inform this clinical question.

Methods

We did a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of double-blind, randomised controlled trials that examined fixed doses of five selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline), venlafaxine, or mirtazapine in the acute treatment of adults (aged 18 years or older) with major depression, identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, AMED, PSYNDEX, websites of drug licensing agencies and pharmaceutical companies, and trial registries. We imposed no language restrictions, and the search was updated until Jan 8, 2016. Doses of SSRIs were converted to fluoxetine equivalents. Trials of antidepressants for patients with depression and a serious concomitant physical illness were excluded. The main outcomes were efficacy (treatment response defined as 50% or greater reduction in depression severity), tolerability (dropouts due to adverse effects), and acceptability (dropouts for any reasons), all after a median of 8 weeks of treatment (range 4–12 weeks). We used a random-effects, dose-response meta-analysis model with flexible splines for SSRIs, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine.

Findings

28 554 records were identified through our search (24 524 published and 4030 unpublished records). 561 published and 121 unpublished full-text records were assessed for eligibility, and 77 studies were included (19 364 participants; mean age 42.5 years, SD 11.0; 7156 [60.9%] of 11 749 reported were women). For SSRIs (99 treatment groups), the dose-efficacy curve showed a gradual increase up to doses between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents, and a flat to decreasing trend through the higher licensed doses up to 80 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Dropouts due to adverse effects increased steeply through the examined range. The relationship between the dose and dropouts for any reason indicated optimal acceptability for the SSRIs in the lower licensed range between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Venlafaxine (16 treatment groups) had an initially increasing dose-efficacy relationship up to around 75–150 mg, followed by a more modest increase, whereas for mirtazapine (11 treatment groups) efficacy increased up to a dose of about 30 mg and then decreased. Both venlafaxine and mirtazapine showed optimal acceptability in the lower range of their licensed dose. These results were robust to several sensitivity analyses.

Interpretation

For the most commonly used second-generation antidepressants, the lower range of the licensed dose achieves the optimal balance between efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability in the acute treatment of major depression.

### Combining moderators to identify clinical profiles of patients who will, and will not, benefit from aripiprazole augmentation for treatment resistant late-life major depressive disorder [^112Et8qR]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2016). Low credibility.

Personalizing treatment for late-life depression requires identifying and integrating information from multiple factors that influence treatment efficacy (moderators). We performed exploratory moderator analyses using data from a multi-site, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of aripiprazole augmentation. Patients (n = 159) aged ≥ 60 years had major depressive disorder that failed to remit with venlafaxine monotherapy. We examined effect sizes of 39 potential moderators of aripiprazole (vs. placebo) augmentation efficacy using the outcome of percentage reduction in depressive symptom after 12 weeks. We then incorporated information from the individually relevant variables in combined moderators. A larger aripiprazole treatment effect was related to: white race, better physical function, better performance on Trail-Making, attention, immediate, and delayed memory tests, greater psychomotor agitation and suicidality symptoms, and a history of adequate antidepressant pharmacotherapy. A smaller aripiprazole treatment effect was observed in patients with: more pain and more work/activity impairment and libido symptoms. Combining information from race and Trail-Making test performance (base combined moderator (Mb*)) produced a larger effect size (Spearman effect size = 0.29 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.15, 0.42)) than any individual moderator. Adding other individually relevant moderators in the full combined moderator (Mf*) further improved effect size (Spearman effect size = 0.39 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.52)) and identified a sub-group benefiting more from placebo plus continuation venlafaxine monotherapy than adjunctive aripiprazole. Combining moderators can help clinicians personalize depression treatment. We found the majority of our patients benefited from adjunctive aripiprazole, but a smaller subgroup that is identifiable using clinical measures appeared to benefit more from continuation venlafaxine plus placebo.
