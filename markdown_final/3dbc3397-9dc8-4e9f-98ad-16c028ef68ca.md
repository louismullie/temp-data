## Question

Systemic effects of cyclooxygenase inhibition

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the systemic effects of cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanistic basis of COX-1 versus COX-2 inhibition and the prostaglandin biology that underlies organ effects. Then, I should map organ system–specific consequences across cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic, immune/inflammatory, and oncologic domains. Next, I will stratify risks by NSAID selectivity, dose, and duration, and integrate high-quality guideline and meta-analytic data to quantify risks. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical recommendations, including drug selection, monitoring, and special populations, while flagging uncertainties and controversies along the way [^116PX8t1] [^111zr1yf] [^11353vMC].

> Let me first confirm the core mechanism, because everything else hinges on it. COX-1 is constitutively expressed and generates "housekeeping" prostaglandins that protect the gastric mucosa, support renal blood flow, and maintain vascular homeostasis, whereas COX-2 is inducible in inflammation and produces proinflammatory mediators but also prostacyclin (PGI2), which restrains platelets and vasomotor tone; aspirin uniquely causes irreversible COX-1 acetylation, explaining its antiplatelet effect, whereas most other NSAIDs reversibly inhibit both isoforms to varying degrees, creating distinct pharmacodynamic profiles [^114JLFNW] [^115GNXwz] [^116dg9Fq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — cardiovascular effects are both complex and clinically pivotal. Selective COX-2 inhibition lowers PGI2 without blocking thromboxane A2 (TXA2), tilting the prostacyclin–thromboxane balance toward thrombosis and vasoconstriction; meta-analyses and observational data show a 30–40% relative increase in serious vascular events with coxibs, with diclofenac carrying higher risk, ibuprofen at high dose approaching that risk, and naproxen appearing more neutral, while aspirin at low dose is protective via sustained COX-1 blockade and platelet inhibition [^1149MNsB] [^111zr1yf] [^116PX8t1] [^113b1N7a].

> Wait, let me verify the dose and timing details for cardiovascular risk because these matter clinically. The excess vascular risk with rofecoxib appears within the first month and rises with dose; similarly, diclofenac and high-dose ibuprofen increase myocardial infarction risk, whereas naproxen shows no clear excess in many analyses, aligning with its sustained COX-1 platelet inhibition despite concurrent PGI2 suppression, a pattern not shared by short-acting NSAIDs with intermittent COX-1 effects [^111zr1yf] [^113b1N7a] [^1149MNsB].

> I will now examine renal effects, and I need to ensure I don't overstate COX-2 selectivity as "renal-sparing". COX-2 is constitutively expressed in the kidney and participates in renin release, medullary blood flow, and natriuresis; both selective and nonselective NSAIDs can cause sodium retention, edema, hypertension, and reduced GFR, with risk amplified in the elderly, diuretic users, cirrhosis, or heart failure; some data suggest COX-2 inhibition may be particularly relevant to renin regulation and sodium handling, though the clinical takeaway is that no NSAID is reliably renoprotective in at-risk patients [^116R9PeN] [^111hNpyZ] [^112RT61P] [^113FKM95].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I recall older statements that COX-2 inhibitors might reduce renal toxicity — let me reconsider that. Contemporary reviews and trials show that COX-2 inhibitors have renal adverse effects comparable to nonselective NSAIDs in many settings, and mechanistic work implicates COX-2 in renal hemodynamics and natriuresis, so I should correct any assumption that COX-2 selectivity equals renal safety; judicious use and monitoring remain essential in high-risk renal phenotypes [^114SGTew] [^113FKM95] [^111hNpyZ].

> Next, I should review gastrointestinal toxicity, because this is where COX-1 sparing was intended to help. Nonselective NSAIDs impair gastroduodenal protective prostaglandins, leading to ulcers and bleeding; COX-2–selective agents reduce serious GI events by roughly 50–60% versus nonselective comparators in outcome trials, but this benefit is attenuated with concomitant low-dose aspirin and can be offset by delayed ulcer healing when COX-2 is inhibited in injured mucosa; PPI co-therapy remains a key mitigation strategy when NSAIDs are necessary in patients with GI risk [^11392Bmo] [^113uhgyc] [^114QwY3H] [^112EHFVw].

> I need to check hematologic and hemostatic effects next, and I should double-check platelet pharmacology nuances. Low-dose aspirin irreversibly inactivates platelet COX-1, yielding durable antiplatelet effects and a bleeding liability, whereas coxibs lack clinically meaningful platelet inhibition and thus do not provide cardioprotection; conversely, NSAIDs like ibuprofen can interfere with aspirin's acetylation of COX-1 if given close together, potentially undermining aspirin's antiplatelet effect, a practical interaction to avoid by separating doses when both are required [^114JLFNW] [^111AMn77] [^115YcAfC] [^1164uZsw].

> Let me consider immune and inflammatory modulation, and I should confirm whether COX-2 inhibition meaningfully alters systemic inflammation. NSAIDs suppress prostanoid-driven hyperalgesia and central sensitization, explaining their analgesic utility, and there is emerging but low-certainty evidence that NSAIDs may reduce systemic inflammatory biomarkers and improve cachexia-related outcomes in advanced cancer; mechanistically, this fits with prostaglandins' roles in both promoting and resolving inflammation, which complicates predictions in chronic disease states [^1129QNzS] [^112FQ5R4] [^1118XiMo].

> I should now examine oncologic effects, and I need to be careful to separate prevention from treatment contexts. Low-dose aspirin reduces incident colorectal cancer and recurrence in some settings, with platelet COX-1 inhibition and modulation of platelet–tumor interactions posited as key mechanisms; selective COX-2 inhibitors reduce colorectal adenomas in high-risk populations but increase vascular events, so they are not used for chemoprevention; overall, NSAIDs influence tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis via COX-dependent and independent pathways, but routine oncologic use remains investigational outside of research settings [^116vJGhW] [^11488gWa] [^115ykUWB] [^115exLgJ].

> Next, I should review modifiers of risk by drug, dose, and patient phenotype, and I should confirm whether short half-life acidic NSAIDs truly confer safety advantages. High COX-2 selectivity correlates with higher cardiovascular risk, while higher COX-1 inhibition drives GI toxicity; slow-release or high-dose regimens increase vascular and renal risk; CYP2C9 polymorphisms can elevate celecoxib exposure and adverse events; elderly patients, those with hypertension, CKD, heart failure, or high atherothrombotic risk warrant heightened caution and monitoring if NSAIDs are used at all [^11353vMC] [^113Q2iLX] [^112KyYiH].

> But wait, what if we use short half-life acidic NSAIDs with intermittent dosing — does that mitigate systemic harm while preserving local anti-inflammatory effects. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data suggest that drugs like diclofenac accumulate in inflamed tissues and clear quickly from plasma, potentially allowing analgesia with lower systemic exposure, but this strategy requires careful dose minimization and vigilance for GI, CV, and renal signals, and should not be interpreted as risk-free [^112tMFQa] [^1111zDdR] [^111qAwD5].

> I should now translate this into clinical practice recommendations, and I will align with guidelines to ensure consistency. Prefer the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration; in patients with cardiovascular disease or high risk, avoid coxibs and high-dose diclofenac, consider naproxen if an NSAID is absolutely necessary, and always weigh against non-NSAID alternatives; in patients with GI risk, prefer COX-2–selective agents or add PPI prophylaxis; in CKD, heart failure, or cirrhosis, avoid NSAIDs when possible or use with close monitoring; in those on aspirin for secondary prevention, avoid ibuprofen around aspirin dosing or choose naproxen if an NSAID is required; in older adults, start with reduced doses and reassess early [^114Z9AVz] [^11353vMC] [^112KyYiH].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations where guidance is explicit. For sickle cell disease, short courses of NSAIDs are conditionally recommended for acute pain when renal risk is acceptable, with explicit counseling on nephrotoxicity and avoidance in those with renal comorbidity; for perioperative and acute pain, coxibs offer analgesia without platelet effects but still carry cardiovascular and renal risks that must be screened and monitored [^115vfRkF] [^114tPpg4].

> Let me reconsider one potential pitfall in my earlier thinking: I initially thought celecoxib might be "cardiovascularly neutral", but I should double-check the meta-analytic signal. The JAMA meta-analysis suggested celecoxib at usual doses may not increase vascular risk, yet broader contemporary reviews still classify celecoxib and other coxibs as increasing thrombotic risk relative to naproxen, reinforcing a cautious stance and underscoring that individual patient risk and dose are decisive factors [^111zr1yf] [^11353vMC] [^112KyYiH].

> In summary, COX inhibition produces systemic effects via disruption of prostaglandin homeostasis: gastrointestinal mucosal injury with nonselective agents, thrombotic cardiovascular risk with selective COX-2 inhibition and high-dose NSAIDs, renal sodium retention and hemodynamic compromise across the class, and nuanced effects on hemostasis, inflammation, and cancer biology; clinical decisions should individualize therapy by balancing efficacy with dose-, duration-, and phenotype-specific risks, and when in doubt, favor the lowest effective dose, shortest duration, and the safest agent feasible for the patient's comorbidity profile [^11353vMC] [^1149MNsB].

Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition blocks prostaglandin synthesis, producing **analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects** [^1121F8yV]. However, it also causes **gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular adverse effects** due to loss of protective prostaglandins [^1129QNzS]. COX-1 inhibition increases **gastric ulcer and bleeding risk** [^11392Bmo], while COX-2 inhibition raises thrombotic events and hypertension risk [^11353vMC]. All NSAIDs can cause sodium retention, reduced GFR, and fluid overload [^111hNpyZ], and may worsen heart failure [^114Z9AVz]. Aspirin's irreversible COX-1 blockade provides antiplatelet benefit [^116PX8t1] but increases bleeding risk [^111AMn77]; COX-2 inhibitors spare platelets [^1164uZsw] yet increase thrombotic risk [^1149MNsB]. Risk varies by agent, dose, and patient factors [^112KyYiH]; use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, and avoid in high-risk patients [^113b1N7a] [^11353vMC].

---

## Gastrointestinal effects

- **Gastric ulceration and bleeding**: COX-1 inhibition reduces protective prostaglandins, causing mucosal injury, ulcers, and bleeding [^11392Bmo] [^116UjKWP].
- **Gastrointestinal complications**: Risk increases with age, prior GI events, and higher doses; COX-2 inhibitors reduce GI events but do not eliminate them [^113uhgyc] [^111zBJS6].
- **Delayed ulcer healing**: COX-2 inhibition can impair healing of existing ulcers [^114QwY3H].

---

## Renal effects

- **Sodium and water retention**: COX inhibition reduces renal blood flow and sodium excretion, causing edema and hypertension [^111hNpyZ] [^114SGTew].
- **Acute kidney injury**: Risk rises in volume-depleted, elderly, or pre-existing renal disease patients [^112RT61P] [^113FKM95].
- **Chronic kidney disease**: Prolonged use can worsen renal function, especially in vulnerable populations [^116R9PeN].

---

## Cardiovascular effects

- **Increased thrombotic risk**: COX-2 inhibition reduces prostacyclin (PGI2) without affecting thromboxane A2, promoting thrombosis, MI, and stroke [^11353vMC] [^111zr1yf].
- **Hypertension and heart failure**: NSAIDs can worsen hypertension and heart failure by promoting sodium retention and vasoconstriction [^114NE5za] [^114Z9AVz].
- **Aspirin exception**: Low-dose aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelet COX-1, providing antithrombotic benefit but increasing bleeding risk [^116PX8t1] [^116dg9Fq].

---

## Hematologic effects

Bleeding risk arises from **COX-1 inhibition** [^114JLFNW] of thromboxane A2, which impairs platelet aggregation and increases bleeding [^114JLFNW]. Conversely, **platelet-sparing effect** occurs because COX-2 inhibitors do not directly inhibit platelets, though they increase thrombotic risk [^113uhgyc] [^1149MNsB].

---

## Immune and inflammatory effects

Anti-inflammatory effect results from **COX-2 inhibition**, which reduces prostanoids and cytokines and alleviates inflammation and pain [^1129QNzS] [^1121F8yV]. Immunomodulatory effects include altered immune responses, with **potential benefits in cancer and chronic inflammation** [^11639xbY] [^112FQ5R4].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Individualized risk assessment**: Consider GI, CV, and renal risk when selecting NSAIDs [^115f1kUC] [^117JAGGv].
- **Lowest effective dose**: Use the lowest dose for the shortest duration to minimize adverse effects [^113b1N7a] [^114hsybq].
- **Alternative therapies**: Use acetaminophen, opioids, or non-pharmacologic options in high-risk patients [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor renal function, blood pressure, and GI symptoms during therapy [^112iSTeW].

---

COX inhibition provides analgesic and anti-inflammatory benefits but carries **significant systemic risks**, including GI, renal, and cardiovascular adverse effects. Risk varies by agent and patient factors; **use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration** and monitor closely to balance benefits and harms [^notfound].

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

Aspirin and other NSAIDs inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase and the production of prostaglandins that result in inflammatory responses and pain. These are used extensively in the populations of the western world. There has been a longstanding interest in the use of NSAIDs in the treatment of cancer-associated symptoms. More recently, there has been further work that supports the routine use of NSAIDs in treating the most troublesome symptoms associated with cancer.in a recent systematic review (including 13 controlled trials of NSAIDS in advanced cancer), reported that 11 studies reported a slowing of weight loss with 4 studies demonstrating a reduction in measures of systemic inflammation. There was also evidence that NSAIDs may improve physical function and patient-reported quality of life and reduce markers of the systemic inflammatory response.

Together with well-defined systemic inflammatory response parameters, the broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory properties of NSAIDs along with their relatively mild side-effect profiles in patients, make them good agents for the manipulation of cancer-associated inflammation with or without gastro-protection. Furthermore, with recent studies demonstrating positive survival outcomes with aspirin use following surgery for colorectal cancer dependent on tumour molecular phenotypes and similar work in breast cancer, the role of aspirin/NSAID treatment looks set to expand to early-stage disease. However, it is not clear which NSAID should be used nor the amount and timing of the dosage for optimal and continued reduction of the systemic inflammatory response.

Statins

Statins are HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that have had a major beneficial impact on the natural history of coronary artery disease in humans. Beyond their cholesterol-lowering properties, statins exhibit important anti-inflammatory activities. For example, in randomised clinical trials, moderation of the systemic inflammatory response using a statin has been clearly associated with improved outcomes. Furthermore, favourable effects on organ rejection following heart and renal transplant confirm an important immunomodulatory effect. Also, similar to NSAIDs, long-term statin use before cancer diagnosis is associated with significantly lower-stage tumours and better long-term survival (e.g.).

### Cyclooxygenase-2 – specific inhibitors: are they safe? [^113uhgyc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The basic tenet of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) hypothesis rests on the fact that sparing of inhibition of COX-1 should result in greater safety than if both COX isoforms are inhibited. This increase in safety should be most evident in those organs and tissues in which COX-1 alone has important, necessary physiologic functions (e.g., the stomach and platelets). Data from large clinical trials are now available to support the superior gastrointestinal safety of COX-2 inhibitors, not only for endoscopic endpoints but also for clinically significant outcomes. Additionally, lack of effect on platelets has been demonstrated at doses many times higher than being used clinically. Unfortunately, the COX-2 inhibitors still retain some of the side effects seen with traditional dual COX inhibitors (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), namely, effects on the kidney that may manifest as an increased incidence of hypertension, edema, and associated clinical states. Similarly, effects on reproductive functions, endothelial function, and wound healing are theoretically possible but need to be evaluated in well-controlled clinical trials.

### Cyclooxygenase inhibition: pain, inflammation, and the cardiovascular system [^117Q5vDK]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Inhibitors of the cyclooxygenases (COXs), the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), relieve inflammatory pain, but are associated with gastrointestinal and cardiovascular complications. Given the widespread use of NSAIDs, there has been a longstanding interest in optimizing their risk-benefit ratio, for example by reducing their gastrointestinal risk. More recently, the focus has shifted toward the cardiovascular complications of NSAIDs and very large prospective studies have been performed to compare cardiovascular risk across distinct NSAIDs. Surprisingly, much less attention has been paid to the efficacy side of the risk-benefit ratio. There is marked variability in the degree of pain relief by NSAIDs due to the complex interplay of molecular mechanisms contributing to the pain sensation, variability in the disposition of NSAIDs, and imprecision in the quantification of human pain. Here we discuss how NSAIDs relieve pain, how molecular mechanisms relate to clinical efficacy, and how this may inform our interpretation of clinical trials.

### Combining enzyme specificity and tissue selectivity of cyclooxygenase inhibitors: towards better tolerability? [^111GZ1pP]. Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Inhibitors of cyclooxygenases (COXs) are the most widely used drugs. They reduce discomfort and fever, inhibit peri-operative and inflammatory pain. These effects are largely mediated by inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COX-1 and COX-2)-enzymes found throughout the body producing prostaglandins, which are important mediators of pain and fever, but also adaptive and protective reactions in many organs. A first step to reduce the overall toxicity and to increase the anti-inflammatory activity of these drugs was achieved with the development of acidic 'non-selective' (traditional) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (tNSAIDs). These agents distribute unequally throughout the body, reaching effective concentrations in inflamed tissue (effect compartment) for prolonged time periods. They can also reach effective concentrations in the bloodstream, kidney and gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa, where they can cause unwanted effects, such as GI toxicity, kidney dysfunction and cardiovascular impairment. All these effects are particularly prominent with compounds which are eliminated slowly [half-life (T((1/2))) > 12 h] and thus also block prostaglandin production permanently outside the effect compartment. A second step towards improving safety was achieved with selective COX-2 inhibitors. These agents reduce the incidence of GI toxicity, pseudo-asthmatic reactions and blood loss following surgical interventions. However, they may be more toxic to the cardiovascular and renal systems than some tNSAIDs, possibly because they distribute homogeneously throughout the body and inhibit COX-2 in the endothelial layer of the vessels and the kidney permanently due to their slow elimination. Another step towards improvement in safety appears possible by combining both enzyme specificity and tissue selectivity, to achieve a further reduction of unwanted drug effects while maintaining the anti-inflammatory/analgesic efficacy.

### COX isoforms in the cardiovascular system: understanding the activities of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^115GNXwz]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2006). Medium credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the formation of prostanoids by the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). Work in the past 15 years has shown that COX exists in two forms: COX1, which is largely associated with physiological functions, and COX2, which is largely associated with pathological functions. Heated debate followed the introduction of selective COX2 inhibitors around 5 years ago: do these drugs offer any advantages over the traditional NSAIDs theywere meant to replace, particularly in regard to gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects? Here we discuss the evidence and the latest recommendations for the use of selective inhibitors of COX2 as well as the traditional NSAIDs.

### Cardiovascular effects of selective COX-2 inhibition: is there a class effect? The international COX-2 study group [^1141pzLL]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

The International COX-2 Study Group, a panel of independent physicians and scientists, convened January 28–30, 2005, in Washington, DC, to discuss the issues concerning the cardiovascular (CV) profile of coxibs. The purpose of the meeting was to review potential mechanisms by which inhibition of COX-2 by selective and nonselective NSAID could increase risk of CV events, to evaluate the similarities and differences between drugs based on mechanism and pharmacology, and to propose potential trial methodology to more definitively answer questions regarding cardiovascular risk.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^115f1kUC]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which act via inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) isozymes, were discovered more than 100 years ago. They remain a key component of the pharmacological management of acute and chronic pain. The COX-1 and COX-2 isozymes have different biological functions; analgesic activity is primarily (although not exclusively) associated with inhibition of COX-2, while different side effects result from the inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2. All available NSAIDs, including acetaminophen and aspirin, are associated with potential side effects, particularly gastrointestinal and cardiovascular effects, related to their relative selectivity for COX-1 and COX-2. Since all NSAIDs exert their therapeutic activity through inhibition of the COX isozymes, strategies are needed to reduce the risks associated with NSAIDs while achieving sufficient pain relief. A better understanding of the inhibitory activity and COX-1/COX-2 selectivity of an NSAID at therapeutic doses, based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties (eg, inhibitory dose, absorption, plasma versus tissue distribution, and elimination), and the impact on drug tolerability and safety can guide the selection of appropriate NSAIDs for pain management. For example, many NSAIDs with moderate to high selectivity for COX-2 versus COX-1 can be administered at doses that maximize efficacy (~80% inhibition of COX-2) while minimizing COX-1 inhibition and associated side effects, such as gastrointestinal toxicity. Acidic NSAIDs with favorable tissue distribution and short plasma half-lives can additionally be dosed to provide near-constant analgesia while minimizing plasma concentrations to permit recovery of COX-mediated prostaglandin production in the vascular wall and other organs. Each patient's clinical background, including gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risk factors, should be taken into account when selecting appropriate NSAIDs. New methods are emerging to assist clinicians in the selection of appropriate NSAIDs and their doses/schedules, such as biomarkers that may predict the response to NSAID treatment in individual patients.

### Effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy on blood pressure and peripheral edema [^112iSTeW]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used drugs with potential effects on systemic blood pressure. NSAIDs act by inhibiting synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid via cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2, the 2 isoforms of COX. NSAIDs may affect blood pressure via the renin-angiotensin pathway, alterations in sodium and water retention in the kidneys, inhibition of vasodilating PGs, and production of various vasoconstricting factors, including endothelin-1 and P450-mediated metabolites of arachidonic acid. In 2 meta-analyses, it was found that NSAIDs have small but significant effects on blood pressure, most notably in hypertensive patients on antihypertensive medication. NSAIDs cause small (< 5 mm Hg) elevations in systolic blood pressure, and little or no change in diastolic blood pressure. The incidence rates of hypertension and peripheral edema were low, ranging from < 1% to > 9% of patients. The incidence and levels of hypertension associated with COX-2 inhibitors are within the range of those observed with nonspecific NSAIDs. Apparent differences between the COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib may be functions of differences in study population susceptibilities to NSAID-mediated hypertensive effects. Patients at risk for hypertension should be monitored for changes in blood pressure during NSAID treatment.

### Renal effects of cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors [^116UGwD1]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Recent in-vitro and animal data show that cyclooxygenase-2 has an integral role in the physiology and pathophysiology of the kidney. Cyclooxygenase-2 regulates renin-angiotensin secretion, and thereby glomerular filtration rate and sodium homeostasis. It is also important for protecting against hypertonic stress. As a consequence, it is not surprising that clinical data verify that selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 affect renal function to a degree similar to that which has previously been documented with nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Conclusion

NSAIDs are among the most commonly prescribed and used medications worldwide. However, they are associated with safety and tolerability concerns. There are a number of factors that need to be considered in the selection of an NSAID, including its potency, selectivity for the COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms, pharmacokinetic properties, pharmacodynamic interactions, and the overall impact of these features on tolerability and safety. In addition to the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety of NSAIDs, the negative effects of inhibiting prostanoid production on other body systems should be considered. Emerging factors, including biomarkers, may assist clinicians in the selection of appropriate doses and types of NSAIDs. Finally, the individual's clinical background, particularly gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risk factors, should be considered as important determinants that may exacerbate adverse reactions to NSAIDs. The risk factors for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs are summarized in Table 1. NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for atherothrombotic events. The long-term use of higher doses of NSAIDs represents an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse events;, therefore, the lowest dose of an NSAID should be used, particularly in patients with other known risk factors.

Current knowledge of factors affecting the safety and tolerability of NSAIDs, including the impact of selectivity, dose, and pharmacokinetics, is being used to guide the development of novel formulations of NSAIDs that address some of these tolerability concerns. For example, a novel immediate-release diclofenac formulation, which has a short half-life, acidic profile, and COX-2 selectivity, has been developed that allows for the use of lower doses (thus reducing systemic exposure and the potential for adverse events) together with rapid attainment of C max, providing sustained analgesia with a rapid onset. Strategies to mitigate the risks and maximize the therapeutic benefits associated with NSAIDs should continue to be employed, such as use of the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time, use of immediate-release formulations, avoidance of known drug interactions (eg, concomitant use with corticosteroids, low-dose aspirin, or other antiplatelet/anticoagulation events), and limited use of NSAIDs with high gastrointestinal toxicity. Additional strategies for minimizing the risks associated with NSAIDs in individuals with gastrointestinal and/or cardiovascular risk factors are summarized in Table 2.

### Balancing risks and benefits of cyclooxygenase-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^114kmqh8]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Choosing NSAID therapy remains confusing and controversial-the challenge for the clinician is to sum all the risks as well as analgesic and anti-inflammatory efficacy. COX-2 inhibitors are an important scientific advance in pain therapy, and using them in a safe and cost-effective manner is possible when all the competing risks are carefully weighed.

### Oxylipid profile of low-dose aspirin exposure: a pharmacometabolomics study [^111PGApt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acetyl salicylic acid, or aspirin, was first marketed in 1899 for reducing fever, pain, and inflammation. It was not until the 1960s that aspirin's antiplatelet effects were realized, and aspirin is now taken by over 50 million people in the United States alone to prevent primary and secondary cardiovascular disease. The antiplatelet effects of aspirin are mediated through its ability to irreversibly inhibit cyclooxygenase‐1 (COX‐1), which subsequently prevents the conversion of arachidonic acid (AA) to the potent platelet activator thromboxane A2. Specifically, at low dose, aspirin acetylates platelet COX‐1 in the presystemic circulation before its metabolism by the liver. 1, 2 Therefore, platelet function inhibition occurring at low aspirin doses is thought to result in little to no systemic effects. However, the non‐COX‐mediated effects of aspirin are increasingly apparent. For example, low‐dose (81 mg/day) but not high‐dose (650 mg/day) aspirin initiated the biosynthesis of anti‐inflammatory mediators, the 15‐epi‐lipoxins. 3 Similarly, our group demonstrated that several amino acids, purine metabolites, and nonesterified fatty acids, which are not directly related to COX, were significantly altered in healthy volunteers after 81 mg/day aspirin treatment for 14 days. 4, 5 Understanding these non‐COX‐1‐mediated mechanisms is critical in order to better understand the wide interindividual variability observed in aspirin response. Though aspirin use significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular death, still ≈25% of high‐risk patients on aspirin therapy show persistent platelet reactivity 6, 7 (ie, laboratory aspirin resistance) and atherothrombotic events (ie, clinical aspirin resistance) remain relatively common 8 in patients on aspirin therapy. The mechanisms underlying variability in aspirin response are poorly understood. Incomplete COX‐1 inhibition has been observed in several settings; 9, 10 however, poor response despite complete COX‐1 inhibition has also been reported. 9, 11

### Are platelets the primary target of aspirin's remarkable anticancer activity? [^116vJGhW]. Cancer Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Aspirin, when administered at low doses, has emerged as a powerful anticancer drug due to both chemopreventive activity against many forms of cancer and its ability to block metastases when administered postdiagnosis. Platelets, which are often elevated in circulation during the latter stages of cancer, are known to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cancer cell growth, survival in circulation, and angiogenesis at sites of metastases. Low-dose aspirin has been demonstrated to block this procarcinogenic action of platelets. In this article, we present evidence that aspirin's unique ability to irreversibly inhibit platelet cyclooxygenase-1 is a key mechanism by which aspirin exerts anticancer activity.

### The multifaceted clinical readouts of platelet inhibition by low-dose aspirin [^111AMn77]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Inactivation of platelet cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 by low-dose aspirin leads to long-lasting suppression of thromboxane (TX) A2 production and TXA2-mediated platelet activation and aggregation. This effect is necessary and sufficient to explain aspirin's unique (among other COX-1 inhibitors) effectiveness in preventing atherothrombosis, as well as its shared (with other antiplatelet agents) bleeding liability. However, different mechanisms of action have been suggested to explain other beneficial effects of aspirin, such as prevention of venous thromboembolism, chemoprevention of colorectal (and other) cancers, and reduced risk of dementia. These mechanisms include acetylation of other proteins in blood coagulation, inhibition of COX-2 activity, and other COX-independent mechanisms. The intent of this review is to develop the concept that the multifaceted therapeutic effects of low-dose aspirin may reflect pleiotropic consequences of platelet inhibition on pathophysiological tissue repair processes. Furthermore, the clinical implications of this concept will be discussed in terms of current clinical practice and future research.

### Prostaglandins and inflammation [^1118XiMo]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2011). Low credibility.

Prostaglandins are lipid autacoids derived from arachidonic acid. They both sustain homeostatic functions and mediate pathogenic mechanisms, including the inflammatory response. They are generated from arachidonate by the action of cyclooxygenase isoenzymes, and their biosynthesis is blocked by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, including those selective for inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2. Despite the clinical efficacy of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, prostaglandins may function in both the promotion and resolution of inflammation. This review summarizes insights into the mechanisms of prostaglandin generation and the roles of individual mediators and their receptors in modulating the inflammatory response. Prostaglandin biology has potential clinical relevance for atherosclerosis, the response to vascular injury and aortic aneurysm.

### Historical lessons in translational medicine: cyclooxygenase inhibition and P2Y12 antagonism [^113npNgF]. Circulation Research (2013). Low credibility.

The development of drugs that inhibit platelets has been driven by a combination of clinical insights, fundamental science, and sheer luck. The process has evolved as the days of stumbling on therapeutic gems, such as aspirin, have long passed and have been replaced by an arduous process in which a drug is designed to target a specific protein implicated in a well-characterized pathophysiological process, or so we would like to believe. The development of antiplatelet therapy illustrates the importance of understanding the mechanisms of disease and the pharmacology of the compounds we develop, coupled with careful clinical experimentation and observation and, yes, still, a fair bit of luck.

### COX-2 inhibitors. are they nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with a better safety profile? [^115koB5j]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

In the treatment of arthritis, NSAIDs are some of the most commonly used drugs, although the prescription of such drugs has been questioned due to their inherent risks for gastrointestinal compromise, platelet effects, and the potential for renal toxicity with long-term use. With the availability of celecoxib and rofecoxib, 2 cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitors (or COX-1 sparing agents) as new forms of NSAIDs, these issues have become magnified not only in the context of risk-to-benefit ratios but also interms of pharmacoeconomics because they have been proven to be equally efficacious as the nonselective NSAIDs, with an improved safety profile particularly within the gastrointestinal tract, but at a significantly increased cost.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^113cATr4]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Although in vitro COX-2 selectivity is a chemical feature of the NSAID, COX-2 selectivity measured in whole blood following dosing depends on the dose administered.NSAIDs are administered at doses that are not bioequivalent with respect to the extent of inhibition of monocyte COX-2 (which represents a target for drug efficacy) obtained at maximal concentration of drug in the systemic circulation after dosing (C max). In particular, NSAIDs with short half-lives (eg, diclofenac) are often given at higher doses to extend their duration of clinical efficacy (analgesic or anti-inflammatory effect). As shown in Figure 3, diclofenac 50 mg three times daily is associated with a higher inhibitory effect (> 90% inhibition) over 8 hours following dosing compared with other NSAIDs. Different NSAIDs are associated with a differential impact of platelet COX-1 (which represents an index of drug-associated side effects) depending upon their COX isozyme selectivity. Thus, administration of high-dose diclofenac and meloxicam, which have comparable and intermediate COX-2 selectivity in vitro, results in partial inhibition of COX-1. Further, the anti-inflammatory and full analgesic effects of NSAIDs are associated with plasma concentrations that inhibit whole-blood COX-2 activity by 80% (IC 80). Therefore, for drugs such as diclofenac, lowering the dose will lead to circulating concentrations near the COX-2 IC 80 values, which correlate with adequate analgesia while reducing COX-1–mediated side effects.

### Update on cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors [^113vNFSn]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs represent the most commonly used medications for the treatment of pain and inflammation, but numerous well-described side effects can limit their use. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors were initially touted as a therapeutic strategy to avoid not only the gastrointestinal but also the renal and cardiovascular side effects of nonspecific nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, in the kidney, COX-2 is constitutively expressed and is highly regulated in response to alterations in intravascular volume. COX-2 metabolites have been implicated in mediation of renin release, regulation of sodium excretion, and maintenance of renal blood flow. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge about both renal and cardiovascular side effects that are attributed to COX-2 selective inhibitors.

### Cell-specific gene deletion reveals the antithrombotic function of COX1 and explains the vascular COX1 / prostacyclin paradox [^113Neqz7]. Circulation Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

By the 1970s, it was firmly established that the endothelium provides an antithrombotic surface. This observation was rapidly followed by the discovery of 2 COX products with striking opposing effects on thrombosis: prothrombotic thromboxane A 2 and antithrombotic prostacyclin. Since this time, the prostacyclin-thromboxane balance has become a cardinal feature of cardiovascular biology and underpins the pharmacology of some of the world's most widely used drugs including aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Beyond this simple idea, much complexity has emerged. The most controversial questions surround what role, if any, vascular COX1 plays in antithrombotic protection and how this complements the well-known antithrombotic actions of COX2 seen in animal models, and patients taking COX2 inhibitors. COX1 is required for prostacyclin formation by most arteries. However, to date, there have been no tools to dissociate vascular from platelet COX1 and, as such, no way to determine whether COX1-derived prostacyclin is physiologically important in thrombotic protection. In the current study, we have confirmed earlier observations using isolated cells, to show the endothelial layer is the principal site for prostacyclin generation and antiplatelet activity of intact blood vessels in vitro. Using novel conditional knockout mice, we found that endothelial-specific COX1 deletion prevented local vascular and circulating prostacyclin production and produced a prothrombotic phenotype similar to that seen when prostacyclin receptors are blocked. However, when thrombosis was studied in dual endothelial/platelet COX1 knockout mice the net effect was antithrombotic. These data demonstrate, for the first time, that endothelial COX1 provides an essential antithrombotic tone, but when COX1 activity is lost in both ECs and platelets the resulting phenotype is driven by loss of prothrombotic prostanoids from platelets. In parallel experiments using endothelial-specific COX2 knockout mice, we observed a prothrombotic phenotype, in agreement with previous reports that deletion/inhibition of COX2 in mice, either globally, or selectively from vascular cells, or renal interstitial cells increases thrombosis. However, this was not associated with any change in aortic, carotid, or circulating prostacyclin levels, consistent with observations that constitutive COX2 expression is restricted to specific tissues and vascular beds and absent in most systemic blood vessels. Further, acute administration of a selective COX2 inhibitor to remove COX2-derived prostacyclin and other short-lived prostaglandins had no effect on thrombosis. Instead, and in agreement with published protocols, the prothrombotic effect of parecoxib took several days to develop. Therefore, the antithrombotic effect of endothelial COX2 cannot be explained by an acute prostacyclin-mediated event such as platelet inhibition. It is important to note that in vascular disease there may be changes in the expression of COX isoforms that alter their relative roles in antithrombotic protection; however, even in severe atherosclerosis, COX1 remains the dominant driver of prostacyclin production by systemic arteries, with a contribution from COX2 only appearing under conditions of endotoxemia.

### Elevation of cardiovascular risk by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^1158tDMn]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most frequently used medications. NSAIDs profoundly modify prostaglandin homeostasis through inhibition of the enzyme, cyclooxygenase (COX), especially COX-2. COX-2 inhibition is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes as demonstrated by recent trials using this type of drug. This review explores the latest available data, including recent, randomized, clinical trials, controversies, and pathophysiology of the adverse effects of COX-inhibition.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^113b1N7a]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Like the risk of gastrointestinal complications, the risk of cardiovascular complications can be affected by drug exposure. In a 2008 observational study, the risk of myocardial infarction was increased with higher doses and with exposure to slow-release formulations of NSAIDs, even after adjusting for the dose. Based on these and other safety findings, the American Heart Association recommends patients take the lowest effective dose of NSAIDs for the shortest duration of time.

The cardiovascular risk conferred by non-aspirin NSAIDs is likely associated with inhibition of COX-2–mediated production of PGI 2, which has a cardioprotective role in the circulatory system, promoting vasodilation, preventing platelet activation and cell adhesion, and counteracting the action of TxA 2, as well as several other stimuli. The antiplatelet effects of aspirin are mediated by irreversible inhibition of COX-1, resulting in profound and persistent reduction of TxA 2 production and TxA 2 -dependent platelet activation (for several days after aspirin administration). However, for most other traditional NSAIDs and coxibs, COX-1 inhibition is only transient and insufficient to translate into inhibition of atherothrombosis. The exception is naproxen, which has a long half-life and potently inhibits platelet COX-1 activity sufficiently to prevent platelet aggregation at high doses;, however, unlike aspirin, naproxen is a reversible inhibitor of COX-1 with variable effects across dosing intervals. Moreover, naproxen profoundly affects systemic PGI 2 biosynthesis, while aspirin (at a low dosage) has only a marginal effect on biosynthesis of PGI 2. Thus, as shown in the clinical data, naproxen is neutral with regard to cardiovascular risk, while aspirin is associated with a protective role.

### Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) as a target for therapy and noninvasive imaging [^112qbgCc]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2003). Low credibility.

Prostaglandins modulate a wide range of biologic functions, including wound healing, temperature regulation, reproduction, and many aspects of immune function. Exaggerated production of prostaglandins contributes to a large number pathophysiologies. The critical enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis is prostaglandin synthase, also known as cyclooxygenase (COX). The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), one of the largest classes of pharmaceutical agents, exert most of their biologic effects by inhibiting cyclooxygenase production of prostaglandins. The discovery of a second, inducible form of cyclooxygenase, now known as COX-2, responsible for the production of prostaglandins in most pathological states, revived a relatively moribund research area in biochemistry, physiology, and pharmacology, and led to the search for and discovery of a new class of pharmacologic agents. The coxibs have greater efficacy and substantially ameliorated side effects when compared to the classic NSAIDs. Because of the pervasive role of COX-2 in a wide range of human pathologies, the coxibs have been the most successful entry into the pharmaceutical market in history, responsible for 6–10 billion dollars in sales annually. The ability to noninvasively monitor COX-2 expression with molecular imaging probes will provide a corresponding advance in diagnosing COX-2-based disease, monitoring progression of such diseases, and evaluating alternative therapies.

### Cyclooxygenase-2 selectively controls renal blood flow through a novel PPAR β / δ-dependent vasodilator pathway [^116dtbdb]. Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Summary and Conclusions

COX-2 is expressed constitutively in multiple discrete regions of the body, including the brain, gut, and kidney. Other organs, such as the heart, show negligible expression. Within the sites of constitutive COX-2 expression we have identified, our data demonstrate the only place where local constitutively expressed COX-2 regulates blood flow is the kidney. As summarized in Figure S5, regulation of renal blood flow by COX-2 activity occurs through a vasodilator pathway involving prostacyclin acting on PPARβ/δ receptors, a pathway that to our knowledge has not previously been described. These data highlight the increasingly recognized role that renal COX-2 plays in systemic vascular protection and support the idea that the kidney rather than the systemic circulation is the major site of constitutive COX-2 expression where inhibition by NSAIDs could produce cardiovascular side effects. They also suggest that in the future, drugs that target inflammatory/oncogenic prostanoid signaling but spare the renal COX-2/PPARβ/δ might have improved cardiovascular and renal safety compared with NSAIDs. In a more general context, the findings of this study may have direct relevance to the mechanistic understanding of renal disease, where for example, a loss of COX-2, prostacyclin, or PPARβ/δ could contribute to reductions in medullary blood flow and renal ischemia. Conversely, if cancer risks can be overcome, targeting the PPARβ/δ pathway directly may offer a means to produce selective renal vasodilation and offer a potential treatment strategy for acute renal failure and other conditions characterized by excessive renal vascular tone.

Perspectives

NSAIDs work by blocking COX-2 and are among the most widely used medicines worldwide. However, they produce serious cardiovascular side effects that have had far-reaching effects, including drug withdrawals and increased regulation, limiting development of new drugs in this class, and preventing use of COX-2 inhibitors in cancer prevention. Therefore, there is now an urgent unmet need to identify mechanistic pathways regulating these cardiovascular side effects. This study specifically identifies the kidney as being the sole anatomic site where local constitutive COX-2 drives vascular homeostasis and implicates a novel prostacyclin signaling pathway. Ultimately, this knowledge will foster development of new, safer drugs that spare protective COX-2–driven pathways in the vasculature.

### Do selective cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors eliminate the adverse events associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy? [^114QwY3H]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Among the most widely prescribed drugs worldwide, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective for relieving pain, but they are also associated with a high incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events. Both the beneficial and harmful effects of NSAIDs result from inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzyme. Recognition of the two distinct COX isoforms prompted development of drugs that selectively block the activity of COX-2, thus providing pain relief and reducing inflammation while sparing COX-1, the enzyme apparently responsible for most protective prostaglandin synthesis in the mucosa of the stomach and duodenum. The results of preclinical and clinical studies indicate that COX-2 inhibitors exhibit high selectivity in inhibiting COX-2, provide excellent pain relief, and cause significantly less GI toxicity than do conventional nonselective NSAIDs. Although they represent a significant advance over nonselective NSAIDs, selective COX-2 inhibitors are not without limitations. They do not completely eliminate GI toxicity or the renal side effects associated with use of conventional NSAIDs. Moreover, in cases of inflammation or ulceration in the GI tract, COX-2 inhibition may delay ulcer healing. Finally, case reports and the results of animal experiments suggest that COX-2 inhibitors may adversely affect ovulation and cause a tendency towards prothrombotic events.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^1111zDdR]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

The accumulation of NSAIDs at sites of inflammation and accompanying therapeutic effects are also affected by their pharmacokinetic properties (including extended-release or immediate-release formulations). Acidic NSAIDs with short plasma half-lives (eg, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen) may be associated with tolerability benefits compared with drugs with a long plasma half-life due to rapid clearance from the plasma and non-targeted tissues, allowing for recovery of COX activity in other tissues (eg, production of vasoprotective prostanoids by endothelial COX-2) even while the drug continues to actively inhibit COX-2 at sites of inflammation. The use of excessively high doses or slow-release formulations of these analgesics could negate these benefits. Further studies using in vivo markers of COX-2 inhibition (such as urinary metabolites of PGE 2 and PGI 2) should ideally be conducted to verify this hypothesis. Persistence in the plasma is also a key factor with respect to the gastrointestinal safety and tolerability of NSAIDs.

### The development of COX2 inhibitors [^112kub4R]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2003). Medium credibility.

Aspirin, arguably the world's favourite drug, has been around since the late nineteenth century, but it wasn't until the late 1970s that its ability to inhibit prostaglandin production by the cyclooxygenase enzyme was identified as the basis of its therapeutic action. Early hints of a second form of the cyclooxygenase that was differentially sensitive to other aspirin-like drugs ultimately ushered in an exciting era of drug discovery, culminating in the introduction of an entirely new generation of anti-inflammatories. This article reviews the story of this discovery and looks at the future of cyclooxygenase pharmacology.

### Variability in the analgesic response to ibuprofen is associated with cyclooxygenase activation in inflammatory pain [^111m1ghE]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Pain is a complex multidimensional experience that reflects the interaction between nociceptive, affective, and cognitive processes. 24, 25 Given the diverse mechanisms that contribute to pain, it has long been recognized that there is substantial interindividual variability in the effectiveness of all analgesics, including NSAIDs. 16, 19, 20, 26 For example, it has been estimated that only half of the patients with arthritis prescribed NSAIDs will have a moderate or better pain relief response. 26 Studies in acute postsurgical pain following third molar extraction have demonstrated that, although NSAIDs are highly effective on average, 20–30% of patients required opioid rescue medication within 4–6 hours of the initial NSAID dose, indicating that these were individuals in whom NSAIDs failed to provide sufficient pain relief throughout the dosing interval. 19, 20 Currently, pain therapy is configured on a trial‐and‐error approach, often involving several iterations of switching drugs and adjusting doses. However, the development of algorithms to personalize treatment based on genetic or nongenetic information is limited by our lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying interindividual variability in analgesic efficacy. Here, we demonstrate that variability in the response to ibuprofen following third molar extraction is detectable across multiple diagnostic domains — behavioral, brain imaging, and markers of systemic inflammation — indicating that partial and complete analgesic responses to ibuprofen reflect internally consistent phenotypes. In addition, we find that activation of the prostanoid biosynthetic pathway following surgical trauma differs between complete and partial responders, suggesting that the response phenotype relates to the mechanism of drug action.

### Pharmacology of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition in the kidney [^114PRNaU]. Kidney International (2002). Low credibility.

Cyclooxygenase (COX) exists as two unique isoforms (that is, COX-1 and COX-2) which are poorly understood with regard to their roles in renal function. The renal effects of conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are believed to result from the inhibition of one or both isoforms. Drugs that selectively inhibit COX-2 provide useful pharmacological tools for discerning the effects associated with the inhibition of the individual isoforms, and may help clarify the renal roles of COX-1 and COX-2. This review summarizes the current data on the renal expression of COX isoforms and their potential roles in renal function, and reviews the studies that have attempted to correlate renal functional changes with selective isoform inhibition. Since there are significant differences in the expression of COX isoforms in the kidneys of laboratory animals and humans, this review also examines the correlation of the results of COX inhibition in experimental studies in laboratory animals with clinical data. Because of potential interspecies differences in the roles of COX isoforms in renal function, animal models may have limited predictive value for patients, particularly those with renal risk factors. Accordingly, any uncertainty concerning the safety or therapeutic benefit of COX-2-specific drugs in these patient populations will need to be resolved with clinical investigations.

### The cardiovascular pharmacology of COX-2 inhibition [^117XteXu]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, the coxibs, were developed to inhibit inflammatory prostaglandins derived from COX-2, while sparing gastroprotective prostaglandins primarily formed by COX-1. However, COX-2-derived prostaglandins mediate not only pain and inflammation but also affect vascular function, the regulation of hemostasis/ thrombosis, and blood pressure control. All coxibs depress COX-2-dependent prostacyclin (PGI(2)) biosynthesis without effective suppression of platelet COX-1-derived thromboxane (Tx) A(2), unlike aspirin or traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2. The actions of PGI(2) oppose mediators, which stimulate platelets, elevate blood pressure, and accelerate atherogenesis, including TxA(2). Indeed, structurally distinct inhibitors of COX-2 have increased the likelihood of hypertension, myocardial infarction and stroke in controlled clinical trials. The detection of these events in patients is related to the duration of exposure and to their baseline risk of cardiovascular disease. Thus, coxibs should be withheld from patients with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors, and exposed patients at low cardiovascular baseline risk should be monitored for changes in their risk factor profile, such as increases in arterial blood pressure.

### Targeting aspirin resistance with nutraceuticals: a possible strategy for reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [^115YcAfC]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical impact of aspirin resistance

The failure of daily aspirin therapy to achieve an adequate or 'normal' suppression of platelet aggregation, as assessed ex vivo, is known as 'aspirin resistance'. A substantial fraction of patients classified as aspirin-resistant are in fact poorly compliant. In other cases, an increase in platelet turnover, often seen in association with systemic inflammation, as found in smokers and patients with diabetes, may render a once-daily administration schedule inadequate.(Administering aspirin twice daily can result in greater platelet inhibition but may increase the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.) When adverse pharmacokinetic factors impede the delivery of aspirin to platelets, an increase in dose can be helpful. Concurrent administration of ibuprofen or other cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibitors may prevent aspirin from acetylating the active site of COX-1. But in some patients, even when platelet cyclooxygenase is fully inhibited, platelet aggregation remains anomalously high; this might be described as inherent aspirin resistance. Inherent aspirin resistance presumably reflects genetic or metabolic factors that alter the expression or function of platelet proteins such that platelets can aggregate effectively in the absence of thromboxane.

### Measurement of cyclooxygenase isozyme inhibition in humans: exploring the clinical relevance of biochemical selectivity [^111zBJS6]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Treatment with highly selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors is associated with significantly fewer serious adverse gastrointestinal events than is treatment with non-selective NSAIDs, provided that the drug employed inhibits COX-2 but not COX-1 at therapeutic plasma levels. Several factors might influence the gastrointestinal (GI) safety of a COX-2 inhibitor administered to an individual patient. These factors include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variables (e.g. COX-2 selectivity), the interaction of these features with preexisting risk factors for drug-dependent adverse effects, as well as the variability in the individual response. Biochemical selectivity is one of the determinants of the risk of experiencing a serious GI complication during long-term NSAID therapy. The wider the separation between the COX-2 and COX-1 dose-response curves of the inhibitor (an index of biochemical selectivity), the lower the probability of experiencing a clinically relevant inhibition of platelet COX-1 due to an unusually high drug level or intense pharmacodynamic response to a normal drug level. The clinical relevance of biochemical selectivity has to be studied in large GI outcome trials with adequate statistical power to detect realistic differences in these relatively rare events.

### Selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors: after the smoke has cleared [^11374KYx]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2002). Low credibility.

An enormous amount of fanfare and marketing preceded the introduction of selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 to the marketplace. These drugs were purported to offer equivalent anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects to conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs without causing gastrointestinal injury. Now that there is considerable clinical experience with four drugs of this class having been available for at least two years, it is worthwhile re-visiting some of the original claims to determine whether selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors have thus far lived up to their promise. In short, selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors have proven to be somewhat safer in terms of gastrointestinal toxicity, than some (but not all) conventional non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs. However their efficacy of the selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors has not always matched that of the conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and there are significant safety concerns with some of the new drugs that deserve very careful consideration.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^111qAwD5]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Although novel compounds are being developed (eg, COX-inhibiting nitrous oxide donors) to improve safety and tolerability, it is unlikely that an ideal oral NSAID that avoids all potential side effects will be available in the near future. Thus, strategies are needed to reduce the risks associated with currently available NSAIDs. Drug choice should be driven by the clinical and demographic features (eg, age) of the patient, and the lowest effective dose of drug should be used for the shortest period of timeto reduce the risk of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects related, at least in part, to drug exposure.

The development of whole-blood assays of COX isozyme inhibition in vitro has proved useful for differentiating NSAIDs based on their pharmacodynamic features, such as COX-2 versus COX-1 selectivity (ie, experimental COX isoenzyme selectivity),–while ex vivo assessment after NSAID dosing allows evaluation of COX isozyme selectivity achieved at circulating drug levels. Additionally, the use of biochemical markers of COX isozyme inhibition in vivo, such as the assessment of major enzymatic urinary metabolites of the parent prostanoid, permits assessment of the actual inhibition of prostanoid biosynthesis following NSAID dosing. The use of these biomarkers of COX inhibition have provided a mechanistic interpretation of the efficacy, adverse events, and interindividual variability associated with NSAID treatment.–

This review provides an overview of these and other key aspects that differentiate orally administered NSAIDs, with a focus on the role of these factors in establishing the safety and tolerability of individual NSAIDs for analgesia. Characterization of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences between these compounds and their relationship with the administered oral dose may allow for better tailoring of NSAID therapy to individual patient needs.

### Mitigating the cardiovascular and renal effects of NSAIDs [^114rB8fW]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are principal pharmacologic agents for symptom relief in patients with arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. Cardiovascular risk is associated with all NSAIDs, excluding aspirin. Selective inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX)-2 could produce a relative reduction in endothelial production of prostacyclin, while leaving the platelet production of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) intact. It has been speculated that this imbalance of homeostatic prostanoids might increase the risk for thrombotic events. The goal of this review is to provide physicians guidelines to mitigate cardiovascular and nephrotoxicity of NSAIDs.

Methods

We conducted a systematic literature review to determine what information is available to guide treatment decisions in this patient population.

Results

Selective inhibition of COX-2 could produce a relative reduction in endothelial production of prostacyclin, while leaving the platelet production of TXA2 intact. Increasing degrees of selectivity for COX-2 are associated with augmented cardiovascular risk, whereas increasing degrees of selectivity for cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-1) are associated with augmented gastrointestinal risk. Some NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen) can interfere with the cardioprotective effects of aspirin by competitively binding to COX-1 enzyme, resulting in increased TXA2 production Naproxen may differ from other NSAIDs in sustaining functionally important degrees of inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 activity throughout the dosing interval.

Conclusion

It is of paramount importance to consider individual health factors when choosing therapy with NSAIDs.

### Cardiovascular effects of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors [^117WtLpe]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Arthritis and musculoskeletal disorders are highly prevalent and management often involves the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme inhibitors are newer selective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs that purport to exhibit less gastrointestinal toxicity than traditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Cardiotoxicity has been an adverse outcome of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors and this article will critically review the evidence.

Recent Findings

Although there is less than perfect evidence, both traditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, with the possible exception of naproxen, and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors are associated with increased thrombotic cardiovascular risk. There is strong evidence supporting the cardiotoxicity of rofecoxib and valdecoxib, but less compelling evidence for the other cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors. Observational studies have been helpful in providing confirmatory and complimentary evidence about this cardiotoxicity. The thrombotic cardiovascular risk begins upon drug introduction, continues throughout exposure and is greatest in patients with a high baseline cardiac risk profile. Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors are also associated with other nonthrombotic cardiovascular risks.

Summary

The totality of the evidence suggests that all cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors are associated with increased cardiotoxicity. The cardiovascular risks of the different cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors are not homogeneous, however, and are likely influenced not only by a class effect, but also by individual drug, dosage and patient characteristics.

### Chemoprevention of colorectal cancer with cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors: two steps forward, one step back [^11488gWa]. The Lancet: Oncology (2007). Medium credibility.

Chronic inflammation is a tissue-specific process implicated in several diseases of an aging population, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and arthritis. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a mediator of acute and chronic inflammation, and drugs designed to specifically target this enzyme have achieved widespread clinical use. Unfortunately, randomised trials of selective COX-2 inhibitors for cancer prevention have shown that beneficial effects in one type of tissue can be accompanied by toxic effects in another. These trials documented a significant reduction in adenoma formation in patients at high risk for colorectal cancer, with reductions in advanced disease occurrence from 28–66% over 3 years. As a result, these studies provided important evidence for the involvement of COX-2 in early colorectal tumorigenesis. In the same patients, however, these placebo-controlled clinical trials revealed a little-understood relation between COX-2 and maintenance of cardiovascular integrity. During the 3 years of treatment, patients who received selective COX-2 inhibitors were 1.3–3.4-times more likely to have serious cardiovascular events than those treated with placebo. This article will discuss the biological rationale for using selective COX-2 inhibitors in cancer chemoprevention, and outline new avenues of research into toxic effects and tissue specificity that are necessary to allow their successful use in patients at risk for colorectal cancer.

### The demographics of chronic pain management [^112sTeAH]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2002). Low credibility.

Pain is the most common symptom for which patients seek care. The management of pain advanced considerably with the development of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific inhibitors (coxibs). The clinical usefulness of nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is often limited by the occurrence of adverse effects, such as gastric toxicity and bleeding complications, which have been attributed to the inhibition of COX-1. At the recommended dosage by targeting only COX-2, coxibs offer patients anti-inflammatory and analgesic relief with reduced gastrotoxicity compared with traditional NSAIDs. Individualization of therapy based on a careful assessment of risks versus benefits of different agents is an important consideration in pain management. This review summarizes clinical evidence of the comparable efficacy but improved tolerability of the coxibs compared with conventional NSAIDs. Important patient considerations and risk factors involved in the selection of appropriate analgesic/anti-inflammatory treatments are highlighted.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cardiovascular risk [^113Uk6xF]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which exist in at least two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2. Aspirin and older agents in this class are nonselective inhibitors of both COX-1 and COX-2. Newer agents termed "coxibs" are selective inhibitors of COX-2. Among the NSAID, only aspirin has been proven to significantly reduce cardiovascular risk, primarily through inhibition of COX-1-mediated platelet aggregation. It has been suggested that other nonselective agents, especially naproxen, may provide some lesser degree of cardioprotection, but conclusive evidence is lacking. Conversely, there are concerns that the COX-2 inhibitors may increase cardiovascular risk. However, mechanisms for this potentially adverse cardiovascular effect are unknown, and it is becoming increasingly clear that our understanding of the role of COX-2 in cardiovascular function is incomplete. Some studies have demonstrated a potentially beneficial effect of COX-2 on cardiovascular function that could be negated by COX-2 inhibition, while other studies have reported improved endothelial function with COX-2 inhibitors. Additionally, the impact of combined therapy with aspirin and other COX inhibitors is not yet clear. This article will review the studies that have examined these issues.

Mechanism of action of NSAIDs: COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition

The anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities of NSAIDs are mediated by their inhibition of prostanoid biosynthesis. Prostanoids are synthesized from arachidonic acid, a fatty acid present in cell membranes as a phospholipid ester.COX isozymes convert arachidonic acid first to prostaglandin (PG)G 2 and then to PGH 2, which undergoes a series of subsequent conversion reactions, ultimately producing five bioactive prostanoids, ie, PGD 2, PGE 2, PGF 2α, PGI 2 (prostacyclin), and thromboxane A 2 (TxA 2). These bioactive prostanoids exhibit various cell-specific and tissue-specific activities through their interaction with different receptors, mediating a range of diverse, and often opposing, physiological and pathological processes, including induction and resolution of the inflammatory response, protection of and damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa, promotion and inhibition of blood clotting and atherosclerosis, and renal control of blood pressure and renal disease.

As described previously, there are two distinct isoforms of COX: the constitutively expressed COX-1 isoform and the inducible COX-2 isoform.COX-1 is present in the majority of cells and tissues, including the endothelium, monocytes, gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and platelets. In contrast, COX-2 is constitutively expressed in only a few tissues. However, expression of COX-2 is upregulated in a variety of cells and tissues, such as vascular endothelium, rheumatoid synovial endothelial cells, monocytes, and macrophages, during inflammation through the actions of various inflammatory mediators (eg, bacterial endotoxins, tumor necrosis factor α, interleukins); the increase in COX-2 protein levels is the primary driving force for enhanced production of prostanoids at inflammatory sites. Although COX-2 is the primary pathway, evidence suggests that COX-1 may also contribute to the initial phase of prostanoid-dependent pain and inflammation; in vivo, COX-1 is expressed, along with COX-2, in circulating inflammatory cells and in inflamed tissue. The roles of COX-1 and COX-2 in different systems are summarized in Figure 1.

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? [^116UjKWP]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

As life expectancy in many countries increases into the 80s and beyond, degenerative joint disease is creating an increasing burden for patients and healthcare systems. For osteoarthritis especially, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAID) remain the most effective option for pain relief, short of surgical alternatives such as joint replacement. However, gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers and their complications are well-known NSAID side effects that are more prevalent in the elderly and are, at times, life-threatening.

The recognition that NSAIDS damage the stomach and duodenum (at least partly) by blocking the mucosal production of protective prostaglandins catalyzed by cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 led to the development of COX-1-sparing NSAIDs. These selectively inhibit COX-2, which mediates synthesis of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. The strategy has been successful: highly selective COX-2 inhibitors do reduce (but do not eliminate) the risk of GI ulceration. However, an unanticipated risk that surfaced in several randomized studies was an increase in adverse cardiovascular (CV) events in patients taking COX-2 inhibitors for months or years. The European Medicines Agency responded promptly, stating, in 2005, that ' COX-2 inhibitors must not be used in patients with established ischaemic heart disease and/or cerebrovascular disease… '. On the other hand, the US Food and Drug Agency (FDA), in the same year, declined to make such a limiting statement – noting that it was unclear whether COX-2 inhibitors carried a greater vascular risk than the older non-selective NSAIDs (nsNSAIDs), that further research was required, and that in the meantime warnings about the possibility of increased CV risk with all NSAIDs should be included in drug labeling.

### Prostaglandin pathways: opportunities for cancer prevention and therapy [^11639xbY]. Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Inhibiting COX enzymes reportedly could be effective in the prevention and treatment of multiple cancer types. However, inhibition of COX by NSAIDs or other COX inhibitors has seen limited use because these drugs are associated with various side effects, including gastrointestinal toxicity, increased risk of myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular disease. Thus, many studies have focused on the PGs downstream of COX, hoping to avoid the side effects associated with COX inhibition while retaining the potential for cancer prevention and treatment. Clarifying the function of individual receptors and development of specific inhibitors is critically important to improve the efficacy and avoid toxicity. Previously, researchers have mostly concentrated only on the EP receptors in various cancers. In this review, we comprehensively examine the role of PGs, their receptors, and signaling pathways involved in multiple types of cancer (Supplementary Table S1). We also discuss the potential of inhibitors of PG signaling pathways as well as their limitations and side effects in cancer treatment.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^112YyzXn]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

This knowledge allows prediction of the clinical consequences of COX isozyme inhibition by NSAIDs. NSAIDs may affect platelet function in vivo when the inhibition of platelet COX-1 ex vivo is > 97%. This effect occurs primarily with low-dose aspirin and persists throughout the dose interval. Naproxen, which is a reversible inhibitor of COX isozymes and has a higher potency for COX-1 than COX-2 and a long half-life (~14 hours), may have an aspirin-like effect on platelet function in some individuals when administered at high (500 mg twice daily) doses. The use of whole-blood assays allows for characterization of COX isozyme selectivity of NSAIDs in vitro. Concentration-dependent relationships for inhibition of whole-blood COX-1 and COX-2 activities as a function of the addition of an NSAID in vitro allow for assessment of half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values for COX-1 and COX-2, as well as calculation of IC 50 ratios for COX-1/COX-2. COX-2 selectivity assessed in human whole blood in vitro is a continuous variable, and it is not possible to separate traditional NSAIDs from coxibs (Figure 2C).

All NSAIDs are essentially COX-2 inhibitors with differing degrees of COX-1 inhibition as a "side effect". From a clinical perspective, COX-2 selectivity can be considered as a variable describing the probability of sparing COX-1 activity and avoiding associated side effects (eg, in the gastrointestinal mucosa and platelets) at therapeutic concentrations of the NSAID. Drugs that inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 with comparable potency (known as nonselective NSAIDs; eg, ibuprofen and ketoprofen) will not spare COX-1 activity after dosing, while drugs with intermediate COX-2 selectivity (eg, nimesulide, meloxicam, diclofenac, celecoxib) or highly selective COX-2 inhibitors (eg, rofecoxib, etoricoxib, lumiracoxib [not available in the United States]) have greater potential for sparing COX-1 activity.

### Role of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in postoperative pain management [^114tPpg4]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are as efficacious as nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of postoperative pain but have the advantages of a better gastrointestinal side-effect profile as well as a lack of antiplatelet effects. There have been recent concerns regarding the cardiovascular side effects of COX-2 inhibitors. Nonetheless, they remain a valuable option for postoperative pain management. The pharmacology of these agents and available studies are reviewed.

Absorption, distribution, and elimination

In addition to dose, the therapeutic activity and side effects of NSAIDs depend on their absorption, distribution, and elimination; these pharmacokinetic parameters can differ substantially between different NSAIDs. As with any analgesic class, the rate of absorption is a key factor in the selection of an NSAID; those with rapid absorption are preferable for most patients, particularly those with severe or acute pain. For example, celecoxib, which has a relatively slow rate of absorption, can be administered at standard doses to effectively treat osteoarthritis pain, but is not ideal for treatment of acute pain as it takes considerable time for absorption and often requires a loading dose to achieve clinically meaningful analgesia.

The distribution of NSAIDs in injured tissues, blood, and other areas of the body is a particularly crucial consideration for ensuring activity at the site of inflammation, as well as reducing the risk of side effects unrelated to therapeutic activity on COX enzymes throughout the body.NSAIDs can be classified as acidic or non-acidic based on their chemical structure, and the acidity of the drug can have an effect on its distribution. NSAIDs with acidic functional groups (eg, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen) and with a high degree of protein binding have been shown to selectively accumulate and persist at sites of inflammation,–while non-acidic NSAIDs (eg, acetaminophen, celecoxib, rofecoxib) tend to be distributed homogenously throughout the body. Acidic NSAIDs with a high degree of protein binding may remain in inflamed tissues or synovial fluid for a longer time than in the plasma (Figure 4). For example, diclofenac 75 mg (enteric-coated) reaches peak concentrations in the synovial fluid that exceed plasma concentrations at 4 hours after oral administration in patients with arthritis; these high and persistent synovial levels are maintained above or near the expected IC 80 for COX-2 for up to 12 hours after dosing, with rapid disappearance of diclofenac from the plasma, even after repeated dosing. The persistence of certain NSAIDs (eg, diclofenac, ibuprofen) in the synovial fluid is associated with a sustained therapeutic effect despite relatively rapid clearance from the plasma, vascular wall, and kidneys, indicating that accumulation at sites of inflammation may allow for continued anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity. The localization of COX activity to inflamed tissue and the resulting ability to use lower doses than might otherwise be required also minimizes COX inhibition at sites associated with potential side effects (eg, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal adverse effects).

### Cyclooxygenase 2 and the kidney [^116R9PeN]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Cyclooxygenase metabolizes arachidonic acid to a family of bioactive fatty acids designated prostaglandins. Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase exist, designated COX1 and COX2. These isoforms are expressed in distinct but important areas of the kidney. COX1 predominates in vascular smooth muscle and collecting ducts, whereas COX2 predominates in the macula densa and nearby cells in the cortical thick ascending limb. COX2 is also highly expressed in medullary interstitial cells. Whereas COX1 expression does not exhibit dynamic regulation, COX2 expression is subject to regulation by several environmental conditions, including salt intake, water intake, medullary tonicity, growth factors, cytokines, and adrenal steroids. Recently, COX2-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have become widely available. Many of the renal effects of non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (including sodium retention, decreased glomerular filtration rate, and effects on renin-angiotensin levels) appear to be mediated by the inhibition of COX2 rather than COX1. Therefore, in contrast to the gastrointestinal-sparing effects of COX2-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, when considering the kidney, the same caution must be applied when using COX2-selective inhibitors as has been used with traditional non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### Cardiovascular pharmacology of nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and coxibs: clinical considerations [^111U5cNp]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors have been developed with the goal of providing similar efficacy and greater safety compared with traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Development was based on the hypothesis that COX-1 is the housekeeping enzyme necessary for production of prostaglandins (PGs) with homeostatic functions, whereas COX-2 is a mediator of pathophysiologic processes. However, later research has demonstrated a role of COX-2 in production of PGs that have functions under normal physiologic conditions. In the vasculature, COX-2 seems to be the main enzyme responsible for the production of prostacyclin. Increased synthesis of this vasodilatory and antithrombotic PG represents a homeostatic response during periods of accelerated platelet-vessel wall interactions and counteracts increased synthesis of COX-1-derived prothrombotic prostanoid thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)). The clinical sequelae of inhibiting prostacyclin activity in the absence of concomitant inhibition of TXA(2) are not currently clear. Animal studies show that inhibition of prostacyclin activity does not lead to spontaneous thrombosis but may increase response to thrombotic stimuli. Therefore, prostacyclin synthesis may be important for limiting thrombotic events in patients who are at an increased cardiovascular risk. Overviews of clinical studies in arthritis and Alzheimer's disease have not demonstrated increased cardiovascular risk associated with specific COX-2 inhibition in most patients. However, data from 1 clinical trial revealed a 5-fold divergence in rates of myocardial infarction between a coxib and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug comparitor. Credible explanations for the results of this trial have been proposed and further studies are necessary to clarify the relative risk-to-benefit ratio of COX-2 inhibition in patients at increased risk for cardiovascular events, and the effects of concomitant aspirin therapy.

### Lessons from 20 years with COX-2 inhibitors: importance of dose-response considerations and fair play in comparative trials [^114hsybq]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which forms prostaglandins involved in pain and inflammation. COX inhibitors have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, but also increase risks for gastrointestinal ulcers, bleeding, and renal and cardiovascular adverse events. Identification of two isoforms of COX, COX-1 and COX-2, led to the development of selective COX-2 inhibitors, which were launched as having fewer gastrointestinal side effects since gastroprotective prostaglandins produced via COX-1 are spared. The balance between COX-1 mediated prothrombotic thromboxane and COX-2 mediated antithrombotic prostacyclin is important for thrombotic risk. An increased risk of suffering myocardial infarction and death with COX-2 inhibitor treatment is well established from clinical trials and observational research. Rofecoxib (Vioxx) was withdrawn from the market for this reason, but the equally COX-2 selective etoricoxib has replaced it in Europe but not in the United States. The "traditional" NSAID diclofenac is as COX-2 selective as celecoxib and increases cardiovascular risk dose dependently. COX inhibitor dosages should be lower in osteoarthritis than in rheumatoid arthritis. Randomized trials comparing COX-2 inhibitors with NSAIDs have exaggerated their gastrointestinal benefits by using maximal NSAID doses regardless of indication, and/or hidden the cardiovascular risk by comparing with COX-2 selective diclofenac instead of low-dose ibuprofen or naproxen. Observational studies show increased cardiovascular risks within weeks of treatment with COX-2 inhibitors and high doses of NSAIDs other than naproxen, which is the safest alternative. COX inhibitors are symptomatic drugs that should be used intermittently at the lowest effective dosage, especially among individuals with an increased cardiovascular risk.

### Renal and cardiovascular effects of selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors [^114SGTew]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was proposed as a novel anti-inflammatory and analgesic treatment with a reduced profile of gastrointestinal side effects compared with conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Although perceived as an inducible enzyme by inflammatory and other stimuli, COX-2 is constitutively expressed in the kidney. In this review, we focus on renal and cardiovascular (CV) physiological and pathophysiological characteristics of COX-2 and renal and CV aspects of treatment with selective COX-2 inhibitors. Both clinical and experimental studies have shown that renal and CV effects of COX-2 inhibitors are similar to those of NSAIDs. These effects include sodium, potassium, and water retention and decreases in renal function, as well as mild to modest increases in blood pressure (BP) and edema. These deleterious effects are amplified in patients with volume and/or sodium depletion. The concomitant administration of COX-2 inhibitors may destabilize BP control in hypertensive patients treated with antihypertensive agents. In contrast to the normal kidney, which could constitute a target for adverse actions of COX-2 inhibitors, recent experimental studies showed increased renal COX-2 expression in several models of renal injury, such as the remnant kidney, renovascular hypertension, and diabetes, and implicated COX-2 in the progression of renal failure. This suggests that COX-2 inhibitors may confer a renoprotective effect in diverse renal disorders. These intriguing formulations must be delineated further in appropriately designed prospective clinical trials.

### Efficacy of cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitors [^111py4GQ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit both cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The clinical efficacy of NSAIDs is primarily related to the inhibition of COX-2 activity, whereas much of the toxicity, particularly gastrointestinal toxicity, is related to COX-1 inhibition. In vitro and in vivo assays indicate that both COX-2-specific inhibitors and conventional NSAIDs are equally effective in inhibiting COX-2, suggesting that the clinical efficacy of COX-2-specific inhibitors should be similar to that of conventional NSAIDs. Multiple studies in patients with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and acute pain have now confirmed that the clinical efficacy of COX-2-specific inhibitors is similar to that of conventional NSAIDs.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are well recognised as causing peptic ulceration and ulcer complications. However, several critical issues, including the amount of both gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disease affected by NSAIDs, their interaction with ancillary risk factors, and how to optimise management in subgroups, remain poorly understood. In this article, strategies for subgroups that take account of non-specific gastrointestinal risks, minimisation of residual risk, and the importance of non-gastrointestinal toxicity are suggested, and areas for research identified.

Given the importance of constitutive COX-2 to our understanding of the cardiovascular and renal side effects of NSAIDs, in the present study, we have addressed its role in the control of regional blood flow for a wide range of tissue sites, including the kidney. We have done this by determining the effect of acute COX-2 inhibition on local regional blood flow throughout the body and mapped this to the distribution of COX-2 across the same tissues.

### An evidence-based review of the cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^111y8d1x]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), both nonselective and cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitors, are commonly used medications for the relief of acute and chronic pain associated with a wide range of medical conditions. Because of the extensive use of these agents, adverse events that occur infrequently may still affect the overall risk/benefit ratio of this class of medications. Serious adverse cardiovascular (CV) events have been reported with NSAID use, but unfortunately, definitive evidence regarding the precise CV risk associated with these drugs, as a class and individually, is lacking. Therefore, it is an issue of public health importance that physicians be guided by careful assessment of the existing evidence to make reasonable choices in prescribing these medications. The investigators review the key clinical trials, meta-analyses of clinical trials, and epidemiologic studies on the subject of the CV safety of NSAIDs and identify key variables that define the CV risk of the NSAIDs. In conclusion, it is important that cardiologists, who are not among those physicians frequently prescribing NSAIDs, have a particular responsibility to have up-to-date, thoughtfully synthesized information about the CV risks of these drugs, especially when administered to patients receiving low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection.

### Cardiovascular effects and safety of (non-aspirin) NSAIDs [^11353vMC]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective, widely used analgesics. For the past 2 decades, considerable attention has been focused on their cardiovascular safety. After early studies indicating an association between NSAID use and increased risks of heart failure and elevated blood pressure, subsequent studies found a link between NSAID use and an increased risk of thrombotic events. Selective cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) inhibitors (also known as coxibs) have been associated with the greatest risk of adverse vascular effects but concern also relates to non-selective NSAIDs, especially those with strong COX2 inhibition such as diclofenac. Although NSAID use is discouraged in patients with cardiovascular disease, pain-relief medication is often required and, in the absence of analgesics that are at least as effective but safer, NSAIDs are frequently prescribed. Furthermore, non-prescription use of NSAIDs, even among people with underlying cardiovascular risks, is largely unsupervised and varies widely between countries. As concern mounts about the disadvantages of alternatives to NSAIDs (such as opioids) for pain management, the use of NSAIDs is likely to rise. Given that the pharmaceutical development pipeline lacks new analgesics, health-care professionals, patients and medicine regulatory authorities are focused on optimizing the safe use of NSAIDs. In this Review, we summarize the current evidence on the cardiovascular safety of NSAIDs and present an approach for their use in the context of holistic pain management.

Conclusions

Scarpignato et al. have produced a valuable summary of the current state of knowledge about the GI and CV risks of both nsNSAIDs and COX-2 selective drugs, which will be helpful for clinicians managing patients with osteoarthritis. As they emphasize, there are still uncertainties regarding CV risk profiles of commonly used NSAIDs, and results of some ongoing research directed at this are anticipated.

### Cyclooxygenases, the kidney, and hypertension [^111hNpyZ]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors that are in widespread clinical use were developed to avoid side effects of conventional NSAIDs, including gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. However, COX-2 is constitutively expressed in the kidney and is highly regulated in response to alterations in intravascular volume. COX-2 metabolites have been implicated in maintenance of renal blood flow, mediation of renin release, and regulation of sodium excretion. COX-2 inhibition may transiently decrease urine sodium excretion in some subjects and induce mild to moderate elevation of blood pressure. Furthermore, in conditions of relative intravascular volume depletion and/or renal hypoperfusion, interference with COX-2 activity can have deleterious effects on maintenance of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. In addition to physiological regulation of COX-2 expression in the kidney, increased renal cortical COX-2 expression is seen in experimental models associated with altered renal hemodynamics and progressive renal injury (decreased renal mass, poorly controlled diabetes), and long-term treatment with selective COX-2 inhibitors ameliorates functional and structural renal damage in these conditions.

### COX inhibitors and breast cancer [^112LSf83]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

So where does this leave us in assessing the role of COX-2 inhibition for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer in the clinical setting? Certainly, there is little evidence at present that these drugs are effective treatments for established breast cancer. Work is currently in progress to investigate the possible role of COX inhibitors in limiting the development of invasive breast cancer from ductal carcinoma- in situ. Also, clinical trials are being conducted to study the use of specific COX-2 inhibitors both alone and in combination with other agents in early and advanced breast cancer.

There seems to be a small but potentially significant protective role of NSAIDs on breast cancer risk. It is not clear if aspirin use is associated with a different risk reduction compared with other NSAIDs and, indeed, selective COX-2 inhibitors and questions remain over drug dosage and patient selection. Table 1 summarises the available data for an association between COX and breast cancer.

While several mechanisms have been suggested for the anticancer action of COX inhibitors, it remains unclear which is the most important and, indeed, whether inhibition of COX-2 is the sole reason for the effects observed in this context. Also, if there is a protective role to be played by COX inhibitors in breast cancer, there are questions of how much drug should be taken and for how long. Concern over the long-term safety of conventional NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors has recently been highlighted. In evaluating the potential use of NSAIDS in cancer chemoprophylaxis, the safety profile of these drugs is as important as their efficacy.

On the face of it, at the end of this review, the reader has probably been left with more questions than there are answers. However, if the use of aspirin and other NSAIDs is associated with reduced incidence of breast cancer, this could have a major public health impact. Work is in progress to detail the possible link of COX-2 inhibition and breast cancer, and also to assess the long-term safety and hence viability of this potentially valuable and viable chemopreventative approach.

### Cyclooxygenase inhibition and thrombogenicity [^111rH54n]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 catalyze the formation of prothrombotic and antithrombotic eicosanoids, respectively. Aspirin, conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and COX-2-specific inhibitors exhibit different patterns of inhibition of COX-1-mediated thromboxane biosynthesis and COX-2-mediated prostacyclin biosynthesis. The relationship between the pharmacologic inhibition of these vasoactive eicosanoids and the thromboprophylaxis or thrombogenicity exhibited by different therapeutic agents is currently unclear. Future studies are needed to assess the antithrombotic properties of commonly used NSAIDs, the hypothetical thrombogenicity of COX-2-specific inhibitors in high-risk patients, the need for concomitant aspirin with selective versus nonselective COX inhibitors, and the antiplatelet and gastric toxicity of the aspirin/COX-2-specific inhibitor combination in comparison with the aspirin/conventional NSAID combination.

Arachidonic acid metabolism and aspirin mechanism — Arachidonic acid, a 20-carbon fatty acid containing four double bonds, is liberated from the sn2 position in membrane phospholipids and is converted by cytosolic prostaglandin H synthases to the unstable intermediate prostaglandin H2; the synthases are colloquially termed "cyclooxygenases" and exist in two forms, COX-1 and COX-2. Low-dose aspirin selectively inhibits COX-1, and high-dose aspirin inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2, and prostaglandin H2 is converted by tissue-specific isomerases to multiple prostanoids that activate specific cell membrane receptors.

### Adverse renal effects of anti-inflammatory agents: evaluation of selective and nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors [^112RT61P]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), i.e. nonselective cyclooxygenase COX inhibitors have well-documented nephrotoxicity. Adverse renal effects occur because of inhibition of the synthesis of cyclooxygenase-derived prostaglandins which act to modulate pathologic processes that would normally impair various renal functions. The introduction of the selective COX-2 inhibitors raised hope that this class of drugs would reduce injury in both the gastrointestinal tract and the kidneys. Animal and human data, however, suggest that COX-2 synthesized prostaglandins are important in the modulation of renal physiology during adverse conditions. Hence, it appears that these drugs are equal in causing nephrotoxicity as the nonselective COX inhibitors.

### Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-independent anticarcinogenic effects of selective COX-2 inhibitors [^1148QRiy]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2006). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) appear to reduce the risk of developing cancer. One mechanism through which NSAIDs act to reduce carcinogenesis is to inhibit the activity of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme that is overexpressed in various cancer tissues. Overexpression of COX-2 increases cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. However, selective COX-2 inhibitors can also act through COX-independent mechanisms. In this review, we describe the COX-2-independent molecular targets of these COX-2 inhibitors and discuss how these targets may be involved in the anticarcinogenic activities of these selective COX-2 inhibitors. We also compare the concentrations of these inhibitors used in in vitro and in vivo experiments and discuss the implications of the in vitro studies for clinical management of cancer with these drugs.

### Cardiovascular risk and inhibition of cyclooxygenase: a systematic review of the observational studies of selective and nonselective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 2 [^111zr1yf]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Evidence that rofecoxib increases the risk of myocardial infarction has led to scrutiny of other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Regulatory agencies have provided variable advice regarding the cardiovascular risks with older nonselective NSAIDs.

Objective

To undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled observational studies to compare the risks of serious cardiovascular events with individual NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors.

Data Sources

Searches were conducted of electronic databases (1985–2006), scientific meeting proceedings, epidemiological research Web sites, and bibliographies of eligible studies.

Study Selection

Eligible studies were of case-control or cohort design, reported on cardiovascular events (predominantly myocardial infarction) with cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, NSAID use, or both with nonuse/remote use of the drugs as the reference exposure. Of 7086 potentially eligible titles, 17 case-control and 6 cohort studies were included. Thirteen studies reported on cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors, 23 on NSAIDs, and 13 on both groups of drugs.

Data Extraction

Two people independently extracted data and assessed study quality with disagreements resolved by consensus.

Data Synthesis

Data were combined using a random-effects model. A dose-related risk was evident with rofecoxib, summary relative risk with 25 mg/d or less, 1.33 (95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.79) and 2.19 (95% CI, 1.64–2.91) with more than 25 mg/d. The risk was elevated during the first month of treatment. Celecoxib was not associated with an elevated risk of vascular occlusion, summary relative risk 1.06 (95% CI, 0.91–1.23). Among older nonselective drugs, diclofenac had the highest risk with a summary relative risk of 1.40 (95% CI, 1.16–1.70). The other drugs had summary relative risks close to 1: naproxen, 0.97 (95% CI, 0.87–1.07); piroxicam, 1.06 (95% CI, 0.70–1.59); and ibuprofen, 1.07 (95% CI, 0.97–1.18).

Conclusions

This review confirms the findings from randomized trials regarding the risk of cardiovascular events with rofecoxib and suggests that celecoxib in commonly used doses may not increase the risk, contradicts claims of a protective effect of naproxen, and raises serious questions about the safety of diclofenac, an older drug.

### Selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors: cardiovascular and gastrointestinal toxicity [^115Cxc9N]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2001). Low credibility.

The introduction of selective inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase-2 to the marketplace has been much anticipated for several years. It would appear that these compounds have lived up to the expectations of having reduced gastrointestinal toxicity and, at least for some indications, of efficacy similar to that of conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that cyclo-oxygenase-2 plays a very important role in gastrointestinal mucosal defence, particularly in situations in which the mucosa is damaged or inflamed. Moreover, physiological roles for cyclo-oxygenase-2 both in the renal and cardiovascular systems are becoming better recognized. Inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-2 can lead to peripheral oedema and hypertension, and may promote thrombosis. Indeed, there is recent evidence of increased rates of myocardial infarction in arthritis patients taking a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor. Use of low-dose aspirin concurrently with use of a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor may provide some degree of protection against the potential cardiovascular toxicity of the latter but both laboratory and clinical studies suggest that the concomitant use of these two types of drugs results in gastrointestinal ulceration comparable to what is seen with conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These recent results suggest that care must be exercised in the use of selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors by individuals who are at increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, and the use of low-dose aspirin by these patients may place them at increased risk of gastrointestinal complications.

### Ibuprofen and famotidine [^1132tQzm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Ibuprofen and famotidine tablet is a fixed-combination tablet of ibuprofen and famotidine. The ibuprofen component has analgesic, anti- inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of the ibuprofen component of ibuprofen and famotidine tablet, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).

Ibuprofen is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Ibuprofen concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because ibuprofen is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to an increase of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.

Famotidine is a competitive inhibitor of histamine H2-receptors. The primary clinically important pharmacologic activity of famotidine is inhibition of gastric secretion. Both the acid concentration and volume of gastric secretion are suppressed by famotidine, while changes in pepsin secretion are proportional to volume output.

Systemic effects of famotidine in the CNS, cardiovascular, respiratory, or endocrine systems were not noted in clinical pharmacology studies. Also, no antiandrogenic effects were noted. Serum hormone levels, including prolactin, cortisol, thyroxine (T4), and testosterone, were not altered after treatment with famotidine.

### Do selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors and traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increase the risk of atherothrombosis? Meta-analysis of randomised trials [^1149MNsB]. BMJ (2006). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the effects of selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX 2) inhibitors and traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the risk of vascular events.

Design

Meta-analysis of published and unpublished tabular data from randomised trials, with indirect estimation of the effects of traditional NSAIDs.

Data Sources

Medline and Embase (January 1966 to April 2005); Food and Drug Administration records; and data on file from Novartis, Pfizer, and Merck.

Review Methods

Eligible studies were randomised trials that included a comparison of a selective COX 2 inhibitor versus placebo or a selective COX 2 inhibitor versus a traditional NSAID, of at least four weeks' duration, with information on serious vascular events (defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death). Individual investigators and manufacturers provided information on the number of patients randomised, numbers of vascular events, and the person time of follow-up for each randomised group.

Results

In placebo comparisons, allocation to a selective COX 2 inhibitor was associated with a 42% relative increase in the incidence of serious vascular events (1.2%/year v 0.9%/year; rate ratio 1.42, 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 1.78; P = 0.003), with no significant heterogeneity among the different selective COX 2 inhibitors. This was chiefly attributable to an increased risk of myocardial infarction (0.6%/year v 0.3%/year; 1.86, 1.33 to 2.59; P = 0.0003), with little apparent difference in other vascular outcomes. Among trials of at least one year's duration (mean 2.7 years), the rate ratio for vascular events was 1.45 (1.12 to 1.89; P = 0.005). Overall, the incidence of serious vascular events was similar between a selective COX 2 inhibitor and any traditional NSAID (1.0%/year v 0.9%/year; 1.16, 0.97 to 1.38; P = 0.1). However, statistical heterogeneity (P = 0.001) was found between trials of a selective COX 2 inhibitor versus naproxen (1.57, 1.21 to 2.03) and of a selective COX 2 inhibitor versus non-naproxen NSAIDs (0.88, 0.69 to 1.12). The summary rate ratio for vascular events, compared with placebo, was 0.92 (0.67 to 1.26) for naproxen, 1.51 (0.96 to 2.37) for ibuprofen, and 1.63 (1.12 to 2.37) for diclofenac.

Conclusions

Selective COX 2 inhibitors are associated with a moderate increase in the risk of vascular events, as are high dose regimens of ibuprofen and diclofenac, but high dose naproxen is not associated with such an excess.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^1146VPJ5]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

The first non-opioid analgesics (phenazone, paracetamol, and aspirin) were found by serendipity more than 100 years ago. Later, systematic research identified their mode of action as inhibition of prostanoid production. The development of animal models of pain and inflammation led to the discovery of a host of new NSAIDs (eg, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen), many of which were acidic, highly protein-bound compounds that generally showed similar therapeutic effects and side effects related to their inhibitory activity on prostanoid synthesis.

NSAIDs inhibit prostanoid biosynthesis through their activity on the COX enzymes COX-1 and COX-2. The two COX isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2) have different functions, and the inhibition of these isoforms results in different therapeutic effects and side effects. Efforts to avoid the gastrointestinal side effects associated with COX-1 inhibitionled to the development of selective COX-2 inhibitors called "coxibs", which were designed to inhibit COX-2 while sparing COX-1 at therapeutic doses. Evidence of increased risk of myocardial infarction and other thrombotic events led to concerns over the cardiovascular safety of coxibs, resulting in the withdrawal of rofecoxib from the market in 2004. However, traditional NSAIDs, which inhibit COX-2 without sustained inhibition of platelet COX-1, may also be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, particularly at high doses.–

Introduction

Cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes catalyze the metabolic conversion of arachidonic acid to prostanoids including prostaglandins (PGs), prostacyclin, and thromboxane, which play important roles in human physiology and various pathological conditions –. Despite several known side effects like myocardial infarction and atherothrombotic events, drugs aimed at COXs inhibition is a billion dollar industry, inspiring scientists to search constantly for novel COX inhibitors. COX exists in three isoforms: cyclooxygenase-1, 2, and 3 (COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3) –. COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms are of primary interest, as they are involved in physiological as well as pathological processes. COX-1 is a constitutively expressed house-keeping isozyme responsible for the basal production of essential PGs. These PGs mediates homoeostatic functions in the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular system. COX-3 (a splice variant of COX-1) is expressed only in specific parts of the brain and spinal cord and its exact functions are still unclear. In contrast, COX-2 isozyme is expressed at very low levels under normal conditions. However, COX-2 expression is rapidly upregulated in the immediate response to diverse pro-inflammatory and pathogenic stimuli. There is accumulating evidence for the critical involvement of COX-2 in various pathologies that include inflammation, cancer –, neurodegenerative diseasesand multidrug resistance. Therefore, beyond their traditional use as anti-inflammatory agents, COX-2 inhibitors have recently been used for molecular imaging – and therapy – of cancer. Hence, the development of selective COX-2 inhibitors as anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor drugs is a major direction in academic research and pharmaceutical industry –. Traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen) inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms; and their use is limited due to associated ulcerogenic and gastrointestinal side effects. Discovered in the late 1990's, COX-2 selective inhibitors (the COXIBs: celecoxib, rofecoxib) are diarylheterocycles possessing a SO 2 NH 2 or SO 2 Me group as COX-2 pharmacophore, which exert similar anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties as traditional NSAIDs but are devoid of gastrointestinal toxicity. However, COXIBs are also under scrutiny since several studies have demonstrated that chronic use of COXIBs can elevate the risk of myocardial infarction and other thrombotic events by stalling the biosynthesis of anti-aggregatory prostacyclin (PGI 2) while leaving the biosynthesis of pro-thrombotic thromboxane A 2 (TxA 2) unaffected –. As a result, COXIBs such as rofecoxib and valdecoxib were withdrawn from the market thereby leaving a demand for the synthesis and screening of novel COX-2 inhibitors.

### Antiprostaglandin drugs [^112aHgz5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Prostaglandins create conditions favorable for activation and stimulation of labor and are key components in the process of both normal and preterm labor. Antiprostaglandins may be useful in the prevention of preterm labor because they inhibit prostaglandin synthetase and reduce prostaglandin formation. The antiprostaglandin indomethacin has been the most studied as a tocolytic agent, but its success is limited because of fetal and neonatal complications associated with prolonged use. More recently, the cyclooxygenase-2 specific agents have been investigated because of their improved side effect profile. This article discusses the process of prostaglandin production and inhibition and reviews and critiques the available literature investigating the efficacy and safety of indomethacin and the newer cyclooxygenase-2 agents.

### COX-2 inhibitors and the cardiovascular system [^117DppQ6]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors (coxibs) represent a new class of non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that exhibit preference for inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the COX isoform thought to account largely for prostanoid formation in inflammation. We review the divergent incidence of cardiovascular events derived from the two large clinical trials of coxibs, the Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research Trial (VIGOR) and the Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS), in the context of current understanding of relevant clinical and basic pharmacology. The incidence of cardiovascular events was higher in patients receiving rofecoxib than in those receiving naproxen in VIGOR and did not differ between the groups in CLASS. By contrast, while the primary gastrointestinal (GI) endpoint comparison favored rofecoxib in VIGOR, no significant difference in the incidence of the primary GI endpoint was evident between celecoxib and two NSAID comparators not attained in CLASS. The cardiovascular results in VIGOR may have resulted from chance, a cardioprotective effect of naproxen, or suppression of prostacyclin but not thromboxane on rofecoxib. Differences in cardiovascular outcome between the two trials may also have resulted either from chance, or from aspects of the trial design (such as the use of aspirin by roughly one-fifth of the participants in CLASS), or from differences in the COX-2 selectivity or other pharmacology of the coxibs. Individuals who warrant low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection may have less likelihood of a GI event if they combine aspirin with rofecoxib, rather than a traditional NSAID. However, evidence addressing directly this hypothesis is currently unavailable. On the other hand, coxib consumption alone does not currently warrant initiation of a cardioprotective regimen, such as low-dose aspirin.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^1129QNzS]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

During the inflammatory response, COX-dependent prostanoids play a role in the development of hyperalgesia. PGE 2 and PGI 2 increase the sensitivity of pain receptors (or nociceptors) in the periphery and enhance the activity of various pain mediators. Peripheral inflammation is also associated with upregulation of COX-2 and an increase in PGE 2 in the central nervous system, while contributing to the development of central hyperalgesia. The role of COX-2 in the development of central hyperalgesia has been demonstrated in an engineered mouse model, in which conditional deletion of the gene for COX-2 in neurons and glial cells of the central nervous system resulted in the reduction of peripheral inflammation–induced COX-2 expression in the spinal cord and of mechanical hypersensitivity related to joint movement or tenderness to touch.

In general, NSAIDs inhibit prostanoid synthesis by competitive and transient inhibition of arachidonic acid binding to the COX active site. The therapeutic effects of NSAIDs largely result from COX-2 inhibition at sites of inflammation, while many of the side effects associated with NSAIDs, particularly gastrointestinal side effects, are attributed to inhibition of the protective effects of prostanoids produced by COX-1. Although all NSAIDs generally act by inhibition of arachidonic acid binding at COX, the mechanism of action of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) differs fundamentally from that of non-aspirin NSAIDs in that it causes an irreversible inactivation of COX-1 and COX-2 in most patients, preventing the oxidative conversion of arachidonic acid to PGG 2 and PGH 2. In non-nucleated platelets, this effect confers persistent inhibition of COX-1–mediated TxA 2 production and platelet function throughout the dosing interval. Acetaminophen also differs from other NSAIDs in that it has no measurable anti-inflammatory effects at therapeutic doses, but primarily inhibits prostanoid-mediated hyperalgesia through suppression of PGE 2 biosynthesis.–

Inhibition of prostanoid biosynthesis by NSAIDs is responsible for the therapeutic activities of these drugs;, however, this inhibitory activity also suppresses other effects of these prostanoids, resulting in the side effects associated with NSAID treatment. For example, inhibition of PGE 2 production may reduce hyperalgesia but may also reduce the tissue-protective effects of this prostanoid in various organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, vascular wall, kidney, and lung.

Biomarkers to predict drug responses

The use of biochemical markers of COX inhibition may assist clinicians in the rational selection of an appropriate NSAID dose to achieve efficacy; this dose should be the lowest effective dose to limit the risk of adverse events. However, differences in the efficacy and tolerability of NSAIDs have been observed between individuals, resulting from genetic factors that affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of NSAIDs (Figure 6). For example, cytochrome (CYP) enzymes are responsible for the metabolism of approximately 70%–80% of all drugs, including several NSAIDs, and interindividual differences in CYP450 expression can therefore result in altered metabolism of some NSAIDs. A number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the genetic sequence of CYP2C9 have been described, and the product of one of these altered genes, CYP2C9*2, is associated with reduced metabolism of celecoxib and an accompanying increase in CYP2C9*2 plasma concentration within 4 hours of administration in healthy individuals.

In addition to interindividual variability in COX inhibition, the individual's clinical background, particularly gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risk factors, should also be considered as important predictors of the risk of adverse reactions due to NSAIDs. Together, these factors should be used to select an NSAID and dose that will be both effective and well tolerated, and to help guide individualized treatment strategies.

Studies are ongoing to verify the feasibility of using of biochemical markers of COX isozyme inhibition ex vivo and in vivo together with genetic biomarkers to identify individuals at accelerated risk of developing cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse events by NSAID administration.

### Molecular targets of aspirin and cancer prevention [^115ykUWB]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Proposed mechanisms of action

Aspirin's molecular mechanism of action was discovered in the 1970s when it was demonstrated that it irreversibly acetylates and inactivates the cyclooxygenase enzyme (prostaglandin H-synthase). The COX enzymes are involved in the synthesis of cyclic endoperoxides from arachidonic acid (AA) forming prostaglandins, prostacyclins and thromboxanes, which have a wide array of effects. Aspirin is unique because it is the only non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that irreversibly inactivates both isoforms of the COX enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2), which bring about its anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic effects. Although the precise mechanisms by which aspirin exerts its anticancer effects are yet to be elucidated, both COX-dependent and independent mechanisms have been proposed.

### Celecoxib [^113BuMKt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Celecoxib has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.

The mechanism of action of celecoxib is believed to be due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, primarily via inhibition of COX-2.

Celecoxib is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Celecoxib concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Since celecoxib is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Platelets

In clinical trials using normal volunteers, celecoxib at single doses up to 800 mg and multiple doses of 600 mg twice daily for up to 7 days duration (higher than recommended therapeutic doses) had no effect on reduction of platelet aggregation or increase in bleeding time. Because of its lack of platelet effects, celecoxib is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis. It is not known if there are any effects of celecoxib on platelets that may contribute to the increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic adverse events associated with the use of celecoxib.

Fluid Retention

Inhibition of PGE2 synthesis may lead to sodium and water retention through increased reabsorption in the renal medullary thick ascending loop of Henle and perhaps other segments of the distal nephron. In the collecting ducts, PGE2 appears to inhibit water reabsorption by counteracting the action of antidiuretic hormone.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Celecoxib exhibits dose-proportional increase in exposure after oral administration up to 200 mg twice daily and less than proportional increase at higher doses. It has extensive distribution and high protein binding. It is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9 with a half-life of approximately 11 hours.

Absorption

Peak plasma levels of celecoxib occur approximately 3 hours after an oral dose. Under fasting conditions, both peak plasma levels (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) are roughly dose-proportional up to 200 mg twice daily; at higher doses there are less than proportional increases in Cmaxand AUC (see Food Effects). Absolute bioavailability studies have not been conducted. With multiple dosing, steady-state conditions are reached on or before Day 5. The pharmacokinetic parameters of celecoxib in a group of healthy subjects are shown in Table 4.

### Nephrotoxic potential of selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors [^113FKM95]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the relative nephrotoxic potential of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1996-February 2004) identified clinical trials evaluating the nephrotoxicity of COX-2 inhibitors versus traditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Key search terms included cyclooxygenase inhibitors, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, nephrotoxicity, and chemically induced.

Data Synthesis

Three clinical trials determined that COX-2 inhibitors have similar adverse effects on the kidney when compared with nonselective NSAIDs, while 2 studies concluded that COX-2 inhibitors are less nephrotoxic than nonselective NSAIDs. All 5 trials utilized low numbers of subjects, short-term therapy, and surrogate markers of kidney damage.

Conclusions

COX-2 inhibitors may not offer distinct advantages over nonselective NSAIDs with respect to kidney function. Longer trials in patients with comorbidities are warranted. These agents should be used cautiously or not at all in patients with predisposing conditions.

### Aspirin: new cardiovascular uses for an old drug [^116f9Wmv]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Inhibition of TXA2-dependent platelet function by aspirin may lead to prevention of thrombosis as well as to excess bleeding. The balance between the two depends critically on the absolute thrombotic versus hemorrhagic risk of the patient. As the risk of experiencing a major vascular event increases, so does the absolute benefit of antiplatelet prophylaxis with aspirin [Figure-see text]. The antithrombotic effect of aspirin does not appear to be dose related over a wide range of daily doses (30 to 1,300 mg), an observation consistent with saturability of platelet COX-1 inhibition by aspirin at very low doses. In contrast, GI toxicity of the drug does appear to be dose related, consistent with dose- and dosing interval-dependent inhibition of COX-1 activity in the nucleated lining cells of the GI mucosa. Thus, aspirin once daily is recommended in all clinical conditions where antiplatelet therapy is effective. Because of safety considerations, physicians are encouraged to use the lowest dose of aspirin shown effective in each clinical setting [Table-see text].

### Antimetastatic activity of a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor [^111UcY1M]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), is produced in large amounts by some tumours and has been implicated in the promotion and growth of malignant tumours. PGE 2 is produced from arachidonic acid by either of two enzymes: COX-1 is expressed constitutively in most tissues whereas COX-2 is predominantly inducible but these classifications are not absolute. Cyclooxygenase-2 is markedly increased at sites of inflammation and at sites of proliferation such as within tumours One of the mechanisms by which PGE 2 may support tumour growth is by inducing angiogenesis necessary to supply oxygen and nutrients to tumours. Cyclooxygenase-2 expression has been observed in newly formed blood vessels within tumours, whereas under normal physiological conditions the quiescent vasculature expresses only the constitutive COX-1 enzyme.

Growth, invasion and metastasis of many cancers depend on angiogenesis. The current view is that the net balance between endogenous angiogenesis stimulators and inhibitors regulates the 'switch to the angiogenic phenotype'. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/vascular permeability factor (VPF) is the most potent angiogenic factor identified. VEGF induces both the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells in vitro while inhibiting endothelial cell apoptosis. Therapeutic blockade of VEGF has been shown to inhibit primary and metastatic tumour growth in animal models, which has been attributed to an antiangiogenic effect. We and others have recently shown that VEGF can also act as a survival factor for tumour cells, protecting them from apoptosis.

Although there are many studies showing that COX-2 inhibitors have antitumour activity many of these have used chemically induced tumours and there are few, if any, studies examining antimetastatic effects of COX inhibition. We examined the antimetastatic activity of COX-2 inhibitors in an orthotopic model following excision of the primary tumour and in an experimental metastasis model.

### Antimetastatic activity of a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor [^11779SfE]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

In most cancer patients, metastases are already present at time of diagnosis and while surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for primary tumours it may paradoxically enhance growth of residual or metastatic disease. This may occur as a consequence of an alteration in the balance between pro- and antiangiogenic factors as part of the healing process and removal of the tumour can of itself stimulate tumour growth by removing the source of angiostatin. There is an increase in growth factors in the immediate postoperative period and although angiogenesis is essential for wound healing it also plays a key role in the growth and metastasis of tumours. In addition, surgical manipulation may also increase tumour cell dissemination into the bloodstream resulting in the seeding of tumour cells in distant organs and the establishment of metastases. As most cancer patients ultimately die of metastatic disease, it is important to develop therapies that are effective against metastases.

Several studies show that regularly taking aspirin or other conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) provides a 40–50% reduction in the relative risk of death by colon cancer, indicating that inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), both COX-1 and COX-2, has a chemopreventive effect. In rodent models of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), a genetic disease leading to colon carcinoma, blockade of COX-2, either by gene deletion or pharmacological inhibition of enzyme activity, suppresses intestinal polyp formation. Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition also demonstrates chemopreventive activity against colon carcinogenesis in rodent models. NSAIDS inhibit the activity of both COX enzymes and consequently can inhibit or abolish the effects of prostaglandins. Selective inhibition of the COX-2 isoform has reduced toxicity profile compared to inhibition of both isoforms. It has been suggested that arachidonic acid, the substrate for COX-2, induces apoptosis and that depletion of arachidonic acid by COX-2 activity decreases apoptosis. We previously demonstrated that COX inhibition reduced the growth of a primary tumour, number and incidence of spontaneous metastases accompanied by increased apoptosis and decreased microvessel density in the primary tumour.

### Analgesia and COX-2 inhibition [^114DZWH9]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

While non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the mainstay of therapy for the management of acute pain and rheumatoid arthritis, toxicity associated with chronic administration limits their benefit-to-risk relationship in many patients. A series of studies is reviewed that assesses the relationship between cytokines released at the site of tissue injury and NSAID analgesia, and the in vivo selectivity of a selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor (celecoxib) in comparison to a dual COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor (ketorolac). Three replicate studies in the oral surgery model of acute pain used submucosal microdialysis sample collection for the measurement of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2; a product of both COX-1 and COX-2) and thromboxane B2 (as a biomarker for COX-1 activity) with parallel assessments of pain. The time course of PGE2 production was consistent with early release due to COX-1 activity followed by increased production 2–3 hours after surgery, consistent with COX-2 expression. Ketorolac 30 mg at pain onset suppressed both pain and peripheral PGE2 levels. Ketorolac 1 mg either at the site of injury or intramuscularly also produced analgesia but without any effect on peripheral PGE2 levels. Celecoxib selectively suppressed PGE2 but not TxB2 at time points consistent with COX-2 activity, while producing analgesia. These studies demonstrate the ability to assess the time course and selective effects of COX-2 inhibitors in vivo and suggest that suppression of COX-2 mediated PGE2 is temporally related to NSAID analgesia.

### Prostaglandin pathways: opportunities for cancer prevention and therapy [^115exLgJ]. Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations and Adverse Effects Associated with Targeting PG Pathways

Preclinical, epidemiologic, and clinical studies have demonstrated that targeting the COX pathway could be effective in the prevention and treatment of multiple cancer types. However, suppression of COX signaling by the use of NSAIDs, or other inhibitors has been limited because the use of these drugs is associated with various side effects, including gastrointestinal toxicity and increased risk of myocardial infarction. Extensive studies were conducted to determine the downstream signaling pathways of the PG receptors (Fig. 1), with the hope that targeting PG receptors might circumvent the toxic effects associated with COX inhibition while still exerting anticancer effects. Thus, several small molecules have been demonstrated to exert anticancer effects in multiple cancer types by targeting PG receptors (Table 1). However, whether these small molecules are effective clinically with less toxicity is still not clear although several clinical studies targeting EP receptors or the TBXA2 receptor have been conducted or are ongoing. Further studies will be needed to evaluate the effectiveness versus the unwanted side effects that have been associated with targeting PG receptors downstream of COX. Another limitation is that directly inhibiting individual PG receptors may not be as efficient as targeting COX with NSAIDS, which likely suppresses the majority of the PG pathways. Bioavailability has always been an issue with drug treatments, and thus, to improve bioavailability, multiple inhibitors might be required to attenuate cancer development. In fact, smaller doses of multiple inhibitors might be less toxic overall. For example, the TXA2:PGI2 balance is known to be critical for maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system. Targeting COX cannot specifically mediate the TXA2, PGI2, or other downstream signaling pathways. Thus, a combination of PG inhibitors that maintains a proper balance of TXA2 and PGI2 might have greater potential to suppress cancer development and avoid cardiovascular toxicity. Unfortunately, targeting the PG receptors has not yet made it past the stage of biological tools and future clinical studies are absolutely required to determine their potential in cancer prevention and treatment.

### Gastrointestinal toxic side effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitors [^11392Bmo]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to treat pain and inflammation but are frequently associated with gastrointestinal side effects, including life-threatening bleeding or perforation of gastroduodenal ulcers. Conventional NSAIDs are nonselective inhibitors of two isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX): COX-1 and COX-2. The inhibition of COX-1 is believed to be responsible for inducing mucosal injury primarily by impairing prostaglandin-dependent mucosal protective mechanisms. The latest development in reducing the incidence of ulcers and ulcer complications associated with conventional NSAIDs is the use of recently approved COX-2-specific inhibitors (CSIs). This article critically reviews the data on gastrointestinal toxic side effects for conventional NSAIDs without as well as with prevention therapy. In addition, we compare these data with those for the CSIs, namely, celecoxib and rofecoxib. Finally, we offer recommendations on the clinical use of these drugs, emphasizing the need to balance clinical effectiveness with the avoidance of potential gastrointestinal side effects.

### Antiplatelet drugs: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114JLFNW]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Aspirin — mechanism of action involves permanent cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition via acetylation and downstream effects on thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and prostacyclin (PGI2): The best-characterized mechanism of action of aspirin is related to its capacity to permanently inhibit the COX activity of prostaglandin H-synthase-1 and prostaglandin H-synthase-2 (also referred to as COX-1 and COX-2, respectively); the molecular mechanism of permanent inhibition of COX activity by aspirin is related to blockade of the COX channel as a consequence of acetylation of a strategically located serine residue (Ser529 in COX-1, Ser516 in COX-2), thereby preventing substrate access; human platelets and vascular endothelial cells process PGH2 to produce primarily TXA2 and PGI2, respectively, with TXA2 inducing platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction and PGI2 inhibiting platelet aggregation and inducing vasodilatation; because TXA2 is largely derived from COX-1 (mostly from platelets), it is highly sensitive to aspirin inhibition, whereas the major source of vascular PGI2 is COX-2, even under physiologic conditions.

### COX-2 inhibitors and the kidney [^117JAGGv]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors are now extensively used for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic efficacy. Several large controlled trials provide evidence to support the proposition that they cause fewer major gastro-intestinal side effects and less toxicity than routine nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In view of the documented different localizations of the cyclooxygenase-1 and COX-2 enzymes in the kidney, it was initially hoped that COX-2 inhibitors would be associated with fewer renal side effects than other NSAIDs. This has not been borne out by subsequent studies. Like other NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors can cause salt and water retention, leading to edema and worsening hypertension. They can also cause acute declines in renal function and glomerular filtration rate. These events are, however, uncommon in large rheumatology populations and infrequently lead to discontinuation of the medications. Judicious use of COX-2 inhibitors in high-risk patients (such as those with chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes or congestive heart failure) will lead to a decreased incidence of adverse renal events.

Nonopioid pharmacological therapy for acute sickle cell disease (SCD) pain — For adults and children presenting with acute pain related to SCD, the ASH guideline panel suggests a short course (5 to 7 days) of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in addition to opioids for acute pain management (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕◯◯◯). NSAIDs are defined broadly to include selective and nonselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, and patient-specific assessment of harms should guide use and drug/class selection; patients at increased risk of renal toxicity should be identified, and if comorbidities confer significant risk, the mild potential benefit may not outweigh the risk. It is good practice to provide patient-centered education and surveillance related to NSAID toxicity, especially in patients with end-organ comorbidities, given limited long-term safety data and potential vascular, bleeding, and renal risks.

### Cooperative effects of matrix metalloproteinase and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition on intestinal adenoma reduction [^115EjGAy]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Colon cancer is the third largest cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women in the US. Sporadic colorectal cancer is a multistep process involving a number of genetic and epigenetic changes, while familial forms such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) have been shown to be caused by mutations in the tumour suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and mismatch repair (MMR) genes, respectively. There are multiple stages and many years involved in the progression from benign colon polyp to invasive carcinoma and metastatic disease. In addition to efforts to improve therapy for colorectal cancer, the detection of early-stage lesions by colonoscopy provides the opportunity to develop novel chemopreventive approaches to this disease.

Inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (COX, prostaglandin H synthase), the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin, have been utilised as chemopreventive agents for colorectal cancer. There are two forms of the COX enzyme; COX-1 is expressed ubiquitously while COX-2 expression is induced in response to a number of different stimuli including cytokines, growth factors, oncogenes, serum, and tumour promoters. COX-2 is expressed in 85–90% of human colorectal adenocarcinomas. Initial studies of COX and colorectal tumours came about after epidemiological studies linked nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) intake with reduced risk for developing colorectal tumours. Clinical trials in FAP patients with NSAIDs showed that their use results in significant reduction in both the number and size of the polyps. These studies also demonstrated that NSAIDs had adverse side effects of bleeding and ulceration, which was most likely because of inhibition of gastric prostaglandin production by COX-1.

### Recommendations for the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cardiovascular disease risk: decades later, any new lessons learned? [^112KyYiH]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most prescribed pharmacologic therapies worldwide due to their therapeutic analgesic efficacy and relative tolerability. In the past several decades, various cardiovascular (CV) adverse events have emerged regarding both traditional NSAIDs (tNSAIDs) and cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) selective (coxibs). This review will provide an updated report on the CV risk profile of NSAIDs, focusing on several of the larger clinical trials, meta-analyses, and registry studies. We aim to provide rheumatologists with a framework for NSAID use in the context of rheumatologic chronic pain management. Recent findings: In patients with and without CV diseases, the use of NSAIDs, both tNSAIDs and coxibs, is associated with an increased risk of adverse CV events, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cerebrovascular events. These CV risks have increased within weeks of coxib use and higher doses of tNSAIDs. The risk of adverse CV events is heterogenous across NSAIDs; naproxen and low-dose ibuprofen appear to have lower increased CV risk among NSAIDs. A variation in CV risk is associated with multiple factors, including NSAID class, COX-2 selectivity, treatment dose and duration, and baseline patient risk. Summary: Many important questions remain regarding the safety of NSAIDs and whether the culmination of research performed could inform us whether specific patient subtypes or NSAID class may have a more favorable profile. tNSAIDs such as naproxen and low-dose ibuprofen may have a lower CV risk profile, while coxibs have a more favorable GI risk profile. In general, any NSAID can be optimized if used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest amount of time, especially among individuals with increased CV risk.

### Celecoxib (generic drug) [^1164uZsw]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Celecoxib has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.

The mechanism of action of celecoxib is believed to be due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, primarily via inhibition of COX-2.

Celecoxib is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Celecoxib concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Since celecoxib is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Platelets

In clinical trials using normal volunteers, celecoxib at single doses up to 800 mg and multiple doses of 600 mg twice daily for up to 7 days duration (higher than recommended therapeutic doses) had no effect on reduction of platelet aggregation or increase in bleeding time.

Because of its lack of platelet effects, celecoxib is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis. It is not known if there are any effects of celecoxib on platelets that may contribute to the increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic adverse events associated with the use of celecoxib.

Fluid Retention

Inhibition of PGE2 synthesis may lead to sodium and water retention through increased reabsorption in the renal medullary thick ascending loop of Henle and perhaps other segments of the distal nephron. In the collecting ducts, PGE2 appears to inhibit water reabsorption by counteracting the action of antidiuretic hormone.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Celecoxib exhibits dose-proportional increase in exposure after oral administration up to 200 mg twice daily and less than proportional increase at higher doses. It has extensive distribution and high protein binding. It is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9 with a half-life of approximately 11 hours.

Absorption

Peak plasma levels of celecoxib occur approximately 3 hours after an oral dose. Under fasting conditions, both peak plasma levels (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) are roughly dose-proportional up to 200 mg twice daily; at higher doses there are less than proportional increases in Cmaxand AUC [see Food Effects]. Absolute bioavailability studies have not been conducted. With multiple dosing, steady-state conditions are reached on or before Day 5. The pharmacokinetic parameters of celecoxib in a group of healthy subjects are shown in Table 4.

### Cardiovascular risk and COX-2 inhibition in rheumatological practice [^111bbVA2]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

The use of specific COX-2 inhibitors in place of standard nonsteroidals for the treatment of arthritis appears to reduce the risk of serious gastrointestinal toxicity in this group of patients. However, the role played by these inhibitors in the generation or exacerbation of ischaemic cardiovascular disease is less clear. Clinical studies demonstrate that hypertension can be induced or aggravated by COX-2 inhibitors to a degree similar to that which occurs with standard nonsteroidals. Endothelial dysfunction, an indicator of cardiac ischaemia, may also be exacerbated by specific COX-2 inhibition and there is much debate as to whether these changes lead to an absolute increase in ischaemic cardiac events. These effects on cardiovascular risk factors appear all the more important in patients with rheumatoid arthritis where there is an increase in the incidence of ischaemic heart disease. Here we review the available data on COX-2 inhibition and cardiovascular disease and conclude that all patients who started these agents should have a careful assessment and modification of any cardiovascular risk factors.

### The role of prostaglandins and other eicosanoids in the gastrointestinal tract [^112z3Zco]. Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are generally prescribed to ameliorate symptoms associated with acute pain and chronic inflammatory diseases such as arthritis. Recent epidemiologic studies and clinical trials indicate that use of NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective inhibitors are associated with a reduced risk of certain malignancies, especially gastrointestinal cancer. The cyclooxygenase enzymes are the best known targets of NSAIDs; this diverse class of compounds blocks conversion of arachidonic acid to prostanoids. Prostaglandins and other eicosanoids derived from COX-1 and COX-2 are involved in a variety of physiologic and pathologic processes in the gastrointestinal tract. Recent efforts to identify the molecular mechanisms by which COX-2-derived prostanoids exert their proneoplastic effects have provided a rationale for the possible use of NSAIDs alone or in a combination with conventional or experimental anticancer agents for the treatment or prevention of gastrointestinal cancers.
