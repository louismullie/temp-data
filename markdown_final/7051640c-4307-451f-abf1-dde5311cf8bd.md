## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about delirium. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and diagnostic criteria, including DSM-5 and how to interpret them. Then, I should verify the clinical features and subtypes, especially hypoactive presentations. Next, I will review epidemiology and risk factors, followed by pathophysiology. After that, I need to examine assessment tools and the DSM-IV versus DSM-5 concordance issue. Then, I should consider nomenclature and the delirium–encephalopathy relationship. Next, I will appraise current management and prevention, and finally, I will identify research gaps and future directions, including subtyping and biomarkers, before summarizing key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the core definition and diagnostic criteria. Delirium is an acute, fluctuating disturbance in attention and awareness with additional cognitive deficits, developing over hours to days, not better explained by a pre-existing neurocognitive disorder, and not occurring in the context of severely reduced arousal such as coma; DSM-5 operationalizes consciousness as reduced awareness and emphasizes inattention as the cardinal feature, which I should double-check to avoid overcalling hypoactive cases as non-delirious [^113a379C] [^114UDeh2]. Hold on, I should verify the arousal–attention hierarchy: adequate arousal is necessary to test attention, so altered arousal is clinically meaningful and should be captured, even if DSM-5's wording is less explicit than DSM-IV about "consciousness" per se [^1137AX9P] [^113QGDeX].

> I will now examine the clinical features and subtypes. Core features include inattention, acute onset or fluctuating course, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness; psychomotor subtypes include hyperactive, hypoactive, and mixed, with hypoactive presentations frequently underrecognized despite worse outcomes, so I need to ensure I actively screen for lethargy, withdrawal, and slowed responses rather than only agitation [^113a379C] [^1126VjxV]. Wait, let me verify the prognostic weight of arousal and inattention: meta-analytic data associate altered arousal and inattention with higher mortality, reinforcing the need to document these domains explicitly rather than relying on a binary delirium label alone [^116YUGng].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and risk factors. Delirium is common in hospitalized older adults, with pooled occurrence around 23% on medical wards, higher after major surgery, and up to 75% in mechanically ventilated ICU patients; predisposing factors include advanced age, pre-existing cognitive impairment, sensory impairment, and multimorbidity, while precipitating factors include infection, hypoxia, metabolic derangements, polypharmacy, and sedatives such as benzodiazepines, so I need to check for these modifiable drivers at the bedside [^112s6cCd] [^113R9D1J] [^112va3g2]. Hold on, I should verify that "unable to assess" patients are not simply excluded; those labeled unable to assess often have worse outcomes than delirium-positive patients, so I must document arousal and nonverbal signs even when formal testing is limited [^114WdU5d].

> Let me consider pathophysiology. Multiple mechanisms likely converge: neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter imbalances (notably cholinergic deficiency and dopaminergic excess), cerebral metabolic derangements, blood–brain barrier disruption, and impaired network connectivity; this mechanistic heterogeneity helps explain why broad pharmacologic strategies have largely failed and why precision approaches are needed [^113a379C] [^112va3g2]. I should confirm that these hypotheses remain largely inferential in humans, underscoring the urgency of biomarker-integrated studies to link phenotype to endotype [^113a379C].

> Now, I need to check assessment tools and reconcile DSM versions. The CAM is well validated in non-ICU settings, and CAM-ICU performs with sensitivity ~0.78–0.80 and specificity ~0.95–0.98 in ICU cohorts; the ICDSC is an alternative, and the 4AT is rapid and feasible across settings, but I should remember that no single tool replaces clinical judgment in complex cases or when patients cannot engage verbally [^117KLJJB] [^112XvLox] [^112hjDUB]. Wait, let me verify the DSM-IV versus DSM-5 concordance issue: strict DSM-5 interpretations can miss a large proportion of DSM-IV cases, whereas a relaxed interpretation that treats impaired attention as sufficient for criterion A and accepts either acute onset or fluctuation for criterion B improves concordance to about 91% with DSM-IV; thus, in research and quality improvement, I should specify the diagnostic algorithm used and consider DRS-R98 to operationalize features when needed [^114SeswB] [^113DAbwr] [^112kcd1j].

> I should confirm nomenclature and the relationship between delirium and acute encephalopathy. A ten-society consensus recommends "acute encephalopathy" to denote the underlying pathobiologic process developing over less than 4 weeks, with clinical expressions including subsyndromal delirium, delirium, and coma; they advise against vague terms like "altered mental status" or "acute brain dysfunction", and DSM-5-TR clarifies that minimal responses to verbal or physical stimulation should be classified as stupor or coma rather than delirium, which I need to apply to avoid misclassification [^113EPJcy] [^1152KZGA] [^114WdU5d]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: some authors propose an integrated "delirium disorder" model to unify delirium and encephalopathy, but I should acknowledge this remains debated while adopting the consensus nomenclature for clarity and interoperability [^115ZrRZ1] [^113EPJcy].

> Next, I should review management and prevention. Best evidence supports multicomponent nonpharmacologic strategies targeting modifiable risks: infection treatment, medication review to minimize anticholinergics and sedatives, sleep optimization, mobility, sensory aids, hydration, and family engagement; pharmacologic treatment is reserved for severe agitation threatening safety or care delivery, with antipsychotics used cautiously given limited efficacy and potential harms, so I need to ensure the underlying precipitant is aggressively treated first [^1126VjxV] [^113uG3Bf] [^113a379C]. I should double-check that guidelines emphasize baseline cognitive assessment and serial severity tracking to gauge response and detect fluctuation, which I will incorporate into daily rounds [^111DCYHC] [^1126VjxV].

> I will now examine research gaps and future directions. The field lacks a unified definition and standardized measurement across settings; efforts by NIDUS and the Delirium Subtyping Initiative call for harmonized tools, core outcome sets, and integration of clinical features with biomarkers to identify reproducible subphenotypes and endotypes that could guide targeted therapy, so I need to support studies collecting repeated, standardized clinical and biological data with attention to fluctuation and nonverbal assessments [^116W3rkx] [^116H6Qj4] [^11783A1s]. But wait, what if we overinterpret early clusters? Validation across diverse cohorts and linkage to mechanisms will be essential before adopting subtypes clinically, and I should remain cautious about premature translation while encouraging precision-medicine trials stratified by endotypes [^1166bNMW] [^111hfr4f].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. Delirium is an acute, fluctuating neuropsychiatric syndrome with inattention as the core feature, driven by heterogeneous pathobiologies; it is common, underrecognized, and carries substantial morbidity and mortality, especially when arousal is impaired; diagnosis remains clinical, with validated tools like CAM/CAM-ICU and 4AT aiding detection, but concordance varies by DSM interpretation, so I should specify the diagnostic approach; management hinges on identifying and treating precipitants plus multicomponent nonpharmacologic care, reserving medications for severe agitation; and future progress depends on standardized definitions, harmonized measurement, and biomarker-informed subtyping to enable targeted interventions [^113a379C] [^1126VjxV] [^113EPJcy] [^116W3rkx].

---

Delirium is an **acute, fluctuating disturbance of attention and awareness** [^113a379C] with additional cognitive changes, caused by a medical condition or substance and not better explained by a pre-existing neurocognitive disorder [^113a379C]. It is common in hospitalized older adults [^113R9D1J] and is associated with increased mortality, longer hospital stay, and long-term cognitive decline [^113R9D1J]. Diagnosis is clinical [^114nV3Fy], guided by DSM-5 [^113EPJcy] and supported by tools such as the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) [^112x4wt2] and CAM-ICU [^112XvLox]. Management centers on identifying and treating underlying causes, with **non-pharmacologic measures as first-line** [^1126VjxV]; antipsychotics are reserved for severe agitation or distress [^1126VjxV]. Prevention focuses on **multicomponent interventions** addressing modifiable risk factors [^113uG3Bf].

---

## Clinical features and diagnostic criteria

According to DSM-5, delirium is characterized by:

- **Disturbance of attention and awareness**: Acute onset, fluctuating, with reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention [^116YNdjj].

- **Additional cognitive changes**: Memory, orientation, language, visuospatial, or perception disturbances (e.g. hallucinations) [^116YNdjj].

- **Medical causation**: Symptoms result from a medical condition, substance intoxication/withdrawal, or multiple etiologies [^116YNdjj].

- **Exclusion of coma**: Not better explained by a pre-existing neurocognitive disorder or severely reduced arousal [^116YNdjj].

---

## Subtypes of delirium

Delirium is classified into **subtypes** based on psychomotor features:

| **Subtype** | **Clinical features** | **Prevalence and prognosis** |
|-|-|-|
| Hyperactive | - Agitation <br/> - Restlessness <br/> - Hallucinations <br/> - Delusions | - Less common <br/> - Often recognized <br/> - Associated with anticholinergic toxicity and alcohol withdrawal [^notfound] |
| Hypoactive | - Lethargy <br/> - Reduced activity <br/> - Withdrawal <br/> - Slow responses | - Common <br/> - Underrecognized <br/> - Higher mortality and worse outcomes [^116yPUrz] |
| Mixed | Alternating hyper- and hypoactive features | Common and associated with significant morbidity [^notfound] |

---

## Risk factors and precipitating causes

Delirium results from the interplay of predisposing and precipitating factors [^113R9D1J]. Predisposing factors include advanced age, pre-existing cognitive impairment, multiple comorbidities, sensory impairment, and frailty; precipitating factors include infections (especially respiratory and urinary), medications (sedatives, anticholinergics, opioids), metabolic disturbances, hypoxia, surgery, trauma, and substance withdrawal [^113pN9uD].

---

## Epidemiology

Delirium is common across settings: general medical wards 29–64% [^113R9D1J], ICU 31–75% (higher with mechanical ventilation) [^112va3g2], and postoperative patients 7–51% depending on procedure [^112va3g2]. Incidence rises with age and comorbidity burden [^112va3g2].

---

## Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology is **multifactorial**, involving neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter imbalances (cholinergic deficiency, dopaminergic excess), cerebral metabolic disturbances, and impaired network connectivity [^113a379C]. These mechanisms are triggered by systemic insults and modulated by patient vulnerability [^112va3g2].

---

## Diagnostic assessment

Diagnosis is clinical, supported by standardized tools:

- **CAM**: Validated for bedside use; high sensitivity and specificity [^112x4wt2].

- **CAM-ICU**: For mechanically ventilated or nonverbal ICU patients [^112XvLox].

- **DRS-R98**: Assesses severity and distinguishes delirium from other neuropsychiatric conditions [^112kcd1j].

- **Laboratory and imaging**: Identify underlying causes; no definitive diagnostic test [^114nV3Fy].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on identifying and treating underlying causes, with **non-pharmacologic measures as first-line** [^113a379C]:

- **Environmental interventions**: Orientation, sensory aids, sleep hygiene, mobilization, hydration, and nutrition [^1126VjxV].

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol, atypicals) for severe agitation or distress; benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal delirium [^1126VjxV].

- **Supportive care**: Monitor and manage complications, provide family education and support [^113a379C].

---

## Prevention

Prevention centers on **multicomponent interventions** targeting modifiable risk factors: medication review, infection prevention, sleep optimization, mobility, sensory aids, hydration, and nutrition [^113uG3Bf]. These strategies reduce incidence and severity [^116XJtYe].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Delirium is associated with increased short- and long-term mortality, longer hospital stay, institutionalization, and persistent cognitive decline [^114qvBDT]. Persistent delirium (> 3 months) is linked to greater long-term cognitive and functional impairment [^notfound].

---

## Current research and controversies

- **Subtyping**: Efforts to define clinically meaningful subtypes (e.g. inflammatory, hypoxic, sedative-associated) to guide targeted therapy [^116CyPGN].

- **Biomarkers**: Exploration of blood, CSF, EEG, and neuroimaging markers to improve diagnosis and understanding [^1137cfkJ].

- **Pharmacologic treatment**: Ongoing trials of antipsychotics, alpha-2 agonists, and other agents; no definitive effective pharmacologic therapy yet [^113a379C].

- **Nomenclature**: Debate over integrating "delirium" and "acute encephalopathy" into a unified framework [^115ZrRZ1].

---

Delirium is a common, serious, and often preventable syndrome requiring prompt recognition, thorough evaluation, and targeted management. Emphasis on **non-pharmacologic prevention and care** [^113uG3Bf], along with ongoing research into subtyping and biomarkers, is essential to improve outcomes.

2 ADVANCING DELIRIUM DEFINITION AND MEASUREMENT

First and foremost, the field cannot advance without an accepted, uniform, operationalized definition of delirium, and standardized approaches to its measurement. The Scientific Think Tank participants identified the following priority areas to advance the definition and measurement of delirium: (1) consensus on the definition of delirium; (2) development of a reference standard approach for the diagnosis of delirium; (3) use of uniform, standardized measurement tools for delirium case identification and severity rating across different care settings; (4) identification of etiologic subtypes of delirium; and (5) development and application of a core outcomes set (COS) for clinical studies in delirium.

2.1 Refinement of the definition of delirium

The construct of delirium is complex. While inattention is the core feature, considerable variability exists surrounding the presence and degree of other symptom domains, such as altered level of arousal, global cognitive dysfunction, and psychotic features. Currently, there is no definitive diagnostic test for delirium; hence, detection of delirium must rely on eliciting the key clinical features using a combination of patient interview, cognitive testing, observation, and informant history. However, the component features of delirium lack explicit and accepted definitions, and there is little consensus on operationalization and assessment methods of the individual symptom domains. Reconceptualizing delirium would require expert panel approaches, ideally combining clinical and psychometric approaches, to identify and rank key domains and supporting features. Until such consensus can be achieved, application of a smaller set of harmonized delirium measures would help to speed advances in the field.

### Advancing specificity in delirium: the delirium subtyping initiative [^116H6Qj4]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium, a common syndrome with heterogeneous etiologies and clinical presentations, is associated with poor long-term outcomes. Recording and analyzing all delirium equally could be hindering the field's understanding of pathophysiology and identification of targeted treatments. Current delirium subtyping methods reflect clinically evident features but likely do not account for underlying biology.

Methods

The Delirium Subtyping Initiative (DSI) held three sessions with an international panel of 25 experts.

Results

Meeting participants suggest further characterization of delirium features to complement the existing Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition Text Revision diagnostic criteria. These should span the range of delirium-spectrum syndromes and be measured consistently across studies. Clinical features should be recorded in conjunction with biospecimen collection, where feasible, in a standardized way, to determine temporal associations of biology coincident with clinical fluctuations.

Discussion

The DSI made recommendations spanning the breadth of delirium research including clinical features, study planning, data collection, and data analysis for characterization of candidate delirium subtypes.

Highlights

Delirium features must be clearly defined, standardized, and operationalized. Large datasets incorporating both clinical and biomarker variables should be analyzed together. Delirium screening should incorporate communication and reasoning.

3.1 Session 1: clinical features

3.1.1 Challenges

The diagnostic criteria of delirium in the DSM‐5‐TR (Table 5)offer only a partial picture of the delirium syndrome. The DSM takes an indexical approach to diagnosis in that its diagnostic criteria include a subset of features that reliably index a given condition, as opposed to a constitutive approach, which would provide a comprehensive list of features. As a result, there may be features not included in the DSM that are important for subtyping purposes. For instance, many of delirium's most distressing neuropsychiatric disturbances, such as hallucinations or dissociative experiences, are not included. Relying on the core diagnostic features of delirium alone is likely inadequate for advancing delirium science and for clinical care. Moreover, it remains unclear how best to define and operationalize these core features, for example, attention deficits. Experienced clinicians may be confident they "know delirium when they see it", but identifying certain features in a reproducible, operationalized fashion remains challenging.

### The DSM-5 criteria, level of arousal and delirium diagnosis: inclusiveness is safer [^1137AX9P]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium is a common and serious problem among acutely unwell persons. Although linked to higher rates of mortality, institutionalisation and dementia, it remains underdiagnosed. Careful consideration of its phenomenology is warranted to improve detection and therefore mitigate some of its clinical impact. The publication of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-5) provides an opportunity to examine the constructs underlying delirium as a clinical entity.

Discussion

Altered consciousness has been regarded as a core feature of delirium; the fact that consciousness itself should be physiologically disrupted due to acute illness attests to its clinical urgency. DSM-5 now operationalises 'consciousness' as 'changes in attention'. It should be recognised that attention relates to content of consciousness, but arousal corresponds to level of consciousness. Reduced arousal is also associated with adverse outcomes. Attention and arousal are hierarchically related; level of arousal must be sufficient before attention can be reasonably tested.

Summary

Our conceptualisation of delirium must extend beyond what can be assessed through cognitive testing (attention) and accept that altered arousal is fundamental. Understanding the DSM-5 criteria explicitly in this way offers the most inclusive and clinically safe interpretation.

### Three key areas in progressing delirium practice and knowledge: recognition and relief of distress, new directions in delirium epidemiology and developing better research assessments [^1167Pp5D]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Delirium presents formidable challenges: it affects one in four of older hospitalised adults, greatly elevates the risk of multiple short- and long-term complications including dementia and causes significant distress. Delirium care remains generally poor. Yet, there are clear grounds for optimism; the last decade has seen impactful policy advances and a tripling of research output. Here, we highlight three linked areas which have strong potential to transform delirium practice and knowledge in the near term. Delirium-related distress is strikingly underrepresented in practice guidance and research. Proactive recognition combined with effective clinical responses based on good communication provides a critical and largely untapped opportunity to improve care. Delirium epidemiology research is well positioned to produce novel insights through advanced prospective designs in populations such as emergency medical patients with detailed pre-, intra- and post-delirium assessments allied with fluid, imaging and other biomarkers. Research-grade assessment of delirium currently involves a chaotic array of tools, methods and diagnostic algorithms. Areas for development: expand and analytically distinguish the range of features assessed (including distress), optimise feature assessment including use of validated neuropsychological tests where possible, produce standardised algorithms which articulate explicit pathways from features to diagnosis, and create new fine-grained approaches to the measurement of severity. Delirium practice and knowledge show accelerating growth. This is encouraging but much of the necessary progress is still to come. Innovation in these three highlighted areas, as well as many others, will open up exciting possibilities in enhancing the care of patients with this common and often devastating condition.

### Delirium: where do we stand? [^116a8hig]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Clinicians are likely to encounter delirium frequently, particularly in inpatient and intensive care settings. However, delirium is underrecognized and undertreated because of its heterogeneous and fluctuating presentation and due to the limitations in resources and training in contemporary clinical settings. Translation of current knowledge about delirium into clinical practice may improve patient care and benefit public health economics. Hence, this review comprehensively discusses the phenomenology and pathophysiology of delirium and its presenting features, risk factors, differential diagnoses, assessment, prognosis, and treatment with antipsychotics; the goal is to facilitate better prevention, recognition, and treatment of delirium. Available research is reviewed, limitations of the research are discussed, and future directions for further delirium research are identified.

### Advancing specificity in delirium: the delirium subtyping initiative [^115K5FJY]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

The broader range of features of acute brain dysfunction alongside the core diagnostic criteria of delirium and relevant underlying pathophysiology were discussed within the session. It is unclear whether "possible/probable delirium" is a useful construct or indeed whether research and clinical criteria should differ. Boundaries between clinical syndromes, for example, delirium and dementia, can be indistinct and are likely to remain so. The existence of this continuum is a topic of debate among the DSI.

Delirium, as with all psychiatric conditions, is defined by its clinical features, and it remains uncertain whether novel biomarkers (e.g. blood or cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] markers, neuroimaging, or electroencephalography [EEG]) might aid clinical practice. However, patient experience remains the centerpiece of delirium, both as a potential indicator of underlying pathophysiology and as an unmet need for effective intervention. It is possible that the diagnostic threshold for delirium or the pattern of core features may differ between populations of varying age or illness severity. Detailed mental status evaluations are important and involve more than evaluating attention, cognition, and arousal. All potentially distressing disturbances are important to note, including emotional lability, fear, hallucinations, paranoia, apathy, or dissociation. We recognize the time restraints that may arise in suggesting all clinicians complete detailed mental status examinations, and that evidence‐based treatments for distressing symptoms are still needed.

Delirium severity may be relevant to subtyping as increasing levels of severity are associated with clinically relevant outcomes. However, it is not yet clear how to best measure and quantify delirium severity. The domains assessed by existing delirium severity tools vary. Delirium severity is associated with biomarkers of systemic inflammation, neurofilament light, plasma tau, short‐ and long‐term mortality, length of stay, and cognitive decline. Similarly, consensus is required on the necessary clinical, biological, and patient‐experience variables to measure when assessing severity.

Development and use of distinct research and clinical criteria for delirium subtyping was discussed during the DSI meeting. Research criteria have been published by Trzepacz et al. based on detailed phenomenological analysis; however, consensus was not reached during our DSI sessions. Future candidate subtypes may incorporate and define what constitutes delirium in unique medical populations. Separate diagnostic criteria for delirium may, in the future, be explored for use in clinical and specific research settings.

### Diagnosis of delirium: a practical approach [^114nV3Fy]. Practical Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Delirium is an acute disorder of fluctuating attention and awareness with cardinal features that allow it to be positively distinguished from other causes of an acute confusional state. These features include fluctuations, prominent inattentiveness with other cognitive deficits, a change in awareness and visual hallucinations. We describe a framework for diagnosing delirium, noting the need to consider certain caveats and differential diagnoses. Delirium is a clinical diagnosis where a thorough history and clinical examination are much more helpful diagnostically than any single test or combination of tests.

---

### Advancing specificity in delirium: the delirium subtyping initiative [^115W33wk]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

Delirium already shares interfaces, for example, with dementia, and it is expected that subtyping will introduce additional boundaries that must be approached with caution. Further research may also differentiate multiple sets of core delirium syndromes (e.g. different core features in hepatic encephalopathy vs. septic encephalopathy), but such expressions of delirium should nevertheless be understood as subtypes of a unified model of delirium.

3.1.2 Recommendations

‐Attempts to operationalize the features of delirium need to be standardized across studies to facilitate combination and comparison of results.
‐Use of the term "delirium" without a specified etiology, pathophysiology, or subtype should be understood as "all‐cause delirium", similar to "all‐cause dementia".

Clearly defining and operationalizing the identification of key features will advance understanding of the lived delirium experience. Approaching delirium research independently of iterative changes across DSM editions may help identify delirium subtypes by facilitating consideration of the lesser‐discussed features. To represent the entire spectrum of delirium presentations, a comprehensive description of delirium should be constitutive — that is, incorporating the full spectrum of delirium features, rather than merely its indexical criteria.

For subtyping purposes, the same features must be assessed consistently using comparable tools. Features not captured by DSM‐5‐TR criteria should be systematically assessed, recorded, and standardized along with core features. Such efforts will require close collaboration as the range of potential features are broad and, to date, incompletely characterized and understood.
‐In addition to measuring specific features, delirium screening should involve a patient's level of verbal communication and reasoning.

### Advancing specificity in delirium: the delirium subtyping initiative [^111hfr4f]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

Delirium remains an umbrella term for a syndrome of heterogenous populations with varied physiological parameters, cognitive health, environmental factors, vulnerabilities, underlying mechanisms, etiologies, and clinical manifestations. Treating all episodes of delirium as equal, a type of "all‐cause delirium", can hinder identification of underlying physiological mechanisms and, thus, effective, or preventive, treatments.

The broad range of clinical features across delirium‐spectrum syndromes should be measured consistently across studies, to allow for finer characterization, subtype identification, and comparisons across sites. Detailed instruments should also be able to screen patients unable to communicate verbally. Individual features should be evaluated regularly to monitor for fluctuation, with concurrent bio‐samples collection. Clustering analyses of large, multicenter datasets should incorporate both clinical and biomarker data for identification of reproducible potential subphenotypes and endotypes. Stratification by identified endotypes in delirium trials will facilitate validation and manipulation of treatable traits.

### Identifying indicators of important diagnostic features of delirium [^115BD5XK]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To use an expert consensus process to identify indicators of delirium features to help enhance bedside recognition of delirium.

Design

Modified Delphi consensus process to assign existing cognitive and delirium assessment items to delirium features in the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) diagnostic algorithm.

Setting

Meetings of expert panel.

Participants

Panel of seven interdisciplinary clinical experts.

Measurements

Panelists' assignments of each assessment item to indicate CAM features.

Results

From an initial pool of 119 assessment items, the panel assigned 66 items to at least one CAM feature, and many items were assigned to more than one feature. Experts achieved a high level of consensus, with a postmeeting kappa for agreement of 0.98. The study staff compiled the assignment results to create a comprehensive list of CAM feature indicators, consisting of 107 patient interview questions, cognitive tasks, and interviewer observations, with some items assigned to multiple features. A subpanel shortened this list to 28 indicators of important delirium features.

Conclusion

A systematic, well-described qualitative methodology was used to create a list of indicators for delirium based on the features of the CAM diagnostic algorithm. This indicator list may be useful as a clinical tool for enhancing delirium recognition at the bedside and for aiding in the development of a brief delirium screening instrument.

### Phenotypes and subphenotypes of delirium: a review of current categorisations and suggestions for progression [^1166bNMW]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The identification of subphenotypes of delirium is a task which requires prioritising delirium as a syndrome worth vast clinical attention and research. The most viable subphenotyping approaches should be selected and methods for their translation to clinical practice created. Barriers in delirium diagnosis and heterogeneity of populations must be overcome on an international scale to allow precision and use of the most robust clustering techniques. This advancement will enable new levels in understanding of the underlying putative pathways by which the delirium phenotype arises. We recommend eventual progression from subphenotypes to endotypes by creation of a biological–clinical subtype hybrid. This may be completed by identification of underlying mechanism clusters and their course alongside clinical expression. For definition of treatable traits, the mechanistic differences between the subphenotypes must be clarified to allow targeted treatment. Treatments or interventions may then be developed using in vitro and in vivo models and then tested prospectively to assess clinical value.

### Updated nomenclature of delirium and acute encephalopathy: statement of ten societies [^1152KZGA]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Consensus recommendations on nomenclature

To generate expert consensus, we convened an international, interdisciplinary panel of leading experts with expertise in intensive-care medicine, neurology, geriatrics, rehabilitation medicine, pharmacy, anaesthesiology, and psychiatry. Panellists were tasked with generating recommendations on the nomenclature of delirium, acute encephalopathy, and related terms. The definitions were created, refined, and voted on using the modified Delphi method (see Supplementary Materials).

The panel recommends the term acute encephalopathy to describe a rapidly developing (in less than 4 weeks) pathobiological brain process which is expressed clinically as either subsyndromal delirium, delirium or coma and may have additional features, such as seizures or extrapyramidal signs (Box). The term acute encephalopathy is not recommended as a descriptor of clinical features that can be observed at the bedside. Instead, the panel recommends the term subsyndromal delirium for acute cognitive changes that are compatible with delirium, but do not fulfil all DSM-5 delirium criteria, delirium for a clinical state defined according to the criteria of the DSM-5, and coma for a state of severely depressed responsiveness defined using diagnostic systems such as the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) or the Full Outline of UnResponsiveness (FOUR) score (Box). The panel further recommends against use of the terms acute confusional state, acute brain dysfunction, acute brain failure, or altered mental status in clinical practice or research (Box). Although these terms might have relevance for educational purposes, the panel felt that they lacked face or construct validity.

The recommendations in this manuscript have been endorsed by ten key professional societies (see Supplementary Materials), and this terminology is congruent with the recent recommendations for the nomenclature of cognitive change associated with anaesthesia and surgery. Delayed neurocognitive recovery after anaesthesia and surgery can be regarded as consequence of prolonged postoperative acute encephalopathy.

In conclusion, current literature on delirium and acute encephalopathy is highly segregated, presenting an obstacle for clinical care and research. We recommend a consensus-based, pragmatic nomenclature which we expect will establish a foundation for advances in the field.

### The confusion assessment method: a systematic review of current usage [^1158JdoZ]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)" for delirium, ICU delirium and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.

The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is a diagnostic tool specifically designed for the identification of delirium in both clinical and research settings. It is primarily used in older adults, particularly those in hospital or long-term care facilities. The CAM provides a simple and reliable way to detect delirium quickly, using a four-step process that assesses the patient's mental status, attention, cognition, and level of consciousness. The clinical utility of this calculator is to aid in the early detection and diagnosis of delirium, which can help initiate appropriate management and improve patient outcomes. The CAM should not be used in patients who are comatose or those with pre-existing cognitive impairments like dementia, as it may not accurately distinguish between these conditions and delirium.

The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is designed to help determine if delirium is present based on an evaluation of four key cognitive features. The assessment is structured around identifying specific patterns that, when present, indicate the likelihood of delirium. Here's how it works:

- The assessment consists of four cognitive features:

- Presence of inattention
- Acute onset/fluctuating course
- Disorganized thinking
- Altered level of consciousness

To establish a diagnosis of delirium using these features, the following conditions must be met:

1. Both "Presence of inattention" and "Acute onset/fluctuating course" must be identified. These two conditions are necessary and must be checked to potentially indicate delirium.
2. Either "Disorganized thinking" or "Altered level of consciousness" must also be identified. At least one of these conditions should be checked, in addition to the two conditions above.

The assessment evaluates these inputs:

- If there is both inattention and an acute or fluctuating course of symptoms, along with either disorganized thinking or altered consciousness, delirium is considered to be present.
- If any of these conditions is not met, it suggests that delirium is not present.

This approach allows the user to systematically check the presence of delirium based on recognized cognitive features. The result provides a clear indication of whether the conditions for delirium are satisfied.

### Delirium: an important (but often unrecognized) clinical syndrome [^117DZnQy]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2002). Low credibility.

Delirium is a clinical syndrome characterized by the acute onset of a disturbance in consciousness accompanied by a reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention. It may foreshadow impending death in as many as 25% of hospitalized inpatients and may be a source of significant morbidity in those who present with this syndrome. The disorder may go unrecognized by hospital staff as well as those close to an affected individual, and this oversight may lead to poorer outcomes including longer lengths of stay in acute care hospitals, the need for nursing home placement, prolonged cognitive disturbances, and protracted disability. This paper will address this complex condition, focusing on its history, definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, recognition, risk factors, and clinical quantification. Its prevention and treatment will be covered elsewhere in this journal.

A comparison of DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria for delirium

Note: Adapted to allow direct item comparison from DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) and DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). DSM-IV, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual fourth edition; DSM-5, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual fifth edition.

Moreover, although the gold standard for delirium identification is considered a clinical diagnosis according to DSM-IV criteria, there is widespread recognition among 'deliriumologists' that there is no consensus as to how this should actually be determined in practice. Against this background, and considering the new DSM-5 criteria, we explored how the criteria can be applied when the individual elements are assessed in a systematic and operationalized way, thus allowing for various interpretations of the new criteria to be examined. In order to explore how DSM-5 criteria might differ from those of DSM-IV, we examined a pooled dataset derived from previous prospective phenomenological research exploring delirium in a variety of clinical populations and research sites using standardized assessments.

The aims of this study were: (1) to analyze retrospectively the pooled database to compare features of delirium cohorts identified by the originally applied DSM-IV criteria (identified by the gold standard of a detailed clinical assessment) as well as those identified by applying scores from the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (DRS-R98) items relevant to criteria for a post hoc application of strict and relaxed interpretations of DSM-5 criteria; (2) to examine whether different interpretations of DSM-5 criteria impact significantly upon delirium identification rates by exploring concordance across these three groups. We thus sought to understand to what degree DSM-IV and DSM-5 were concordant and how the DSM-5 criteria can be best applied to allow for inclusiveness and that the gap between rates of diagnosis by the different systems is not excessively wide; and (3) to examine how DSM-IV and the different interpretations of DSM-5 differ in terms of delirium phenomenology.

In DSM-5, the term 'consciousness' is not used at all (Table 1). Delirium is now more restrictively defined in terms of its cognitive features, and the level of arousal element implicit in prior DSM criteria has been removed. Moreover, Criterion D states that inattention or changes in cognition 'must not occur in the context of a severely reduced level of arousal such as coma'.

Future treatable traits will be decided once the most effective methods are determined. It is important to note that this is a suggested framework for categorisation

Subphenotypes of delirium

A subphenotype is a set of features in a group of patients who share a phenotype. The subphenotype may include shared risk factors, traits, diagnostic features, expression markers, mortality risk or treatment response, distinguishing the group from other patients with the same phenotype. The potential means of subphenotyping delirium are displayed in Table 1.

### Assessment and report of individual symptoms in studies of delirium in postoperative populations: a systematic review [^1164WZbm]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is, most commonly, considered as present or absent, as assessed using validated screening tools, based on accepted diagnostic criteria. Reasonably, these tools and criteria focus on the core symptoms — such as inattention and altered consciousness/arousal — considered necessary to constitute a delirium syndrome. There are, however, a broader range of symptoms that can occur as part of a delirium and which can have significant impacts and implications for patients' experiences, long-term health and clinical care. Given the current absence of identifiable and treatable mechanisms underlying delirium symptoms, accurate identification and measuring of symptoms are necessary if treatable mechanisms underlying these symptoms are to be discovered, and calls have been made to integrate the underlying mechanisms of delirium, i.e. the acute encephalopathy, with its clinical features. The reward for such efforts, it is hoped, will be the identification of specific delirium symptoms as an indicator of particular underlying mechanisms. This would lead on to the identification of treatable traits, for example, by performance of data-driven cluster analyses of specific symptoms with biomarkers or imaging data, and the discovery and validation of novel therapeutics for delirium. This approach has been successful in studies of other clinical syndromes such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, which have utilised analysed large datasets combining clinical and biomarker data to identify links between underlying mechanisms and clinical features.

When delirium is reported as simply present or absent, it is likely that patients with symptoms falling short of the diagnostic criteria for delirium are included in 'no delirium' or 'control' groups in studies, potentially compromising analyses. The phenotype of subsyndromal delirium describes a condition falling on a continuum between no delirium and delirium defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, but it does not specify which symptoms are present.

Attempts have been made in research studies to categorise delirium symptoms by psychomotor subtype i.e. hyperactive, hypoactive or mixed; however, this neglects description of individual delirium symptoms and is not sufficient to facilitate in-depth investigation of how specific mechanisms give rise to specific symptoms. Recent publications have called for comprehensive reporting of delirium symptoms, and phone applications have been developed by Tieges et al. and Hall et al. to improve monitoring of attention and levels of arousal, respectively. Variations in performance in tests of inattention have been reported, as have differential outcomes dependant on altered arousal. The Delirium Subtyping Initiative recently highlighted the lack of standardisation of clinical features across studies.

### Phenotypes and subphenotypes of delirium: a review of current categorisations and suggestions for progression [^111Wfdeh]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Delirium is a clinical syndrome occurring in heterogeneous patient populations. It affects 45–87% of critical care patients and is often associated with adverse outcomes including acquired dementia, institutionalisation, and death. Despite an exponential increase in delirium research in recent years, the pathophysiological mechanisms resulting in the clinical presentation of delirium are still hypotheses. Efforts have been made to categorise the delirium spectrum into clinically meaningful subgroups (subphenotypes), using psychomotor subtypes such as hypoactive, hyperactive, and mixed, for example, and also inflammatory and non-inflammatory delirium. Delirium remains, however, a constellation of symptoms resulting from a variety of risk factors and precipitants with currently no successful targeted pharmacological treatment. Identifying specific clinical and biological subphenotypes will greatly improve understanding of the relationship between the clinical symptoms and the putative pathways and thus risk factors, precipitants, natural history, and biological mechanism. This will facilitate risk factor mitigation, identification of potential methods for interventional studies, and informed patient and family counselling. Here, we review evidence to date and propose a framework to identify subphenotypes. Endotype identification may be done by clustering symptoms with their biological mechanism, which will facilitate research of targeted treatments. In order to achieve identification of delirium subphenotypes, the following steps must be taken: (1) robust records of symptoms must be kept at a clinical level. (2) Global collaboration must facilitate large, heterogeneous research cohorts. (3) Patients must be clustered for identification, validation, and mapping of subphenotype stability.

3.1.3 Future goals

‐Robust collection of individual, routine, and well‐classified clinical features.

Detailed clinical features should be recorded both within research studies and, where possible, in routinely collected electronic care data. Recording of individual features would facilitate both identification and validation of subtypes within clinical research studies and testing of these subtypes in real‐world data.
‐Delirium identification and severity assessment tools for all medical settings and communicative abilities.

Delirium assessment and severity tools should be applicable in the settings of both verbal and non‐verbal communication. Arousal, attention, orientation, and successful completion of tasks should be the starting point for assessing ability. Assessment of non‐verbal patients needs to incorporate cues for attention, such as eye tracking. Delirium should also be assessable in patients with reduced levels of arousal. Delirium severity should be domain specific, for which severity of each feature should be measured. It may be appropriate to extend both the mild and severe ends of the delirium spectrum. Assessment tools should be common across, and modified for, different patient populations. Delirium‐related distress should also be considered in assessments.
‐Consistent collection of clinical feature data and biomarker data in both clinical and research settings.

Biomarkers characterize the encephalopathy presenting as delirium. Diagnosis is ideally based on reliable, empirical features, supported by biomarkers, as in other medical conditions. An example of applicability to delirium is shown in Table 6. Where a site can collect biomarker data reliably, this should be planned and completed in accordance with global standards regarding sampling, storage, and analysis. Biological samples must be collected alongside clinical data. Large‐scale biological data are essential to consider association, causation, and ultimately pathophysiology of delirium. Datasets should be harmonized across institutions to facilitate large, comprehensive datasets capable of testing subtyping‐based hypotheses.

### Advancing specificity in delirium: the delirium subtyping initiative [^111BWvo5]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

Tieges et al. and Todd et al. assessed outcomes in relation to individual domains of delirium features, suggesting that attention deficits, and altered level of arousal, are independently associated with increased mortality. These findings indicate that recording and investigating specific delirium features may aid prognosis.

Thorough guidelines, statements, and core outcome sets for delirium have previously been produced using consensus methods. For example, the Network for Investigation of Delirium: Unifying Scientists (NIDUS) 2020 Scientific Think Tank listed identifying etiologic subtypes of delirium as a priority. The think tank suggested that future studies should use standardized approaches to identify contributors to delirium, to incorporate biomarkers, and to use subtyping to guide targeted treatments.

Debate persists regarding the relative merits of approaching delirium based solely on its core features as a manifestation of its common final pathway — that is, regarding all delirium as "all‐cause delirium". We suggest that delirium research needs to evaluate the relationship between distinct clinical phenotypes and the discrete pathophysiological pathways underlying them. The primary goal of the Delirium Subtyping Initiative (DSI) is to identify the primary infrastructure required to propose and investigate novel approaches to delirium subtyping. The DSI also aimed, in these sessions, to assess the field's readiness for identification of delirium subtypes using novel data‐informed methods, while considering the importance of clinical viability of new subtypes, to generate "knowledge‐based" subtypes. We consider clinical features of delirium, including those described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition Text Revision (DSM‐5‐TR), and nomenclature in conjunction with lessons that can be learned from previous subtyping works in other medical conditions such as asthma and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Herein, we provide recommendations for all delirium researchers, clinicians, health data managers, and research funders. We propose shared future goals to enable collaborative progress toward identification of delirium subtypes.

### Concordance between DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria for delirium diagnosis in a pooled database of 768 prospectively evaluated patients using the delirium rating scale-revised-98 [^116Qe7xx]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome that is common across healthcare settings, occurring in 29% to 64% of medical in-patients with even higher rates among patients in intensive and palliative care settings. It is independently associated with a range of adverse outcomes that include elevated risk of dementia and mortality. However, delirium is often misdiagnosed and under detected in real-world practice such that clear and concise diagnostic criteria are fundamental to improving detection and management.

The advent of clear diagnostic criteria for delirium in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual third edition (DSM-III) and subsequent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual third edition revised (DSM-IIIR) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual fourth edition (DSM-IV) versions has supported considerable growth in research activity in the field of delirium. The DSM-IV criteria provide a highly inclusive description of delirium that has become the preferred diagnostic criteria for both clinicians and researchers. However, the essential criteria have been progressively abbreviated and studies indicate considerable disparity in delirium detection when applying these different DSM versions and the International Classification of Diseases – Tenth Edition (ICD-10).

The fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) provides an opportunity to consolidate the strengths of the DSM-IV delirium description while incorporating findings from interim research. Although no major changes from DSM-IV were made to the core elements of DSM-5 criteria for delirium, there are some differences in content and wording of the criteria (Table 1) that may impact upon the alignment between DSM-5 and previous criteria. For example, the removal of the term 'consciousness', and the focus on reduced awareness and inattention might substantially narrow the inclusiveness of the criteria, depending on how strictly this term is interpreted. The application of DSM-5 criteria could impact substantially upon both clinical care and research case identification, such that it is important to understand how they compare in the same patient population.

### The DSM-5 criteria, level of arousal and delirium diagnosis: inclusiveness is safer [^113QGDeX]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium is an extensive and serious problem in acute hospitals. It is unquestionably a marker for vulnerability, and is associated with adverse outcomes in a number of settings. Fundamentally, the syndrome represents a decompensation of cerebral function in response to one or more pathophysiological stressors. Therefore, understanding how to identify delirium can be central to recognising acute illness in patients of all ages. The American Psychiatric Association's fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) revised the diagnostic criteria for delirium. As the leading organisations in delirium science and practice, the European Delirium Association (EDA) and American Delirium Society (ADS) believe that the interpretation of these revisions warrants comment, in order to improve clinical practice and patient safety.

The diagnosis of delirium represents an umbrella construct that was adopted to overcome the terminological chaos existing before DSM-III (1980), when dozens of terms were used to indicate generalised brain dysfunction occurring in the context of acute illness or drug intoxication. These included 'acute confusional state', 'encephalopathy', 'acute brain failure', 'ICU psychosis', and even 'subacute befuddlement'. These terms were not based upon any explicit scientific rationale, but rather denoted delirium occurring in different patient populations and/or treatment settings. Combining all of these clinical constructs under the term 'delirium' has resulted in a more coherent approach to clinical practice and research.

A consistent feature of DSM versions prior to DSM-5 has been the requirement that alterations in the content (that is, attention) and/or level (that is, arousal) of consciousness are core to the diagnosis of delirium. Delirium can present as hypoactive or hyperactive states, and may fluctuate between the two. DSM-III used the term ' clouding of consciousness'. DSM-III-R and DSM-IV, while maintaining the term ' consciousness', operationalised this by linking this construct to deficits in attention. This shift towards attention was driven by a recognition that the construct 'consciousness' was difficult to assess objectively. It should be appreciated that for consciousness, both attention and arousal are hierarchically related: it is possible to have full arousal, but profound inattention (for example, hypervigilance), but not the other way around. Therefore, the retention of 'consciousness' implied that level of arousal remained part of the construct of delirium.

2 METHODS

A multidisciplinary group of clinicians and researchers who had published on delirium subtyping, from a range of institutions and spanning the breadth of relevantdisciplines, were engaged via e‐mail by E.B. E.L.C. and M.O. Early conversations and discussion on the topic of delirium subtypes were held via Zoom and e‐mail between September 2021 and March 2022 to gather support, generate ideas, and establish clear aims for the initiative. The DSI included the presidents and members of the three international delirium societies: American Delirium Society (ADS), Australasian Delirium Association (ADA), and European Delirium Association (EDA). After initial discussions and ahead of the planned in‐person meeting, a list of key questions was distributed to the committee (Table 2).

TABLE 2
Initial questions distributed to the Delirium Subtyping Initiative Steering Committee.

A program for a DSI meeting was constructed based on the e‐mail responses (Table 3). The program consisted of three sessions:
Clinical features
Validation and refinement
Methods for data handling and statistics

TABLE 3
Program of the Delirium Subtyping Initiative 2022 meeting.

Session 1 focused on clinical features, including primary diagnostic signs and symptoms, especially in relation to DSM‐5‐TR criteria, the delirium construct, and variables to be included in delirium subtyping. We use the term "features" throughout to encompass both objective signs and subjective symptoms. Session 2 centered on the clinical and biomarker variables to be considered, consensus terminology, and defining success of subtype identification. Prior subtyping projects in other medical conditions, such as asthma and ARDS, were reviewed as the foundation of this session. The third session covered methods for handling data and statistics, including various cluster analysis options, factors to consider when combining datasets, and logistical considerations.

Each session was introduced with a short presentation to provide context (given by A.M. P.S. and E.B. respectively). After this, the ensuing discussion was moderated by the chair (E.L.C.). Full details of each session were recorded by A.S. and E.B. The outputs from each session were synthesized into key sections: challenges, recommendations, and aspirational goals. To ensure the whole‐group opinion was represented, each committee member was given the opportunity to edit and comment on the statements.

### Identifying subphenotypes of patients undergoing post-operative delirium assessment [^112aYDUM]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Delirium is a common, transient clinical syndrome characterized by disturbance in attention and cognitive change. The syndrome has heterogenous etiologies and clinical presentations and is often associated with adverse outcomes including acquired dementia, institutionalization, and death. Currently, delirium is most commonly considered present or absent, based on accepted diagnostic criteria. This binary classification does not consider the complete patient profile, lacking full description of symptoms and without consideration for underlying pathophysiology. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the clinical symptoms of delirium remain largely hypothetical, with no recommended pharmacological treatments for the syndrome.

To improve understanding of delirium as a syndrome, its clinical presentation, particularly its individual symptoms, must be better defined. Patients experiencing symptoms of delirium but falling short of the delirium diagnostic criteria might currently be included in the "no delirium" or "control" groups in research studies, therefore compromising the results of analyses. In cases in which symptoms of delirium do not fulfill complete criteria for delirium diagnosis, the term subsyndromal delirium can be used, and considered part of a delirium severity spectrum.

Better characterization of the spectrum of delirium syndrome, from those with only individual symptoms, to those with severe delirium, should involve coupling clinical presentation (including individual symptoms and their fluctuation) with underlying pathological mechanisms and exploring associations between them. Mapping delirium symptoms with underlying mechanisms could result in the identification of delirium subphenotypes or endotypes, expanding understanding of the condition itself, and guiding the development of effective prevention and novel pharmacological treatment strategies. Such treatments may be informed by the individual patients' clinical symptoms and biomarkers. Furthermore, it is likely that better understanding of the syndrome will improve delirium diagnosis and prevention by increasing screening, screening accuracy, and risk prediction. Due to the spectrum of disturbance from no delirium, to individual delirium symptoms, to full delirium, it is important to consider those without any symptoms of delirium in analyses.

Discussion

The principal purpose of these analyses was to explore the concordance/discordance between DSM-IV and the new DSM-5 criteria for delirium, especially given the differences in wording that could be interpreted differently by different DSM-5 users, thereby leading to potentially widely disparate diagnostic rates with serious implications for patient care and research. We used proxy symptom information captured systematically using a standardized administration of the DRS-R98 to retrospectively generate delirium diagnoses according to two different interpretations of DSM-5 criteria. We then compared the level of concordance between these criteria with each other and with prospectively-determined DSM-IV delirium identified through detailed and comprehensive clinical assessment. This extrapolation was possible because we first tested the proxy method for DSM-IV and found high concordance, supporting the post hoc method as valid. We found that a more relaxed interpretation of DSM-5 criteria detected most of the cases of DSM-IV defined delirium, while a strict interpretation excluded more than two-thirds of such cases. There was thus considerable overlap for the actual cases designated as delirious by DSM-IV and the relaxed DSM-5 approach, suggesting that delirium diagnosis will be minimally changed by the use of DSM-5 criteria if the presence of impaired attention is interpreted as sufficient for criterion A, and either acute/subacute onset or fluctuation symptom course is used to interpret criterion B.

Studies exploring the concordance between DSM IIIR, DSM-IV and ICD-10 diagnostic systems in elderly hospitalized patients indicate that DSM-IV provides a highly inclusive definition of delirium that includes a substantial number of patients who do not have delirium as defined by DSM-IIIR or ICD-10. The inclusion of disorganized thinking as a criterion in DSM-IIIR and the wide range of mandatory features in ICD-10 are key factors that underpin this finding. Other work suggests that DSM-IV includes many cases that are of subsyndromal severity according to DRS-R98 cut-off scores, although the distinction between subsyndromal versus 'mild' delirium can be challenging, especially when dimensional approaches are employed. Subsyndromal delirium is addressed under 'attenuated delirium syndrome' in DSM-5.

### Delirium [^113a379C]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Delirium, a syndrome characterized by an acute change in attention, awareness and cognition, is caused by a medical condition that cannot be better explained by a pre-existing neurocognitive disorder. Multiple predisposing factors (for example, pre-existing cognitive impairment) and precipitating factors (for example, urinary tract infection) for delirium have been described, with most patients having both types. Because multiple factors are implicated in the aetiology of delirium, there are likely several neurobiological processes that contribute to delirium pathogenesis, including neuroinflammation, brain vascular dysfunction, altered brain metabolism, neurotransmitter imbalance and impaired neuronal network connectivity. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) is the most commonly used diagnostic system upon which a reference standard diagnosis is made, although many other delirium screening tools have been developed given the impracticality of using the DSM-5 in many settings. Pharmacological treatments for delirium (such as antipsychotic drugs) are not effective, reflecting substantial gaps in our understanding of its pathophysiology. Currently, the best management strategies are multidomain interventions that focus on treating precipitating conditions, medication review, managing distress, mitigating complications and maintaining engagement to environmental issues. The effective implementation of delirium detection, treatment and prevention strategies remains a major challenge for health-care organizations globally.

3.3 Session 3: methods for handling data and statistics

3.3.1 Challenges

Adequately recording the heterogeneity of delirium presentations (across features, duration, and response to treatment), populations (across medical settings, demographics, precipitants, physiological insults, levels of pre‐existing cognition), and subsequent outcomes in ways that facilitate sharing and consolidation is challenging. In addition, differences are anticipated between hypotheses and data‐ or sample‐driven studies. Even where the same tests are used in different studies, often the exact methods and thresholds used vary.

3.3.2 Recommendations

‐Large multicenter studies should collect data using repeated, frequent, and standardized measures of clinical features.

Biomarker analyses, where feasible, should be completed alongside robust recording of features, tracked feature fluctuation, and relevant clinical variables. Subphenotype stability should be tracked throughout the delirium fluctuations in course. Standardization of features to be recorded, methods of tests, and thresholds will allow researchers to be selective in formation of analyses. Analyses should be completed in both similar and different populations.
‐Data‐driven phenotypes must incorporate clinical applicability to become a knowledge‐based phenotype.

Groups identified using data‐driven models should be compared to a "knowledge‐based phenotype", written according to existing knowledge of the clinical signs and symptoms of delirium.

3.3.3 Future goals

‐Data collection (in the written and sample form) should be robust, consistent, and with the ability to share statistical protocols across investigators.
‐Operationalization and standardization of all recommendations is essential for data‐driven approaches to be adopted alongside clinical features to identify new delirium subtypes.
‐A universally translatable language within which we are collecting data based on a framework is required.
‐Newly identified subtypes should not be defined as correct before being standardized and validated.
‐The DSI plans to reconvene in 1 to 2 years for progress updates and review of goals.

### Classifying neurocognitive disorders: the DSM-5 approach [^1131DwsG]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Neurocognitive disorders — including delirium, mild cognitive impairment and dementia — are characterized by decline from a previously attained level of cognitive functioning. These disorders have diverse clinical characteristics and aetiologies, with Alzheimer disease, cerebrovascular disease, Lewy body disease, frontotemporal degeneration, traumatic brain injury, infections, and alcohol abuse representing common causes. This diversity is reflected by the variety of approaches to classifying these disorders, with separate groups determining criteria for each disorder on the basis of aetiology. As a result, there is now an array of terms to describe cognitive syndromes, various definitions for the same syndrome, and often multiple criteria to determine a specific aetiology. The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) provides a common framework for the diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders, first by describing the main cognitive syndromes, and then defining criteria to delineate specific aetiological subtypes of mild and major neurocognitive disorders. The DSM-5 approach builds on the expectation that clinicians and research groups will welcome a common language to deal with the neurocognitive disorders. As the use of these criteria becomes more widespread, a common international classification for these disorders could emerge for the first time, thus promoting efficient communication among clinicians and researchers.

### Detecting delirium: a systematic review of identification instruments for non-ICU settings [^117KLJJB]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Delirium manifests clinically in varying ways across settings. More than 40 instruments currently exist for characterizing the different manifestations of delirium. We evaluated all delirium identification instruments according to their psychometric properties and frequency of citation in published research.

Design

We conducted the systematic review by searching Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Library, Excerpta Medica Database (Embase), PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science from January 1, 1974, to January 31, 2020, with the keywords "delirium" and "instruments", along with their known synonyms. We selected only systematic reviews, meta-analyses, or narrative literature reviews including multiple delirium identification instruments.

Measurements

Two reviewers assessed the eligibility of articles and extracted data on all potential delirium identification instruments. Using the original publication on each instrument, the psychometric properties were examined using the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) framework.

Results

Of 2,542 articles identified, 75 met eligibility criteria, yielding 30 different delirium identification instruments. A count of citations was determined using Scopus for the original publication for each instrument. Each instrument underwent methodological quality review of psychometric properties using COSMIN definitions. An expert panel categorized key domains for delirium identification based on criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-III through DSM-5. Four instruments were notable for having at least two of three of the following: citation count of 200 or more, strong validation methodology in their original publication, and fulfillment of DSM-5 criteria. These were, alphabetically, Confusion Assessment Method, Delirium Observation Screening Scale, Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98, and Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale.

Conclusion

Four commonly used and well-validated instruments can be recommended for clinical and research use. An important area for future investigation is to harmonize these measures to compare and combine studies on delirium.

4 DISCUSSION

At the meeting for the DSI, attendees reviewed the field's readiness for identification of novel delirium subtypes. The areas covered included clinical features, refinement and validation, and data handling and statistics. The committee agreed that the core clinical features of delirium should be operationalized and standardized to allow for comparison and combination of results across datasets. Drawing together large data facilitates cluster analyses that will indicate meaningful clusters of patients with delirium. Description and measurement of features must be completed consistently in studies using validated methods and include modifications to suit patient populations or needs. A suite of tests for each clinical domain being assessed, clearly defining user instructions and thresholds, is needed to enhance reliability. Studies should include the range of "delirium‐spectrum syndromes".

Such recommendations for meticulous measurement and documentation will be met with many challenges. While thorough record of all relevant clinical and biological features would optimize big‐data–driven analyses, comprehensiveness of assessment and recording will be limited by acceptability to both patients/participants and staff.

The discussions of delirium's clinical presentations highlight ongoing questions regarding the boundaries of delirium; they also suggest that we should revisit basic theories of delirium en route to delirium subtypes. Ground‐breaking work requires, at the very least, that some ground be broken, and advances in delirium subtyping naturally invite skepticism when such work challenges traditional models. "Lumping" of information has advanced our knowledge of the delirium syndrome and has brought us to this point where some splitting is required.

Refinement and validation require reproducibility of analyses across multiple large cohorts. We should learn from previous subphenotyping projects, while ensuring all generated models are clinically applicable to delirium. This task includes determining how delirium subtypes should be defined — as subphenotypes, endotypes, or by an alternative nomenclature. Analyses should include an array of clinical features and biomarker measurements taken from blood, CSF, EEG, and magnetic resonance imaging. These measurements and analyses should be as uniform as feasible across cohorts to identify strong endotypes, and eventually, treatable traits and preventive strategies. These endotypes should be knowledge based as well as data driven, to ensure they are clinically useful. Updates of identified and validated subtypes must be completed as knowledge on delirium expands. A stepwise approach may lead to the success of expanding information on delirium, alongside identification of meaningful clusters.

### Updated nomenclature of delirium and acute encephalopathy: statement of ten societies [^113EPJcy]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Delirium and acute encephalopathy nomenclature — consensus recommendations state that acute encephalopathy is recommended to describe a rapidly developing (in less than 4 weeks) pathobiologic brain process and is not recommended as a descriptor of clinical features that can be observed at the bedside. For clinical states, the panel recommends the term subsyndromal delirium for acute cognitive changes compatible with delirium that do not fulfil all DSM-5 delirium criteria, delirium for a clinical state defined according to the criteria of the DSM-5, and coma for a state of severely depressed responsiveness defined using diagnostic systems such as the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) or the Full Outline of UnResponsiveness (FOUR) score. The panel further recommends against use of the terms acute confusional state, acute brain dysfunction, acute brain failure, and altered mental status; specifically, the term acute confusional state should not be used in addition to the terms delirium and acute encephalopathy, the term acute brain dysfunction should not be used in addition to the terms delirium and acute encephalopathy, the term acute brain failure should not be used in addition to the terms delirium and acute encephalopathy, and the term altered mental status is not synonymous with delirium and should not be used.

### Delirium in critical illness: clinical manifestations, outcomes, and management [^112va3g2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on ICU delirium:

- **Definition**: ICU delirium is an acute, fluctuating disturbance of attention, awareness, and cognition that occurs in critically ill patients, often developing over hours to days. It is a form of acute brain dysfunction and is a common complication in the ICU, particularly among mechanically ventilated patients.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of ICU delirium is multifactorial and incompletely understood. Proposed mechanisms include neuroinflammation, impaired neurotransmitter signaling (cholinergic deficiency and dopamine excess), oxidative stress, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier. These processes may be precipitated by systemic illness, sedative medications, or metabolic derangements, leading to acute brain dysfunction.
- **Epidemiology**: In the ICU setting, the prevalence of delirium in adults is estimated at 31%, with incidence varying between 4–11% depending on motor subtype. Delirium is particularly common in mechanically ventilated ICU patients, with prevalence rates reaching up to 75%. On general medical inpatient units, the overall occurrence rate is approximately 23%. Among older adults, 11–25% present with delirium on admission, and an additional 29–31% develop it during hospitalization. Postoperative delirium increases with surgical complexity, ranging from 7% to 51% in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. Delirium also occurs in non-hospital settings, with probable cases reported in 19% of older adults attending memory clinics, and prevalence in palliative care populations ranging from 4% to 88% depending on care setting and stage of illness.
- **Risk factors**: Major risk factors include advanced age, preexisting cognitive impairment, hypertension, or alcohol use disorder, severity of illness, mechanical ventilation, use of sedative or analgesic medications (especially benzodiazepines), metabolic disturbances, infection, and prolonged ICU stay. Modifiable risk factors include sleep disruption, immobility, and polypharmacy. Coma is an independent risk factor for the development of delirium in the ICU.
- **Disease course**: Delirium typically develops acutely and can fluctuate in severity throughout the day. It presents in hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed subtypes, with hypoactive delirium often underrecognized despite its poor prognosis. Delirium may last for days or weeks and is associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, increased ICU and hospital stay, long-term cognitive decline, and increased risk of death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: ICU delirium is associated with poor short- and long-term outcomes. It independently predicts prolonged mechanical ventilation, longer ICU and hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and a greater risk of in-hospital mortality. Delirium increases the risk of death by 38%, and in postoperative patients, the 30-day mortality rate may reach up to 10%, compared to 1% in those without delirium. Long-term consequences include persistent cognitive impairment, functional decline, and increased risk of institutionalization. The duration of delirium correlates with the severity of long-term cognitive deficits. Positive delirium screening in critically ill adults is strongly associated with cognitive impairment at 3 and 12 months after ICU discharge and may be associated with longer hospital stays. However, delirium has not been consistently associated with PTSD, post-ICU psychological distress, depression, or long-term functional dependence. Evidence on its association with ICU length of stay, discharge disposition, or mortality is mixed. Notably, rapidly reversible delirium is associated with outcomes similar to those of patients who do not develop delirium.

### Predisposing and precipitating factors associated with delirium: a systematic review [^113R9D1J]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is an acute and often fluctuating disturbance in attention and awareness that is extremely common among hospitalized older adults, with an incidence of 29% to 64% in general medical wards, 50% after high-risk surgical procedures, and up to 75% in patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. Delirium is associated with adverse outcomes, including increased risk of falls, functional decline, dementia, prolonged hospitalization, institutionalization, and death, at an annual cost of $38 billion to $152 billion in the US.

Heterogeneous delirium phenotypes and the many predisposing factors, precipitants, and pathophysiological mechanisms associated with delirium make this condition challenging to identify, manage, and study. Despite its heterogeneous etiologies, delirium remains a blanket diagnosis, so it is unsurprising that treatment trials to address delirium of all causes have largely been ineffective. The understanding of delirium etiology is a major unmet need. Currently, there is no consistently used comprehensive framework for categorizing delirium etiologies, although multiple models have been proposed.,

While the heterogeneity of the literature on risk factors associated with delirium precludes a meta-analysis, this systematic review aimed to identify potential predisposing and precipitating factors associated with delirium across all clinical settings and patient populations to provide the basis for a framework for standardizing delirium classification into major pathophysiological categories. We believe this foundation may be necessary to develop a precision medicine approach to delirium in which etiology and pathophysiology inform research and therapeutic strategies.

### Concordance between DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria for delirium diagnosis in a pooled database of 768 prospectively evaluated patients using the delirium rating scale-revised-98 [^117XdKiL]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The concept of delirium described in DSM-5 overlaps considerably with DSM-IV delirium, but with narrower capture of delirium. Depending on the interpretation of criteria that is applied, between 11% and 70% of cases of DSM-IV delirium did not meet the new criteria, which has important implications for case identification in clinical and research activity. Overly-strict adherence for some new text details in DSM-5 criteria would greatly reduce the number of delirium cases diagnosed; however a more 'relaxed' approach renders DSM-5 criteria comparable to DSM-IV with minimal impact on their actual application. We also found that delirium diagnosis based upon relevant DRS-R98 items has substantial overlap with DSM-IV diagnoses from detailed clinical assessment, especially when interpreted that inattention is accompanied by impaired awareness flexibly defined in criterion A and that acute or subacute onset of symptoms with or without a fluctuating course accounts for criterion B of DSM-5. This relaxed interpretation of DSM-5 criteria has greater concordance with DSM-IV and is more inclusive of cases that have substantial delirium symptoms as measured on the DRS-R98. We, therefore, recommend this approach to delirium diagnosis according to DSM-5 criteria as it maintains the perceived strengths of DSM-IV in terms of simplicity and inclusiveness while clarifying how to address issues such as reduced alertness or inability to co-operate with assessments. Further studies can explore the therapeutic and prognostic relevance of different application of these criteria.

As mental status changes may wax and wane, delirium screening will be reevaluated on a regular basis, and upon diagnosis of an acute delirium, attention will be paid to underlying causes including, but not limited to, infections (UTI, pneumonia most commonly) and medications such as anti-cholinergic medications, sedative/hypnotics, narcotics, and any new medication, especially if multiple medications have been recently added.

### What is It like to be delirious? [^116UJQnR]. Neurocritical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The current terminology of delirium and encephalopathy is open to debate. As with any poorly understood disorder with an unknown mechanism, there is a range of opinions. Attention must be paid to a proliferation of new terms and the ease with which they were introduced. In this viewpoint article, the authors invite the readers to return to the patient and rethink linguistic usage. The meaning of terms will be determined by their use rather than by authoritative description. We conclude that the suggested terminology of delirium is subjective, unsatisfactory, and may seriously hamper scholarly work. Rather than expand the definitions of types of delirium and separate them from encephalopathy, we advocate a definition-encephalopathy with or without characteristics of delirium-with the understanding that agitated patients in a delirium are innately encephalopathic. We subscribe to the prevailing neurologic description of delirium. This would allow sufficient granularity for bedside use and prospective studies.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^116YNdjj]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

DSM-5 criteria — alcohol withdrawal delirium specify a disturbance in attention and awareness that develops over a short period of time (usually hours to a few days), represents a change from baseline, and tends to fluctuate in severity during the course of a day, with an additional disturbance in cognition; the disturbances are not better explained by another preexisting, established, or evolving neurocognitive disorder and do not occur in the context of a severely reduced level of arousal, such as coma; and there is evidence that the disturbance is a direct physiological consequence of another medical condition, substance intoxication or withdrawal, or exposure to a toxin, or is due to multiple etiologies. Specify substance withdrawal delirium when this diagnosis should be made instead of substance withdrawal when the symptoms in Criteria A and C predominate and are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.

### Concordance between DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria for delirium diagnosis in a pooled database of 768 prospectively evaluated patients using the delirium rating scale-revised-98 [^112kcd1j]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Criterion D addresses the attribution of symptoms to delirium versus other states, particularly dementia and newly introduced in DSM-5 is an exclusion from low arousal states 'such as coma' (although the guidance notes state that non-comatose patients giving even minimal responses to verbal stimulation should be classified as showing 'severe inattention'). Operationalizing this aspect of diagnosis is challenging but can be achieved by applying tools with established discriminating capacity in cases complicated by comorbid dementia. For these analyses we used the DRS-R98 which distinguishes delirium from other neuropsychiatric conditions and can thus help to clarify if a diagnosis of delirium should apply where there is evidence for a comorbid neuropsychiatric condition that may complicate clinical presentation.

Our finding of high concordance between clinically-determined DSM-IV diagnosis of delirium and the algorithm-generated DSM-5 relaxed diagnosis supports the usefulness of the DRS-R98 for identifying core diagnostic elements of delirium in an operationalized way. DSM criteria are aimed primarily towards clinicians and designed for use in everyday practice where flexibility and 'common sense' are desirable elements. However, they have also become the research standard and in this context require precise systematic methods for research use. The DRS-R98-based approach described herein overlapped substantially with the DSM-IV criteria identified by detailed clinical review by expert clinician-researchers and can thus assist where more systematic diagnosis is desired.

### Advancing specificity in delirium: the delirium subtyping initiative [^116CyPGN]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Characterized by an acute change in attention, global cognition, and arousal/level of consciousness, delirium is thought to result from pathophysiological disruption of key brain networks. It presents as a spectrum of clinical features in heterogeneous populations. In addition to the distress delirium may cause to patients, caregivers, and relatives, and the health‐care costs incurred, delirium is associated with poor outcomes including incident or accelerated dementia, institutionalization, and death. The multifactorial pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the delirium syndrome remain largely hypothetical. Detailed characterization of these pathways and their clinical manifestations is needed to guide the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies.

Delirium is commonly categorized by psychomotor symptoms: hypoactive, hyperactive, and mixed delirium, as first described by Lipowski in 1980. Additionally, patients who experience intermediate features between "no delirium" and "clinical delirium" groups are categorized as having subsyndromal delirium.

The acute pathophysiological brain process clinically expressed as subsyndromal delirium, delirium, or coma is described as acute encephalopathy. A consensus on nomenclature is important to integrate the literature of acute encephalopathy with that of delirium. The term "delirium disorder" has been proposed to integrate neurophysiological changes and the clinical phenotype. Consensus is also required for subtyping terminology. Potential terms are shown in Table 1.

TABLE 1
Suggested terms for application to novel delirium subtypes, as defined by Lötvall et al.

Potential novel subtypes of delirium have been suggested with classification systems considering both symptoms and underlying pathophysiological disturbances. To date, only a few studies have examined delirium subtypes, either based on etiology or on the pattern of clinical features. Girard et al. investigated delirium phenotypes based on potential underlying causes (e.g. hypoxia, sepsis, sedative exposure, renal or hepatic dysfunction), and found substantial overlap in these candidate phenotypes. The prevalence of each phenotype during critical illness and their association with cognition 3 and 12 months after hospital discharge were assessed. Only 32% of participant‐delirium days involved one phenotype, whereas 68% involved two or more phenotypes. Sedative‐associated delirium was most common, and prediction of poor outcomes varied between the phenotypes.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Box 4: Delirium — Delirium is described as a sometimes life threatening but often preventable acute disorder of cognition and attention that often occurs during a medical illness or after surgery, and it is common in older vulnerable adults. Diagnosis is clinical with acute onset and fluctuating course involving inattention, impaired level of consciousness, and disturbance of cognition; in typical delirium, changes develop on timescales of hours to days and may fluctuate within minutes to hours. Evaluation benefits from a validated brief cognitive assessment instrument such as a form of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). When delirium is suspected, measures should be initiated to prevent delirium complications, symptoms should be managed using non-pharmacological and, in severe cases, pharmacological strategies, and delirium severity should be measured over time to ensure appropriate response and resolution. A hypoactive subtype is more common among older individuals and is associated with greater risk of morbidity and mortality.

Key messages

- The application of a single standardized evaluation may diagnose delirium in 32% of general ICU patients.

- The diagnosis of delirium is associated with worse outcomes including longer ICU and hospital length of stay and is independently associated with short-term mortality.

- The use of invasive devices and sedatives (midazolam) is associated with the diagnosis of delirium. These should be considered modifiable risk factors in the ICU, prompting the inclusion of a systematic evaluation for early device removal and judicious sedation in patients' plan of care.

### Advancing specificity in delirium: the delirium subtyping initiative [^114WdU5d]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

TABLE 5
Abbreviated paraphrase of DSM‐5‐TR diagnostic criteria.

Delirium is most commonly reported as a binary diagnosis — that is, present or absent. Reporting of the severity, or intensity, of delirium is increasing; however, the variability in assessments make combining studies difficult, even across similar populations. The Better Assessment of Illness Study (BASIL) group, alongside NIDUS, has undertaken efforts to harmonize and crosswalk existing delirium severity tools. Nonetheless, their utility is limited in clinical practice due to time constraints, expertise, and the fluctuating course of the syndrome.

It remains unclear how best to describe and treat people who are unable to engage with delirium assessment. Research has shown that people who are rated as "unable to assess" for delirium have even worse outcomes than those positive for delirium. However, it is important to remember that the clinician is still able to, and should, assess basic elements of brain function (e.g. level of arousal, breathing pattern, cranial nerves, pupil light, reflexes after testing vital signs) when unable to assess the mental content of consciousness.

Whether it is appropriate to categorize stupor as delirium remains contested. In 2014, the EDA and ADS jointly authored a statement advocating for an expansive definition of delirium that includes stupor, followed by successful efforts to modify the text of the forthcoming DSM‐5. This allowed patients with "minimal responses to verbal stimulation" to be scored as inattentive, consistent with delirium. Patients with minimal responses only to physical stimulation were excluded from delirium by Criterion D. A debate on the subject was held in 2016 at the annual meeting of the ADS and subsequently published. In 2022 the DSM‐5‐TR modified its position, explaining that "minimal responses to verbal or physical stimulation" should be classified as coma or stupor and "not as delirium". Coma is a state of unarousable unconsciousness, characterized by a severe disturbance in arousal and the alerting system of the brain, in which eyes remain closed as response to any type of stimulation". Stupor" is ill defined but regarded to be present in patients who open their eyes in response to verbal stimuli, with no eye contact.

### Delirium in elderly people [^113uG3Bf]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Delirium is an acute disorder of attention and cognition in elderly people (ie, those aged 65 years or older) that is common, serious, costly, under-recognised, and often fatal. A formal cognitive assessment and history of acute onset of symptoms are necessary for diagnosis. In view of the complex multifactorial causes of delirium, multicomponent non-pharmacological risk factor approaches are the most effective strategy for prevention. No convincing evidence shows that pharmacological prevention or treatment is effective. Drug reduction for sedation and analgesia and non-pharmacological approaches are recommended. Delirium offers opportunities to elucidate brain pathophysiology — it serves both as a marker of brain vulnerability with decreased reserve and as a potential mechanism for permanent cognitive damage. As a potent indicator of patients' safety, delirium provides a target for system-wide process improvements. Public health priorities include improvements in coding, reimbursement from insurers, and research funding, and widespread education for clinicians and the public about the importance of delirium.

Atypical or rapidly progressive presentations — urgent evaluation and specialist referral guidance includes that delirium and rapidly progressive dementia (usually defined as developing subacutely within weeks or months) are considered urgent medical problems requiring rapid, and in some cases inpatient, evaluation and management. Atypical features may include prominent focal cognitive abnormalities, sensorimotor impairment, or profound mood and behavioral symptoms, and patients with such signs on examination require an approach with a broader differential diagnosis, which often warrants specialist examination and distinct testing or studies to arrive at a diagnosis and appropriate interdisciplinary care plan. In patients whose examination may be difficult to interpret in the primary care setting, it is critical to consider and facilitate referral to a specialist with expertise in cognitive–behavioral neurology or geriatric psychiatry. Evaluation for suspected rare or rapidly progressive dementia is complex, includes a very broad differential diagnosis, and is best performed by a dementia subspecialist.

### Concordance between DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria for delirium diagnosis in a pooled database of 768 prospectively evaluated patients using the delirium rating scale-revised-98 [^114wEjhV]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Our work examines how different interpretations can strongly influence diagnosis rates among a mixed neuropsychiatric population who have undergone detailed and highly consistent assessment for the symptoms that characterize delirium. The concordance between DSM-IV-defined cases and DSM-5 delirium in this dataset varied considerably (30% to 89%) according to the interpretation of DSM-5 criteria (strict versus relaxed), especially in relation to the requirements for acute onset, fluctuating course and role of disorientation. In the absence of convincing evidence to support a major change in the concept of delirium, as well as the desire to maintain the generalizability of existing literature to delirium knowledge, our data suggest that the more relaxed interpretation of the DSM-5 criteria should be used. The relaxed interpretation has considerable overlap with DSM-IV delirium, while also adding the benefit of additional precision to the definition that might allow for more focused research efforts. Importantly, this means ignoring the parenthetical notation to require simple disorientation to the environment in Criterion A, which potentially is duplicative of the 'disorientation' mentioned in Criterion C and inadequate from a phenomenological perspective to provide a surrogate for the complexity and breadth of what likely constitutes awareness of normal consciousness. The strict DSM-5 interpretation was clearly too restrictive when disorientation was also required in Criterion A, and too few patients were diagnosed as delirious. Conversely, another reason to favor the relaxed approach is that DSM-IV patients who were excluded by the relaxed DSM-5 criteria had significantly lower mean DRS-R98 scores below the DRS-R98 diagnostic cutoff score for delirium diagnosis.

### The consistent burden in published estimates of delirium occurrence in medical inpatients over four decades: a systematic review and meta-analysis study [^112s6cCd]. Age and Ageing (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is associated with a wide range of adverse patient safety outcomes, yet it remains consistently under-diagnosed. We undertook a systematic review of studies describing delirium in adult medical patients in secondary care. We investigated if changes in healthcare complexity were associated with trends in reported delirium over the last four decades.

Methods

We used identical criteria to a previous systematic review, only including studies using internationally accepted diagnostic criteria for delirium (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases). Estimates were pooled across studies using random effects meta-analysis, and we estimated temporal changes using meta-regression. We investigated publication bias with funnel plots.

Results

We identified 15 further studies to add to 18 studies from the original review. Overall delirium occurrence was 23% (95% CI 19–26%) (33 studies) though this varied according to diagnostic criteria used (highest in DSM-IV, lowest in DSM-5). There was no change from 1980 to 2019, nor was case-mix (average age of sample, proportion with dementia) different. Overall, risk of bias was moderate or low, though there was evidence of increasing publication bias over time.

Discussion

The incidence and prevalence of delirium in hospitals appears to be stable, though publication bias may have masked true changes. Nonetheless, delirium remains a challenging and urgent priority for clinical diagnosis and care pathways.

### Prevalence, timing and characteristics of delirium preceding dementia with lewy bodies: a retrospective case series [^115wvbJo]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Consensus diagnostic criteria for delirium-onset dementia with Lewy bodies are lacking. This retrospective study aimed to identify delirium occurring in the prodrome of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), exploring delirium-onset DLB as an entity and its natural history.

Methods

Thirty-four participants with an established diagnosis of probable DLB from an outpatient neurology clinic in Sydney underwent a structured telephone interview to identify episodes of delirium. The timing, precipitants, and phenomenology of each episode were documented. Core and supportive features from the proposed diagnostic criteria for DLB were evaluated.

Results

26% of the participants experienced delirium prior to diagnosis of DLB, with one participant experiencing multiple episodes in the 24 months before diagnosis. Of these cases, 66% demonstrated some core and supportive features of DLB at the time of their delirium. In addition to expected triggers (e.g. surgery), international (long-haul) air flight was identified as one of the commonest precipitants for delirium in this group. Those DLB cases who fulfilled the proposed research criteria for a delirium-onset prodrome experienced a shorter time from symptom onset to dementia than those DLB patients with no history of pre-diagnosis delirium (26 vs 40 months).

Conclusions

These findings support delirium as a marker of prodromal DLB and suggest delirium-onset cases exhibit a more rapid progression to dementia, offering a focus for future studies. Identifying delirium as a potential early feature of DLB could aid in earlier recognition and improve diagnostic accuracy, particularly in individuals presenting with precipitants such as international air travel.

DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition) diagnostic criteria for mild neurocognitive disorder specify evidence of modest cognitive decline in one or more cognitive domains based on concern of the individual, a knowledgeable informant, or the clinician that there has been a mild decline in cognitive function and a modest impairment in cognitive performance, preferably documented by standardized neuropsychological testing or, in its absence, another quantified clinical assessment; the cognitive deficits do not interfere with capacity for independence in everyday activities, do not occur exclusively in the context of delirium, and are not better explained by another mental disorder.

### Concordance between DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria for delirium diagnosis in a pooled database of 768 prospectively evaluated patients using the delirium rating scale-revised-98 [^114X99oM]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Identification of delirium by diagnostic criteria

The pooled dataset contained 768 patients: 510 (65%) with DSM-IV delirium as established by virtue of a detailed clinical assessment of all available information and 258 (35%) without delirium. The demographic and clinical characteristics of these groups are compared in Table 5. Application of the DSM-5 criteria identified 158 cases (strict criteria) and 466 cases (relaxed criteria) of delirium (P < 0.001). The three approaches to diagnosis produce largely similar groups but the differences with respect to the age profile and comorbid dementia rate for the DSM-IV versus the DSM-5 relaxed interpretation highlight that a higher proportion of the cases of DSM-IV delirium that were not included within DSM-5 relaxed criteria have evidence of dementia (P < 0.001) and were significantly older (P < 0.01).

### New horizons in the pathogenesis, assessment and management of delirium [^113GgctS]. Age and Ageing (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Delirium is one of the foremost unmet medical needs in healthcare. It affects one in eight hospitalised patients and is associated with multiple adverse outcomes including increased length of stay, new institutionalisation, and considerable patient distress. Recent studies also show that delirium strongly predicts future new-onset dementia, as well as accelerating existing dementia. The importance of delirium is now increasingly being recognised, with a growing research base, new professional international organisations, increased interest from policymakers, and greater prominence of delirium in educational and audit programmes. Nevertheless, the field faces several complex research and clinical challenges. In this article we focus on selected areas of recent progress and/or uncertainty in delirium research and practice. (i)

Pathogenesis

recent studies in animal models using peripheral inflammatory stimuli have begun to suggest mechanisms underlying the delirium syndrome as well as its link with dementia. A growing body of blood and cerebrospinal fluid studies in humans have implicated inflammatory and stress mediators. (ii)

Prevention

delirium prevention is effective in the context of research studies, but there are several unresolved issues, including what components should be included, the role of prophylactic drugs, and the overlap with general best care for hospitalised older people. (iii)

Assessment

though there are several instruments for delirium screening and assessment, detection rates remain dismal. There are no clear solutions but routine screening embedded into clinical practice, and the development of new rapid screening instruments, offer potential. (iv)

Management

studies are difficult given the heterogeneity of delirium and currently expert and comprehensive clinical care remains the main recommendation. Future studies may address the role of drugs for specific elements of delirium. In summary, though facing many challenges, the field continues to make progress, with several promising lines of enquiry and an expanding base of interest among researchers, clinicians and policymakers.

The concordance between DSM-IV and the strict DSM-5 criteria was 48% (k = 0.19) for palliative care patients, 56% (k = 0.16) for general hospital patients and 55% (k = 0.23) for psychiatry for later life patients. For DSM-IV and the relaxed DSM-5 criteria the concordance was 94% (k = 0.85) for palliative care patients, 94% (k = 0.87) for general hospital patients and 86% (k = 0.66) for psychiatry for later life patients. Concordance between the relaxed and strict DSM-5 criteria was 55% (k = 0.25) for palliative care patients, 57% (k = 0.17) for general hospital patients and 69% (k = 0.43) for psychiatry for later life patients.

Factors underpinning diagnostic differences

We examined the individual features that underpin discordance between systems. For the 355 DSM-IV delirium cases that were negative by strict DSM-5 interpretation, 254 (72%) did not meet the acute and fluctuating criteria, while 83 (23%) lacked evidence of both inattention and disorientation. In comparing DSM-IV cases with (n = 155) and without (n = 355) DSM-5 strict criteria, the latter were significantly older (P = 0.01) and had significantly higher total DRS-R98 scores (P < 0.001) due to higher scores for all DRS-R98 individual items except language, short-term memory and visuospatial function. These two groups did not differ significantly in terms of gender or frequency of comorbid dementia.

Of the 149 cases of DSM-IV delirium with comorbid dementia, 39 had DRS-R98 scores under the cutoff of 18 and were deemed non-delirious by both strict and relaxed interpretations.

### Updated nomenclature of delirium and acute encephalopathy: statement of ten societies [^1113jPHx]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Segregation of published research

Patients with an acute illness frequently acquire an acute, global disturbance in cognition variably referred to as delirium, encephalopathy, acute confusional state, acute brain dysfunction, acute brain failure, and altered mental status. Although these different terms may have been perceived as distinct clinical entities, evidence to support such distinctions is lacking.

Acute disturbances in cognition are particularly prevalent among individuals admitted to the intensive-care unit. These disturbances have been linked to predisposing and triggering factors, and have been independently associated with adverse short- and long-term outcomes, including higher mortality and chronic cognitive impairment. While progress has been made in the detection of this problem, research is needed to identify effective interventions for prevention and treatment. A rational approach to nomenclature represents an important basis to enable such advances.

### Diagnosing delirium in older hospitalized adults with dementia: adapting the confusion assessment method to international classification of diseases, tenth revision, diagnostic criteria [^113Mfuah]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare performance characteristics of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) algorithm for screening and delirium diagnosis with criteria for delirium from the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) in high-risk individuals.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Academic geriatric hospital.

Participants

One hundred two individuals aged 80 to 100 hospitalized for acute medical illness.

Measurements

Complete CAM instrument (nine items), scored using the four-item CAM diagnostic algorithm. Criterion standard classification of delirium was rated independently according to expert consensus based on DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria for delirium.

Results

In 79 hospitalized participants, the CAM performed well for delirium screening (delirium prevalence of 24% according to DSM-IV and 14% according to ICD-10). Of all CAM features, acute onset and fluctuating course are most important for diagnosis (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.92 in DSM-IV and 0.83 in ICD-10). The CAM diagnostic algorithm had a sensitivity of 0.74, a specificity of 1.0, and an AUC of 0.88 compared with the DSM-IV reference standard and a sensitivity of 0.82, a specificity of 0.91, and an AUC of 0.85 compared with the ICD-10. Compared with the ICD-10, adding psychomotor change to the CAM algorithm improved specificity to 97%, but sensitivity fell to 55% (AUC = 0.96). Applying psychomotor change sequentially only to the group that the CAM algorithm identified as having no delirium improved sensitivity to 91% with specificity of 85% (AUC = 0.95).

Conclusion

Although the CAM diagnostic algorithm performed well against a DSM-IV reference standard, adding psychomotor change to the CAM algorithm improved specificity and diagnostic value against ICD-10 criteria overall in older adults with dementia and improved sensitivity and screening performance when applied sequentially in CAM-negative individuals.

### Improving recognition of delirium in clinical practice: a call for action [^1172qRFL]. BMC Geriatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this correspondence article is to report opinion amongst experts in the delirium field as to why, despite on-going training for all health professionals, delirium continues to be under recognised. Consensus was obtained by means of two conference workshops and an online survey of members of the European Delirium Association. Major barriers to recognition at an individual level include ignorance about the benefit of treating delirium. At an organisational level, reflecting socio-cultural attitudes, barriers include a low strategic and financial priority and the fact that delirium is an orphan condition falling between specialties.

### Delirium in older persons: advances in diagnosis and treatment [^1126VjxV]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Delirium is defined as an acute disorder of attention and cognition. It is a common, serious, and often fatal condition among older patients. Although often underrecognized, delirium has serious adverse effects on the individual's function and quality of life, as well as broad societal effects with substantial health care costs.

Objective

To summarize the current state of the art in diagnosis and treatment of delirium and to highlight critical areas for future research to advance the field.

Evidence Review

Search of Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for the past 6 years, from January 1, 2011, until March 16, 2017, using a combination of controlled vocabulary and keyword terms. Since delirium is more prevalent in older adults, the focus was on studies in elderly populations; studies based solely in the intensive care unit (ICU) and non-English-language articles were excluded.

Findings

Of 127 articles included, 25 were clinical trials, 42 cohort studies, 5 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and 55 were other categories. A total of 11 616 patients were represented in the treatment studies. Advances in diagnosis have included the development of brief screening tools with high sensitivity and specificity, such as the 3-Minute Diagnostic Assessment; 4 A's Test; and proxy-based measures such as the Family Confusion Assessment Method. Measures of severity, such as the Confusion Assessment Method-Severity Score, can aid in monitoring response to treatment, risk stratification, and assessing prognosis. Nonpharmacologic approaches focused on risk factors such as immobility, functional decline, visual or hearing impairment, dehydration, and sleep deprivation are effective for delirium prevention and also are recommended for delirium treatment. Current recommendations for pharmacologic treatment of delirium, based on recent reviews of the evidence, recommend reserving use of antipsychotics and other sedating medications for treatment of severe agitation that poses risk to patient or staff safety or threatens interruption of essential medical therapies.

Conclusions and Relevance

Advances in diagnosis can improve recognition and risk stratification of delirium. Prevention of delirium using nonpharmacologic approaches is documented to be effective, while pharmacologic prevention and treatment of delirium remains controversial.

### Concordance between DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria for delirium diagnosis in a pooled database of 768 prospectively evaluated patients using the delirium rating scale-revised-98 [^112CPtqc]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The CIRG used a standardized approach to clinical rating of the DRS-R98 based upon the DRS-R98 Administration Manual which utilizes both objective testing and subjective interviewer-based judgments for rating item severities, where particular tests and interview questions are used as probes for symptoms. In order to standardize DRS-R98 rating performance across CIRG studies, we developed and utilized training procedures that included a workshop and video case vignettes. Additionally, for this report, relevant DRS-R98 items were selected to serve as content proxies for the presence of DSM-5 criteria to generate the post hoc determination of DSM-5 criteria. DSM-5 was defined in two ways: strict criteria (for example, requiring all criteria in their most explicit forms) versus relaxed criteria, where features were included in all possible forms.

The strict and relaxed DSM-5 criteria for the post hoc proxy qualification of the presence of DSM-5 delirium criteria using DRS-R98 items areas are shown in Table 3. The two interpretations differ principally in relation to criteria A and B. For criterion A, the strict criterion required evidence of impaired attention as well as impaired awareness evidenced by 'impaired orientation to the environment' required to have a documented impairment of orientation to time, place or person as tested in formal cognitive assessment for the DRS-R98 Orientation item. The relaxed interpretation did not require the latter but focused upon disturbed attention by applying only DRS-R98 evidence of inattention. For criterion B, the strict interpretation required both acute onset and fluctuating symptom pattern, while the relaxed interpretation required either acute/subacute onset or fluctuation symptom course.

Informed consent

Similar bioethical procedures were used for all patient groups. The procedures and rationale for assessments were explained to all patients but because many had delirium at study entry it was presumed that most would not be capable of giving informed written consent. At each site, local ethics committees approved an approach whereby patient verbal assent was augmented with proxy consent from next of kin (where possible) or a responsible caregiver. This is in accordance with the Helsinki Guidelines for medical research involving human subjects. These assessment procedures did not have any identified significant risks but the patient or family was informed that they could withdraw participation at any stage.

### Delirium [^116XJtYe]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Delirium is an acute confusional state that is common and costly and is associated with significant functional decline and distress. It is the manifestation of acute encephalopathy and is variably called acute brain failure, acute brain dysfunction, or altered mental status. All patients are at risk for delirium, although those with more vulnerabilities (such as advanced age, exposures to other stressors like infection, and certain medications) are at higher risk. The pathophysiologic cause of delirium is not well understood. It is important to recognize patients at risk for and those with delirium and to immediately identify and treat factors contributing to it. There is no single intervention or medication to treat delirium, making it challenging to manage. Therefore, risk mitigation and prompt treatment rely on a sophisticated strategy to address the contributing factors. Delirium may be prevented or attenuated when multimodal strategies are used, thereby improving patient outcomes.

### Transplantation-associated altered mentation and encephalopathy: a new classification for acute neurocognitive changes associated with hematopoietic cell transplantation from the ASTCT committee on practice guidelines [^115mZS2U]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) — diagnostic classification for acute neurocognitive changes aligns with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria A through C, and delirium may be diagnosed when criteria A, B, and C are all present; the term subsyndromal delirium is recommended for acute cognitive changes compatible with delirium but not meeting all 3 A, B, and C DSM-5 criteria, and DSM-5 delirium requires changes in attention and awareness, rapidly evolving with fluctuating severity, plus additional cognitive changes that are not associated with a known neurocognitive disorder or coma and occur in the context of a medical condition or treatment such as HCT. The term acute encephalopathy is recommended to describe a rapidly developing (< 4 weeks) pathobiological brain process expressed clinically as either subsyndromal delirium, delirium or coma, which may have additional features such as seizures or extrapyramidal signs, and it is not recommended as a descriptor of bedside clinical features. The framework proposes clear diagnostic criteria under the pathophysiologic brain process acute encephalopathy and the spectrum of clinical manifestations including coma, delirium, and subsyndromal delirium.

### Advancing specificity in delirium: the delirium subtyping initiative [^111jd5A4]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients' understanding of why, who, what, and where should be evaluated: Is their thinking clear, and can they use language in a coherent, goal‐directed, productive way? Where appropriate, their ability to use reason and appropriate syntax to communicate effectively or to interpret syntax correctly, should be evaluated. Open‐ended questions can better assess the extent to which patients can engage productively and coherently. We also see a need to pursue additional ways of evaluating the mental content of consciousness in patients who are currently considered "unable to engage". In a review of 88,206 Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) records, people who were "unable to assess" had worse outcomes. In critically ill patients, it may be the case that they are unable to speak due to an endotracheal tube rather than because of delirium. The definition of "inability to engage" deserves careful operationalization, and creative approaches to modifying assessments for people incapable of performing certain tasks should be explored and validated.

This recommendation applies to patients who are being screened due to risk of, or suspected, delirium. However, we acknowledge that often delirium screening is carried out for less specific purposes, for example, during overall monitoring for infection, and so this level of careful observation may not be necessary.
‐Delirium subtyping methods should consider including a broader range of "delirium‐spectrum syndromes".

Identification of new methods for delirium subtyping should consider all "delirium‐spectrum syndromes", ranging from mild subsyndromal delirium to stupor and coma, while maintaining the fidelity of delirium as a categorical entity. Starting with a broader clinical impression without restriction to delirium diagnosis could also provide a broader understanding of the spectrum of mental states ranging from subsyndromal delirium to delirium and perhaps reduce the risk of maintaining clinically unhelpful or arbitrary boundaries. This approach deserves consideration across clinical settings as there may be unique setting‐specific applications.

### An interdisciplinary statement of scientific societies for the advancement of delirium care across Europe (EDA, EANS, EUGMS, COTEC, IPTOP / WCPT) [^112hjDUB]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Collaboration among health care professionals

As it has been highlighted, delirium is not only limited to a geriatric population or geriatric wards but it is present in different clinical settings. Given the outcomes related to delirium and especially its underrecognition, it is essential that all health care professionals have adequate knowledge of this syndrome. In this paper we strongly support the formation of an interdisciplinary approach in the management of delirium involving a specific delirium society (European Delirium Association, EDA;), a geriatric society (European Geriatric Medicine Society, EuGMS;), a nursing society (European Academy of Nursing Science, EANS) an occupational therapy society (Council of Occupational Therapists for European Countries, COTEC) and a physiotherapy society (World Confederation for Physical Therapy, WCPT; and its official subgroup The International association of Physical Therapists working with Older People IPTOP;). Similar to pushing for greater collaboration amongst disciplines on the ward by proposing a unified approach organizational level it is likely that system barriers may be more likely to be overcome.

Improve the daily clinical practice: screening, diagnosis, surveillance, monitoring for recovery

The diagnosis of delirium currently relies on the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) and the International Classification of Disease-10 (Table 2). However, it is well recognized how these criteria could limit delirium screening and diagnosis since they require extensive training to be applied. In recent years, several tools have been developed for delirium screening and diagnosis with the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) being one of the most used. More recently a new tool, the 4AT has been developed to fill existing gap in the use of screening and diagnostic tools (Fig. 2). In particular, the 4AT has important key features: it takes less than 2 min to be administered; it is suitable for use in normal clinical practice; it does not require specific training. It has been validated in geriatric and rehabilitation settings. The 4AT can easily be used by all health care providers including nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists.

### Association between components of the delirium syndrome and outcomes in hospitalised adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116YUGng]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is a heterogeneous syndrome with inattention as the core feature. There is considerable variation in the presence and degree of other symptom domains such as altered arousal, psychotic features and global cognitive dysfunction. Delirium is independently associated with increased mortality, but it is unclear whether individual symptom domains of delirium have prognostic importance. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in hospitalised adults in general settings to identify the relationship between symptom domains of delirium and outcomes. (PROSPERO: CRD42018093935).

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, clinicaltrials.gov and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to November 2019. We included studies of hospitalised adults that reported associations between symptom domains of delirium and 30-day mortality (primary outcome), and other outcomes including mortality at other time points, length of stay, and dementia. Reviewer pairs independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias (Risk of Bias Assessment tool for Non-randomized Studies) and quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. We performed random-effects meta-analyses stratified by delirium domain where possible.

Results

From 7092 citations we included 6 studies (6002 patients, 1112 with delirium). Higher mortality (ranging from in-hospital to follow-up beyond 12months) was associated with altered arousal (pooled Odds Ratio (OR) 2.80, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 2.33–3.37; moderate-quality evidence), inattention (pooled OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.74–3.80; low-quality evidence), and in single studies with disorientation, memory deficits and disorganised thoughts. Risk of bias varied across studies but was moderate-to-high overall, mainly due to selection bias, lack of blinding of assessments and unclear risk of selective outcome reporting. We found no studies on the association between psychotic features, visuospatial deficits or affective disturbances in delirium and outcomes, or studies reporting non-mortality outcomes.

Conclusions

Few studies have related symptom domains of delirium to outcomes, but the available evidence suggests that altered arousal and inattention in delirium are associated with higher mortality than normal arousal and attention in people with or without delirium. Measurable symptom domains of delirium may have value in predicting survival and stratifying patients for treatment. We recommend that future delirium studies report outcomes by symptom domain.

### Delirium disorder: integrating delirium and acute encephalopathy [^115ZrRZ1]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

As the US population ages and with no definitive delirium treatments on the horizon, the delirium epidemic is on course to expand over the coming decades. Recognizing the import of this condition, a recent position statement from 10 medical societies-among whom the American Academy of Neurology was represented-issued recommendations on preferred nomenclature of delirium and acute encephalopathy: it concluded by preferring both terms. Urgently needed is an integrated model that addresses the near-total segregation of these separate bodies of literature, ideally one that offers an interdisciplinary framework to bring these 2 terms and those who use them together.

Methods

We review the historical forces that have led these terms to diverge and consider the unique benefits of each approach as well as their liabilities when considered in isolation. We then explore the potential implications of integrating these concepts and propose a hybrid model to capitalize on the strengths of both the model of delirium and that of acute encephalopathy.

Results

The model we propose-delirium disorder-builds on the recommendations of this recent position statement and provides a unifying framework designed to have clinical utility and interdisciplinary appeal. It also broadens the translational landscape by identifying 4 distinct treatment targets: underlying causes, procognitive factors, delirium (phenotype alone), and neurophysiologic targets.

Conclusions

This person-centered model aims to integrate delirium and acute encephalopathy within a single framework and shared nomenclature. It is hoped that this model aids in harmonizing research efforts and advancing clinical practice.

### Concordance between DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria for delirium diagnosis in a pooled database of 768 prospectively evaluated patients using the delirium rating scale-revised-98 [^114SeswB]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual fifth edition (DSM-5) provides new criteria for delirium diagnosis. We examined delirium diagnosis using these new criteria compared with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual fourth edition (DSM-IV) in a large dataset of patients assessed for delirium and related presentations.

Methods

Patient data (n = 768) from six prospectively collected cohorts, clinically assessed using DSM-IV and the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (DRS-R98), were pooled. Post hoc application of DRS-R98 item scores were used to rate DSM-5 criteria. 'Strict' and 'relaxed' DSM-5 criteria to ascertain delirium were compared to rates determined by DSM-IV.

Results

Using DSM-IV by clinical assessment, delirium was found in 510/768 patients (66%). Strict DSM-5 criteria categorized 158 as delirious including 155 (30%) with DSM-IV delirium, whereas relaxed DSM-5 criteria identified 466 as delirious, including 455 (89%) diagnosed by DSM-IV (P < 0.001). The concordance between the different diagnostic methods was: 53% (ĸ = 0.22) between DSM-IV and the strict DSM-5, 91% (ĸ = 0.82) between the DSM-IV and relaxed DSM-5 criteria and 60% (ĸ = 0.29) between the strict versus relaxed DSM-5 criteria. Only 155 cases were identified as delirium by all three approaches. The 55 (11%) patients with DSM-IV delirium who were not rated as delirious by relaxed criteria had lower mean DRS-R98 total scores than those rated as delirious (13.7 ± 3.9 versus 23.7 ± 6.0; P < 0.001). Conversely, mean DRS-R98 score (21.1 ± 6.4) for the 70% not rated as delirious by strict DSM-5 criteria was consistent with suggested cutoff scores for full syndromal delirium. Only 11 cases met DSM-5 criteria that were not deemed to have DSM-IV delirium.

Conclusions

The concordance between DSM-IV and the new DSM-5 delirium criteria varies considerably depending on the interpretation of criteria. Overly-strict adherence for some new text details in DSM-5 criteria would reduce the number of delirium cases diagnosed; however, a more 'relaxed' approach renders DSM-5 criteria comparable to DSM-IV with minimal impact on their actual application and is thus recommended.

### Confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) for the diagnosis of delirium in adults in critical care settings [^112XvLox]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is an underdiagnosed clinical syndrome typified by an acute alteration of mental state. It is an important problem in critical care and intensive care units (ICU) due to its high prevalence and its association with adverse outcomes. Delirium is a very distressing condition for patients, with a huge impact on their well-being. Diagnosis of delirium in the critical care setting is challenging. This is especially true for patients who are mechanically ventilated and are therefore unable to engage in a verbal interview. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) is a tool specifically designed to assess for delirium in the context of ICU patients, including those on mechanical ventilation. CAM-ICU can be administered by non-specialists to give a dichotomous delirium present/absent result.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the CAM-ICU for the diagnosis of delirium in adult patients in critical care units.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 1946 to 8 July 2022), Embase (Ovid SP, 1982 to 8 July 2022), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Knowledge, 1945 to 8 July 2022), PsycINFO (Ovid SP, 1806 to 8 July 2022), and LILACS (BIREME, 1982 to 8 July 2022). We checked the reference lists of included studies and other resources for additional potentially relevant studies. We also searched the Health Technology Assessment database, the Cochrane Library, Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility database, WHO ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov, and websites of scientific associations to access any annual meetings and abstracts of conference proceedings in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included diagnostic studies enrolling adult ICU patients assessed using the CAM-ICU tool, regardless of language or publication status and reporting sufficient data on delirium diagnosis for the construction of 2 x 2 tables. Eligible studies evaluated the diagnostic performance of the CAM-ICU versus a clinical reference standard based on any iteration of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria applied by a clinical expert.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected and collated study data. We assessed the methodological quality of studies using the QUADAS-2 tool. We used two univariate fixed-effect or random-effects models to determine summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity. We performed sensitivity analyses that excluded studies considered to be at high risk of bias and high concerns in applicability, due mainly to the target population included (e.g. patients with traumatic brain injury). We also investigated potential sources of heterogeneity, assessing the effect of reference standard diagnosis and proportion of patients ventilated.

Main Results

We included 25 studies (2817 participants). The mean age of participants ranged from 48 to 69 years; 15 of the studies included critical care units admitting mixed populations (e.g. medical, trauma, surgery patients). The percentage of patients receiving mechanical ventilation ranged from 11.8% to 100%. The prevalence of delirium in the studies included ranged from 12.5% to 83.9%. Presence of delirium was determined by the application of DSM-IV criteria in 13 out of 25 included studies. We assessed 13 studies as at low risk of bias and low applicability concerns for all QUADAS-2 domains. The most common issue of concern was flow and timing of the tests, followed by patient selection. Overall, we estimated a pooled sensitivity of 0.78 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.83) and a pooled specificity of 0.95 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.97). Sensitivity analysis restricted to studies at low risk of bias and without any applicability concerns (n = 13 studies) gave similar summary accuracy indices (sensitivity 0.80 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.86), specificity 0.95 (95% CI 0.93 to 0.97)). Subgroup analyses based on diagnostic assessment found summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity for studies using DSM-IV of 0.79 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.85) and 0.94 (95% CI 0.90 to 0.96). For studies that used DSM-5 criteria, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 0.75 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.82) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.99). DSM criteria had no significant effect on sensitivity (P = 0.421), but the specificity for detection of delirium was higher when DSM-5 criteria were used (P = 0.024). The relative specificity comparing DSM-5 versus DSM-IV criteria was 1.05 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.08). Summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity for studies recruiting < 100% of patients with mechanical ventilation were 0.81 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.85) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.98). For studies that exclusively recruited patients with mechanical ventilation, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 0.91 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.97) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.99). Although there was a suggestion of differential performance of CAM-ICU in ventilated patients, the differences were not significant in sensitivity (P = 0.316) or in specificity (P = 0.493).

Authors' Conclusions

The CAM-ICU tool may have a role in the early identification of delirium, in adult patients hospitalized in intensive care units, including those on mechanical ventilation, when non-specialized, properly trained clinical personnel apply the CAM-ICU. The test is most useful for exclusion of delirium. The test may miss a proportion of patients with incident delirium, therefore in situations where detection of all delirium cases is desirable, it may be best to repeat the test or combine CAM-ICU with another assessment. Future studies should compare different screening tests proposed for bedside assessment of delirium, as this approach will reveal which tool yields superior accuracy. In addition, future studies should consider and report the flow and timing of the tests and clearly report key characteristics related to patient selection. Finally, future research should focus on the impact of CAM-ICU screening on patient outcomes.

### Delirium: sifting through the confusion [^114n93Ba]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Delirium is commonly encountered in the hospital setting, particularly in the intensive care unit. However, the diagnosis is often missed, due in part to the nature of the illness, fluctuating levels of consciousness, and varied presentation. Even when it is recognized, delirium can be hard to manage, with multiple factors contributing to its course. In this article, we review the latest information regarding the underlying mechanisms of the syndrome and treatment options available. This is accomplished by examining two complex cases encountered at a university medical center-based psychosomatic service.

For the complete cohort (n = 768) the concordance among DSM-IV and the two definitions of DSM-5 is graphed as a Venn diagram in Figure 1 and shown in Table 4 with sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for the strict and relaxed DSM-5 criteria in relation to DSM-IV delirium criteria. The concordance between the different diagnostic methods for the whole dataset was 53% (ĸ = 0.22) between DSM-IV and the strict DSM-5, 91% (ĸ = 0.82) between the DSM-IV and relaxed DSM-5 criteria and 60% (ĸ = 0.29) between the strict versus relaxed DSM-5 criteria. Only 155 cases were identified as delirium by all three approaches and 455 were identified by both DSM-IV and relaxed DSM-5. There were three cases of delirium unique to the strict DSM-5 versus DSM-IV group, compared to 355 DSM-IV cases of delirium negative by the strict interpretation of DSM-5. There were 55 delirium cases unique to DSM-IV as compared to either DSM-5 group (characteristics described below). Further, 11 patients met DSM-5 relaxed criteria but not DSM-IV delirium.

### Guidelines for psychological practice with older adults [^117Svdf7]. The American Psychologist (2014). Medium credibility.

Delirium and major neurocognitive disorder in older adults — clinical significance and age-related prevalence are highlighted: acute confusional states (delirium, also known as acute brain failure) often signal underlying illness or toxic reactions and can be lethal if untreated but may be ameliorated or reversed with prompt medical attention; the prevalence of Major Neurocognitive Disorder increases dramatically with age, with 5% of people aged 65–74 years having Alzheimer's dementia compared with 33% of people over the age of 85; and the most common forms include Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia (VaD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), with growing recognition that many clinically diagnosed cases reflect mixed pathology.

### Association between components of the delirium syndrome and outcomes in hospitalised adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117E5C66]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We conducted a systematic review to establish if the presence of individual symptom domains of delirium in hospitalised adults, in studies which included patients with delirium, is associated with increased mortality and other adverse patient outcomes. The potential effect on outcomes of individual symptom domains of delirium was studied in both patients with and without a delirium diagnosis.

### Advances in management of neuropsychiatric syndromes in neurodegenerative diseases [^113kYbTj]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

A similar strategy for diagnosis of dementia and AD is adopted by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th ed. This approach defines major neurocognitive disorder as having evidence of significant decline from past cognitive ability, impairment of cognitive performance sufficient to interfere with activities of daily living (ADL), and not exclusively explained by a delirium or some other mental disorder. The clinical symptoms include memory impairment, language abnormalities, visuospatial disturbance, executive dysfunction, attention impairment, and social cognition decline. The inclusion of social cognition as a key feature allows major cognitive disorder to be identified by decline in empathy, sympathy, social judgment, responsiveness to social cues, and appropriate social behavior. Major neurocognitive disorder due to AD requires the presence of memory impairment plus impairment of at least one of the other domains. In this setting, compromised social cognition in addition to memory impairment would allow fulfillment of the clinical criteria for major neurocognitive disorder due to AD.

There are four core clinical features of DLB, two of which must be present to allow a diagnosis of DLB in a patient with progressive cognitive decline. These core features include fluctuating cognition, recurrent visual hallucinations, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, and parkinsonism. One can make a diagnosis with no behavioral features based on fluctuating cognition and parkinsonism, but behavioral features including hallucinations and REM sleep behavior disorder are core features that can fulfill the criteria for probable DLB and are invoked in a majority of DLB diagnoses.

Diagnostic criteria for PD dementia identify behavioral symptoms (apathy, depressed or anxious mood, hallucinations, delusions, excessive daytime sleepiness) as supportive of the diagnosis but note that the absence of behavioral symptoms does not exclude the diagnosis.

The diagnostic criteria for corticobasal degeneration include insidious onset and gradual progression in an individual 50 years of age or older. Symptoms must be present for a minimum of 1 year and include the corticobasal syndrome or a frontobehavioral syndrome plus at least one corticobasal feature, such as asymmetric limb rigidity or bradykinesia, asymmetric limb dystonia, asymmetric limb myoclonus, orobuccal or limb apraxia, cortical sensory deficit, or alien limb phenomenon. Thus, a behavioral type of frontobehavioral syndrome plus one corticobasal syndrome feature allows the diagnosis of corticobasal degeneration.

### A research algorithm to improve detection of delirium in the intensive care unit [^111UYCB4]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Key messages

- The CAM-ICU should be used to clinically screen patients for delirium and should ideally be performed at least once per nursing shift.

- Screening for delirium in research studies should include both the CAM-ICU and chart review due to delirium's fluctuating nature.

- While the presence of chart documentation has a good positive predictive value for detecting delirium, the absence of chart documentation cannot reliably exclude delirium in an ICU population.

### Outcome of delirium in critically ill patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114qvBDT]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Another constraint in this study is that there are potentially unmeasured confounders such as differences in the timing and frequency of assessment of delirium, in the use of sedatives, and in the medical management of critically ill patients. While advances have been made in identifying delirium in such patients, it is also apparent that the construct of delirium and the currently available assessment tools for delirium do not sufficiently characterize the range of central nervous system alterations that could be encountered in the intensive care unit. Subtypes of delirium including hypoactive delirium or subsyndromal delirium, for example, might not be accurately or reliably detected with available delirium instruments. Criteria used in defining and scoring delirium differ between studies and could overlap with those used to describe other syndromes of impaired cognitive function or consciousness. In particular, patients whose level of consciousness is depressed or who are comatose might be misclassified as having delirium or alternatively might be excluded altogether from neurocognitive assessment.

Recent work has shown that the impact of delirium on mortality in intensive care is reduced after adjustment for time varying confounders, with most of the negative impact on outcomes confined to the group with persistent delirium. Although this does not diminish the overall importance of the present data, it certainly points in a new direction for clinical research. Future studies should focus on patients with persistent delirium and its impact on neurocognitive outcomes and survival. Notwithstanding these limitations, the results of this meta-analysis show a robust association between the occurrence of delirium in the intensive care unit and adverse short term outcomes.

Conclusion

Delirium is common in a broad sample of critically ill patients and is strongly associated with increased hospital mortality even after adjustment for severity of disease. Evidence also suggests a relation between delirium in the intensive care unit and long term cognitive impairment. Research is needed to unravel the biological mechanisms governing these relations and to discover strategies and treatments that will reduce the burden of acute and long term brain dysfunction in critically ill populations.

### The confusion assessment method: a systematic review of current usage [^112x4wt2]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the psychometric properties, adaptations, translations, and applications of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), a widely used instrument and diagnostic algorithm for identification of delirium.

Design

Systematic literature review.

Setting

Not applicable.

Measurements

Electronic searches of PubMED, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Ageline, and Google Scholar, augmented by reviews of reference listings, were conducted to identify original English-language articles using the CAM from January 1, 1991, to December 31, 2006. Two reviewers independently abstracted key information from each article.

Participants

Not applicable.

Results

Of 239 original articles, 10 (4%) were categorized as validation studies, 16 (7%) as adaptations, 12 (5%) as translations, and 222 (93%) as applications. Validation studies evaluated performance of the CAM against a reference standard. Results were combined across seven high-quality studies (N = 1,071), demonstrating an overall sensitivity of 94% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 91–97%) and specificity of 89% (95% CI = 85–94%). The CAM has been adapted for use in the intensive care unit, emergency, and institutional settings and for scoring severity and subsyndromal delirium. The CAM has been translated into 10 languages where published articles are available. In application studies, CAM-rated delirium is most commonly used as a risk factor or outcome but also as an intervention or reference standard.

Conclusion

The CAM has helped to improve identification of delirium in clinical and research settings. To optimize performance, the CAM should be scored based on observations made during formal cognitive testing, and training is recommended. Future action is needed to optimize use of the CAM and to improve the recognition and management of delirium.

### Tools to detect delirium superimposed on dementia: a systematic review [^1127bLP5]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To identify valid tools to diagnose delirium superimposed on dementia.

Design

Systematic review of studies of delirium tools that explicitly included individuals with dementia.

Setting

Hospital.

Participants

Studies were included if delirium assessment tools were validated against standard criteria, and the presence of dementia was assessed according to standard criteria that used validated instruments.

Measurements

PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched for articles in English published between January 1960 and January 2012.

Results

Nine studies fulfilled the selection criteria. Of 1,569 participants, 401 had dementia, and 50 had delirium superimposed on dementia. Six delirium tools were evaluated. One study using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) with 85% of participants with dementia had high specificity (96–100%) and moderate sensitivity (77%). Two intensive care unit studies that used the CAM for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) reported 100% sensitivity and specificity for delirium in 23 individuals with dementia. One study using electroencephalography reported sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 91% in a population with a 100% prevalence of dementia. No studies examined potential effects of dementia severity or subtype on diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusions

The evidence base on tools for detection of delirium superimposed on dementia is limited, although some existing tools show promise. Further studies of existing or refined tools with larger samples and more-detailed characterization of dementia are required to address the identification of delirium superimposed on dementia.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^112KUCZ3]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal — diagnosis and differential diagnosis recommendations — To diagnose alcohol withdrawal and alcohol withdrawal delirium, use diagnostic criteria such as those provided by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th Edition (DSM-5). To diagnose alcohol use disorder, use diagnostic criteria such as those provided by the DSM-5. Alcohol withdrawal severity assessment scales (including the Clinical Instrument Withdrawal Assessment For Alcohol, Revised [CIWA-Ar]) should not be used as a diagnostic tool because scores can be influenced by conditions other than alcohol withdrawal. Do not rule in or rule out the presence of alcohol withdrawal for patients who have a positive blood alcohol concentration. As part of differential diagnosis, assess the patient's signs, symptoms, and drinking history. Rule out other serious illnesses that can mimic the signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Determine if patients take medications that can mask the signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Do not rule in or rule out a co-occurring disease, co-occurring mental health disorder, co-occurring substance use disorder, or simultaneous withdrawal from other substances even in the presence of alcohol withdrawal. Conduct a neurological exam in patients presenting with a seizure to determine etiology. A seizure should only be attributed to alcohol withdrawal if there was a recent cessation of (or reduction in) a patient's alcohol consumption. For patients experiencing new onset seizures or for patients with a known history of alcohol withdrawal seizures showing a new pattern, an electroencephalogram and/or neuroimaging is recommended.

Delirium in critically ill adults — overview and screening: Delirium is common in critically ill adults and is a clinical diagnosis; most studies detect delirium using screening tools such as the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) or the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). Delirium can be disturbing for affected patients and relatives and is associated with worse outcome, and much higher ICU and hospital LOS and costs. In this guideline, we address six actionable questions and five descriptive questions.

### Definition of delirium-NCI dictionary of cancer terms… [^1177kJRJ]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

deliriumListen to pronunciationA mental state in which a person is confused and has reduced awareness of their surroundings. The person may also be anxious, agitated, or have less energy than usual and be tired or depressed. Delirium can also cause hallucinations and changes in attention span, mood or behavior, judgement, muscle control, and sleeping patterns. The symptoms of delirium usually occur suddenly, last a short time, and may come and go. It may be caused by infection, dehydration, abnormal levels of some electrolytes, organ failure, medicines, or serious illness, such as advanced cancer.

### DELIRIUM… [^111g7YZf]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Delirium is a term of many meanings. Literally it means "to go out of the furrow in ploughing, " i.e., "to go off the track. " We shall use it to describe a syndrome sometimes called the symptomatic psychosis, the toxic-infectious exhaustion state or psychosis associated with somatic disease. Essentially it is a more or less reversible psychotic episode appearing symptomatically during the course of an underlying physical disorder. Thus, it may occur in patients with no preexisting structural cerebral disease and may be associated with such conditions as drug intoxications, febrile states and cardiac and renal disease. It may also occur spontaneously or may be precipitated by the aforementioned factors in patients with preexisting structural cerebral disease. Previous psychologic and clinical studies1 have led us to formulate a principle of release for the explanation of the intellectual, emotional and motor regressive behavior of delirious patients.
