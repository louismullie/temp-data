## Question

Ankle brachial index to diagnose PAD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to use the ankle-brachial index (ABI) to diagnose peripheral artery disease (PAD), including when to test, how to measure and interpret results, special populations, and how to act on findings. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pretest probability. Then, I should verify the diagnostic thresholds and test performance. Next, I will review the measurement technique and common pitfalls. After that, I need to consider special populations where ABI can be misleading. Then, I should outline a stepwise diagnostic algorithm and follow-up strategy. Finally, I will integrate guideline positions and synthesize a practical approach with explicit uncertainties and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pretest probability, because ABI is most informative when the pretest probability is intermediate to high. I should screen for classic risk factors and symptoms: exertional calf pain relieved by rest, walking impairment, nonhealing wounds, absent or diminished pulses, and bruits, while remembering that many patients with PAD are asymptomatic or have atypical symptoms, which lowers the sensitivity of the clinical exam and elevates the value of ABI in the right context [^114bft53] [^115NkD8c]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — USPSTF concludes evidence is insufficient for routine screening of asymptomatic adults without risk factors, so I need to ensure I am not overextending ABI into low-risk, asymptomatic populations [^111EdAL9] [^116y3UUD].

> I need to check the diagnostic thresholds and test performance next. A resting ABI ≤ 0.90 is the conventional cutoff for PAD, with borderline 0.91–0.99 and normal 1.00–1.40; ABI > 1.40 suggests noncompressible arteries and mandates alternative testing rather than reassurance [^114ChQEk] [^116a1ePj]. Wait, let me verify sensitivity and specificity in asymptomatic cohorts — USPSTF reports sensitivity around 15–20% and specificity 96–99% against MRA in older adults, which means a low ABI is specific but not sensitive for anatomically significant disease in screening settings, reinforcing the need to align testing with pretest probability [^1168ETe2] [^111rngDh]. In symptomatic populations, sensitivity and specificity are higher, roughly 68–84% and 84–99% respectively, which supports using ABI as the first-line diagnostic test when PAD is suspected [^114ChQEk].

> Next, I should review the measurement technique and potential pitfalls. ABI is the ratio of the higher ankle systolic pressure (posterior tibial or dorsalis pedis) to the higher brachial systolic pressure, measured supine after 5–10 minutes of rest, with cuffs sized to limb circumference and Doppler or automated devices used consistently; I should double-check for inter-arm pressure differences > 15–20 mmHg and use the higher arm pressure to avoid misclassification [^112Wqzn6] [^11524gxU]. Hold on, I should verify operator effects — accuracy depends on training and equipment; oscillometric devices may outperform manual Doppler in inexperienced hands, and repeating measurements improves reliability, so I need to ensure standardized protocols and quality control [^113yhyf8] [^113kP3W3].

> I will now examine special populations where ABI can be misleading. In diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and advanced age, medial arterial calcification can yield falsely elevated or noncompressible ABI values; in these cases, I should confirm with toe-brachial index (TBI), where TBI ≤ 0.7 is abnormal and digital arteries are less often calcified, improving diagnostic yield when ABI is > 1.40 or otherwise inconclusive [^113skfmQ] [^113ZtWZw] [^115jo7cL]. Wait, let me verify performance in diabetes — meta-analytic data show ABI has high specificity but lower sensitivity in people with diabetes, so a normal ABI does not exclude PAD and TBI or duplex ultrasound should be used if clinical suspicion remains high [^117CAU4t] [^114LAyot].

> Let me consider borderline and exercise ABI next. If resting ABI is 0.91–0.99 and suspicion persists, I should perform exercise ABI with a standardized treadmill or toe-raise protocol; a drop in ABI to ≤ 0.90, a decrease of about 20%, or a delayed recovery increases the likelihood of hemodynamically significant PAD and helps correlate symptoms with objective ischemia [^114ChQEk] [^115jo7cL]. I should double-check that exercise testing is not a substitute for resting ABI — it extends diagnostic sensitivity when resting values are equivocal but normal resting ABI with negative exercise testing makes significant PAD unlikely in the right clinical context [^115hwyMe].

> Now, I should outline a stepwise diagnostic algorithm and follow-up. First, assess symptoms, risk factors, and pulses; if pretest probability is low, observation and risk factor modification are reasonable. If pretest probability is intermediate to high, obtain bilateral resting ABI; if ≤ 0.90, diagnose PAD and initiate guideline-directed medical therapy and risk factor control. If 0.91–0.99, consider exercise ABI or alternative testing; if > 1.40, obtain TBI and waveforms. If TBI is abnormal or suspicion remains high, proceed to anatomic imaging (duplex ultrasound, CTA, or MRA) when revascularization is contemplated; avoid routine anatomic imaging in asymptomatic patients without a plan to intervene [^114ChQEk] [^116Bj67U] [^113Ywfty]. Hold on, I should verify follow-up cadence — after revascularization or significant disease, periodic clinical evaluation with repeat ABI is reasonable, with a change of about 0.15 considered clinically meaningful for progression or response [^112G9ZqM].

> Next, I should review how to act on results. A confirmed low ABI should trigger high-intensity cardiovascular risk reduction: smoking cessation, high-dose statin, blood pressure control, diabetes optimization, and antiplatelet therapy unless contraindicated; supervised exercise therapy is indicated for symptomatic patients, though benefits in screen-detected asymptomatic populations are unproven in trials to date [^116UfGTc] [^112U6dMG]. Wait, let me reconsider aspirin for everyone with a low ABI — USPSTF evidence shows no net benefit of adding aspirin solely based on low ABI in unselected populations, so antiplatelet decisions should be individualized to global cardiovascular risk and symptom status rather than ABI alone [^111aKPJa] [^111EdAL9].

> I need to ensure I integrate guideline positions coherently. USPSTF issues an I statement for routine ABI screening in asymptomatic adults, citing insufficient evidence of net benefit, whereas ACC/AHA recommends ABI in increased-risk adults (≥ 65 years, or ≥ 50 years with diabetes, smoking, or other atherosclerotic risk factors), and ESC/ESVS endorse ABI as first-line for diagnosis and risk stratification in appropriate clinical contexts; this divergence reflects differing evidence bases and policy perspectives, not a contradiction in test validity [^111EdAL9] [^114qVb3B] [^117WVknR] [^116GWp2F]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not implying screening is prohibited — rather, it is not routinely recommended outside risk-enhanced settings, and shared decision-making is prudent when uncertainty exists [^111EdAL9] [^114qVb3B].

> But wait, what about prognostic implications beyond diagnosis? Lower ABI correlates with higher risks of mortality, cardiovascular events, functional decline, and severe limb outcomes; even borderline ABI values carry elevated risk, which supports using ABI for risk stratification even when symptoms are minimal or absent, while acknowledging that screening entire populations has not yet proven to improve hard outcomes in trials [^117VHSGr] [^11153yAq] [^113ywv13] [^1156KQDS]. I should double-check that I am not overpromising screening benefits — prognostic value is robust, but randomized evidence for screening-driven outcome improvement remains limited, reinforcing a targeted approach rather than universal screening [^111EdAL9] [^114inh2v].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical approach. Use ABI when PAD is suspected based on symptoms, risk factors, or abnormal pulses; interpret results within pretest probability; apply standard thresholds and escalate to TBI, exercise testing, or anatomic imaging when indicated; and commit to aggressive risk factor modification when PAD is confirmed. Avoid routine ABI screening in low-risk, asymptomatic adults, but consider it reasonable in higher-risk patients after discussing uncertainties and potential downstream actions, aligning with ACC/AHA guidance and USPSTF's emphasis on evidence gaps and shared decision-making [^114qVb3B] [^111EdAL9] [^113Ywfty].

The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a **simple, non-invasive test** that compares ankle and brachial systolic pressures to diagnose peripheral artery disease (PAD) [^114ChQEk]. An ABI **≤ 0.90 is diagnostic** for PAD, whereas 0.91–0.99 is borderline and ≥ 1.40 suggests noncompressible vessels [^116a1ePj]. ABI has moderate sensitivity and high specificity; accuracy is reduced in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease due to arterial calcification, so consider toe-brachial index or imaging when ABI is > 1.40 or suspicion remains high [^117CAU4t] [^113ZtWZw]. Routine screening is not recommended for asymptomatic adults, but ABI is indicated for patients with symptoms or risk factors and is the first-line test for suspected PAD [^113Ywfty] [^114qVb3B].

---

## Clinical indications for ABI measurement

ABI is indicated in the following clinical scenarios:

- **Symptomatic patients**: Exertional leg pain, non-healing wounds, or rest pain [^115hwyMe].
- **Asymptomatic patients at risk**: Age ≥ 65 years, or ≥ 50 years with diabetes, smoking, or other atherosclerotic risk factors [^115SCf5c].
- **Patients with known PAD**: Baseline assessment and follow-up after interventions [^112G9ZqM].

---

## ABI measurement technique

ABI is calculated by dividing the higher ankle systolic pressure (dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial) by the higher brachial systolic pressure [^117VTRed]. The patient should rest supine for at least 5 minutes before measurements are taken [^notfound]. Use **standardized cuffs** and a handheld Doppler or automated device [^113yhyf8].

---

## Interpretation of ABI results

| **Abi value** | **Interpretation** | **Clinical implication** |
|-|-|-|
| ≤ 0.90 | Abnormal | Diagnostic for PAD [^116a1ePj] |
| 0.91–0.99 | Borderline | Possible mild PAD |
| 1.00–1.39 | Normal | No significant PAD |
| ≥ 1.40 | Noncompressible | Arterial calcification; use TBI or imaging [^1145Pa8d] |

---

## Diagnostic accuracy of ABI

ABI has moderate sensitivity and high specificity for PAD [^114ChQEk]. Sensitivity is reduced in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease due to arterial calcification [^117NXJSk] [^113skfmQ]; in these populations, **specificity remains high** [^117CAU4t].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **Arterial calcification**: Falsely elevated ABI in diabetes or chronic kidney disease [^116hw7ZN].
- **Technical errors**: Improper cuff placement or measurement technique [^113kP3W3].
- **Patient factors**: Obesity, edema, or recent exercise [^notfound].

---

## Alternative diagnostic tests

When ABI is inconclusive or unreliable, **alternative tests** include:

- **Toe-brachial index (TBI)**: Useful in patients with arterial calcification; TBI ≤ 0.70 is abnormal [^115jo7cL].
- **Duplex ultrasound**: Non-invasive imaging to assess arterial stenosis [^115vXpXq].
- **Computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)**: Detailed anatomic assessment [^115hwyMe].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Routine screening of asymptomatic individuals is not recommended by the **USPSTF** due to insufficient evidence of benefit [^111EdAL9]. The **ACC/AHA** recommends ABI for patients with symptoms or risk factors for PAD [^112jQycE]. The **ESC** recommends ABI as the first-line non-invasive test for PAD diagnosis [^117WVknR].

---

## Clinical implications of abnormal ABI

An abnormal ABI (≤ 0.90) indicates PAD and is associated with **increased cardiovascular risk**, including higher risks of myocardial infarction, stroke, and mortality [^117VHSGr]. It also correlates with reduced walking distance, impaired quality of life, and functional decline [^11153yAq].

---

## Follow-up and management strategies

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Smoking cessation, exercise therapy, dietary changes [^116UfGTc].
- **Medical management**: Antiplatelet therapy, statins, blood pressure control, glycemic control [^116UfGTc].
- **Revascularization**: For severe symptomatic PAD or critical limb ischemia [^116Bj67U].

---

ABI is a **non-invasive test** that aids PAD diagnosis and risk stratification. It is most useful in symptomatic patients or those with risk factors, while routine screening of asymptomatic individuals is not recommended.

### Screening for peripheral artery disease using the ankle-brachial index: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^111aKPJa]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with a high risk for cardiovascular events and poor ambulatory function, even in the absence of symptoms. Screening for PAD with the ankle-brachial index (ABI) may identify patients in need of treatment to improve health outcomes.

Objective

To systematically review evidence for the US Preventive Services Task Force on PAD screening with the ABI, the diagnostic accuracy of the test, and the benefits and harms of treatment of screen-detected PAD.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant English-language studies published between January 2012 and May 2, 2017. Surveillance continued through February 7, 2018.

Study Selection

Studies of unselected or generally asymptomatic adults with no known cardiovascular disease.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Independent critical appraisal and data abstraction by 2 reviewers.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Cardiovascular morbidity; PAD morbidity; mortality; health-related quality of life; diagnostic accuracy; and serious adverse events.

Results

Five studies (N = 5864 participants) were included that examined the indirect evidence for the benefits and harms of screening and treatment of screen-detected PAD. No population-based screening trials evaluated the direct benefits or harms of PAD screening with the ABI alone. A single diagnostic accuracy study of the ABI compared with magnetic resonance angiography gold-standard imaging (n = 306) found low sensitivity (7%-34%) and high specificity (96%-100%) in a screening population. Two adequately powered trials (n = 4626) in asymptomatic populations with and without diabetes with a variably defined low ABI (≤ 0.95 or ≤ 0.99) showed no statistically significant effect of aspirin (100 mg daily) for composite CVD outcomes (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.00 [95% CI, 0.81–1.23] and HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.76–1.26]). One trial (n = 3350) demonstrated no statistically significant increase in major bleeding events with the use of aspirin (adjusted HR, 1.71 [95% CI, 0.99–2.97]) and no statistically significant increase in major gastrointestinal bleeding (relative risk, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.44–2.91]). Two exercise trials (n = 932) in screen-relevant populations reported no differences in quality of life, Walking Impairment Questionnaire walking distance, or symptoms at 12 and 52 weeks; no harms were reported.

Conclusions and Relevance

There was no direct evidence and limited indirect evidence on the benefits of PAD screening with the ABI in unselected or asymptomatic populations. Available studies suggest low sensitivity and lack of beneficial effect on health outcomes, but these studies have important limitations.

### Ankle brachial index for the diagnosis of lower limb peripheral arterial disease [^113yhyf8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower limb is common, with prevalence of both symptomatic and asymptomatic disease estimated at 13% in the over 50 age group. Symptomatic PAD affects about 5% of individuals in Western populations between the ages of 55 and 74 years. The most common initial symptom of PAD is muscle pain on exercise that is relieved by rest and is attributed to reduced lower limb blood flow due to atherosclerotic disease (intermittent claudication). The ankle brachial index (ABI) is widely used by a variety of healthcare professionals, including specialist nurses, physicians, surgeons and podiatrists working in primary and secondary care settings, to assess signs and symptoms of PAD. As the ABI test is non-invasive and inexpensive and is in widespread clinical use, a systematic review of its diagnostic accuracy in people presenting with leg pain suggestive of PAD is highly relevant to routine clinical practice.

Objectives

To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of the ankle brachial index (ABI) - also known as the ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) - for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease in people who experience leg pain on walking that is alleviated by rest.

Search Methods

We carried out searches of the following databases in August 2013: MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (EBSCO), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences (LILACS) (Bireme), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and the Health Technology Assessment Database in The Cochrane Library, the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science, the British Library Zetoc Conference search and Medion.

Selection Criteria

We included cross-sectional studies of ABI in which duplex ultrasonography or angiography was used as the reference standard. We also included cross-sectional or diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) cohort studies consisting of both prospective and retrospective studies. Participants were adults presenting with leg pain on walking that was relieved by rest, who were tested in primary care settings or secondary care settings (hospital outpatients only) and who did not have signs or symptoms of critical limb ischaemia (rest pain, ischaemic ulcers or gangrene). The index test was ABI, also called the ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) or the Ankle Arm Index (AAI), which was performed with a hand-held doppler or oscillometry device to detect ankle vessels. We included data collected via sphygmomanometers (both manual and aneroid) and digital equipment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently replicated data extraction by using a standard form, which included an assessment of study quality, and resolved disagreements by discussion. Two review authors extracted participant-level data when available to populate 2×2 contingency tables (true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives). After a pilot phase involving two review authors working independently, we used the methodological quality assessment tool the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2), which incorporated our review question - along with a flow diagram to aid reviewers' understanding of the conduct of the study when necessary and an assessment of risk of bias and applicability judgements.

Main Results

We screened 17,055 records identified through searches of databases. We obtained 746 full-text articles and assessed them for relevance. We scrutinised 49 studies to establish their eligibility for inclusion in the review and excluded 48, primarily because participants were not patients presenting solely with exertional leg pain, investigators used no reference standard or investigators used neither angiography nor duplex ultrasonography as the reference standard. We excluded most studies for more than one reason. Only one study met the eligibility criteria and provided limb-level accuracy data from just 85 participants (158 legs). This prospective study compared the manual doppler method of obtaining an ABI (performed by untrained personnel) with the automated oscillometric method. Limb-level data, as reported by the study, indicated that the accuracy of the ABI in detecting significant arterial disease on angiography is superior when stenosis is present in the femoropopliteal vessels, with sensitivity of 97% (95% confidence interval (CI) 93% to 99%) and specificity of 89% (95% CI 67% to 95%) for oscillometric ABI, and sensitivity of 95% (95% CI 89% to 97%) and specificity of 56% (95% CI 33% to 70%) for doppler ABI. The ABI threshold was not reported. Investigators attributed the lower specificity for doppler to the fact that a tibial or dorsalis pedis pulse could not be detected by doppler in 12 of 27 legs with normal vessels or non-significant lesions. The superiority of the oscillometric (automated) method for obtaining an ABI reading over the manual method with a doppler probe used by inexperienced operators may be a clinically important finding.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence about the accuracy of the ankle brachial index for the diagnosis of PAD in people with leg pain on exercise that is alleviated by rest is sparse. The single study included in our review provided only limb-level data from a few participants. Well-designed cross-sectional studies are required to evaluate the accuracy of ABI in patients presenting with early symptoms of peripheral arterial disease in all healthcare settings. Another systematic review of existing studies assessing the use of ABI in alternative patient groups, including asymptomatic, high-risk patients, is required.

### Screening for peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular disease risk assessment with the ankle-brachial index in adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116sHbyA]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2005 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for peripheral artery disease (PAD).

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the use of resting ankle-brachial index (ABI) as a screening test for PAD or as a risk predictor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The review focused on resting ABI as the sole screening method; the diagnostic performance of ABI testing in primary care populations, unselected populations, and asymptomatic populations; the predictive value of ABI testing for major CVD outcomes in primary care or unselected populations; and the effect of treatment on general CVD and PAD-specific morbidity in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic PAD.

Population

This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults who do not have a known diagnosis of PAD, CVD, severe chronic kidney disease, or diabetes.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for PAD and CVD risk assessment with the ABI in adults. (I statement).

### Screening for peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular disease risk assessment with the ankle-brachial index: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111EdAL9]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a manifestation of atherosclerosis in the lower limbs. It can impair walking and, in severe cases, can lead to tissue loss, infection, and amputation. In addition to morbidity directly caused by PAD, patients with PAD are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, because atherosclerosis is a systemic disease that also causes coronary and cerebrovascular events.

Objective

To update the 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for PAD and CVD risk with the ankle-brachial index (ABI).

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on whether screening for PAD with the ABI in generally asymptomatic adults reduces morbidity or mortality from PAD or CVD. The current review expanded on the previous review to include individuals with diabetes and interventions that include supervised exercise and physical therapy intended to improve outcomes in the lower limbs.

Findings

The USPSTF found few data on the accuracy of the ABI for identifying asymptomatic persons who can benefit from treatment of PAD or CVD. There are few studies addressing the benefits of treating screen-detected patients with PAD; 2 good-quality studies showed no benefit of using the ABI to manage daily aspirin therapy in unselected populations, and 2 studies showed no benefit from exercise therapy. No studies addressed the harms of screening, although the potential exists for overdiagnosis, labeling, and opportunity costs. Studies that addressed the harms of treatment showed nonsignificant results. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for PAD with the ABI in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for PAD and CVD risk with the ABI in asymptomatic adults. (I statement).

### Peripheral arterial disease – what do we need to know? [^115d74Jj]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) results from progressive narrowing of arteries secondary to atherosclerosis and is defined as an Ankle Brachial Index of < 0.9. PAD is highly prevalent and is an increasing burden on both the economy and the patient, especially given the rapid shift in demographics in the United States. Despite its prevalence and association with cardiovascular disease, PAD is still underdiagnosed and undertreated. This may, in part, be related to lack of recognition from the physician's side or paucity of evidence from clinical trials. It has been shown that medical therapy approved for cardiovascular disease is effective in the treatment of PAD and decreases cardiovascular events. Various revascularization strategies are also available for improving symptoms and quality of life in these patients, yet they are underutilized. In an attempt to increase its recognition, PAD has been considered a coronary artery disease equivalent. This article reviews the diagnosis and management of PAD. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Screening for peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular disease risk assessment with the ankle-brachial index: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115NkD8c]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) rationale and detection — Peripheral artery disease is a manifestation of atherosclerosis in the lower limbs, and it can impair walking and, in severe cases, can lead to tissue loss, infection, and amputation. Patients with PAD are at increased risk for CVD events, because atherosclerosis is a systemic disease that also causes coronary and cerebrovascular events. In national survey data, 5.9% of the US population 40 years or older has a low ABI (≤ 0.9), which indicates the presence of PAD, yet the true prevalence is difficult to establish because more than half of persons with a low ABI are asymptomatic or have atypical symptoms and population screening studies using a gold standard diagnostic test are lacking. For screening accuracy, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the accuracy of the ABI for identifying asymptomatic persons with PAD who can benefit from treatment.

### Screening for peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular disease risk assessment with the ankle-brachial index: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116UfGTc]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Treatment and interventions — because PAD manifests systemic atherosclerosis in the lower limbs, treatment targets both lower limb ischemia and prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Interventions to prevent CVD events include smoking cessation, lowering cholesterol levels, managing high blood pressure, and antiplatelet therapy, and patients with a low ABI may already be recommended for these treatments because the major PAD risk factors are used to calculate CVD risk.

### Screening for peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular disease risk assessment with the ankle-brachial index: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116DDMx9]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Biological rationale and public comments regarding ABI screening: Early detection and intervention to reduce atherosclerotic progression and prevent future cardiovascular disease (CVD) events could improve health outcomes compared with intervention strategies used in the absence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) screening, yet a substantial number of asymptomatic persons with low ABI may never develop clinical signs or symptoms of CVD or PAD but would still be subjected to the harms of testing and subsequent treatments; commenters noted that the prevalence of PAD is disproportionately higher among racial/ethnic minorities and low-socioeconomic populations and that an I statement could discourage testing and perpetuate disparities, which the USPSTF acknowledged while stating that evidence on screening and treatment in these groups is currently lacking, that it was unable to determine the overall balance of benefits and harms, and that it added language to the Research Needs and Gaps section; the draft was posted for public comment from January 16, 2018, to February 12, 2018.

### Screening for peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular disease risk assessment with the ankle-brachial index: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116wizJA]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF — Ankle-brachial index (ABI) screening for peripheral artery disease (PAD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in asymptomatic adults: No recommendation. Grade: I (insufficient evidence). This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults without a known diagnosis of PAD, CVD, or severe chronic kidney disease, and the USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for PAD and CVD risk with the ABI in asymptomatic adults.

### Screening for peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular disease risk assessment with the ankle-brachial index: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116y3UUD]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force — ankle-brachial index screening in asymptomatic adults: The USPSTF concludes that "the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for peripheral artery disease (PAD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk with the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in asymptomatic adults (I statement)", and the evidence review focused on "whether screening for PAD with the ABI in generally asymptomatic adults reduces morbidity or mortality from PAD or CVD". The USPSTF "found few data on the accuracy of the ABI for identifying asymptomatic persons who can benefit", noted "few studies addressing the benefits of treating screen-detected patients with PAD; 2 good-quality studies showed no benefit of using the ABI to manage daily aspirin therapy in unselected populations, and 2 studies showed no benefit from exercise therapy", and reported that "no studies addressed the harms of screening", leading to the determination that "the balance of benefits and harms of screening for PAD with the ABI in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined".

### Ankle-brachial index measured by palpation for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease [^111WGjsr]. Family Practice (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The ankle-brachial index (ABI), i.e. the ratio of the ankle to brachial systolic blood pressure, is the golden standard for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and is a highly specific method for the assessment of vascular risk in otherwise asymptomatic patients.

Objective

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of the ABI measured by palpation in patients at increased cardiovascular risk in a primary care setting.

Methods

Twenty-four GPs enrolled 10 consecutive patients each, at intermediate cardiovascular risk, based on age > 55 and < 65 years and one or two associated major cardiovascular risk factors or age > 65 and < 80 years without associated cardiovascular risk factor. Clinical data recording and measurements of the ABI were performed. The design of the study was a prospective, blind comparison between the ABI measured by palpation by the GP and simultaneously by Doppler ultrasound by an angiologist (reference test).

Results

Out of 240 enrolled patients, 205 completed the study (35 lost to follow-up); in 9, ABI by palpation was not measurable. Out of the remaining 196 assessable patients, 8 (4.08%) had PAD. Sensitivity of the palpation method was 88% (95% confidence intervals: 65–100), specificity 82% (77–88), positive predictive value 18% (6–29), negative predictive value 99% (98–100), positive likelihood ratio = 4.98 (3.32–7.48) and negative likelihood ratio = 0.15 (0.02–0.95).

Conclusions

The measurement of ABI by palpation in the setting of primary care, in patients at intermediate cardiovascular risk, is a sufficiently sensitive method to consider its use as a screening test for the exclusion of PAD.

### Association of ankle-brachial indices with limb revascularization or amputation in patients with peripheral artery disease [^114ZnRdE]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

The prevalence and morbidity of peripheral artery disease (PAD) are high, with limb outcomes including revascularization and amputation. In community-dwelling patients with PAD, the role of noninvasive evaluation for risk assessment and rates of limb outcomes have not been established to date.

Objective

To evaluate whether ankle-brachial indices are associated with limb outcomes in community-dwelling patients with PAD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A population-based, observational, test-based cohort study of patients was performed from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2014. Data analysis was conducted from July 15 to December 15, 2017. Participants included a community-based cohort of 1413 patients with PAD from Olmsted County, Minnesota, identified by validated algorithms deployed to electronic health records. Automated algorithms identified limb outcomes used to build Cox proportional hazards regression models. Ankle-brachial indices and presence of poorly compressible arteries were electronically identified from digital data sets. Guideline-recommended management strategies within 6 months of diagnosis were also electronically retrieved, including therapy with statins, antiplatelet agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers, and smoking abstention.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Ankle-brachial index (index ≤ 0.9 indicates PAD; < .05, severe PAD; and ≥ 1.40, poorly compressible arteries) and limb revascularization or amputation.

Results

Of 1413 patients, 633 (44.8%) were women; mean (SD) age was 70.8 (13.3) years. A total of 283 patients (20.0%) had severe PAD (ankle-brachial indices < 0.5) and 350 (24.8%) had poorly compressible arteries (ankle-brachial indices ≥ 1.4); 780 (55.2%) individuals with less than severe disease formed the reference group. Only 32 of 283 patients (11.3%) with severe disease and 68 of 350 patients (19.4%) with poorly compressible arteries were receiving 4 guideline-recommended management strategies. In the severe disease subgroup, the 1-year event rate for revascularization was 32.4% (90 events); in individuals with poorly compressible arteries, the 1-year amputation rate was 13.9% (47 events). In models adjusted for age, sex, and critical limb ischemia, poorly compressible arteries were associated with amputation (hazard ratio [HR], 3.12; 95% CI, 2.16–4.50; P < .001) but not revascularization (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.69–1.20; p = 0.49). In contrast, severe disease was associated with revascularization (HR, 2.69; 95% CI, 2.15–3.37; P < .001) but not amputation (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.82–2.07; p = 0.27).

Conclusions and Relevance

Community-dwelling patients with severe PAD or poorly compressible arteries have high rates of revascularization or limb loss, respectively. Guideline-recommended management strategies for secondary risk prevention are underused in the community.

### Lower extremity peripheral artery disease: contemporary epidemiology, management gaps, and future directions: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111unR2E]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects > 230 million adults worldwide and is associated with increased risk of various adverse clinical outcomes (other cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease and stroke and leg outcomes such as amputation). Despite its prevalence and clinical importance, PAD has been historically underappreciated by health care professionals and patients. This underappreciation seems multifactorial (eg, limited availability of the first-line diagnostic test, the ankle-brachial index, in clinics; incorrect perceptions that a leg vascular disease is not fatal and that the diagnosis of PAD would not necessarily change clinical practice). In the past several years, a body of evidence has indicated that these perceptions are incorrect. Several studies have consistently demonstrated that many patients with PAD are not receiving evidence-based therapies. Thus, this scientific statement provides an update for health care professionals regarding contemporary epidemiology (eg, prevalence, temporal trends, risk factors, and complications) of PAD, the present status of diagnosis (physiological tests and imaging modalities), and the major gaps in the management of PAD (eg, medications, exercise therapy, and revascularization). The statement also lists key gaps in research, clinical practice, and implementation related to PAD. Orchestrated efforts among different parties (eg, health care providers, researchers, expert organizations, and health care organizations) will be needed to increase the awareness and understanding of PAD and improve the diagnostic approaches, management, and prognosis of PAD.

### The toe-brachial index in the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease [^111vHDJE]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) can be diagnosed noninvasively by segmental blood pressure measurement and calculating an ankle-brachial index (ABI) or toe-brachial index (TBI). The ABI is known to be unreliable in patients with vascular stiffness and fails to detect the early phase of arteriosclerotic development. The toe vessels are less susceptible to vessel stiffness, which makes the TBI useful. However, the diagnostic limits used in guidelines, clinical settings, and experimental studies vary substantially. This review provides an overview of the evidence supporting the clinical use of the TBI.

Methods

A review of the literature identified studies reporting the use of the TBI regarding guideline recommendations, normal populations, correlations to angiographic findings, and prognostic implications.

Results

Eight studies conducted in a normal population were identified, of which only one study used imaging techniques to rule out arterial stenosis. A reference value of 0.71 was estimated as the lowest limit of normal based on the weighted average in studies with preheating of the limbs. A further seven studies showed correlations of the TBI with angiographic findings. The TBI had a sensitivity of 90% to 100% and a specificity of 65% to 100% for the detection of vessel stenosis. Few studies investigated the value of the TBI as a prognostic marker for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, and no firm conclusions could be made. Studies have, however, shown correlation between the TBI and comorbidities such as kidney disease, diabetes, and microvasculature disease.

Conclusions

In contrast to the well-defined and evidence-based limits of the ABI, the diagnostic criteria for a pathologic TBI remain ambiguous. Although several guidelines and reviews of PAD diagnostics recommend a TBI < 0.70 as cutoff, it is not strictly evidence-based. The current literature is not sufficient to conclude a specific cutoff as diagnostic for PAD. The current studies in normal populations and the correlation with angiography are sparse, and additional trials are needed to further validate the limits. Large-scale trials are needed to establish the risk of morbidity and mortality for the various diagnostic limits of the TBI.

Research needs and gaps — large, population-based, randomized trials of screening vs no screening are needed to determine whether screening for PAD with the ABI improves clinical outcomes. One ongoing study in Denmark limited enrollment to men aged 65 to 74 years and bundled screening with abdominal aortic aneurysm and high blood pressure, and two other ongoing trials include the ABI as part of a screening bundle; studies isolating the effect of individual tests and focusing on more diverse and high-risk populations (eg, persons with diabetes) are needed.

Burden of disease — prevalence of low ABI and PAD in the United States is summarized as follows: 5.9% of US adults 40 years or older have a low ABI, and when persons with known coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease are excluded, the reported prevalence of PAD in studies is 4.7%. In the United States, a low ABI (typically < 0.9) is considered diagnostic for PAD in clinical practice. Age-stratified low ABI prevalence is 1.9% in adults aged 40 to 59 years, 8.1% in those aged 60 to 74 years, and 17.5% in those 75 years or older.

### Screening for peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular disease risk assessment with the ankle-brachial index: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116RRjSZ]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Assessment of risk for peripheral artery disease (PAD) — major risk factors include diabetes, current smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, obesity, and physical inactivity, with current smoking and diabetes showing the strongest association. Among healthy US men aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD, the 25-year risk for PAD in the absence of 4 conventional risk factors is rare at 9 cases per 100 000 men per year; these 4 factors account for 75% of all PAD cases, and at least 1 is present at diagnosis in 96% of men. Although women have a slightly lower ABI than men, low ABI prevalence does not appear to vary significantly by sex after age adjustment.

### Screening for peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular disease risk assessment with the ankle-brachial index: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117SQQYQ]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) risk assessment and ABI test details — adults: Major risk factors for PAD include older age, diabetes, current smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol level, obesity, and physical inactivity. Resting ABI is most commonly used to detect PAD in clinical settings, and ABI is calculated as the systolic blood pressure obtained at the ankle divided by the systolic blood pressure obtained at the brachial artery while the patient is lying down. A ratio of less than 1 (typically defined as < 0.9) is considered abnormal and is commonly used to define PAD. PAD treatment focuses on improving outcomes in symptomatic patients; interventions to prevent CVD events include smoking cessation, lowering cholesterol levels, managing high blood pressure, and antiplatelet therapy.

### A systematic review for the screening for peripheral arterial disease in asymptomatic patients [^115vDmTh]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is common and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. PAD can be detected through a noninvasive measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI).

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of several electronic bibliographic databases for studies that evaluated ABI as a screening test for PAD in asymptomatic individuals. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis, reporting pooled hazard ratios (HRs) when appropriate.

Results

We included 40 individual studies, 2 systematic reviews, and 1 individual-patient data meta-analysis. We found no studies comparing ABI screening with no screening in terms of patient-important outcomes (mortality, amputations). The yield of PAD screening averaged 17% (range, 1%-42%) and was 1% to 4% in lower risk populations. Patients with PAD had higher adjusted risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 2.99; 95% confidence interval, 2.16–4.12) and of cardiovascular mortality (HR, 2.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.91–2.89). Data on benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of screening were limited; however, ABI screening was associated with additional prognostic information and risk stratification for heart disease. The overall quality of evidence supporting screening was low.

Conclusions

The current available evidence demonstrates that PAD is common in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, but it does not support the benefit of routine ABI screening.

### Interpretation and significance of ankle-brachial systolic pressure index [^117VkiXY]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The ankle-brachial systolic pressure index (ABI) is an underutilized, easy-to-perform, physiologic test to diagnosis atherosclerotic lower-limb arterial occlusive disease. Testing requires a sphygmomanometer and continuous-wave Doppler probe to measure the ratio of ankle and brachial systolic blood pressures. The ABI measurement has been standardized by use of the highest ankle and brachial systolic pressure for the calculation; abnormal threshold value is ≤ 0.9. The ABI is used to diagnosis and screen for peripheral arterial disease, which is a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis and a predictor of cardiovascular events. A lower ABI value correlates with severity of limb ischemia and decreased survival. Measurement of ABI is recommended as the initial diagnostic test for patients with exertional leg pain (claudication), to assess the healing potential of foot lesions, after blunt extremity trauma to detect occult arterial injury, and as part of the routine health assessment of patients with diabetes and peripheral arterial disease.

### Lifetime risk of lower-extremity peripheral artery disease defined by ankle-brachial index in the United States [^11395LAS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

There seem to be a few ways to use the risk calculators from this study. For example, our lifetime risk calculator can be complementary to the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology lifetime risk calculator for coronary disease and stroke 7 and may contribute to comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment. Importantly, the awareness of PAD is low, and most PAD patients do not have typical leg symptoms of intermittent claudication. 17 Also, diagnostic processes and signs/symptoms are unique for PAD (eg, leg examination, ABI measurement, and reduced leg pulse). Thus, identifying people at high lifetime risk of PAD may have implications on targeted patients' education about manifestation and complications of PAD. The risk calculator for prevalent PAD may have implications for screening PAD. Although it is still under debate, 19, 36 some guidelines recommend screening PAD using ABI among high‐risk individuals. 19 Although those clinical guidelines empirically rely on age and the presence of a few key risk factors to identify "high‐risk" populations for PAD (eg, all adults aged ≥ 65 years or people aged 50 to 64 years with any atherosclerotic risk factors 19), our risk calculator for prevalent PAD will allow healthcare providers and patients to quantify the risk objectively on the basis of a combination of risk factors.

### Lifetime risk of lower-extremity peripheral artery disease defined by ankle-brachial index in the United States [^114xScZm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Lifetime risk is useful for communicating long‐term risk and estimating the future burden of disease in populations. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Lifetime risk estimation of coronary heart disease and stroke is recommended in the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology guidelines for guiding preventive therapies. 6, 7 However, to our knowledge, there are no available estimates of lifetime risk of lower‐extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD), despite its impact on prognosis, 8 leg amputation, 9 and physical function. 10 Here, using data from 6 US community‐based cohorts with over 35 000 unique participants, we estimated lifetime risk of PAD by sex and among 3 racial/ethnic groups (whites, blacks, and Hispanics). Subsequently, we extended the lifetime risk estimations by age and other traditional atherosclerotic risk factors, which would complement lifetime risk prediction of coronary disease and stroke in the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines 6, 7 and facilitate personalized and comprehensive cardiovascular risk discussion between healthcare providers and patients. 6, 11

### Sensitivity and specificity of the ankle-brachial index to predict future cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review [^117VHSGr]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The ankle-brachial index is the ratio of the ankle and the brachial systolic blood pressure and is used to assess individuals with peripheral arterial disease. An ankle-brachial index < 0.90 suggests the presence of peripheral arterial disease and is a marker of cardiovascular risk. The objective of this review is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of an ankle-brachial index < 0.90 to predict future cardiovascular events, including coronary heart disease, stroke, and death.

Methods and Results

We conducted a systematic review of the literature and included studies that used an ankle-brachial index cutoff between 0.80 and 0.90 to classify patients with or without peripheral arterial disease, followed patients prospectively, and recorded cardiovascular outcomes (ie, myocardial infarction, stroke, or mortality). Data were combined using a random-effects model meta-analysis to determine the sensitivity, specificity, relative risks, and likelihood ratios of a low ankle-brachial index to predict future cardiovascular disease. A total of 22 studies were identified, 13 were excluded, and 9 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The sensitivity and specificity of a low ankle-brachial index to predict incident coronary heart diseases were 16.5% and 92.7%, for incident stroke were 16.0% and 92.2%, and for cardiovascular mortality were 41.0% and 87.9%, respectively. The corresponding positive likelihood ratios were 2.53 (95% CI, 1.45 to 4.40) for coronary heart disease, 2.45 (95% CI, 1.76 to 3.41) for stroke, and 5.61 (95% CI, 3.45 to 9.13) for cardiovascular death.

Conclusions

The specificity of a low ankle-brachial index to predict future cardiovascular outcomes is high, but its sensitivity is low. The ankle-brachial index should become part of the vascular risk assessment among selected individuals.

### Ankle-brachial index use in peripheral vascular interventions for claudication [^114Qrboe]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The ankle-brachial index (ABI) has been recommended as the first-line noninvasive test to establish a diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease in patients with claudication (grade 1, level A evidence). The ABI can also be used to monitor disease progression and assess the benefits of treatment after peripheral vascular intervention (PVI). The Upper Midwest Region of the Vascular Quality Initiative has a unique balance of participation from vascular surgeons, interventional radiologists, and cardiologists performing PVI. We sought to identify the use of ABI and assess the functional outcomes of patients who had undergone PVI for claudication.

Methods

We conducted a review of the Upper Midwest Region of the Vascular Quality Initiative to identify PVI performed for claudication from native artery atherosclerotic occlusive disease in nondiabetic patients from 2010 to 2020. Patients who had undergone PVI with infection, tissue loss, rest pain, bypass graft stenosis, or aneurysmal disease were excluded. The primary outcomes included the ABI, ambulation status, and functional status before and after PVI.

Results

A total of 3787 patients (58.0% male, 42.0% female; mean age, 68.4 years) who had undergone 3830 procedures were identified. Of the 3787 patients, 2665 (69.5%) had had the ABI measured: 1803 (47.1%) before PVI only, 190 (4.9%) after PVI only, and 862 (22.5%) before and after PVI. In addition, 975 patients (25.5%) had never had the ABI performed. Statistical analysis of the entire cohort found no change in ambulation status (P = 0.33-.95 for all comparisons) or functional status (P = 0.42-.61 for all comparisons) regardless of the use of the ABI. However, a significant number of patients who had never had the ABI measured had decreased from full functional status before PVI to only being functional with light work after PVI (P = 0.015).

Conclusions

Despite the grade 1, level A evidence, ABI had been used before and after PVI for only 22.5% of the patients who had undergone PVI for claudication. In addition, we found overall functional status had decreased significantly after PVI for those patients who had never had an ABI performed. Accurately identifying patients with claudication due to PAD using the ABI remains critically important before PVI. Given the lack of overall improvement in ambulation after PVI found in the present study, identifying the patients who will benefit from PVI to treat claudication remains elusive.

### The validity, reliability, reproducibility and extended utility of ankle to brachial pressure index in current vascular surgical practice [^113kP3W3]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the increasing sophistication of vascular surgical practice, more than three decades after its introduction to clinical practice, the ankle to brachial pressure index (ABPI) remains the cornerstone of non-invasive assessment of the patient with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

Aim

To summarise what is known about ABPI and critically appraise its validity, reliability, reproducibility and extended utility.

Methods

A MEDLINE (1966–2004) and Cochrane library search for articles relating to measurement of ABPI was undertaken; see text for further details.

Results

There is considerable disagreement as to how ABPI should be measured. Furthermore, various factors, including the type of equipment used, and the experience of the operator, can result in significant inter- and intra-observer error. As such, care must be taken when interpreting data in the literature. ABPI is valuable in the assessment of patients with atypical symptoms, venous leg ulcers and after vascular and endovascular interventions. However, absolute pressures are probably more valuable in patients with critical limb ischaemia. ABPI is also useful in subjects with asymptomatic PAD where it correlates well with, and may be used in screening studies to quantify, cardiovascular risk.

Conclusions

While its apparent simplicity can beguile the unwary, ABPI will continue to have a key role in the assessment of symptomatic PAD. ABPI is also likely to have extended utility in health screening and institution of best medical therapy in asymptomatic subjects.

Patient evaluation is critical to identify and quantitate patient's disease. Aside from the patient's history and physical examination, imaging can help confirm and determine the extent of disease. Imaging can aid in treatment planning once the decision to proceed to intervention has been made. This chapter will discuss the role of imaging before and after peripheral arterial interventions and how it may improve intervention outcomes. It will discuss the value of the arterial noninvasive examinations (ankle-brachial index, toe-brachial index, pulse volume recordings, and arterial duplex ultrasound), computed tomographic angiograms, magnetic resonance angiogram, and intravascular ultrasound.

### Association of ankle-brachial indices with limb revascularization or amputation in patients with peripheral artery disease [^112EoggW]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are ankle-brachial indices associated with limb outcomes in community-dwelling patients with peripheral artery disease as identified by computational approaches applied to electronic health records?

Findings

In this cohort study of 1413 community-dwelling patients, peripheral artery disease was identified and limb outcomes were retrieved by computational approaches applied to electronic health records. Ankle-brachial indices of 1.4 or greater were associated with limb amputation and ankle-brachial indices less than 0.5 were associated with limb revascularization.

Meaning

Severe disease and poorly compressible arteries detected by ankle-brachial indices were associated with adverse outcomes in community-dwelling patients with peripheral artery disease; ascertainment of peripheral artery disease phenotypes and outcomes by computational approaches applied to electronic health records is feasible.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) clinical evaluation — vascular examination includes palpation of lower extremity pulses, auscultation for femoral bruits, and inspection of the legs and feet; pulses are rated 0, absent; 1, diminished; 2, normal; or 3, bounding. Patients with confirmed PAD are at increased risk for subclavian artery stenosis, and an inter-arm blood pressure difference of > 15 to 20 mm Hg is abnormal; measuring blood pressure in both arms identifies the arm with the highest systolic pressure, a requirement for accurate measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI). To confirm the diagnosis of PAD, abnormal physical examination findings must be confirmed with diagnostic testing, generally with the ABI as the initial test.

USPSTF levels of certainty regarding net benefit — High certainty: The available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative primary care populations that assess effects on health outcomes, and conclusions are unlikely to be strongly affected by future studies. Moderate certainty: Evidence is sufficient to determine effects, but confidence is constrained by factors such as number, size, or quality of studies, inconsistency, limited generalizability, or lack of coherence in the chain of evidence, and new information could change the magnitude or direction enough to alter the conclusion. Low certainty: The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes due to limited number or size of studies, important flaws in design or methods, inconsistency, gaps in the chain of evidence, lack of generalizability, or lack of information on important outcomes; more information may allow estimation of effects. The USPSTF defines certainty as the "likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct", and net benefit as "benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population".

### A modified calculation of ankle-brachial pressure index is far more sensitive in the detection of peripheral arterial disease [^114eSVZZ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) is a simple, inexpensive, and useful tool in the detection of peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD). The current guidelines published by the American Heart Association define ABI as the quotient of the higher of the systolic blood pressures (SBPs) of the two ankle arteries of that limb (either the anterior tibial artery or the posterior tibial artery) and the higher of the two brachial SBPs of the upper limbs. We hypothesized that considering the lower of the two ankle arterial SBPs of a side as the numerator and the higher of the brachial SBPs as the denominator would increase its diagnostic yield.

Methods

The former method of eliciting ABI was termed as high ankle pressure (HAP) and the latter low ankle pressure (LAP). ABI was assessed in 216 subjects and calculated according to the HAP and the LAP method. ABI findings were confirmed by arterial duplex ultrasonography. A significant arterial stenosis was assumed if ABI was < 0.9.

Results

LAP had a sensitivity of 0.89 and a specificity of 0.93. The HAP method had a sensitivity of 0.68 and a specificity of 0.99. McNemar's test to compare the results of both methods demonstrated a two-tailed P < .0001, indicating a highly significant difference between both measurement methods.

Conclusions

LAP is the superior method of calculating ABI to identify PAD. This result is of great interest for epidemiologic studies applying ABI measurements to detect PAD and assessing patients' cardiovascular risk.

### Systematic review of guidelines on peripheral artery disease screening [^1174rtMN]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) screening may be performed to prevent progression of PAD or future cardiovascular disease in general. Recommendations for PAD screening have to be derived indirectly because no randomized trials comparing screening versus no screening have been performed. We performed a systematic review of guidelines to evaluate the value of PAD screening in asymptomatic adults.

Methods

Guidelines in English published between January 1, 2003 and January 20, 2011 were retrieved using MEDLINE, CINAHL, the National Guideline Clearinghouse, the National Library for Health, the Canadian Medication Association Infobase, and the G-I-N International Guideline Library. Guidelines developed by national and international medical societies from Western countries, containing recommendations on PAD screening, were included. Two reviewers independently assessed rigor of guideline development using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument. One reviewer performed full extraction of recommendations, which was validated by a second reviewer.

Results

Of 2779 titles identified, 8 guidelines were included. AGREE scores varied from 33% to 81%. Five guidelines advocated PAD screening, others found insufficient evidence for PAD screening or were against it. Measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) was generally recommended for middle-aged populations with elevated cardiovascular risk levels. Those identified as having PAD are reclassified as high risk, warranting intensive preventive interventions to reduce their risk of a cardiovascular event. The underlying evidence mainly consisted of studies performed in patients with established PAD. A meta-analysis that evaluated ABI testing in the context of traditional cardiovascular risk assessment was interpreted differently.

Conclusions

Recommendations on PAD screening vary across current guidelines, making the value of PAD screening uncertain. The variation seems to reflect lack of studies that show added value of detection of early PAD beyond expectant management and traditional risk assessment.

### Assessment and management of peripheral arterial disease: what every cardiologist should know [^113skfmQ]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Ankle brachial index

The ankle brachial index (ABI) is a simple bedside tool to diagnose lower extremity PAD. The ABI of each leg is the highest ankle systolic blood pressure (SBP) (obtained by blood pressure cuff above the ankle and Doppler of both the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries) divided by the highest arm SBP. A low ABI (< 0.9) is indicative of obstructive disease, and a very elevated ABI (> 1.4) represents arterial stiffening from calcification. In patients with claudication symptoms, exercise treadmill ABI or pedal plantarflexion (toe raises) ABI increase the sensitivity of the test.

In patients who are elderly or with diabetes or chronic kidney disease (CKD), ABI is often elevated due to medial calcification. If there is suspicion that ABI is artificially elevated, toe brachial index (TBI) should be measured because the digital arteries are rarely non-compressible. A TBI of < 0.7 is generally considered to be abnormal. Due to high likelihood of falsely elevated ABI in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI), TBI should always be obtained in patients with lower extremity wounds. Other measurements of perfusion, such as transcutaneous oxygen pressure and skin perfusion pressure, can help guide revascularisation in patients with CLTI.

### Management of patients with peripheral artery disease (compilation of 2005 and 2011 ACCF / AHA guideline recommendations): a report of the American college of cardiology foundation / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines [^115xxesy]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) — asymptomatic adults: Class I recommendations specify that a history of walking impairment, claudication, ischemic rest pain, and/or nonhealing wounds is recommended as a required component of a standard review of symptoms for adults 50 years and older who have atherosclerosis risk factors and for adults 70 years and older (Level of Evidence: C); individuals with asymptomatic lower extremity PAD should be identified by examination and/or measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) so that therapeutic interventions known to diminish their increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and death may be offered (Level of Evidence: B); smoking cessation, lipid lowering, and diabetes and hypertension treatment according to current national treatment guidelines are recommended (Level of Evidence: B); and antiplatelet therapy is indicated to reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular ischemic events (Level of Evidence: C). Class IIa recommendations add that an exercise ABI measurement can be useful to diagnose lower extremity PAD in at-risk individuals who have a normal ABI (0.91 to 1.30), are without classic claudication symptoms, and have no other clinical evidence of atherosclerosis (Level of Evidence: C), and that a toe-brachial index or pulse volume recording measurement can be useful in at-risk individuals who have an ABI greater than 1.30 and no other clinical evidence of atherosclerosis (Level of Evidence: C).

### Estimating the diagnostic accuracy of the ankle-brachial pressure index for detecting peripheral arterial disease in people with diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117CAU4t]. Diabetic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To systematically evaluate research investigating the accuracy of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) for diagnosing peripheral artery disease (PAD) in people with diabetes, as the accuracy is thought to be reduced in this cohort.

Methods

A database search of EBSCO Megafile Premier, Embase and The Cochrane Library was conducted to 28 February 2019. Prospective and retrospective investigations of the diagnostic accuracy of the ABI for PAD in people with diabetes using an imaging reference standard were eligible. Sensitivity and specify of the ABI and bivariate meta-analysis against reference tests, or a standard summary receiver operating curve analysis (SROC) was performed.

Results

Thirty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. ABI was compared with angiography in 12 studies and with colour duplex ultrasound (CDUS) in 21 studies. A SROC analysis of studies using angiography as the reference standard found a diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 9.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.61 to 22.69], and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.76 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.86). Bivariate analysis of studies using CDUS demonstrated mean sensitivity of 0.60 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.71; P = 0.097) and mean specificity of 0.87 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.92; P < 0.001) with a DOR of 9.76 (95% CI 5.24 to 18.20; P < 0.0001) and AUC 0.72.

Conclusions

These results suggest the ABI has a high specificity but lower sensitivity in detecting imaging diagnosed PAD in people with diabetes. The low probability of the testing being able to rule diagnosis in or out suggest that the ABI has limited effectiveness for early detection of PAD in this cohort.

### Does the clinical examination predict lower extremity peripheral arterial disease? [^114bft53]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is common and associated with significant increases in morbidity and mortality. Physicians typically depend on the clinical examination to identify patients who need further diagnostic testing.

Objective

To systematically review the accuracy and precision of the clinical examination for PAD.

Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2005) and Cochrane databases were searched for articles on the diagnosis of PAD based on physical examination published in the English language. Included studies compared an element of the history or physical examination with a reference standard of ankle-brachial index, duplex sonography, or angiogram. Seventeen of the 51 potential articles identified met inclusion criteria. Two of the authors independently extracted data, performed quality review, and used consensus to resolve any discrepancies.

Data Synthesis

For asymptomatic patients, the most useful clinical findings to diagnose PAD are the presence of claudication (likelihood ratio [LR], 3.30; 95% confidence interval, 2.30–4.80), femoral bruit (LR, 4.80; 95% CI, 2.40–9.50), or any pulse abnormality (LR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.40–6.60). While none of the clinical examination features help to lower the likelihood of any degree of PAD, the absence of claudication or the presence of normal pulses decreases the likelihood of moderate to severe disease. When considering patients who are symptomatic with leg complaints, the most useful clinical findings are the presence of cool skin (LR, 5.90; 95% CI, 4.10–8.60), the presence of at least 1 bruit (LR, 5.60; 95% CI, 4.70–6.70), or any palpable pulse abnormality (LR, 4.70; 95% CI, 2.20–9.90). The absence of any bruits (iliac, femoral, or popliteal) (LR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.34–0.45) or pulse abnormality (LR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.23–0.64) reduces the likelihood of PAD. Combinations of physical examination findings do not increase the likelihood of PAD beyond that of individual clinical findings. However, when combinations of clinical findings are all normal, the likelihood of disease is lower than when individual symptoms or signs are normal. A PAD scoring system, which includes auscultation of arterial components by handheld Doppler, provides greater diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusions

Clinical examination findings must be used in the context of the pretest probability because they are not independently sufficient to include or exclude a diagnosis of PAD with certainty. The PAD screening score using the hand-held Doppler has the greatest diagnostic accuracy.

### Screening for peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular disease risk assessment with the ankle-brachial index: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111rngDh]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Screening tests — ankle-brachial index (ABI) calculation, threshold, and performance in asymptomatic persons: ABI is calculated as the ankle systolic blood pressure divided by the brachial systolic pressure with the patient lying down, and a ratio of less than 1.0 is considered abnormal. In one study of adults older than 70 years, an ABI of less than 0.9 had a sensitivity of 15% to 20% and a specificity of 99% compared with whole-body magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Physical examination has low sensitivity for detecting mild PAD in asymptomatic persons, and the clinical benefits and harms of screening with a physical examination have not been evaluated.

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) screening and prognosis using ankle-brachial index (ABI) — Epidemiologic studies have established the incremental value of ABI beyond standard risk scores in predicting future death and cardiovascular events, and an ABI < 0.9 or > 1.4 portends an increased risk of major cardiovascular events. A review by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gave ABI screening an indeterminate rating, stating insufficient evidence to assess benefits and harms. The SVS-commissioned meta-analysis states that ABI testing may incrementally improve cardiovascular risk prediction, but existing evidence does not support broad population screening of asymptomatic patients for PAD; although future studies may identify targeted subgroups, to date inadequate data exist and broad population screening appears unwarranted. After identifying symptoms consistent with intermittent claudication (IC) and an abnormal ABI, it is important to rule out other potential etiologies that can mimic PAD symptoms.

### Noninvasive physiologic vascular studies: a guide to diagnosing peripheral arterial disease [^116sqtw6]. Radiographics (2016). Low credibility.

Noninvasive physiologic vascular studies play an important role in the diagnosis and characterization in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower extremity. These studies evaluate the physiologic parameters of blood flow through segmental arterial pressures, Doppler waveforms, and pulse volume recordings. Collectively, they comprise a powerful toolset for defining the functionality of the arterial system, localizing the site of disease, and providing prognostic data. This technology has been widely adopted by diverse medical specialty practitioners, including radiologists, surgeons, cardiologists, and primary care providers. The use of these studies increased substantially between 2000 and 2010. Although they do not employ imaging, they remain a critical component for a comprehensive radiologic vascular laboratory. A strong presence of radiology in the diagnosis of PAD adds value in that radiologists have shifted to noninvasive alternatives to diagnostic catheter angiography (DCA), such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) angiography, which provide a more efficient, less-expensive, and lower-risk alternative. Other specialties have increased the use of DCA during the same period. The authors provide a review of the relevant anatomy and physiology of PAD as well as the associated clinical implications. In addition, guidelines for interpreting the ankle-brachial index, segmental pressures, Doppler waveforms, and pulse volume recordings are reviewed as well as potential limitations of these studies. Noninvasive physiologic vascular studies are provided here for review with associated correlating angiographic, CT, and/or MR findings covering the segmental distribution of PAD as well as select nonatherosclerotic diagnoses. © RSNA, 2016.

### Alternative ankle-brachial index method identifies additional at-risk individuals [^1114hhaY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine whether use of an alternative ankle-brachial index (ABI) calculation method improves mortality risk prediction compared with traditional methods.

Background

The ABI is used to diagnose peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and to identify those at risk for cardiovascular events. Traditionally, the ABI is calculated with the higher of the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial ankle arteries. Studies directly comparing calculation methods are limited.

Methods

The ABI was calculated at baseline in 1,413 study participants undergoing non-emergent coronary angiography subsequently followed for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. There were 224 individuals assigned to the traditional-PAD group (ABI < 0.90) with the traditional ABI method. Of those remaining, an alternative ABI method using the lower of the 2 ankle pressures assigned 282 patients to the alternative-PAD group. The 862 individuals not assigned to PAD by either method were the no-PAD group.

Results

There were 163 mortalities during a median follow-up of 5.0 years. Adjusted Cox regression models showed that the alternative-PAD group had an increased risk for all-cause (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.49; 95% confidence interval: 1.01 to 2.19) and cardiovascular mortality (HR: 3.21; 95% confidence interval: 1.53 to 6.37) versus the no-PAD group. Additionally, in the no-PAD group, there was an 11% (HR: 1.11; 95% confidence interval: 1.05 to 1.17) increased risk of all-cause mortality/1-mm Hg increased difference between the left and right brachial systolic pressures.

Conclusions

The implementation of an alternative ABI method and use of the brachial difference identifies individuals at an increased risk for mortality who are currently missed with traditional ABI methods. Current ABI protocols might need to be evaluated.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Resting ankle–brachial index (ABI) for diagnosing PAD — In patients with history or physical examination findings suggestive of PAD, the resting ABI, with or without segmental pressures and waveforms, is recommended to establish the diagnosis. Resting ABI results should be reported as abnormal (ABI ≤ 0.90), borderline (ABI 0.91–0.99), normal (1.00–1.40), or noncompressible (ABI > 1.40). The ABI has sensitivities ranging from 68% to 84% and specificities from 84% to 99%. Calculated ABI values should be recorded to 2 decimal places. Patients with ABI ≤ 0.90 are diagnosed with PAD, those with ABI 0.91 to 0.99 may possibly have PAD and should undergo exercise ABI, if the clinical suspicion of PAD is significant, and values > 1.40 indicate that the arteries were not able to be compressed; in the setting of noncompressible ABI values, additional imaging can be used to diagnose PAD if the clinical suspicion is significant. Segmental lower extremity blood pressures and Doppler or plethysmographic waveforms (pulse volume recordings) can be used to localize anatomic segments of disease (e.g., aortoiliac, femoropopliteal, infrapopliteal).

### Critical analysis and limitations of resting ankle-brachial index in the diagnosis of symptomatic peripheral arterial disease patients and the role of diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease [^117NXJSk]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The ankle-brachial index (ABI) may underestimate the severity of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in patients with noncompressible vessels. This study analyzed limitations of the ABI and toe-brachial index (TBI), if done alone, in patients with symptomatic PAD, diagnosed by duplex ultrasound (DUS) examination, particularly in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Methods

This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data. All patients underwent resting ABIs, TBI, and/or DUS. An ABIs of 0.90 or less in either leg was considered abnormal, and the term inconclusive ABIs (noncompressibility) was used if the ABI was 1.3 or greater. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall accuracy (OA) of ABIs in detecting 50% or greater stenosis of any arterial segment based on DUS were determined. A TBI of less than 0.7 was considered abnormal.

Results

We included 2226 ABIs and 1383 DUS examinations: 46% of patients had diabetes, 16% had CKD, and 39% had coronary artery disease. Fifty-three percent of the ABIs were normal, 34% were abnormal, and 13% were inconclusive. For patients with limb-threatening ischemia, 40% had normal ABIs, 40% abnormal ABIs, and 20% were inconclusive. The sensitivity and OA for ABIs in detecting 50% or greater stenosis in the whole series were 57% (95% confidence interval, 53.7–61.2) and 74% (95% CI, 71.9–76.6); for diabetics 51% (95% CI, 46.1–56.3) and 66% (95% CI, 62.3–69.8); nondiabetics 66% (95% CI, 59.9–70.9) and 81% (95% CI, 78.2–83.9). For patients with CKD, the sensitivity and OA for ABIs in detecting 50% or greater stenosis was 43% (95% CI, 34.3–52.7) and 67% (95% CI, 60.2–73.0) versus patients with no CKD 60% (95% CI, 56.3–64.6) and 76% (95% CI, 73.1–78.1). If patients with inconclusive ABIs were excluded, these values were 69% (95% CI, 65.2–72.9) and 80% (95% CI, 77.2–81.9) in the whole series; 67% (95% CI, 61.6–72.7) and 75% (95% CI, 70.5–78.4) for diabetics; and 63% (95% CI, 51.3–73.0) and 78% (95% CI, 70.6–83.9) for patients with CKD. Thirty-three percent of TBIs were normal and 67% were abnormal. The sensitivity and OA for abnormal TBI in detecting 50% or greater stenosis were 85% (95% CI, 78.9–90.0) and 75% (95% CI, 70.1–80.2) in the whole series; 84% (95% CI, 76.0–90.3) and 74% (95% CI, 67.1–80.2) for diabetics; and 77% (95% CI, 61.4–88.2) and 72% (95% CI, 59.9–82.3) for patients with CKD. For those with inconclusive ABIs, these values for TBI were 75% and 69%.

Conclusions

Of symptomatic patients with PAD with 50% or greater stenosis on DUS examination, 43% had normal/inconclusive resting ABIs (49% in diabetics and 57% in CKD). TBI may help in patients with inconclusive ABIs. These patients should undergo further imaging to determine proper treatment.

### Association of ankle-brachial indices with limb revascularization or amputation in patients with peripheral artery disease [^112NaNZJ]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Amputation and revascularization rates are high in community-dwelling patients with PAD, and noninvasive vascular testing identifies high-risk individuals, including those with either PCA or severe PAD. Guideline-recommended strategies for secondary risk prevention for patients with PAD are underused in the community setting. Future studies that use big data infrastructure and computational approaches will be able to evaluate the association between clinical decision support deployed to EHRs at the point of care to assess whether rates of adoption of guideline-recommended strategies for secondary prevention in patients with PAD can be improved.

### Position statement on noninvasive imaging of peripheral arterial disease by the Society of Interventional Radiology and the Canadian Interventional Radiology Association [^11524gxU]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Ankle-brachial index measurement — standard testing modality — defines that the ABI is the ankle systolic blood pressure divided by the brachial artery systolic blood pressure and directs that both upper-extremity brachial pressures should be taken. If there is more than a 15-mm Hg difference between the two sides, hemodynamically significant disease should be considered to be present proximal to the brachial artery with the lower pressure; if there is a brachial pressure discrepancy, the higher pressure should be used. The greater of the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial artery blood pressure from each side is used to determine the ankle reading.

### Associations between peripheral artery disease and ischemic stroke: implications for primary and secondary prevention [^117TwbVb]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Although peripheral artery disease (PAD) has a particularly poor prognosis compared with vascular disease in other territories, little attention is paid to its epidemiology, treatment, and prevention. Despite the high prevalence of PAD in patients with stroke, and of stroke in patients with PAD, PAD is omitted from all guidelines for treatment, prevention, and rehabilitation of stroke, although coronary artery disease risk is considered. Therefore, routine PAD screening is seldom undertaken and so disease is probably often missed. Summary of Review- This review evaluates epidemiology of PAD in patients with stroke and of stroke in patients with PAD. The role of the ankle-brachial pressure index; imaging and novel markers in risk prediction of PAD in patients with stroke; and treatment and prevention of PAD are reviewed.

Conclusions

In both primary and secondary prevention settings, PAD indicates a high risk of future events. Data on which additional preventive measures are beneficial in this patient group are lacking, but the presence of PAD does have implications for current management in both primary and secondary prevention of stroke.

### Diagnostic utility of the two methods of ankle brachial index in the detection of peripheral arterial disease of lower extremities [^114cijaK]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common disease that is diagnosed with a screening test called the Ankle Brachial Index (ABI). Different methods of ABI have been described in the literature. We wanted to estimate and compare the sensitivity and specificity of an alternative method of calculating the ABI (LAP ABI, low ankle pressure ABI) with the current method (named high ankle pressure (HAP)), using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as the gold standard.

Methods

We reviewed the records of all patients who had undergone DSA at a major academic center between August 2003 and October 2005. The study includes 107 patients/208 limbs. Inclusion criteria included patients with an ABI performed within 30 days prior to the DSA. Patients with non-compressible vessels and ABI > 1.40 were excluded. Abnormal ABI was defined as ≤ 0.9 for both methods. Disease on angiogram was defined as the presence of 50% or more stenosis of any lower extremity artery from the aorto-iliac bifurcation to the ankle arteries.

Results

The sensitivity of the HAP and LAP ABI for the diagnosis of PAD was 69 and 84%, respectively (P < 0.001). The specificity of the HAP and the LAP method was 83 and 64% respectively (P < 0.01). The overall accuracy of LAP ABI and HAP ABI was 80 and 72%, respectively.

Conclusions

The LAP ABI has better sensitivity and overall accuracy in comparison to the HAP ABI to diagnose PAD.

### Use and utility of ankle brachial index in patients with diabetes [^114LAyot]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Ankle brachial index (ABI) is a simple method to screen peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and to evaluate cardiovascular (CV) prognosis in the general population. Measuring it requires a hand-held Doppler probe but it can be done also with an automatic device. ABI is an effective tool for clinical practice or clinical studies. However, in diabetic patients, it has some specific caveats. Sensitivity of the standard threshold of 0.9 appears to be lower in diabetic patients with complications. Moreover, highly frequent arterial medial calcifications in diabetes increase ABI. It has been demonstrated that measurements > 1.3 are well correlated with both an increased prevalence of PAD and CV risk. Therefore, ABI thresholds of less than 0.9 and more than 1.3 are highly suspicious for PAD and high CV risk in diabetic patients. However, when there is concomitant clinical peripheral neuropathy or high risk of arterial calcification, the efficiency of ABI seems to be limited. In this case, other methods should be applied, toe pressure, in particular. Thus, the ABI could be used in patients with diabetes, but values should be interpreted with precision, according to the clinical situation.

1. Introduction

1.1. Methodology and Evidence Review

The recommendations listed in this guideline are, whenever possible, evidence based. An initial extensive evidence review, which included literature derived from research involving human subjects, published in English, and indexed in MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline, was conducted from January through September 2015. Key search words included but were not limited to the following: acute limb ischemia, angioplasty, ankle-brachial index, anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy, atypical leg symptoms, blood pressure lowering/hypertension, bypass graft/bypass grafting/surgical bypass, cilostazol, claudication/intermittent claudication, critical limb ischemia/severe limb ischemia, diabetes, diagnostic testing, endovascular therapy, exercise rehabilitation/exercise therapy/exercise training/supervised exercise, lower extremity/foot wound/ulcer, peripheral artery disease/peripheral arterial disease/peripheral vascular disease/lower extremity arterial disease, smoking/smoking cessation, statin, stenting, and vascular surgery. Additional relevant studies published through September 2016, during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee, and added to the evidence tables when appropriate. The final evidence tables included in the Online Data Supplement summarize the evidence utilized by the writing committee to formulate recommendations. Additionally, the writing committee reviewed documents related to lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) previously published by the ACC and AHA. References selected and published in this document are representative and not all-inclusive.

### Position statement on noninvasive imaging of peripheral arterial disease by the Society of Interventional Radiology and the Canadian Interventional Radiology Association [^1173aoFs]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Peripheral arterial disease — ankle brachial index (ABI) thresholds and performance are outlined: the range for a normal ABI is between 1.0 and 1.1; clinical severity by ABI includes no symptoms when ABI is more than 1.0, claudication when ABI is between 0.5 and 1.0, rest pain when ABI is between 0.25 and 0.50, and impending tissue loss when ABI is less than 0.25; the sensitivity and specificity for PAD diagnosis are 72% and 96%, respectively. In heavily calcified vessels, a toe brachial index (TBI) can be used, with index > 0.65 considered normal and severe PAD present with a TBI of less than 0.40, and ABI does not localize disease within the lower extremities.

Exercise therapy trials in asymptomatic low ABI or PAD — Two randomized trials tested combined risk factor modification and increased physical activity: a small US-based trial (N = 50) with 12 weeks of follow-up and a good-quality Australian trial (n = 882) with 1 year of follow-up; one-fourth of US participants and slightly more than half of Australian participants were asymptomatic. Both studies found no statistically significant differences in the primary outcome of walking distance or in secondary outcomes (quality of life or self-reported symptoms), with the US trial showing improvement only in the mean stair climbing component of the Health Impact Questionnaire; there was no difference in overall improvement of PAD symptoms or in quality of life.

### Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities: management of asymptomatic disease and claudication [^115jo7cL]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery — noninvasive testing for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) specifies ankle-brachial index (ABI)–based thresholds and exercise criteria. Quantitative assessment includes noninvasive vascular testing, of which the cornerstone is the measurement of the ABI. If the ABI is ≥ 1.4 from noncompressibility, a toe-brachial index is a useful alternative and a toe-brachial index value of ≤ 0.7 is indicative of hemodynamically significant arterial insufficiency. In patients with compelling symptoms and normal resting tests, obtaining an ABI with exercise can be helpful; the standardized treadmill protocol asks patients to walk at a predetermined speed for a maximum of 5 minutes. Diagnostic exercise thresholds include a drop in ABI to ≤ 0.9, more specific criteria of a drop of 30 mm Hg or 20% of the baseline ABI with exercise, and a delayed (> 3 minutes) recovery.

### Functional decline in peripheral arterial disease: associations with the ankle brachial index and leg symptoms [^11153yAq]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Among individuals with lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD), specific leg symptoms and the ankle brachial index (ABI) are cross-sectionally related to the degree of functional impairment. However, relations between these clinical characteristics and objectively measured functional decline are unknown.

Objective

To define whether PAD, ABI, and specific leg symptoms predict functional decline at 2-year follow-up.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospective cohort study among 676 consecutively identified individuals (aged ≥ 55 years) with and without PAD (n = 417 and n = 259, respectively), with baseline functional assessments occurring between October 1, 1998, and January 31, 2000, and follow-up assessments scheduled 1 and 2 years thereafter. PAD was defined as ABI less than 0.90, and participants with PAD were categorized at baseline into 1 of 5 mutually exclusive symptom groups.

Main Outcome Measures

Mean annual changes in 6-minute walk performance and in usual-paced and fast-paced 4-m walking velocity, adjusted for age, sex, race, prior-year functioning, comorbid diseases, body mass index, pack-years of cigarette smoking, and patterns of missing data.

Results

Lower baseline ABI values were associated with greater mean (95% confidence interval) annual decline in 6-minute walk performance (-73.0 [-142 to -4.2] ft for ABI < 0.50 vs -58.8 [-83.5 to -34.0] ft for ABI 0.50 to < 0.90 vs -12.6 [-40.3 to 15.1] ft for ABI 0.90–1.50, P = 0.02). Compared with participants without PAD, PAD participants with leg pain on exertion and rest at baseline had greater mean annual decline in 6-minute walk performance (-111 [-173 to -50.0] ft vs -8.67 [-36.9 to 19.5] ft, P = 0.004), usual-pace 4-meter walking velocity (-0.06 [-0.09 to -0.02] m/sec vs -0.01 (-0.03 to 0.003] m/sec, P = 0.02), and fastest-pace 4-meter walking velocity (-0.07 [-0.11 to -0.03] m/sec vs -0.02 [-0.04 to -0.006] m/sec, P = 0.046). Compared with participants without PAD, asymptomatic PAD was associated with greater mean annual decline in 6-minute walk performance (-76.8 (-135 to -18.6] ft vs -8.67 (-36.9 to 19.5] ft, P = 0.04) and an increased odds ratio for becoming unable to walk for 6 minutes continuously (3.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.58–8.36; p = 0.002).

Conclusions

Baseline ABI and the nature of leg symptoms predict the degree of functional decline at 2-year follow-up. Previously reported lack of worsening in claudication symptoms over time in patients with PAD may be more related to declining functional performance to than lack of disease progression.

### Sensitivity and specificity of the toe-brachial index for detecting peripheral arterial disease: initial findings [^117YRE52]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The toe-brachial index (TBI) is an alternative to the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in screening for peripheral arterial disease (PAD); however, there is limited evidence comparing their diagnostic accuracy. This study compared the diagnostic accuracy of the ABI and TBI in a population at risk of PAD.

Methods

The sensitivity and specificity of the ABI and TBI were determined by color duplex sonography. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed.

Results

A total of 119 participants were recruited (75 male and 44 female). The sensitivity for PAD was highest for the TBI (71%; ABI, 45%), and the specificity was highest for the ABI (93%; TBI, 78%). Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that the TBI (ROC area, 0.77; p = 0.0001) had greater clinical efficacy for diagnosis of PAD than the ABI (ROC area, 0.65; p = 0.005).

Conclusions

In specific populations, the TBI may have greater clinical efficacy than the ABI for diagnosis of PAD.

### 2016 AHA / ACC guideline on the management of patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease: executive summary [^115hwyMe]. Vascular Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) diagnostic testing — algorithm: History and physical examination suggestive of PAD without rest pain, nonhealing wound, or gangrene proceed to ankle-brachial index (ABI) with or without segmental limb pressures and waveforms (Class I). Noncompressible arteries (ABI: > 1.40) route to toe-brachial index (TBI) measurement. Patients with normal ABI 1.00–1.4 or borderline ABI 0.91–0.99 who have exertional non–joint-related leg symptoms should undergo exercise treadmill ABI testing to evaluate for PAD, whereas abnormal ABI ≤ 0.90 can undergo Exercise ABI (Class IIa). When lifestyle-limiting claudication persists despite guideline-directed management and therapy (GDMT) with revascularization considered, options include anatomic assessment with Duplex ultrasound + computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) (Class I) or anatomic assessment with invasive angiography (Class IIa). The algorithm advises not to perform invasive or noninvasive anatomic assessments for asymptomatic patients (Class III: Harm).

### Pulse pressure and subclinical peripheral artery disease [^116DD5oP]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement offers an easily available method to diagnose peripheral artery disease (PAD) and systemic atherosclerosis in early stage and thus to identify high-risk individuals for preventive interventions. The objective of this study was to assess the most practical criteria for the measurement of ABI in subjects with high cardiovascular risk. We examined 972 asymptomatic, middle-aged high-risk subjects without manifested cardiovascular disease or previously diagnosed diabetes. The prevalence of PAD (defined as ABI ≤ 0.90) and borderline PAD (0.91–1.00) were 5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 4–7%) (49/972) and 20% (95% CI 18–23%) (192/972), respectively. In multivariate analysis, female gender (odds ratio (OR) 0.71 (95% CI 0.53–0.97)), current smoking (OR 2.14 (95% CI 1.47–3.11)) and pulse pressure (OR 1.03 for each increase of 1mmHg (95% CI 1.01–1.04)) were associated with low ABI. Measuring ABI in subjects who smoke or have pulse pressure > 65mmHg seems to be worthwhile.

### The role of vascular biomarkers for primary and secondary prevention. A position paper from the European Society of Cardiology working group on peripheral circulation: endorsed by the association for research into arterial structure and physiology (ARTERY) society [^1159U7Td]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

While risk scores are invaluable tools for adapted preventive strategies, a significant gap exists between predicted and actual event rates. Additional tools to further stratify the risk of patients at an individual level are biomarkers. A surrogate endpoint is a biomarker that is intended as a substitute for a clinical endpoint. In order to be considered as a surrogate endpoint of cardiovascular events, a biomarker should satisfy several criteria, such as proof of concept, prospective validation, incremental value, clinical utility, clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness, ease of use, methodological consensus, and reference values. We scrutinized the role of peripheral (i.e. not related to coronary circulation) noninvasive vascular biomarkers for primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention. Most of the biomarkers examined fit within the concept of early vascular aging. Biomarkers that fulfill most of the criteria and, therefore, are close to being considered a clinical surrogate endpoint are carotid ultrasonography, ankle-brachial index and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity; biomarkers that fulfill some, but not all of the criteria are brachial ankle pulse wave velocity, central haemodynamics/wave reflections and C-reactive protein; biomarkers that do no not at present fulfill essential criteria are flow-mediated dilation, endothelial peripheral arterial tonometry, oxidized LDL and dysfunctional HDL. Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether a specific vascular biomarker is overly superior. A prospective study in which all vascular biomarkers are measured is still lacking. In selected cases, the combined assessment of more than one biomarker may be required.

### Impact of ankle brachial index calculations on peripheral arterial disease prevalence and as a predictor of cardiovascular risk [^116amK9o]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and predictive accuracy for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity by using different ankle brachial index (ABI) calculation methods in the general population.

Methods

ABI measurements and questionnaire data were collected from 5 080 randomly selected citizens aged 60–90 years. A 10 year follow up with data from Swedish national health registries was carried out. ABI was calculated using as numerator the highest (ABI-HI) or the lowest (ABI-LO) ankle BP obtained in each leg. Subjects were defined as references or having peripheral arterial disease (PAD) based on ABI-LO (Group 1) or ABI-HI (Group 2). Prevalence, mortality, CV events and risk were then analysed for these three groups, and their predictive power by using the area under the curve (AUC).

Results

A total of 4 909 inhabitants were included in the cohort (References: 83.8%, Group 1: 6.7% and Group 2: 9.6%). The prevalence of PAD was 16% using ABI-LO, and 9.6% using ABI-HI. The 10 year all cause mortality for references and Groups 1 and 2 was 27.6%, 48.8%, and 67.2%, respectively. The overall age adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for the composite outcome of CV mortality and a non-fatal CV event was 1.25 (1.06–1.49) for Group 1 and 2.11 (1.85–2.39) for Group 2. The prediction accuracy for ABI < 0.9 in predicting CV event measured with AUC was 0.60 for ABI-HI and 0.62 for ABI-LO.

Conclusion

An ABI < 0.9 should be considered a strong risk marker for future CV morbidity. Applying the traditional ABI calculation method of using the highest measured ankle BP, a group of subjects with high CV risk may be overlooked for intervention, and this why the lowest ankle BP should be the preferred for risk stratification. However, as a single predictive tool an ABI < 0.9 cannot adequately discriminate which individual will have a future CV event regardless of calculation method used.

### Microvascular disease increases amputation in patients with peripheral artery disease [^111Pw9Ud]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

It is estimated that > 2 million patients are living with an amputation in the United States. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) and diabetes mellitus account for the majority of nontraumatic amputations. The standard measurement to diagnose PAD is the ankle-brachial index, which integrates all occlusive disease in the limb to create a summary value of limb artery occlusive disease. Despite its accuracy, ankle-brachial index fails to well predict limb outcomes. There is an emerging body of literature that implicates microvascular disease (MVD; ie, retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) as a systemic phenomenon where diagnosis of MVD in one capillary bed implicates microvascular dysfunction systemically. MVD independently associates with lower limb outcomes, regardless of diabetic or PAD status. The presence of PAD and concomitant MVD phenotype reveal a synergistic, rather than simply additive, effect. The higher risk of amputation in patients with MVD, PAD, and concomitant MVD and PAD should prompt aggressive foot surveillance and diagnosis of both conditions to maintain ambulation and prevent amputation in older patients.

### Ankle-brachial index and subsequent risk of severe ischemic leg outcomes: the ARIC study [^113ywv13]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Ankle-brachial index (ABI) is used to identify lower-extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD). However, its association with severe ischemic leg outcomes (eg, amputation) has not been investigated in the general population. Methods and Results Among 13 735 ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study participants without clinical manifestations of PAD (mean age, 54 [SD, 5.8] years; 44.4% men; and 73.6% White) at baseline (1987–1989), we quantified the prospective association between ABI and subsequent severe ischemic leg outcomes, critical limb ischemia (PAD with rest pain or tissue loss) and ischemic leg amputation (PAD requiring amputation) according to discharge diagnosis. Over a median follow-up of ≈28 years, there were 221 and 129 events of critical limb ischemia and ischemic leg amputation, respectively. After adjusting for demographics, ABI ≤ 0.90 versus 1.11 to 1.20 had a ≈4-fold higher risk of critical limb ischemia and ischemic leg amputation (hazard ratios, 3.85 [95% CI, 2.09–7.11] and 4.39 [95% CI, 2.08–9.27]). The magnitude of the association was modestly attenuated after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratios, 2.44 [95% CI, 1.29–4.61] and 2.72 [95% CI, 1.25–5.91], respectively). ABI 0.91 to 1.00 and 1.01 to 1.10 were also associated with these severe leg outcomes, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.7 to 2.0 after accounting for potential clinical and demographic confounders. The associations were largely consistent across various subgroups. Conclusions In a middle-aged community-based cohort, lower ABI was independently and robustly associated with increased risk of severe ischemic leg outcomes. Our results further support ABI ≤ 0.90 as a threshold diagnosing PAD and also suggest the importance of recognizing the prognostic value of ABI 0.91 to 1.10 for limb prognosis.

### Screening of unrecognized peripheral arterial disease (PAD) using ankle-brachial index in high cardiovascular risk patients free from symptomatic PAD [^115j8k3G]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the utility of ankle-brachial index (ABI) in screening for unrecognized peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Although PAD is a consistent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, it is often under-diagnosed and under-treated.

Methods

In this prospective, observational, real-life, epidemiologic study (ELLIPSE) the prevalence of PAD (ABI < 0.9) was calculated in 2146 asymptomatic patients ≥ 55 years of age who were at high cardiovascular risk and who were hospitalized in departments of cardiology, diabetology, geriatrics, internal medicine, or neurology in metropolitan France. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify PAD risk factors. The discriminatory power of the model was evaluated by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve.

Results

The ABI was < 0.9 in 41.1% of patients. In the multivariate analysis, absence of ≥ 1 pulse (odds ratio [OR], 2.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.81 to 2.63; P < .0001), arterial bruit (OR, 1.92; 95%CI, 1.34 to 2.75; P < .0004), previous non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (OR, 1.50; 95%CI, 1.08 to 2.08; p = 0.02), regular smoking (OR, 1.49; 95%CI, 1.22 to 1.80; P < .0001), age ≥ 81 years (OR, 1.45; 95%CI, 1.15 to 1.82; p = 0.001), creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min (OR, 1.33; 95%CI, 1.08 to 1.63; p = 0.008), and treated hypertension (OR, 1.28; 95%CI, 1.03 to 1.59; p = 0.03) were significantly associated with PAD. Although risk increased with the number of variables, the model, based on clinical symptoms and on medical history parameters, was not discriminatory (AUC = 0.66). On average, physicians took 15 minutes to perform the ABI test.

Conclusions

The high prevalence of asymptomatic PAD in this patient population suggests that ABI should systematically be performed in high-risk hospitalized patients to ensure that appropriate secondary prevention programs are initiated.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) diagnostic testing — In patients with history and physical examination suggestive of peripheral artery disease (PAD) with rest pain, nonhealing wound, or gangrene, the algorithm uses ankle-brachial index (ABI) categories and branches accordingly: noncompressible arteries ABI: > 1.40 to toe-brachial index (TBI), and normal ABI: 1.00–1.40 or borderline ABI: 0.91–0.99 with nonhealing wound or gangrene to perfusion assessment. Additional perfusion assessment, particularly if ABI > 0.70, includes TBI with waveforms, transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2), and skin perfusion pressure (Class IIa), with the notes "TBI with waveforms if not already performed" and "Order based on expert consensus". After the perfusion decision node labeled "Normal" or "Abnormal", abnormal results lead to anatomic assessment with duplex ultrasound, CTA or MRA, or invasive angiography (Class I), and the flow also includes branches to search for alternative diagnosis (Tables 6 and 7).

### New horizons in peripheral artery disease [^116hw7ZN]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of PAD

Clinical diagnosis of PAD is based on history (e.g. intermittent claudication) and examination findings (e.g. absent pedal pulses) as well as haemodynamic tests that are required to confirm the diagnosis. The standard haemodynamic test is the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI), which is the ratio of systolic blood pressure in the ankle to that in the upper arm.

A resting ABPI < 0.90 is considered the threshold for diagnosing PAD. As well as identifying PAD in individuals with symptoms, ABPI can be used to diagnose those with asymptomatic PAD.

In individuals with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, ankle pressures may be falsely elevated or incompressible due to calcification of the crural (below knee) arteries. Measurement of absolute toe pressure is preferable in these patients.

In clinical practice, arterial imaging (e.g. duplex ultrasound, computed tomography angiography) is reserved for those in whom revascularisation is being considered.

### Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities: management of asymptomatic disease and claudication [^113Ywfty]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery — recommendations for diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) state the following. We recommend using the ankle-brachial index (ABI) as the first-line noninvasive test to establish a diagnosis of PAD in individuals with symptoms or signs suggestive of disease. When the ABI is borderline or normal (> 0.9) and symptoms of claudication are suggestive, we recommend an exercise ABI. We suggest against routine screening for lower extremity PAD in the absence of risk factors, history, signs, or symptoms of PAD. For asymptomatic individuals who are at elevated risk, such as those aged > 70, smokers, diabetic patients, those with an abnormal pulse examination, or other established cardiovascular disease, screening for lower extremity PAD is reasonable if used to improve risk stratification, preventive care, and medical management. In symptomatic patients who are being considered for revascularization, we suggest using physiologic noninvasive studies, such as segmental pressures and pulse volume recordings, to aid in the quantification of arterial insufficiency and help localize the level of obstruction. In symptomatic patients in whom revascularization treatment is being considered, we recommend anatomic imaging studies, such as arterial duplex ultrasound, computed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and contrast arteriography.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaVascular claudication-assessment for revascularization [^115vXpXq]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Vascular claudication is a symptom complex characterized by reproducible pain and weakness in an active muscle group due to peripheral arterial disease. Noninvasive hemodynamic tests such as the ankle brachial index, toe brachial index, segmental pressures, and pulse volume recordings are considered the first imaging modalities necessary to reliably establish the presence and severity of arterial obstructions. Vascular imaging is consequently used for diagnosing individual lesions and triaging patients for medical, percutaneous, or surgical intervention. Catheter angiography remains the reference standard for imaging the peripheral arteries, providing a dynamic and accurate depiction of the peripheral arteries. It is particularly useful when endovascular intervention is anticipated. When combined with noninvasive hemodynamic tests, however, noninvasive imaging, including ultrasound, CT angiography, and MR angiography, can also reliably confirm or exclude the presence of peripheral arterial disease. All modalities, however, have their own technical limitations when classifying the location, extent, and severity of disease. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Lifetime risk of lower-extremity peripheral artery disease defined by ankle-brachial index in the United States [^112aBrdV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Although we tried to use the best readily available data in the United States, we need to acknowledge several limitations. First, most data were collected in the 1990s or early 2000s, and, unfortunately, few contemporary US community‐based cohorts measured ABI in multiple racial/ethnic groups. Since a recent international study reported that the prevalence of PAD increased by 13% in high‐income countries from 2000 to 2010, 32 our estimates may be conservative. On the other hand, the increase in prevalent PAD may be attributable to improved survival in people with PAD rather than an increased incidence, and thus a follow‐up investigation with contemporary data would be important. Also, we cannot deny the possibility of birth cohort effects on prevalence of PAD. Second, we could not reliably estimate lifetime risk of PAD over the age of 80 years because of sparse data in this age range in our data sets (eg, NHANES coded all ages older than 80 as age 80). Given extending life expectancy in the United States, this is another element indicating that our estimates are likely to be conservative. Third, as anticipated from the literature, 37 the mortality rate in our cohorts tended to be lower than the mortality rate from vital statistics (Table S5). However, our lifetime risk estimation is based on the mortality rate from vital statistics and relative risk from 6 US cohorts. Of note, cardiovascular relative risk of many risk factors including ABI has been shown to be often consistent regardless of the baseline risk of study populations. 8, 38 Fourth, we did not have systematic data regarding history of leg revascularization across cohorts, indicating some level of underestimation by not capturing some PAD cases with ABI > 0.90 after vascular procedures. Fifth, a few cohorts did not have granular data of smoking status. Sixth, as true for almost any diagnostic tests, ABI is validated to diagnose PAD but is not perfect (sensitivity and specificity > 90%–95% in various studies 39, 40, 41, 42). For example, a high ABI may mask PAD in some individuals. 43 Finally, although our data consisted of the 3 major racial/ethnic groups in the United States, data for other racial/ethnic groups were lacking.

### Management of peripheral arterial disease [^117TF1P6]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Peripheral arterial disease is common, but the diagnosis frequently is overlooked because of subtle physical findings and lack of classic symptoms. Screening based on the ankle brachial index using Doppler ultrasonography may be more useful than physical examination alone. Noninvasive modalities to locate lesions include magnetic resonance angiography, duplex scanning, and hemodynamic localization. Major risk factors for peripheral arterial disease are cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, older age (older than 40 years), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hyperhomocystinemia. Nonsurgical therapy for intermittent claudication involves risk-factor modification, exercise, and pharmacologic therapy. Based on available evidence, a supervised exercise program is the most effective treatment. All patients with peripheral arterial disease should undergo aggressive control of blood pressure, sugar intake, and lipid levels. All available strategies to help patients quit smoking, such as counseling and nicotine replacement, should be used. Effective drug therapies for peripheral arterial disease include aspirin (with or without dipyridamole), clopidogrel, cilostazol, and pentoxifylline.

### Prognostic value of the ankle-brachial index in elderly patients with a stable chronic cardiovascular event [^116mESsH]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Patients with polyvascular arterial disease have a greater risk of suffering a new atherothrombotic episode than those with involvement of only one vascular territory. We have studied the predictive prognostic value of the detection of non-diagnosed peripheral arterial disease, determined by measuring the ankle-brachial index in a population of elderly patients with stable chronic cardiac or cerebrovascular disease.

Methods

This was a multicenter, prospective cohort study with consecutive inclusion of patients between 65 and 85 years of age with a previous atherothrombotic event, but without previously established peripheral arterial disease.

Results

A total of 1096 patients were evaluated during 11.7 (+ or - 2.2) months of follow-up. An ankle-brachial index of < 0.9 was observed in 29.9% and > 1.4 in 6.9%. The detection of an ankle-brachial index < 0.9 was clearly associated with the presence of a combined primary event of cardiovascular death and non-fatal cardiovascular event [HR 1.99 (95% CI, 1.49–2.66; P < 0.001)]. There was also a significant relationship between ankle-brachial index > 1.4 and total (P = 0.001) or cardiovascular (P = 0.020) deaths. The predictive value of both ranges of the ankle-brachial index was maintained after adjusting for age, sex, diabetes mellitus, vascular territory, macroalbuminuria or glomerular filtration rate.

Conclusions

The detection of non-diagnosed peripheral arterial disease in patients with stable coronary or cerebrovascular events identifies a very high risk population that might benefit from more intensive treatment.

Assessment of reporting bias

Due to high levels of heterogeneity, we were not able to use a funnel plot to visually assess reporting bias. However, due to the variation in results across the included studies, we deemed the risk of reporting bias to be low.

Assessment of the certainty of evidence

We were unable to determine the certainty of evidence from pooled studies, due to the inability to perform a meta‐analysis. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence at individual study level (Table 1). The majority of studies had either low or very low certainty of evidence.

Introduction

Globally, over 200 million people live with peripheral artery disease (PAD), 1 with ≈8.5 million people affected in the United States alone. 2 The associated comorbidities and surgical procedures because of PAD result in significant cost, both in terms of quality of life and dollars. 3 Of individuals with PAD, the majority are either asymptomatic (40%) or do not exhibit classic symptoms of leg claudication (50%), leaving only 10% who exhibit classic claudication symptoms. 4, 5 Even when asymptomatic, PAD is associated with decreased functional status, mobility, and quality of life, including the inability to walk one quarter mile, climb 1 flight of stairs, or complete a 6‐minute walk. 6

In population‐based studies including those with and without PAD (ankle‐brachial index [ABI] ≤ 0.90), the ABI has been associated with measures of functional status and physical function, 7, 8, 9 as well as declines in physical function over time. 10 However, the ABI is inadequate for detecting early‐stage lower extremity atherosclerotic disease, when intervention efforts to prevent functional decline, associated comorbid conditions, and mitigate the high risk of mortality, may be most effective. By the time ABI progresses into the abnormal range (≤ 0.90), significant lower extremity disease is typically present 11 (ie, stenosis > 50%), providing less opportunity for effective intervention.

The ankle-brachial index is the ratio of the systolic blood pressure at the ankle to the systolic blood pressure at the brachial artery. It is one of the most widely available markers of atherosclerosis and least expensive to perform. In the primary care setting, it is effectively used to assess cardiovascular risk and diagnose peripheral artery disease. The American Heart Association released a scientific statement on the measurement and interpretation of ABI, including standardization of measurement technique and the threshold for diagnosing PAD. If the entire sequence of ABI measurements is repeated, then the order of measuring the four limb pressures should be reversed. The ABI should be reported separately for each leg, and should be calculated by dividing the higher of the posterior tibial or dorsalis pedis blood pressure by the higher of the right or left arm systolic blood pressure.

Recommendations for ABI Interpretation If there is clinical suspicion of PAD based on symptoms and clinical findings, ABI measurement should be the first-line noninvasive option to confirm the diagnosis. An ABI of 0. 9 or less is the threshold for confirming lower-extremity PAD. If the ABI is greater than 0. 9 but there is suspicion of PAD, postexercise ABI measurement or other noninvasive options, such as imaging, should be used. A postexercise ankle pressure decrease greater than 30 mm Hg or an ABI decrease greater than 20% may be considered a criterion for PAD. If the ABI is greater than 1. 4 but there is clinical suspicion of PAD, a toe-brachial index measurement or other noninvasive options, such as imaging, should be used. When interpreting ABI during follow-up, a decrease greater than 0. 15 can effectively detect significant PAD progression. ABI alone should not be used to monitor revascularized patients.

In asymptomatic individuals, ABI can provide incremental information beyond standard risk scores to predict future cardiovascular events. Persons who have an ABI of 0. 9 or less, or

1. 4 or greater, are at increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality, regardless of the presence of PAD symptoms or other cardiovascular risk factors. An ABI between 0. 91 and
2. 0 is considered borderline for cardiovascular risk. Additional evaluation is appropriate in these cases.
