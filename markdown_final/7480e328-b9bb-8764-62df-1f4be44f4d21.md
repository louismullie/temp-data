## Question

Slit ventricle

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about slit ventricle syndrome, including its definition, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, differential diagnosis, management strategies, and prognosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining slit ventricle syndrome and its subtypes. Then, I should verify the pathophysiological mechanisms, including overdrainage, reduced brain compliance, and craniocephalic disproportion. Next, I will review clinical manifestations and the diagnostic workup, including when to suspect SVS despite small ventricles. After that, I need to outline management options, from conservative measures to surgical alternatives like programmable valves, lumboperitoneal shunts, endoscopic third ventriculostomy, and cranial vault expansion. Finally, I should consider prognosis, prevention, and special populations, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't mislabel entities. Slit ventricle syndrome is best understood as a constellation of symptoms in chronically shunted patients with small or slit-like ventricles on imaging, often accompanied by intermittent intracranial hypertension and reduced brain compliance; it is not a single disease but a syndrome with heterogeneous mechanisms, commonly categorized into types including overdrainage, shunt obstruction with high pressure but small ventricles, craniocephalic disproportion, and headache unrelated to shunt function, which helps frame both diagnosis and treatment decisions [^150fc909] [^e6232d22].

> I need to check the pathophysiology carefully because it drives management. Chronic CSF overdrainage can collapse the ventricles and reduce compliance, while periventricular gliosis and brain stiffness may limit ventricular expansion even when intracranial pressure rises; additionally, damped CSF pulsations can impair calvarial growth, leading to craniocephalic disproportion and secondary craniosynostosis, which further elevates parenchymal pressure despite small ventricles; intriguingly, some data suggest increased cerebrovascular distensibility rather than low compliance in certain patients, underscoring heterogeneity and the need to individualize interpretation of pressure-volume relationships [^150fc909] [^3c741743] [^6d8d3bd4] [^a787284e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical features; I should verify the spectrum. Patients may present with intermittent headaches, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, and neurocognitive decline, and in severe cases, life-threatening intracranial hypertension can occur without ventricular enlargement; ophthalmic complications including optic atrophy and visual field defects have been reported, and craniofacial changes from craniosynostosis may be evident in long-standing cases, so a full neurologic and ophthalmologic exam is prudent when SVS is suspected [^e6232d22] [^90840de6] [^489f9ac6] [^6d8d3bd4].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and explicitly state the pitfalls. A high index of suspicion is required when symptoms of shunt failure coexist with small ventricles; comparison with baseline imaging is essential, and a shunt series can reveal disconnections or migrations missed on CT; ICP monitoring can document episodic hypertension despite slit ventricles, and neuroimaging should also assess for craniocephalic disproportion and suture fusion; I should double-check that normal ventricles do not exclude malfunction, as multiple reports show obstruction or disconnection with slit ventricles and elevated ICP [^cea37bdb] [^4534b771] [^60e1291a] [^90840de6].

> Let me consider the differential so I don't anchor prematurely. Migraine, tension-type headache, and other primary headache disorders can mimic SVS; medication overuse and psychiatric comorbidity are common in chronic headache populations; trapped fourth ventricle can present with posterior fossa signs and small lateral/third ventricles; and shunt infection or distal failure can produce symptoms without ventricular change, so CSF analysis and shunt tapping should be considered when appropriate [^150fc909] [^9feeeb5c] [^1b74b42b].

> I will now examine management, starting with conservative measures. Valve adjustments to higher opening pressures or activation of antisiphon mechanisms can mitigate overdrainage; programmable valves allow noninvasive titration, though I should confirm that some series show limited success in preventing slit ventricles in infants, highlighting the need for careful selection and follow-up; in select cases, home programming can be safe and feasible with appropriate education and oversight [^c7429784] [^9a4eded3].

> Wait, let me verify surgical options when conservative therapy fails. Conversion to a lumboperitoneal shunt can reduce malfunction rates and avoid repeated ventricular catheter failures in patients with slit ventricles and recurrent VP shunt issues; endoscopic third ventriculostomy with or without shunt removal is a promising path to shunt independence in carefully selected patients; and for refractory cases with craniocephalic disproportion, cranial vault expansion can restore intracranial volume, improve symptoms, and reduce shunt revisions, though it is a major procedure reserved for selected patients [^b8a9fb67] [^11af09e6] [^2fdbe682] [^31652f99] [^fbe8a26d].

> But wait, what if the ventricles are collapsed and a standard VP shunt keeps failing? I should consider alternatives. Cisterna magna–ventricle–peritoneum shunts can bypass noncompliant ventricles when LP shunts are contraindicated; neurofiberscope-guided strategies can facilitate catheter repositioning or ETV in complex ventricular anatomy; and in patients with arachnoid cysts and slit ventricles after cyst-peritoneal shunting, converting to a VP shunt with a programmable valve has been effective in small series [^3243bf06] [^2fdbe682] [^a796a8b1].

> I need to ensure I address prognosis and prevention. SVS is uncommon but consequential, with risks of visual loss, repeated surgeries, and chronic headache; early shunting and certain valve types have been associated with higher risks of slit ventricles, suggesting that modifiable factors at the time of initial shunt placement may influence long-term outcomes; antisiphon devices may reduce overdrainage and proximal obstruction in pediatric cohorts, though high-quality randomized data are limited; long-term, many patients require ongoing surveillance and occasional revisions, and a subset achieve shunt independence after ETV or LP conversion [^95513dda] [^c2d74292] [^2fdbe682] [^b8a9fb67].

> Let me reconsider special populations and nuances. Adults with longstanding shunted hydrocephalus can present with SVS and may harbor unrecognized disconnections or isolated ventricles; craniocephalic disproportion may be less prominent but still relevant; and in infants, aggressive early shunting and low-pressure systems may increase overdrainage risk, so valve selection and follow-up imaging cadence matter; in complex craniofacial contexts, coordination between neurosurgery and plastics/craniofacial teams is essential to sequence vault expansion and shunt strategies appropriately [^cea37bdb] [^95513dda] [^542d1e2b].

> In summary, I should confirm that slit ventricle syndrome reflects a heterogeneous set of mechanisms unified by small ventricles and symptomatic intracranial pressure dysregulation in shunted patients; diagnosis hinges on correlating symptoms with imaging and, when needed, ICP or shunt function studies; management is tiered from valve adjustments to alternative shunt strategies or cranial expansion; and outcomes depend on timely recognition, individualized pathophysiology-targeted therapy, and longitudinal follow-up to adapt to evolving compliance and cranial dynamics [^150fc909] [^4534b771] [^b8a9fb67] [^31652f99].

Slit ventricle syndrome (SVS) is a **complication of chronic shunting** characterized by small, slit-like ventricles with intermittent intracranial hypertension and reduced brain compliance [^150fc909]. It presents with **headaches, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances** despite minimal ventricular enlargement, often mimicking shunt malfunction [^e6232d22] [^489f9ac6]. Diagnosis relies on clinical symptoms plus MRI/CT showing slit ventricles, and may require ICP monitoring to confirm intermittent hypertension [^4534b771] [^60e1291a]. Management is **multimodal**: valve upgrades, antisiphon devices, programmable valves, lumboperitoneal shunts, or endoscopic third ventriculostomy; cranial expansion is reserved for refractory cases with craniocephalic disproportion [^b8a9fb67] [^2fdbe682] [^31652f99]. Prognosis varies: many improve with targeted therapy, but some have persistent symptoms and require repeated interventions [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology

SVS arises from **complex interactions** among chronic CSF overdrainage, reduced brain compliance, and craniocephalic disproportion:

- **Chronic CSF overdrainage**: Persistent low intracranial pressure collapses ventricles, causing ventricular wall adherence and reduced compliance [^c2d74292].

- **Reduced brain compliance**: Ventricular walls become rigid, limiting expansion despite rising ICP, leading to intermittent hypertension [^3c741743].

- **Craniocephalic disproportion**: Chronic overdrainage dampens CSF pulsations, impairing skull growth and causing secondary craniosynostosis, further increasing ICP [^6d8d3bd4].

---

## Clinical presentation

SVS typically presents with **intermittent symptoms** that correlate with episodes of elevated ICP:

- **Headaches**: Often severe, positional, and worsened by upright posture [^ca2d6e6e].

- **Nausea and vomiting**: Frequent, especially with headaches [^e6232d22].

- **Visual disturbances**: Blurred vision, diplopia, or visual field defects from papilledema or optic atrophy [^489f9ac6].

- **Neurological deficits**: Rarely, focal deficits or seizures may occur [^4534b771].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis requires a **combination of clinical, radiological, and physiological assessments**:

- **Clinical assessment**: Detailed history and neurological examination to identify intermittent symptoms and exclude other causes [^4534b771].

- **Neuroimaging**: MRI or CT shows slit-like ventricles; comparison with baseline imaging is essential [^4534b771].

- **Intracranial pressure monitoring**: Gold standard to confirm intermittent hypertension despite small ventricles [^60e1291a].

- **Shunt evaluation**: Shunt series, radionuclide shuntography, or shunt tap to assess function and exclude obstruction [^4534b771].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **individualized** based on symptoms, imaging, and ICP findings:

| **Management approach** | **Indication** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Valve upgrade or antisiphon device | Overdrainage | Upgrading to higher-pressure or antisiphon valves reduces overdrainage [^c2d74292] |
| Programmable valves | Adjustable control | Allows noninvasive pressure adjustments to balance drainage [^9a4eded3] |
| Lumboperitoneal shunt | Refractory cases | Bypasses collapsed ventricles; effective in selected patients [^b8a9fb67] |
| Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) | Obstructive hydrocephalus | Creates alternative CSF pathway; shunt-independent in some [^2fdbe682] |
| Cranial vault expansion | Craniocephalic disproportion | Increases intracranial volume; reserved for refractory cases [^31652f99] |

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies: many patients improve with targeted therapy, but some have **persistent symptoms** and require repeated interventions. Early recognition and individualized management are key to optimizing outcomes [^notfound].

---

Slit ventricle syndrome is a **chronic shunt complication** with small ventricles and intermittent hypertension; it requires a multimodal approach — valve adjustments, alternative shunts, ETV, or cranial expansion — tailored to the underlying pathophysiology and symptoms.

### Neuroimaging of ventriculoperitoneal shunt complications in children [^4534b771]. Pediatric Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The ventriculoperitoneal shunt is the mainstay of treatment for hydrocephalus. Despite its widespread use and safety record, it often malfunctions due to complications such as obstruction, breakage, migration and infection. This necessitates a systematic approach to diagnosing the etiology of shunt failure. Any evaluation should begin with an appraisal of the patient's symptoms. In acute malfunction, nausea, vomiting, irritability, seizures, headache, lethargy, coma and stupor are seen. In chronic malfunction, neuropsychological signs, feeding pattern changes, developmental delay, decline in school performance, headaches and increased head size are often seen. The next step in evaluation is a CT scan of the head to evaluate ventricular size. Prior imaging studies should be obtained for comparison; if the ventricles have enlarged over time, shunt malfunction is likely. If there is no such increase or dilation in the first place, other diagnoses are possible. However, "slit ventricle syndrome" should also be considered. When prior imaging is not available, pumping the reservoir, a radionuclide shuntogram, a shunt tap or even surgical exploration are options. The goals of this paper are to provide an algorithm for evaluating shunt malfunction and to illustrate the radiographic findings associated with shunt failure.

### Slit ventricle syndrome: a case report of intermittent intracranial hypertension [^60e1291a]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Slit ventricle syndrome is a rare condition whereby brain compliance is reduced and can be associated with intermittent intracranial hypertension. A 19-year-old male with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for congenital hydrocephalus presented with a 1-day history of headache and drowsiness-symptoms from which he suffered in many recurrent episodes over the past 5 years. The improvement of headaches without surgical intervention led to the diagnosis of migraine. During this hospitalization, episodes of intermittent intracranial hypertension were documented along with the remission and relapse of the symptoms. While the patient's intracranial pressure was within normal range in over 90% of his monitoring period, which postponed shunting, replacement of his ventriculoperitoneal shut eventually resolved his symptoms. Slit ventricle syndrome with reduced ventricular compliances should be considered in patients with clinical evidence of intermittent intracranial hypertension and small ventricular size. The authors advocate shunt replacement as an appropriate treatment for this condition.

### The role of lumbar shunts in the management of slit ventricles: does the slit-ventricle syndrome exist? [^b8a9fb67]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Object

Slit-ventricle syndrome (SVS) is a confusing description of presentations in patients with chronic shunt-treated hydrocephalus. These patients are prone to acute deterioration with recurrent malfunction. The authors describe the clinical profile and management outcome of using lumboperitoneal (LP) shunts in this population of patients.

Methods

Thirty-three patients with slit ventricles and recurrent malfunctions were converted to LP shunts (mean age 12 years). The initial ventricular shunt was placed at a mean age of 16.5 months. Ten patients had failed endoscopic third ventriculostomies prior to placement of their LP shunt. At a previous presentation, in 11 patients suspected to have SVS following revision of the shunt, intracranial pressure normalized after insertion of a contralateral shunt, suggesting that their ventricles were isolated. The rate of infection and malfunction was compared before and after conversion to an LP shunt. Twenty-seven patients were successfully converted to LP shunts. Four of the 11 patients with isolated ventricles required ventricular shunts in addition to the LP shunt. During a mean follow-up period of 16.7 months, the malfunction rate per patient decreased from 4.81 for ventriculoperitoneal shunts, prior to conversion to 1.48 after conversion to LP shunts, a statistically significant reduction (p < 0.000). No significant difference was found in the rate of shunt infections (7.1% for VP shunts and 9.6% for LP shunts, p = 0.44). No patient presented with acute symptoms following malfunction of an LP shunt or suffered from a Chiari I malformation.

Conclusions

Conversion to an LP shunt is a safe and effective procedure in patients prone to rapid decompensation and recurrent shunt malfunctions from small, slitlike ventricles. The term SVS is confusing. The condition is a manifestation of an unrecognized slitlike isolated ventricle and should be abandoned.

### Slit ventricle syndrome [^e6232d22]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Slit ventricle syndrome (SVS) is a complication after ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) or cystoperitoneal shunt(CPS), mostly due to excessive drainage of cerebrospinal. The disease is most often seen in children and has a complex pathogenesis. Clinical manifestations are mainly intermittent headache, slow refilling of the shunt reservoir, and slit-like ventricles on imaging. Surgery is the main treatment. We present a 22-year-old female patient with a previous 14-year history of CPS. The patient recently presented with typical symptoms but her ventricular morphology was normal. We performed VPS after diagnosis of SVS. After the surgery, the patient's symptoms improved and her condition was stable.

### What we don't (but should) know about hydrocephalus [^856e3d4d]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

In an effort to identify critical gaps in the prevailing knowledge of hydrocephalus, the authors formulated 10 key questions. 1) How do we define hydrocephalus? 2) How is cerebrosinal fluid (CSF) absorbed normally and what are the causes of CSF malabsorption in hydrocephalus? 3) Why do the ventricles dilate in communicating hydrocephalus? 4) What happens to the structure and function of the brain when it is compressed and stretched by the expanding ventricles? 5) What is the role of cerebrovenous pressure in hydrocephalus? 6) What causes normal-pressure hydrocephalus? 7) What causes low-pressure hydrocephalus? 8) What is the pathophysiology of slit ventricle syndrome? 9) What is the pathophysiological basis for neurological impairment in hydrocephalus, and to what extent is it reversible? 10) How is the brain of a child with hydrocephalus different from that of a young or elderly adult? Rigorous answers to these questions should lead to more effective and reliable treatments for this disorder.

### Slit-ventricle syndrome masking shunt disconnection in adulthood [^cea37bdb]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A male in his 20s was referred to the neurosurgical service with headaches, vomiting and personality changes. He had a previous history of bilateral ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts and bitemporal decompressive surgery for neonatal intraventricular haemorrhage. There were appearances of slit-ventricles on his CT head scan typically associated with adequate cerebrospinal fluid drainage and normal intracranial pressure (ICP), which ordinarily will have limited further investigation. However, an X-ray shunt series demonstrated a right shunt disconnection at the neck and ICP monitoring confirmed raised ICP with poor brain compliance. He underwent revision of the right VP shunt with distal catheter replacement. Postoperatively, his symptoms, ICP and brain compliance improved.This case highlights the value of obtaining shunt series in patients presenting with symptoms of shunt obstruction regardless of a normal CT head. It emphasises awareness of slit-ventricle syndrome in adult patients with shunts, particularly those with complex childhood hydrocephalus.

### Hypertensive slit ventricle syndrome: pseudotumor cerebri with a malfunctioning shunt? [^150fc909]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

Symptomatic shunt malfunction without ventricular enlargement is known as slit ventricle syndrome (SVS). Patients presenting with this syndrome are not a homogeneous group. Of the 5 different types classified by Rekate, Type 1 is caused by CSF overdrainage and is associated with low pressures; Types 2 and 3 are associated with shunt blockage and elevated CSF pressures; Type 4 is cephalocranial disproportion that increases brain parenchymal pressure but not CSF pressure; and Type 5 is headache unrelated to shunt function. The low and normal CSF pressure types are relatively well understood, but the high-pressure forms are more problematic. In the high-pressure forms of SVS it is said that the lack of ventricular dilation is related to a reduction in brain compliance analogous to idiopathic intracranial hypertension or pseudotumor cerebri. Despite this, there is little evidence in the literature to support this conjecture. With this in mind, 3 cases of SVS associated with elevated CSF pressure are presented. The MR venogram findings and hemodynamics of these 3 cases are shown to be identical to those of pseudotumor cerebri. A literature review indicates that an underlying venous impairment may be functioning in the patients who re-present with small ventricles following shunt malfunction.

### Slitlike ventricle syndrome: a life-threatening presentation [^90840de6]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Severely increased intracranial pressure can be life-threatening in shunted children who do not experience ventricular enlargement. This condition is termed normal ventricular hydrocephalus and represents the most severe form of slit ventricle syndrome.

Case Report

A 7-year-old girl with a repaired lumbosacral myelomeningocele and shunted at birth who presented with headache, vomiting, seizure, and deterioration of level of consciousness was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. Because her ventricles were small to slitlike on cranial computed tomographic (CT) scan, the shunt was presumed to be working. Although the cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal, she received initial empirical treatment of viral encephalitis. Twenty-four hours after admission, she evolved with apnea and bradycardia, requiring ventilatory support. Repeated CT scans were unchanged from one study to the next. After 48 hours, her condition worsened, and cerebrospinal pressure during lumbar puncture reached more than 30 mm Hg despite the serial CT scan disclosing no ventricular enlargement. She underwent a shunt revision that showed that the catheter was occluded and had adhered to the ventricular wall. The shunt was replaced, resulting in dramatic neurological improvement. This report highlights a life-threatening condition involving chronically shunted children who present severe intracranial hypertension without ventriculomegaly and may often be neglected or unrecognized by emergency physicians or general neurosurgeons.

### Pituitary enlargement in patients with cerebrospinal fluid drainage due to ventricular shunt insertion: know the condition and do not mistake for adenoma [^afd895ad]. Pituitary (2023). Medium credibility.

In sum, we showed a significant pituitary enlargement after v.-p. shunt insertion in children and adolescents in comparison to the age-related population mean. Together with the findings published in the literature we believe this enlargement to be primarily mediated by the drop in intracranial pressure after shunting, as exemplified by the radiological marker of slit ventricles. However, since this was a retrospective analysis with some patients lost to follow-up, endocrinological assessment to definitely rule out end organ failure or increased gonadotropin secretion as alternative explanations for the observed pituitary enlargement was not available in all patients. There was, however, no clinical evidence of severe untreated hypothyroidism in any of the investigated patients, that would have explained the pituitary hyperplasia that occurred in temporal relation with shunt insertion.

Next to the retrospective design and the predefined inclusion criterion of presence of slit ventricles as radiological markers of shunt overdrainage, an additional drawback of the present study is the relatively small sample size, which necessitated the calculation of normative estimates to explore pituitary parameter differences in comparison to the normal population and limits the generalizability of the present results. Future studies with larger patient samples and a prospective design, allowing for pre-post shunt comparisons and a stratification by clinical (i.e. age of shunt insertion, duration of treatment) and technical parameters (such as shunt system and valve pressure) are needed to confirm and further differentiate the present results. Moreover, it would be very interesting to investigate, whether neuroradiological aspects of shunt overdrainage such as pituitary morphology will regress after adjustment of shunt valve pressure. Already now, we can say that physicians involved in the diagnosis and therapy of patients with childhood hydrocephalus should know the potential consequences of this treatment on the pituitary gland and be aware of the entity of shunt-induced pituitary enlargement, not to be confused with pituitary adenoma.

### Surgical management of adult hydrocephalus [^2518d7fc]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

The management of adult hydrocephalus spans a broad range of disorders and ages. Modern management strategies include endoscopic and adjustable cerebrospinal fluid shunt diversionary techniques. The assessment and management of the following clinical conditions are discussed: 1) the adult patient with congenital or childhood-onset hydrocephalus, 2) adult slit ventricle syndrome, 3) multicompartmental hydrocephalus, 4) noncommunicating hydrocephalus, 5) communicating hydrocephalus, 6) normal pressure hydrocephalus, and 7) the shunted patient with headaches. The hydrodynamics of cerebrospinal fluid shunt diversion are discussed in relation to mechanisms of under- and overdrainage conditions. A rationale for the routine implementation of adjustable valves for adult patients with hydrocephalus is provided based on objective clinical and experimental data. For the condition of normal pressure hydrocephalus, recommendations are offered regarding the evaluation, surgical treatment, and postoperative management of this disorder.

### Shunt failure-the first 30 days [^bb4db95e]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Incontrovertible predictors of shunt malfunction remain elusive.

Objective

To determine predictors of shunt failure within 30 d of index surgery.

Methods

This was a single-center retrospective cohort study from January 2010 through November 2016. Using a ventricular shunt surgery research database, clinical and procedural variables were procured. An "index surgery" was defined as implantation of a new shunt or revision or augmentation of an existing shunt system. The primary outcome was shunt failure of any kind within the first 30 days of index surgery. Bivariate models were created, followed by a final multivariable logistic regression model using a backward-forward selection procedure.

Results

Our dataset contained 655 unique patients with a total of 1206 operations. The median age for the cohort at the time of first shunt surgery was 4.6 yr (range, 0-28; first and third quartile, .37 and 11.8, respectively). The 30-day failure rates were 12.4% when analyzing the first-index operation only (81/655), and 15.7% when analyzing all-index operations (189/1206). Small or slit ventricles at the time of index surgery and prior ventricular shunt operations were found to be significant covariates in both the "first-index" (P < .01 and P = .05, respectively) and "all-index" (P = .02 and P < .01, respectively) multivariable models. Intraventricular hemorrhage at the time of index surgery was an additional predictor in the all-index model (P = .01).

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that only 3 variables are predictive of 30-day shunt failure when following established variable selection procedures, 2 of which are potentially under direct control of the surgeon.

### The role of lumboperitoneal shunts in managing chronic hydrocephalus with slit ventricles [^11af09e6]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVELumboperitoneal (LP) shunts have a role not only in pseudotumor cerebri, but also in patients with slit-like ventricles who are treated with CSF shunting on a chronic basis. Hesitation to utilize LP shunts is based on previous conventional beliefs including the tendency for overdrainage, difficulties accessing the shunt to tap or revise, and risk of progressive cerebellar tonsillar herniation. The authors hypothesized that the use of horizontal-vertical (HV) valves may reduce the risk of these complications, particularly overdrainage and development of Chiari malformation.METHODSAll pediatric cases involving patients treated with an LP shunt at the Children's Hospital of Michigan were reviewed in this retrospective case series. A total of 143 patients with hydrocephalus were treated with LP shunts from 1997-2015 (follow-up range 8 months-8 years, median 4.2 years). Patients with pseudotumor cerebri underwent placement of an LP shunt as a primary procedure. In patients with slit ventricles from chronically treated hydrocephalus or repeated shunt malfunctions from proximal catheter obstruction, a lumbar drain was inserted to assess candidacy for conversion to an LP shunt. In patients who tolerated the lumbar drain and demonstrated communication of the ventricles with the spinal cisterns, treatment was converted to an LP shunt. All patients included in the series had undergone initial shunt placement between birth and age 16 years.RESULTSIn 30% of patients (n = 43), LP shunts were placed as the initial shunt treatment; in 70% (n = 100), treatment was converted to LP shunts from ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts. The patients' age at insertion of or conversion to an LP shunt ranged from 1 to 43 years (median 8.5 years). Of the patients with clear pre-LP and post-LP shunt follow-up imaging, none were found to develop an acquired Chiari malformation. In patients with pre-existing tonsillar ectopia, no progression was noted on follow-up MRIs of the brain in these patients after LP shunt insertion. In our LP shunt case series, no patient presented with acute deterioration from shunt malfunction.CONCLUSIONSConversion to an LP shunt may minimize acute deterioration from shunt malfunction and decrease morbidity of repeated procedures in patients with chronically shunt-treated hydrocephalus and small ventricles. In comparison to previously published case series of LP shunt treatment, the use of LP shunts in conjunction with HV valves may decrease the overall risk of cerebellar tonsillar herniation. The use of an LP shunt may be an alternative in the management of slit ventricles when VP shunting repeatedly fails.

### Predicting slitlike ventricles in children on the basis of baseline characteristics at the time of shunt insertion [^95513dda]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Object

Slit ventricle syndrome (SVS) is a delayed complication of shunt insertion and occurs only in children with slitlike ventricles after shunt placement. Although SVS appears to be related to early shunt placement, its predisposing factors are largely unknown.

Methods

Baseline data in 737 children who had received shunts were obtained from the databases of two previous clinical trials. Ventricular size before shunt placement and at the last routine follow up was measured using the frontooccipital horn ratio (FOHR). Ventricles with an FOHR less than or equal to 0.2 at follow up were classified as slitlike ventricles. A univariate analysis was performed on data obtained in children with more than 1 year of clinical and radiographic follow up to identify risk factors for developing slitlike ventricles. These results were entered into a multivariate analysis to identify independent predictors of slitlike ventricles. Two hundred forty-four children had more than 1 year of clinical and radiographic follow-up data. The 23 patients (9.4%) who developed slitlike ventricles had shunts inserted at a younger age (42 compared with 134 days, p = 0.09) and were more likely to have developed hydrocephalus secondary to infection (37.5%), head injury (25.0%), or aqueductal stenosis (22.2%). Slitlike ventricles were seen in 10.8% of patients with differential-pressure valves, 10.5% of patients with Delta valves, and 3.6% of patients with Orbis-Sigma valves (p = 0.007). Regression analysis supported the role of the valve type in developing slitlike ventricles.

Conclusions

Age at shunt insertion and valve type appear to be the modifiable risk factors for developing slitlike ventricles. If the authors of subsequent studies can further validate these conclusions, slow-draining valves and delayed shunt insertion might be used to decrease the incidence of slitlike ventricles and SVS.

### Analysis of therapeutic choices for slit ventricle syndrome after cyst-peritoneal shunting for temporal arachnoid cysts in children [^a796a8b1]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Object

The goal in this study was to investigate early diagnostic evidence, optimal therapeutic strategies, and prophylactic methods for slit ventricle syndrome (SVS) in patients with temporal lobe arachnoid cysts who received cyst-peritoneal (CP) shunts.

Methods

Six cases of SVS in patients with temporal lobe arachnoid cysts who received CP shunts were treated by the senior authors in 2 institutions between January 2005 and January 2009. The radiological data, treatment process, and therapeutic results were reviewed retrospectively.

Results

There were 4 boys and 2 girls, whose mean age at presentation was 4 years and 1 month. The main clinical symptoms were severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and decreasing eyesight. Radiological studies showed normal or slightly smaller than normal ventricles, and arachnoid cysts that had shrunk dramatically. The most effective treatment for SVS was to replace the original shunts with devices that had a programmable valve, or if this was unsuccessful, to replace the original shunts with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts. All symptoms in these patients disappeared, and the mean follow-up duration was 24 months.

Conclusions

The SVS presents more often in patients with hydrocephalus who undergo VP shunting. However, it is also a serious complication in patients with arachnoid cysts who receive a CP shunt. The SVS is not a single condition; rather, different pathophysiological conditions can underlie this complicated syndrome. Because there are no striking morphological changes on radiological studies of the SVS in the patients with CP shunts, it is not easy for this syndrome to be diagnosed in time and treated rationally. Misdiagnosis and delayed treatment usually occur. The use of programmable shunts or VP shunts to replace the original shunt is an optimal therapeutic choice. The use of low-pressure shunts to treat arachnoid cysts should be abandoned unless dictated by specific indications.

### Predictors of fast and ultrafast shunt failure in pediatric hydrocephalus: a hydrocephalus clinical research network study [^6e562040]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The primary objective of this study was to use the prospective Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network (HCRN) registry to determine clinical predictors of fast time to shunt failure (≤ 30 days from last revision) and ultrafast time to failure (≤ 7 days from last revision).

Methods

Revisions (including those due to infection) to permanent shunt placements that occurred between April 2008 and November 2017 for patients whose entire shunt experience was recorded in the registry were analyzed. All registry data provided at the time of initial shunt placement and subsequent revision were reviewed. Key variables analyzed included etiology of hydrocephalus, age at time of initial shunt placement, presence of slit ventricles on imaging at revision, whether the ventricles were enlarged at the time of revision, and presence of prior fast failure events. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to find key predictors of fast and ultrafast failure events.

Results

A cohort of 1030 patients with initial shunt insertions experienced a total of 1995 revisions. Of the 1978 revision events with complete records, 1216 (61.5%) shunts remained functional for more than 1 year, and 762 (38.5%) failed within 1 year of the procedure date. Of those that failed within 1 year, 423 (55.5%) failed slowly (31-365 days) and 339 (44.5%) failed fast (≤ 30 days). Of the fast failures, 131 (38.6%) were ultrafast (≤ 7 days). In the multivariable analysis specified a priori, etiology of hydrocephalus (p = 0.005) and previous failure history (p = 0.011) were independently associated with fast failure. Age at time of procedure (p = 0.042) and etiology of hydrocephalus (p = 0.004) were independently associated with ultrafast failure. These relationships in both a priori models were supported by the data-driven multivariable models as well.

Conclusions

Neither the presence of slit ventricle syndrome nor ventricular enlargement at the time of shunt failure appears to be a significant predictor of repeated, rapid shunt revisions. Age at the time of procedure, etiology of hydrocephalus, and the history of previous failure events seem to be important predictors of fast and ultrafast shunt failure. Further work is required to understand the mechanisms of these risk factors as well as mitigation strategies.

### Acute cranial decompression in Meckel-Gruber syndrome and slit-ventricle syndrome with craniocephalic disproportion [^13b4c64e]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Slit-ventricle syndrome (SVS) is characterized by headaches associated with subnormal ventricular size in patients with shunt-treated hydrocephalus. It commonly occurs in children who have had shunts placed at an early age and is diagnosed when computed tomography scans are carried out to investigate suspected shunt obstruction with an accompanying rise in intracranial pressure (ICP). Overdrainage of cerebrospinal fluid may additionally result in craniocephalic disproportion, potentially by dampening the normal expansile pulsations of the dura against the skull, which leads to craniostenosis. Management is controversial because many strategies have only short-term benefit, and surgical intervention is understandably often seen as a last resort.We present a case of a child with SVS and craniocephalic disproportion who was treated with urgent cranial expansion due to rising ICP. Intraoperative ICP monitoring demonstrates a rapid and sustained drop in ICP, and the patient made an uneventful return to his premorbid condition. We conclude that cranial vault expansion should be considered as an effective treatment for postshunt craniocephalic disproportion in patients with SVS.

### Treatment of hydrocephalus in adults by placement of an open ventricular shunt [^ac1ad17e]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Object

Ventricular shunt placement is the neurosurgical procedure most frequently associated with complications. Over the years, it has been a growing concern that the performance of most shunting devices does not conform to physiological parameters. An open ventriculoperitoneal (VP) bypass with a peritoneal catheter for which the cross-sectional internal diameter was 0.51 mm as a distinctive element for flow resistance was evaluated for use in the treatment of adult patients with hydrocephalus.

Methods

During a 2-year period, open shunts were surgically implanted in 54 adults with hydrocephalus; conventional shunts were implanted in 80 matched controls. Periodic evaluations were performed using neuroimaging studies and measures of clinical status. All patients were followed from 12 to 36 months. 18.5 +/- 4 months for patients with the open shunt and 19.1 +/- 8.1 months for controls (mean +/- standard deviation). The device continued to function in 50 patients with the open shunt (93%) and in 49 controls (61%: p < 0.001). The Evans index in patients with the open shunt was 0.33 +/- 0.09 throughout the follow up. No cases of infection, overdrainage, or slit ventricles were observed: the index in controls was 0.28 +/- 0.08; 60% of them developed slit ventricles. During the follow-up period occlusion occurred in four patients with the open shunt (7%) and in 31 controls (39%: p < 0.001).

Conclusions

The daily cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage through the open VP shunt is close to 500 ml of uninterrupted flow propelled by the hydrokinetic force generated by the combination of ventricular pressure and siphoning effect. It complies with hydrokinetic parameters imposed by a bypass connection between the ventricular and peritoneal cavities as well as with the physiological archetype of continuous flow and drainage according to CSF production. The open shunt is simple, inexpensive, and an effective treatment for hydrocephalus in adults.

### Severe intracranial hypertension in slit ventricle syndrome managed using a cisterna magna-ventricle-peritoneum shunt [^3243bf06]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Object

Severely increased intracranial pressure (ICP) can be life threatening in patients who had previously undergone shunt treatment but who do not experience ventricular enlargement. The authors analyzed the utility of placing shunts into the cisterna magna concurrently with ventricular shunts in patients who were not candidates for lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt placement.

Methods

Ten patients treated with cisterna magna-ventricle-peritoneum (CMVP) shunts for complex problems of shunt function were reviewed retrospectively. All patients had documented increases in ICP and ventricles that did not expand despite life-threatening increases (> 80 mm Hg in one case) in ICP. Between 1995 and 2003, 10 patients (four males and six females, age range 4-32 years) were identified as having life-threatening increases in ICP despite small or slit-like ventricles on imaging studies. Each episode was documented with intraparenchymal pressure monitoring. All patients had documented ventricular catheter failures at the time of the intervention, and all had undergone at least one previous attempt to treat the condition with a valve upgrade and replacement of the ventricular catheter. Three patients had achondroplasia, four had spina bifida, and three had a preexisting Chiari malformation Type I. All patients improved after the procedure, and none suffered permanent complications. For at least 48 hours after surgery, all patients underwent intraparenchymal monitoring of ICP (an intraparenchymal monitor was used that documented normal ICP).

Conclusions

The CMVP shunts are an excellent option for patients who are not candidates for LP shunts but who have high ICP and ventricles that do not enlarge at shunt failure. The ability to access the spinal fluid in the cortical subarachnoid space presumably accounts for this success.

### Sylvian aqueduct syndrome with slit ventricles in shunted hydrocephalus due to adult aqueduct stenosis [^abddbb97]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

The authors report on 3 patients who developed sylvian aqueduct syndrome (SAS) in the context of shunt dysfunction and slit ventricles. All 3 patients had received shunts for adult onset hydrocephalus due to aqueduct stenosis and were stable for years before presenting with loss of upward gaze, convergence-retraction nystagmus, and slit ventricles, all due to shunt overdrainage. All 3 improved after either shunt revision or a third ventriculostomy procedure. Although it is well known that SAS can be caused by shunt blockage producing a transtentorial pressure gradient, these cases emphasize that an identical clinical pattern can occur with a reverse transtentorial pressure gradient and slit ventricles due to shunt overdrainage. The authors propose a simple management plan for patients with shunted hydrocephalus who develop SAS.

### Pediatric hydrocephalus: systematic literature review and evidence-based guidelines. part 10: change in ventricle size as a measurement of effective treatment of hydrocephalus [^81b80b19]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Object

The objective of this systematic review is to answer the following question: Does ventricle size after treatment have a predictive value in determining the effectiveness of surgical intervention in pediatric hydrocephalus?

Methods

The US National Library of Medicine PubMed/MEDLINE database and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched using MeSH headings and key words relevant to change in ventricle size after surgical intervention for hydrocephalus in children. An evidentiary table was assembled summarizing the studies and the quality of evidence (Classes I-III).

Results

Six articles satisfied inclusion criteria for the evidentiary tables for this part of the guidelines. All were Class III retrospective studies. CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIon: There is insufficient evidence to recommend a specific change in ventricle size as a measurement of the effective treatment of hydrocephalus and as a measurement of the timing and effectiveness of treatments including ventriculoperitoneal shunts and third ventriculostomies.

Strength Of Recommendation

Level III, unclear clinical certainty.

### Shunt-dependent hydrocephalus: management style among members of the American society of pediatric neurosurgeons [^5a86b618]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE The authors conducted a survey to evaluate differences in the understanding and management of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus among members of the American Society of Pediatric Neurosurgeons (ASPN). METHODS Surveys were sent to all 204 active ASPN members in September 2014. One hundred thirty responses were received, representing a 64% response rate. Respondents were asked 13 multiple-choice and free-response questions regarding 4 fundamental problems encountered in shunted-hydrocephalus management: shunt malfunction, chronic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) overdrainage, chronic headaches, and slit ventricle syndrome (SVS). RESULTS Respondents agreed that shunt malfunction occurs most often as the result of ventricular catheter obstruction. Despite contrary evidence in the literature, most respondents (66%) also believed that choroid plexus is the tissue most often found in obstructed proximal catheters. However, free-text responses revealed that the respondents' understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of shunt obstruction was highly variable and included growth, migration, or adherence of choroid plexus, CSF debris, catheter position, inflammatory processes, and CSF overdrainage. Most respondents considered chronic CSF overdrainage to be a rare complication of shunting in their practice and reported wide variation in treatment protocols. Moreover, despite a lack of evidence in the literature, most respondents attributed chronic headaches in shunt patients to medical reasons (for example, migraines, tension). Accordingly, most respondents managed headaches with reassurance and/or referral to pain clinics. Lastly, there were variable opinions on the etiology of slit ventricle syndrome (SVS), which included early shunting, chronic overdrainage, and/or loss of brain compliance. Beyond shunt revision, respondents reported divergent SVS treatment preferences. CONCLUSIONS The survey shows that there is wide variability in the understanding and management of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus and its complications. Such discrepancies appear to be derived partly from inconsistent familiarity with existing literature but especially from a paucity of high-quality publications.

### Long-standing overt ventriculomegaly in adults (LOVA) as a distinct entity on the neurologist's differential: a narrative review [^5410c004]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS)

VPSs have also been shown to confer improvements in symptoms and radiographic features of LOVA. If not chosen as the first line of treatment, VPSs are often used in cases of ETV failure.

Oi et al attempted VPSs in 9/18 patients.These patients underwent placement of either a differential pressure valve (DPV) (initially seven patients) or a PPV (initially two patients).All seven patients with DPVs had subsequent SDHs, with two of seven patients demonstrating slit ventricle syndrome.Five of the seven DPV patients required reoperation with placement of PPVs, with one patient undergoing ETV.All PPV patients demonstrated radiographic arrest of hydrocephalus and clinical improvement.

There is always a risk of overdrainage in LOVA patients, as noted by the fact that all three patients who underwent VPS with DPVs in the Oi study developed SDHs and required reoperation.DPVs work such that the valves open when the pressure difference between the upper and lower ends of the closing mechanism exceeds the valves’ mechanical resistance. Therefore, any reduction in pressure at the lower end of the valve can lead to the valve opening at a lower ICP. This can occur even with just an upright body position, and in some cases, can lead to excessive drainage of CSF when the patient sits or stands. This accounted for why DPV patients developed SDHs and slit-ventricle syndrome requiring reoperation.Therefore, the decision on the type of valve is essential for patients undergoing shunt placement. Oi et al noted that all patients receiving a VPS with a PPV demonstrated clinical and radiographic improvement.PPVs allow for selection of the opening pressure of the shunt valve, allowing better calibration to mitigate the risk of overdrainage.

Kiefer et al also analysed gravitational shunt valves in LOVA, and found significant clinical improvements in their patient cohorts, indicating that gravitational shunts are an option after ETV failure.

Whichever shunt system is selected for LOVA patients should use a highly resistant valve. Using a PPV and setting the opening pressure to a higher threshold can potentially mitigate overdrainage and SDH or subsequent slit ventricle syndrome.

### Neurofiberscope-guided management of slit-ventricle syndrome due to shunt placement [^2fdbe682]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Object

The purpose of this study was to evaluate an original neurofiberscope-guided strategy for the management of slit-ventricle syndrome that occurs after shunt placement.

Methods

Between 1995 and 2003 15 patients with slit-ventricle syndrome (mean age 14.2 years) underwent endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and shunt removal. During the initial surgical procedure a neurofiberscope with a small outer diameter was inserted along the shunt tube into the collapsed ventricle for endoscopically controlled removal of the ventricular catheter and evaluation of brain compliance. If the latter was sufficiently preserved, primary ETV and shunt removal were performed (four cases). If brain compliance seemed to be significantly reduced, endoscopically controlled replacement of the ventricular catheter and implantation of the Codman-Hakim programmable valve shunt device were performed (11 cases). In these patients, delayed ETV and shunt removal were performed later (mean period of 16.3 months). No medical or surgical complications occurred in any case. Follow up ranged from 6 to 84 months (mean 31.1 months; median 22 months). All patients became shunt independent and 13 became symptom free. Overall, the size of the ventricles returned to normal in five cases, became slightly dilated in nine, and moderately dilated in one.

Conclusions

Neurofiberscope-guided treatment of slit-ventricle syndrome involving shunt removal and ETV appears to be beneficial; all patients in this series were symptom free and shunt independent at the end of follow up.

### GAVCA study: randomized, multicenter trial to evaluate the quality of ventricular catheter placement with a mobile health assisted guidance technique [^c891cd86]. Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

Patient Population

A total of 144 patients, including a 10% drop-out rate, had to be recruited. The patients were consecutively enrolled with the following inclusion criteria: hydrocephalic patients with indication for shunt implantation, patients with a fronto-occipital horn ratio of (FOHR) <0.5 (Figure 4), positioning of the ventricular catheter via a new brain tissue path, precoronal/frontal approach to the ventricle, and signed informed consent. The following exclusion criteria were defined: previously known uneven bone surface at the site of the approach, slit ventricles with a fronto-occipital horn width ratio (FOHWR) <0.05 (Figure 4), participation in other clinical trials with interfering endpoints, patients unable to give informed consent.

Figure 4. 
Range of ventricular width for including the patients for this study was FOHR < 0.5 and FOHWR > 0.05. The range of ventricular width is shown on representative MRIs with an FOHR of 0.47 (right) in the upper range and FOHWR 0.09 (left) in the lower range.

Data Management

For each study center, approval was obtained from the competent ethic committee. Study meetings were held at the outset and after 1 yr in order to report about the study status and clarify any open questions. Data was documented in the password-protected, online database (see Supplemental Methods, Supplemental Digital Content, for further details).

Statistical Hypothesis

The hypothesis evaluated in this study was the rate of primary, grade I catheter position in the ipsilateral ventricle (response rate) being significantly higher in the guided group than in the freehand treatment group. The intention to treat (ITT) analysis was the primary analysis (see Supplemental Methods, Supplemental Digital Content, for further details).

### Pathophysiological changes in cerebrovascular distensibility in patients undergoing chronic shunt therapy [^a787284e]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Object

Patients undergoing long-term shunt therapy following shunt malfunction often present with acute neurological deterioration, high intracranial pressure (ICP), and yet small or slit ventricles. It is believed that low brain compliance prevents ventricle enlargement in such cases. To elucidate the underlying pathophysiology, the authors estimated compliance as a function of cerebrovascular distensibility in 45 patients undergoing chronic shunt therapy.

Methods

The ICP and pressure-volume index (PVI) were measured at end-tidal CO2 of 30 mm Hg (PVI30) and 40 mm Hg (PVI40). The ventricle volume was dichotomized as slit/small/normal or dilated based on the frontooccipital horn ratio. In 18 patients PVI30 was normal (18.4 +/- 4 ml), whereas in 27 patients it was significantly elevated (45.5 +/- 14 ml). Clinical symptoms or ventricle size at presentation did not correlate with the PVI30. The ICP and PVI at end-tidal CO2 of 40 mm Hg were significantly higher than those at end-tidal CO2 of 30 mm Hg (p < 0.001 and < 0.02, respectively) suggesting an increased cerebrovascular distensibility.

Conclusions

The authors did not observe a low compliance in patients undergoing chronic shunt therapy who, at shunt malfunction, presented with a slit/small/normal ventricle; however, analysis of the findings strongly indicated that an increased cerebrovascular distensibility was present in these patients. This may explain the high ICP and acute clinical deterioration following shunt malfunction in such cases.

### Advancing treatment strategies for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review on studies comparing ventricular and lumbo-peritoneal shunts [^13cadcb2]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanical failures and revision rates

Malfunction, including occlusion, disconnection, and valve failure, is a critical concern in shunt surgery. In 2023, a systematic review by Ho et al. showed a significantly lower malfunction rate for LPS (3.99%) compared to VPS (8.31%). This likely reflects the absence of a ventricular catheter in LPS that can clog with choroid plexus or debris and the shorter length of the hardware. Ho et al. showed that across 25 included studies with 3654 patients, LPS was associated with roughly half the odds of mechanical failure compared to VPS.

However, some individual studies have reported higher revision rates with LPS. In the SINPHONI-2 trial, 7% of LPS patients required a shunt revision within 1 year versus only 1% of VPS. The authors supposed a role of the learning curve of the procedure and the need to fine-tune valve pressure settings to avoid under- or over-drainage. Consistently, it has been observed that many LPS revisions occur early, being correlated to incorrect valve pressure or catheter positioning. By comparison, long-term VPS revision rates is between 10–20% in most series. Thus, current evidence suggests no gross difference in long-term shunt survival between the two techniques, although LPS might necessitate more frequent initial adjustments or revisions to optimize function. However, anti-siphon control and newer programmable valves with siphon guards have mitigated this issue.

Factors influencing the choice of the procedure

The limited adoption of LPS in Western countries is probably due to factors such as historical preference, lower risk of displacement, concerns about CSF flow dynamics associated to LPS and surgical complications.

On the other hand, in Eastern countries, the preferable adoption of LPS is a practice dating back to the 1970 s for different reasons. Kazui et al. underlined that LPS should be the preferred option for iNPH given its minimal invasiveness, based on their controlled trial.

Therefore, nowadays the current difference stems from a greater level of experience and expertise in LPS placement in these regions.

However, the international literature supports that some patients’ factors represent the main guidance for choosing the preferred procedure. For example, severe lumbar spinal canal stenosis or prior lumbar surgery, represent strong criteria to prefer VPS over LPS. Conversely, for in patients with slit ventricles or with contraindication to cranial surgery, e.g. anticoagulation that cannot be reversed, a LPS is still preferable. Finally, another LPS advantage is the possibility to be performed in local anesthesia in elderly patients.

### Prevention of ventricular catheter obstruction and slit ventricle syndrome by the prophylactic use of the integra antisiphon device in shunt therapy for pediatric hypertensive hydrocephalus: a 25-year follow-up study [^c2d74292]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Object

This 25-year follow-up study was performed on 120 children with hypertensive hydrocephalus to evaluate the influence of the early prophylactic implantation of the Integra antisiphon device (ASD, Integra Neurosciences Ltd.) on the rate of proximal shunt obstructions and the frequency of symptomatic slit ventricle syndrome (SVS). The adaptability of the ASD to growth, proper positioning of the ASD as a necessity for its successful performance, and the 3 phases of SVS development are discussed.

Method

Since 1978, the ASD has consistently been implanted either at the time of primary shunt insertion (66 neonates, mean follow-up 11 years) or during revisions of preexisting shunts (54 children, mean follow-up 11.8 years). The complication rate among the 54 children before ASD implantation (mean follow-up 8.3 years) was compared with that among all 120 patients once an ASD had been inserted. Shunt complications were documented as ventricular catheter, distal catheter, and infectious complications.

Results

The study revealed a significant long-term reduction in ventricular catheter obstructions and hospitalizations due to intermittent intracranial hypertension symptoms (symptomatic SVS) after both primary and secondary ASD implantation. Data in the study suggest that the high rate of ventricular catheter obstruction in pediatric shunt therapy is caused by hydrostatic suction induced by differential-pressure valve shunts during mobilization of the patient and that the development of a SVS can be traced back to this constant suction, which causes chronic CSF overdrainage and ventricular noncompliance. Recurrent ventricular catheter obstruction and SVS can be prevented by prophylactic supplementation of every shunt system with an ASD.

Conclusions

To inhibit chronic hydrostatic suction, to prevent overdrainage and proximal shunt obstruction, and to avoid SVS and thus improve the patient's quality of life, the prophylactic implantation of an ASD in every pediatric hydrocephalus shunt is recommended.

### Ophthalmic complications of slit-ventricle syndrome in children [^489f9ac6]. Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To present the ophthalmic features and visual prognosis of patients with slit-ventricle syndrome (SVS).

Design

Observational case series.

Participants

Six patients diagnosed and treated with SVS at the Montreal Children's Hospital between 1985 and 1999.

Methods

Patients were included in this study if they had an appropriate ophthalmologic follow-up and if they fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of SVS based on intracranial pressure monitoring and neuroimaging studies.

Main Outcome Measures

Features studied included patients' baseline ophthalmologic evaluation, visual outcome, and neurosurgical characteristics.

Results

The follow-up ranged from 1 to 14 years. The average number of shunting procedures was 3.7. Ocular examination performed on the initial visit revealed a normal visual acuity in four patients, esotropia in three of six patients, and nystagmus in two of six patients. Cycloplegic refraction was normal in all the subjects. Initial funduscopic evaluation revealed optic atrophy in a 4-month-old infant, whereas two children developed optic atrophy later in the course of the disease. One child developed severe visual field defects. The two children with optic atrophy had moderate to severe loss of visual acuity associated with SVS.

Conclusions

A prompt recognition of patients with SVS is crucial, because these individuals are at an increased risk for significant visual loss.

### Periventricular rigidity in long-term shunt-treated hydrocephalus [^3c741743]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Object

The failure of ventricles to enlarge after acute shunt malfunction in long-term shunt-dependent patients is generally attributed to the presence of periventricular rigidity resulting from gliosis. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that periventricular rigidity is present in these patients.

Methods

Fifteen pediatric patients who presented with acute shunt malfunction were studied; slit ventricles were detected in all of these patients. Pressure measurements were recorded simultaneously in both the ventricle and the brain parenchyma during shunt revision and then repeated after bolus infusion of fluid into the ventricle. The mean intraventricular pressure (IVP) at presentation was 24.1 mm Hg (standard deviation 10 mm Hg). The mean baseline IVP after drainage of cerebrospinal fluid but prior to the infusion was 7.5 +/- 4.3 mm Hg. There was no significant difference in the increase in the IVP and the intraparenchymal pressure (IPP) after bolus infusion into the ventricle (3.6 +/- 2.4 mm Hg and 3.3 +/- 2.1 mm Hg, respectively; p = 0.39). The mean pressure volume index was 24.1 ml (standard error of the mean 4.6 ml).

Conclusions

The profile of the changes in IVP and IPP indicates that the periventricular wall does not restrict ventricular enlargement following shunt malfunction in long-term shunt-dependent patients.

### Slit-ventricle syndrome secondary to shunt-induced suture ossification [^6d8d3bd4]. Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To report five children with slit-ventricle syndrome who were found to have increased intracranial pressure despite functioning cerebrospinal fluid shunts.

Methods

Computed tomographic scans demonstrated erosion of the inner table of the cranium and sclerosis of the cranial sutures, particularly the coronal suture. Magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrated no cerebrospinal fluid over the convexities. The patients were treated with cranial expansion operations that included removal of the sclerotic sutures, which were examined histologically.

Results

Postoperatively, symptoms resolved for all children. Sutures were abnormal and contained foci of cartilage and bone within abnormally arranged fibrous tissue.

Conclusion

We postulate that chronic overdrainage of cerebrospinal fluid via shunts dampens the normal cerebral pressure waves; growth of the calvarium is thus understimulated, and this leads to ossification of the sutures, which become unable to expand to allow normal brain growth. Shunt-induced craniostenosis should be considered for children with symptoms of slit-ventricle syndrome for whom shunts are functional but intracranial pressure is increased. Cranial expansion operations may be more appropriate treatments than subtemporal decompressions for such children, given the diffuseness of the suture pathological features.

### Aesthetic cranial vault expansion in a child with slit ventricle syndrome and eumorphic face [^e4886f56]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Ventricular shunting procedures represent the classical surgical treatment for hydrocephalus. Slit ventricle syndrome (SVS) with craniocerebral disproportion (CCD) and secondary craniosynostosis (SCS) is a well-known but uncommon complication following cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting in children. Its general management includes shunt upgrade or revision, placement of anti-siphon devices, lumbo-peritoneal shunting, and endoscopic third ventriculostomy. Cranial expansion is generally considered a major procedure and is indicated when less invasive treatments fail. In these cases, SVS and associated SCS have been usually managed through anterior cranial vault expansion. This procedure aims to decrease the risk of further shunt revisions and to improve neurologic symptoms, but it takes the disadvantage of considerable iatrogenic alterations of the facial proportions. The authors report a case of a 6-year old boy with SVS and SCS, who maintained eumorphic face and was treated by an innovative post-coronal vault expansion ensuring a wide volume increase while avoiding any change of facial conformation.

### The use of noninvasive electromagnetic neuronavigation for slit ventricle syndrome and complex hydrocephalus in a pediatric population [^4438a8ea]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Object

The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the use of noninvasive electromagnetic neuronavigation in children, in particular its use in complex hydrocephalus and slit ventricle syndrome.

Methods

Prospective data was collected from all pediatric patients undergoing insertion of ventriculoperitoneal shunts using electromagnetic frameless neuronavigation from January 2006 to November 2007.

Results

Twenty-three patients fulfilled the study criteria. All ventricles were cannulated on the first pass. There were no immediate or early postprocedural complications. All but 1 patient had resolution of symptoms (mainly chronic headache) on follow-up (median 7 months, range 1-17 months). The proximal revision rate was 9% (2 of 23 patients). One patient required distal catheter revision. Infection occurred in 1 patient.

Conclusions

Electromagnetic neuronavigation using a frameless and pinless system is especially suited for pediatric patients. The authors hypothesize that successful placement of ventricular catheters will reduce morbidity and improve shunt longevity.

10. 1001/jama.
2023. 26074 Importance Age-related macular degeneration affects approximately 20 million people in the US and 196 million people worldwide. AMD is a leading cause of severe vision impairment in older people and is expected to affect approximately 288 million people worldwide by 2040. Observations Older age, genetic factors, and environmental factors, such as cigarette smoking, are associated with development of AMD. AMD occurs when extracellular deposits accumulate in the outer retina, ultimately leading to photoreceptor degeneration and loss of central vision. The late stages of AMD are characterized by outer retinal atrophy, termed geographic atrophy, or neovascularization associated with subretinal and/or intraretinal exudation, termed exudative neovascular AMD.

Long-term prospective cohort studies show a significantly higher AMD incidence in people who smoke more than 20 cigarettes per day compared with people who never smoked. AMD is diagnosed primarily with clinical examination that includes a special lens that focuses light of the slit lamp through the pupil. Exudative neovascular AMD is best identified using angiography and by optical coherence tomography. Individuals with AMD who take nutritional supplements consisting of high-dose vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, and zinc have a 20% probability to progress to late-stage AMD at 5 years vs a 28% probability for those taking a placebo. In exudative neovascular AMD, 94. 6% of patients receiving monthly intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor injections experience less than a 15-letter visual acuity loss after 12 months compared with
62. 2% receiving sham treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance The prevalence of AMD is anticipated to increase worldwide to 288 million individuals by 2040. Intravitreally administered anti-VEGF treatment is first-line therapy for exudative neovascular AMD. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### A good choice for the patients with prior failed ventriculoperitoneal shunt treatment of suprasellar arachnoid cysts: endoscopic fenestration [^000ea4c9]. Neurosurgical Review (2020). Medium credibility.

To investigate the effectiveness of endoscopic fenestration in the patients with prior failed ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt treatment of suprasellar arachnoid cysts (SACs). Between 2012 and 2018, four pediatric patients of SACs with previous failed VP shunt treatment were surgically treated using endoscopic ventriculocystocisternostomy (VCC) in our hospital. The clinical symptoms, imaging data, and surgical outcomes were collected and analyzed retrospectively. A literature review is provided with regard to the reasons of shunt failure and surgical outcome of further endoscopic fenestration in the previously reported patients of SACs with prior failed VP shunt. For the 4 cases, the initial clinical symptoms relieved or even disappeared after shunt placement, but, respectively, recurred 2, 6, 11, and 6 months later. MR scans were conducted when the clinical symptoms reappeared and showed a cyst had greatly enlarged after shunt placement. Furthermore, VP shunt-related slit ventricle was also demonstrated in 3 cases. Clinical improvement and cysts shrinkage occurred in all 4 patients after VCC. Slit ventricle and hydrocephalus were also resolved. Three patients had their shunt apparatus removed after VCC, and another patient's guardian refused to remove the shunt apparatus. Subdural hematoma occurred in one case after shunt apparatus removal. Four patients have been stable during follow-up period (mean follow-up 26.5 months). All the three patients whose VP shunt were removed were shunt independence. There were 24 patients who underwent endoscopic fenestration as an alternative to the failed VP shunt treatment in the published reports. Added our 4 patients to the published group, the effective rate of endoscopic fenestration for SACs following previous failed VP shunt treatment was approximately 93% (26/28). Of the 24 patients, the shunt apparatuses were in situ or reimplantation in 9 patients due to shunt dependence. The correction to recognize the SAC is the first condition to select the optimal management philosophy. The analysis of the series suggests endoscopic operation is still an effective and safe option in the SAC patients with previous failed VP shunt, and the shunt apparatus can be removed for some patients. The short interval time between shunt operation and endoscopic fenestration is conductive to return patients to the shunt-free state.

### The expanding role of posterior vault distraction osteogenesis in idiopathic intracranial hypertension and slit ventricle syndrome [^fbe8a26d]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The purpose of this study was to compare perioperative safety and efficacy of posterior vault distraction osteogenesis (PVDO) in patients with primary nonsynostotic cephalo-cranial disproportion, namely slit ventricle syndrome and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), to a cohort of patients with craniosynostosis (CS). A retrospective review of patients undergoing PVDO from 2009 to 2019 at our institution was performed. Craniosynostosis patients were matched by sex and age at PVDO to the nonsynostotic cohort. Operative details, perioperative outcomes, and distraction patterns were analyzed with appropriate statistics. Nine patients met inclusion criteria for the non-CS cohort. Six patients (67%) underwent PVDO for slit ventricle and the remaining 3 patients (33%) underwent PVDO for IIH. The majority of CS patients were syndromic (n=6, 67%) and had multisuture synostosis (n=7, 78%). The non-CS cohort underwent PVDO at a median 56.1months old [Q1 41.1, Q3 86.6] versus the CS cohort at 55.7months [Q1 39.6, Q3 76.0] (P=0.931). Total hospital length of stay was longer in the non-CS patients (median days 5 [Q1 4, Q3 6] versus 3 [Q1 3, Q3 4], P=0.021). Non-CS patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts had significantly less shunt operations for ICP concerns post-PVDO (median rate: 1.74/year [Q1 1.30, Q3 3.00] versus median: 0.18/year [Q1 0.0, Q3 0.7]; P=0.046). In this pilot study using PVDO to treat slit ventricle syndrome and IIH, safety appears similar to PVDO in the synostotic setting. The cohort lacks adequate follow-up to assess long term efficacy, although short-midterm follow-up demonstrates promising results with less need for shunt revision and symptomatic relief. Future studies are warranted to identify the preferred surgical approach in these complex patients.

### First-in-human endovascular treatment of hydrocephalus with a miniature biomimetic transdural shunt [^b1e113af]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Communicating hydrocephalus results from an imbalance between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production and its resorption, leading to increased intracranial pressure and ventricular dilatation. Current standard treatment of hydrocephalus remains ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt surgery first introduced over 60 years ago, requiring multiple scalp, neck, and abdominal incisions, a burr hole, and catheter traversing cortex and white matter. The hydrostatic column pressure when the patient stands upright makes VP shunts prone to a siphon effect, leading to CSF overdrainage and resulting in subdural fluid or blood collections. Despite its maturity, the VP shunt has remained largely unchanged except for development of externally adjustable valves and modifications to mitigate siphoning. These incremental developments and the introduction of antibiotic-impregnated tubing have not eliminated a risk of surgical infection of around 10% and high overall VP shunt failure rates, estimated to be between 21% and 42% by the first year following placement.A recent, National Institutes of Health-sponsored symposium noted that first-time shunts fail within 2 years at a rate of over 40%.

The shortcomings of VP shunts served as impetus to seek a less invasive alternative approach for patients with communicating hydrocephalus. A biomimetic strategy inspired an approach to replicating the function of the arachnoid granulation which passively transports CSF from the subarachnoid space to the venous sinuses with a valved micro-implant (figure 1A and B) to be positioned straddling the dura mater and enable CSF flow from a brain cistern to an adjacent draining vein.

### Effect of electromagnetic-navigated shunt placement on failure rates: a prospective multicenter study [^57807b74]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Object

As many as 40% of shunts fail in the first year, mainly due to proximal obstruction. The role of catheter position on failure rates has not been clearly demonstrated. The authors conducted a prospective cohort study of navigated shunt placement compared with standard blind shunt placement at 3 European centers to assess the effect on shunt failure rates.

Methods

All adult and pediatric patients undergoing de novo ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement were included (patients with slit ventricles were excluded). The first cohort underwent standard shunt placement using anatomical landmarks. All centers subsequently adopted electromagnetic (EM) navigation for routine shunt placements, forming the second cohort. Catheter position was graded on postoperative CT in both groups using a 3-point scale developed for this study: (1) optimal position free-floating in CSF; (2) touching choroid or ventricular wall; or (3) intraparenchymal. Episodes and type of shunt revision were recorded. Early shunt failure was defined as that occurring within 30 days of surgery. Patients with shunts were followed-up for 12 months in the standard group, for a median of 6 months in the EM-navigated group, or until shunt failure.

Results

A total of 75 patients were included in the study, 41 with standard shunts and 34 with EM-navigated shunts. Seventy-four percent of navigated shunts were Grade 1 compared with 37% of the standard shunts (p=0.001, chi-square test). There were no Grade 3 placements in the navigated group, but 8 in the standard group, and 75% of these failed. Early shunt failure occurred in 9 patients in the standard group and in 2 in the navigated group, reducing the early revision rate from 22 to 5.9% (p=0.048, Fisher exact test). Early shunt failures were due to proximal obstruction in 78% of standard shunts (7 of 9) and in 50% of EM-navigated shunts (1 of 2).

Conclusions

Noninvasive EM image guidance in shunt surgery reduces poor shunt placement, resulting in a significant decrease in the early shunt revision rate.

### Unilateral mydriasis in a child with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for obstructive hydrocephalus: a diagnostic dilemma [^df2d398f]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

BACKGROUND

Children with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt for obstructive hydrocephalus can present acutely with symptoms of shunt blockage and any delay in diagnosis results in serious complications including death. A new onset neurological sign should be investigated urgently, but being aware of potential non-serious causes could avoid unnecessary neurological interventions from a diagnostic dilemma.

### Evaluation of the ventriculocholecystic shunt-an overview of present practice in adult and pediatric hydrocephalus [^46e583ba]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

In the context of hydrocephalus, there are a multitude of therapeutic options that can be explored in order to improve patient outcomes. Although the peritoneum is the current elected clinical solution, various receptacles have been utilized when experiencing contraindications. Along with the ventriculoatrial or ventriculopleural, the ventriculocholecystic shunt was also described as an alternative. In order to make a decision on a place for drainage, the surgeon must be knowledgeable on details from modern literature. The main target of this review was to summarize the currently available information on this topic and assess the status of the gallbladder as a viable option for cerebrospinal fluid diversion.

### Transcranial color-coded Doppler ultrasonography for evaluation of children with hydrocephalus [^a16f17dc]. Neurosurgical Focus (2003). Low credibility.

Object

Hydrocephalus is a common disease process. Transcranial color-coded Doppler (TCCD) ultrasonography is an accepted noninvasive method with which to quantify intracranial blood flow in adults and children. The authors studied the applications of TCCD ultrasonography and the alterations of the flow velocity of the cerebral arteries in children with hydrocephalus.

Methods

One hundred thirty-five children were divided into three groups: Group 1 comprised 40 infants with asymptomatic hydrocephalus who had well-functioning ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts; Group 2 comprised 10 children with symptomatic hydrocephalus who had malfunctioning shunts that were replaced; and Group 3 was a control group of 85 healthy infants. All patients underwent sequential measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocities (systolic and diastolic velocities) and resistivity index (RI). One group of patients underwent functional tests (compression of the anterior fontanelle and CO2 vasoreactivity) to determine hemodynamic changes in cerebral circulation. A significant statistical change in RI measurements, end diastolic CBF velocity, and percentage of change in RI was shown in patients with malfunctioning shunts, and in infants with a well-functioning VP shunt vasomotor reactivity was severely reduced.

Conclusions

Transcranial color-coded Doppler ultrasonography can be used to perform follow-up assessments of normal and malfunctioning shunts in children with hydrocephalus; the functional tests are a noninvasive tool for evaluating the cerebral compliance and the cerebral autoregulation in infants with hydrocephalus. The autoregulatory capacity may partly or completely be lost in cases of long-term shunt-treated hydrocephalus, and loss of cerebral vasoreactivity may be responsible for long-term deficits commonly observed in children, which help explain some of symptoms related to slit ventricles.

### Management of hydrocephalus in infants by using shunts with adjustable valves [^c7429784]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Object

Previous reports suggest that the use of adjustable differential-pressure valves may improve shunt performance. The absence of a flow- or siphon-controlled mechanism, however, is a concern. The goal of this prospective study was to assess the efficacy of valve adjustments in preventing slitlike ventricles in children < 6 months old after the first shunt insertion.

Methods

A total of 15 infants < 6 months of age who were undergoing initial shunt placement were included. Imaging was performed preoperatively, at 14 days postoperatively, and every 4 weeks thereafter. Ventricle size was assessed using ultrasonography and MR imaging or cerebral CT scanning at 1 and 2 years postoperatively. Clinical follow-up duration was 24 months for all patients. Valve settings were changed by 50 mm H(2)O if ventricle size decreased by 30% compared to preoperative size.

Results

The valve pressure setting was increased to 200 mm H(2)O in 11 children within the follow-up time, whereas ventricle size decreased from 0.6 +/- 0.08 to 0.39 +/- 0.09 (frontal/occipital horn ratio, mean +/- standard deviation). There was neither clinical nor radiological evidence of underdrainage.

Conclusions

The adjustable differential-pressure valve used in this study was not effective in preventing slitlike ventricles in the majority of patients. Despite the small number of patients, this study provides a rationale for examining whether new shunt designs (gravitational shunt valves) are superior to conventional shunt systems in managing challenging hydrocephalus problems.

### Safety and efficacy of gravitational shunt valves in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a pragmatic, randomised, open label, multicentre trial (SVASONA) [^f1884d50]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate whether gravitational valves reduce the risk of overdrainage complications compared with programmable valves in ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt surgery for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH).

Background

Patients with iNPH may benefit from VP shunting but are prone to overdrainage complications during posture changes. Gravitational valves with tantalum balls are considered to reduce the risk of overdrainage but their clinical effectiveness is unclear.

Methods

We conducted a pragmatic, randomised, multicentre trial comparing gravitational with non-gravitational programmable valves in patients with iNPH eligible for VP shunting. The primary endpoint was any clinical or radiological sign (headache, nausea, vomiting, subdural effusion or slit ventricle) of overdrainage 6 months after randomisation. We also assessed disease specific instruments (Black and Kiefer Scale) and Physical and Mental Component Scores of the Short Form 12 (SF-12) generic health questionnaire.

Results

We enrolled 145 patients (mean (SD) age 71.9 (6.9) years), 137 of whom were available for endpoint analysis. After 6 months, 29 patients in the standard and five patients in the gravitational shunt group developed overdrainage (risk difference -36%, 95% CI -49% to -23%; p<0.001). This difference exceeded predetermined stopping rules and resulted in premature discontinuation of patient recruitment. Disease specific outcome scales did not differ between the groups although there was a significant advantage of the gravitational device in the SF-12 Mental Component Scores at the 6 and 12 month visits.

Conclusions

Implanting a gravitational rather than another type of valve will avoid one additional overdrainage complication in about every third patient undergoing VP shunting for iNPH.

### Safety and efficacy of gravitational shunt valves in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a pragmatic, randomised, open label, multicentre trial (SVASONA) [^338732dc]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

The Kiefer Score attempts to grade the severity of the three key symptoms of iNPH (mental deficits, gait disturbance, incontinence) and two additional minor symptoms (headache and dizziness).The overall score may reach values between 0 and 24, with higher scores indicating more severe impairment.

We also evaluated health related quality of life with the generic Short Form 12 V2.0 (SF-12) questionnaire, calculating population norm based Physical (PCS) and Mental (MCS) Component Scores.

The central coordinating unit prepared electronic case report forms (CRF) run on study specific laptop computers at the different trial sites. Two research assistants were responsible for telephone and on site monitoring of data during the study and after database closure.

The primary trial endpoint was any overdrainage complication occurring within 6 months after randomisation, as determined by local investigators. The diagnosis of overdrainage was verified by two neurosurgeons at the coordinating centre based on a consensus review of CRF entries and CT reports. Overdrainage was defined as any clinical symptom suggestive of overdrainage (headache, nausea, vomiting) requiring readjustment of the valve to a pressure of 90 mm H 2 O or more, the presence of subdural hygroma or haematoma with a thickness of at least 3 mm, a slit ventricle in CT scans or subsequent crossover from the programmable to the gravitational device.

Categorical secondary endpoints were surgical revision resulting from any cause, surgical site infections, ventriculitis and underdrainage. The latter was defined as ongoing ventricle enlargement accompanied by a secondary increase in symptoms.

Ordinal and continuous secondary endpoints included raw values and longitudinal changes in Black Scales, Kiefer Scores, SF-12 PCS and MCS, and the Evans Index.

The SVASONA trial compared approved and established devices. Adverse events and serious adverse events were recorded cumulatively and evaluated for their association with the procedure and devices under investigation by a panel of investigators at regular study meetings.

### Cranial vault expansion in the management of postshunt craniosynostosis and slit ventricle syndrome [^31652f99]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Slit ventricle syndrome and postshunt craniosynostosis are uncommon complications after shunting procedures for congenital hydrocephalus. Slit ventricle syndrome occurs as a complication in 1 to 5 percent of patients after shunting procedures for hydrocephalus during infancy. These patients usually have had a shunt in place for years, with overdrainage of cerebrospinal fluid resulting in very small ventricles. Excessive intracranial decompression may result in ventricular collapse with the formation of slit-like ventricles and cranial vault collapse with secondary craniosynostosis.

Methods

A retrospective review of 12 patients who had undergone cranial vault expansion for management of postshunt craniosynostosis and slit ventricle syndrome refractory to other treatment modalities was performed. All patients had initially been shunted for congenital hydrocephalus and subsequently underwent a mean of 4.9 shunt revisions before cranial vault expansion.

Results

All 12 patients demonstrated decreased ventricular volume, with noncompliant slit-like ventricles in nine of these patients. Five patients demonstrated pancraniosynostosis, three patients demonstrated multiple sutural fusion, and isolated sagittal synostosis occurred in two patients. Two patients appeared to have "functional" synostoses with narrowed, overlapping sutures that were not actually fused. Eleven patients underwent bilateral fronto-orbital advancement with frontotemporoparietal expansion; one patient underwent only posterior vault expansion. Seven of the 12 patients required a mean of 2.3 shunt revisions after cranial vault expansion; five patients did not require subsequent revisions. Improvement in cranial vault shape was achieved in all 12 patients, as was improvement of neurologic symptoms in nine of the 12 patients.

Conclusions

Cranial vault expansion is a useful approach in the management of the restricted cranium associated with slit ventricle syndrome and postshunt craniosynostosis. This approach resulted in a decreased need for shunt revisions and improvement of neurologic symptoms and cranial vault shape.

### Trapped fourth ventricle: to stent, shunt, or fenestrate-a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^a1ef69d9]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of findings

This study summarized evidence from 95 articles, including 465 patients. An IPD was performed to evaluate safety, efficacy, and durability of each intervention. A meta-analysis was performed on non-individual patient data from cohorts with the addition of the results of the IPD. The results of the IPD for endoscopy showed a significantly higher clinical improvement, a higher durability, and a lower revision rate, compared to shunt placement. There was no significant difference in safety outcomes between the interventions. The results of the cohort meta-analysis revealed no significant difference in revision rate between endoscopy and shunt placement, but the wide confidence intervals preclude any reasonable conclusion from being drawn.

Treatment modalities and potential biases

In this study, the different treatment modalities for TFV described in the literature were divided into four groups. The applied modifications of these techniques in the four groups might influence the safety, efficacy, and durability of these techniques (e.g. aqueductoplasty and stenting; Fig. 5). As a study by Fritsch et al. which treated a group of 18 TFV patients with either endoscopic aqueductoplasty alone or together with stenting, concluded that patients with a trapped fourth ventricle have a significant restenosis rate following aqueductoplasty. Therefore, initial stent placement is recommended by this study. As for shunt placement, a study by El Damaty et al. mentioned a decline in the occurrence of TFV over the last years of the follow-up, after the introduction of the anti-siphon device in ventriculoperitoneal shunt systems due to the marked decrease in overdrainage. As for the surgical approaches for the shunt placement, no conclusions can be drawn about their effect on the clinical outcomes of TFV patients because of a lack of data reported by the included studies. Future research should look into the possible benefits or indications for modifications of the used treatment techniques and different surgical approaches described in the current study.

Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was performed with a favorable change in the 15D score 5 years after the shunting as the dependent variable (Table 4). According to the model, younger age (adjusted OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77–0.95; p < 0.005), lower BMI (adjusted OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77–0.98; p < 0.05) and better MMSE performance (adjusted OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01–1.32; p < 0.05) before surgery predicted favorable HRQoL outcome in the 5-year follow-up. The model had an acceptable goodness-of-fit as demonstrated by the Hosmer–Lemeshow test (Table 4) and the overall percentage accuracy rate for the model was 72%. The lowest tolerance was 0.50 (age at shunting) and the highest variance inflation factor was 2.0 (age at shunting) suggesting that multicollinearity did not have a significant effect on the model.

At 5 years, 49/189 (26%) patients had experienced at least one shunt-related complication (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1), shunt infection being the most common complication (11/189, 6%). The average time from surgery to the first complication was 14 months. The setting of programmable shunt valves was adjusted at least in 101/189 (53%) of the patients. In patients needing valve adjustment, 41/101 (41%) were adjusted twice or more. On average, the first adjustment took place 9 months post-operatively. The most common reason for adjustment was persisting or re-emerging iNPH -related symptoms (77/101, 76%) and the rest were done due to overdrainage (headache, slit ventricles, conservatively manageable subdural effusion/hematoma).

XVIII. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction or superinfection—single- vs double-staged revision: We recommend that patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction be replaced in a single procedure, and when the shunt has developed a bacterial or other superinfection, we recommend that the infected shunt be removed and a replacement placed at a subsequent time as a second procedure (strong, low). In hemodynamically stable patients, lumbar puncture to assess for CM or other bacterial infection and measure opening pressure to indirectly assess shunt function is a rational approach, and a shunt tap to sample the cerebrospinal fluid for infection as well as to evaluate patency and function can be considered. In most cases, bacterial shunt infections should be treated with shunt removal and placement of an EVD until cerebrospinal fluid has been sterilized, after which a new shunt can then be placed. With organisms of low pathogenicity or if Coccidioides species is the only organism involved, a single-stage approach with simultaneous reimplantation can be considered, and for a rare complication of an isolated fourth ventricle, endoscopic aqueductoplasty, stenting of the cerebral aqueduct, or placement of a dedicated fourth ventricular shunt as part of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt system may be considered an appropriate intervention.

### Lumbocaval shunt for idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a technical report and case series [^20ef3ef4]. Neurosurgery Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

LCS has theoretical advantages over conventional shunts. Similar to LPS, the intracranial space is avoided. In our series, all patients had slit ventricles, making intracranial shunt placement more technically challenging. Moreover, ventricular collapse around the shunt catheter may be an important contributor to shunt failure in this difficult-to-manage population.Placement of the distal shunt catheter outside of the peritoneal space may also be advantageous. Physiologically, intraabdominal pressure is higher in obese patients.Because obesity is a common comorbidity associated with IIH, a diminished gradient between the intracranial pressure and intra-abdominal pressure may reduce the effectiveness of CSF drainage. This insight remains speculative because much is lacking in our understanding of the pathophysiology of IIH. Longer follow-up in a larger sample set is needed to determine where LCS fits into the treatment paradigm of IIH.

Several important technical aspects were noted from our early experience. First, the lumbar portion of the catheter is inserted at L2-3. This is done to reserve the lower lumbar levels for LP should the patient present with shunt failure symptoms. Similar to LPS, catheter migration represents a potential complication. Indeed, an early case in our series required shunt revision because of migration of the lumbar shunt into the lumbar suprafascial pocket. This led to a modification of the surgical technique in which the exiting lumbar catheter is anchored to the fascia using silicone dips. While the entirety of the procedure can be performed in a lateral decubitus position, we have chosen to perform LCS in 2 stages to minimize the risks of contamination during tunneling of the catheter and for the ease of femoral vein access and fluoroscopic confirmation of the distal catheter tip. Given that overdrainage is a common complication of LPS,the addition of a gravitational device is performed in all our IIH LCS cases to help mitigate this risk. Finally, the lumbar shunt valve and gravitational unit work best when positioned vertically. Thus, it is often helpful to note the position of the femoral vein puncture site before tunneling the catheter from the flank to the upper abdomen.

### Adjustable shunt valve reprogramming at home: safety and feasibility [^9a4eded3]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Shunt valve resistance changes using a specialized magnetic programming device permit noninvasive changes to cerebrospinal fluid drainage. In selected cases between 2001 and 2005, patients and families used shunt valve programming devices at home. This study examines the safety and efficacy of this practice.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of the medical records of patients who had been given a shunt valve-programming device for home use. A survey was mailed to patients or family members requesting information regarding their experiences with the shunt valve programming device. Patient and family responses were tabulated and a statistical analysis was performed.

Results

Twenty patients or families returned the survey. The median patient age was 19.6 years (range, 6-48 yr); 25% were male. Seventeen patients had pseudotumor cerebri, one had an arachnoid cyst, and two had slit ventricle syndrome. Fifteen patients had lumboperitoneal shunts, one had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, three had cisterna magna shunts, and one had an arachnoid cyst-to-peritoneal shunt. No adverse events were attributable to the use of the home shunt valve programmer. Thirty-five percent of respondents used the programmer at least once every week, 40% used the programmer between once a week and once a month, and 25% used the programmer less frequently than once per month. Overall, 85% of respondents reported that they benefited "very much" from the use of a home shunt valve programmer and 15% of respondents benefited "somewhat."

Conclusion

Providing shunt valve programming devices to selected patients for home use is a safe practice associated with high patient satisfaction. However, the selection of appropriate patients, comprehensive patient education, and close patient-physician communication are crucial to the success of this practice.

### Shunt-related craniocerebral disproportion: treatment with cranial vault expanding procedures [^db9e5d7e]. Neurosurgical Review (2006). Low credibility.

Two patients with intracranial arachnoid cysts, one with myelomeningocele-hydrocephalus and the other with a subdural fluid collection, were given a cerebrospinal (CSF) extracranial shunt. All four patients developed features of CSF overdrainage following shunting and were treated by cranial vault expanding procedures. Before undergoing decompressive craniotomy, the patients were treated by a variety of procedures, including changing of obstructed ventricular catheters (n=4), insertion or upgrading of programmable valves (n=3), and foramen magnum decompression (n=1). Clinical manifestations of these four patients were attributed to craniocerebral disproportion caused by chronic and progressive skull changes due to dampening of the CSF pulse pressure, which is necessary for maintaining normal cranial growth. On the basis of our previous experience with expanding craniotomies in cases of minimal forms of craniosynostosis, we treated these patients with bilateral parietal craniotomies, with satisfactory results. In conclusion, biparietal decompressive craniotomy constitutes a useful and safe procedure for relieving the clinical manifestations of some CSF overdrainage syndromes, especially in cases with slit-ventricle syndrome and craniocerebral disproportion that prove to be refractory to simpler management procedures.

### Antibiotic or silver versus standard ventriculoperitoneal shunts (BASICS): a multicentre, single-blinded, randomised trial and economic evaluation [^0e40549f]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Hydrocephalus affects one in every 500 births.It also affects children and adults of all ages and can be secondary to different causes including haemorrhage, trauma, infection, and intracranial tumours.A systematic review and meta-analysisreported the prevalence of hydrocephalus to be 88 cases in 100 000 in children (aged ≤18 years), 11 cases in 100 000 in adults (aged 19–64 years), and 175 cases in 100 000 in elderly people (≥65 years).The commonest treatment for hydrocephalus is a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, which comprises proximal (ventricular) and distal (peritoneal) silicone catheters joined by a valve to drain CSF from the ventricles into the peritoneal cavity. Insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus is one of the commonest neurosurgical procedures worldwide.Failure of this shunt due to infection occurs in 7–15% of patients.Episodes of infection have a major impact on patients and are expensive to manage, requiring prolonged hospital treatment, antibiotics, and surgery to remove the infected shunt and to place a new one once the infection has been treated. Nevertheless, a health economic analysis from a UK perspective has not been done so far. Shunt infection affects health-related quality of life, cognitive function,and survival, with the number of infections per patient throughout their lifetime being an independent predictor of death.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

In a systematic review comparing antibiotic-impregnated with standard shunts for patients with hydrocephalus, we identified only one randomised trial, one prospective cohort study, and ten retrospective studies; none were adequately powered to detect a difference in infection rates between different shunt types. There were no randomised trials of silver-impregnated versus standard shunts. Neurosurgeons were using antibiotic and silver shunts to reduce infection despite a lack of firm evidence to support this practice and increased financial cost.

Added value of this study

BASICS is, to our knowledge, the largest randomised trial evaluating infection risk of ventriculoperitoneal shunts in patients with hydrocephalus. Antibiotic shunts significantly reduce the risk of infection compared with standard shunts in patients of all ages. Silver shunts are associated with the same number of infections as standard shunts. From the perspective of the UK National Health Service health-care system, the use of antibiotic shunts saves £135 753 per infection avoided.

### Evaluation of the ventriculocholecystic shunt-an overview of present practice in adult and pediatric hydrocephalus [^49037688]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In neurosurgical literature, ventriculocholecystic shunts seem to have shown encouraging results in both adults and children. There are several case series that exhibit results comparable to ventriculoperitoneal or ventriculoatrial shunts and there are indications that they could be a feasible option in congenital plasminogen deficiency, optic chiasmal hypothalamic astrocytomas, and post-tuberculous hydrocephalus. Some authors advocate for VCS as an early alternative; however, there are many questions regarding this CSF diversion that are open and difficult to answer, mainly because of the small number of patients treated with this method up until now. VCS cannot be viewed as a first-line strategy as there are still aspects regarding indications, contraindications, and follow-up that require clarification. It is quintessential that a surgeon is faced with all the current facts before deciding to undertake such a procedure that can prove as challenging as other shunting methods. Further research with larger patient populations and with rigorous statistical parameters are necessary to establish the current role of the ventriculocholecystic shunt.

### Resident opinions on image guidance for external ventricular drain placement: a national survey [^441d859a]. Neurosurgery Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

An ideal EVD neuronavigation system would add not more than 6 minutes on average to the user's workflow. Residents of all training levels seem to prefer neuronavigation for EVD placement in complex cases of slit ventricles, rather than intraventricular hemorrhage or hydrocephalus. Future EVD neuronavigation technologies should focus on efficiency of user experience and techniques to achieve rapid registration.

### In vitro testing of explanted shunt valves in hydrocephalic patients with suspected valve malfunction [^b9bf6761]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Material and methods

We performed experimental in-vitro testing of explanted shunt valves. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (study number 10/4/17). Informed consent was obtained from each patient. Patients with suspected shunt malfunction underwent intensive diagnostic workup prior to surgery. In case of suspected underdrainage, low-dose CT-shunt-series as well as conventional contrast-enhanced shunt series failed to demonstrate radiological evidence of shunt failure (i.e. enlargement of ventricles compared to prior imaging or obstruction of the VPS), while clinical symptoms were persistent despite multiple adjustments of the respective valve. After lumbar puncture, clinical symptoms improved in all of these patients so that finally valve dysfunction was suspected. In case of suspected overdrainage, an adjustable gravitational unit was implanted, and multiple valve adjustments were performed without improvement of clinical symptoms. Radiological evidence of overdrainage (e.g. subdural hygroma, slit ventricles) has been proven in none of the patients. Furthermore, in all of the non-NPH patients, lumbar puncture was performed to assess the ICP.

Revision was indicated due to missing radiological evidence of VPS failure while clinical symptoms of shunt failure persisted although intensive shunt management was performed in all of the patients.

In all cases, intraoperative testing of the shunt components was performed. CSF flow could be seen at the distal end of the proximal catheter after disconnection from the valve in all cases. Likewise, a distal outflow of the irrigation fluid was seen when a manometer was connected to the proximal inlet of the valve. The explanted valve was then examined in our experimental set-up.

### Ventriculo-peritoneal shunting devices for hydrocephalus [^dbb9c805]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hydrocephalus is a common neurological disorder, caused by a progressive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the intracranial space that can lead to increased intracranial pressure, enlargement of the ventricles (ventriculomegaly) and, consequently, to brain damage. Ventriculo-peritoneal shunt systems are the mainstay therapy for this condition, however there are different types of shunt systems.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness and adverse effects of conventional and complex shunt devices for CSF diversion in people with hydrocephalus.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2020 Issue 2); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to February 2020); Embase (Elsevier) (1974 to February 2020); Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS) (1980 to February 2020); ClinicalTrials.gov; and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised trials of different types of ventriculo-peritoneal shunting devices for people with hydrocephalus. Primary outcomes included: treatment failure, adverse events and mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened studies for selection, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Due to the scarcity of data, we performed a Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) incorporating GRADE for the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included six studies with 962 participants assessing the effects of standard valves compared to anti-syphon valves, other types of standard valves, self-adjusting CSF flow-regulating valves and external differential programmable pressure valves. All included studies started in a hospital setting and offered ambulatory follow-up. Most studies were conducted in infants or children with hydrocephalus from diverse causes. The certainty of the evidence for most comparisons was low to very low. 1. Standard valve versus anti-syphon valve Three studies with 296 randomised participants were included under this comparison. We are uncertain about the incidence of treatment failure in participants with standard valve and anti-syphon valves (very low certainty of the evidence). The incidence of adverse events may be similar in those with standard valves (range 0 to 1.9%) and anti-syphon valves (range 0 to 2.9%) (low certainty of the evidence). Mortality may be similar in those with standard valves (0%) and anti-syphon valves (0.9%) (RD 0.01%, 95% CI -0.02% to 0.03%, low certainty of the evidence). Ventricular size and head circumference may be similar in those with standard valves and anti-syphon valves (low certainty of the evidence). None of the included studies reported the quality of life of participants. 2. Comparison between different types of standard valves Two studies with 174 randomised participants were included under this comparison. We are uncertain about the incidence of treatment failure in participants with different types of standard valves (early postoperative period: RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.27; at 12 months follow-up: RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.92, very low certainty of the evidence). None of the included studies reported adverse events beyond those included under "treatment failure". We are uncertain about the effects of different types of standard valves on mortality (range 2% to 17%, very low certainty of the evidence). The included studies did not report the effects of these interventions on quality of life, ventricular size reduction or head circumference. 3. Standard valve versus self-adjusting CSF flow-regulating valve One study with 229 randomised participants addressed this comparison. The incidence of treatment failure may be similar in those with standard valves (42.98%) and self-adjusting CSF flow-regulating valves (39.13%) (low certainty of the evidence). The incidence of adverse events may be similar in those with standard valves (range 0 to 1.9%) and those with self-adjusting CSF flow-regulating valves (range 0 to 7.2%) (low certainty of the evidence). The included study reported no deaths in either group in the postoperative period. Beyond the early postoperative period, the authors stated that nine patients died (no disaggregated data by each type of intervention was available, low certainty of the evidence). The included studies did not report the effects of these interventions on quality of life, ventricular size reduction or head circumference. 4. External differential programmable pressure valve versus non-programmable valve One study with 377 randomised participants addressed this comparison. The incidence of treatment failure may be similar in those with programmable valves (52%) and non-programmable valves (52%)  (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.24, low certainty of the evidence). The incidence of adverse events may be similar in those with programmable valves (6.19%) and non-programmable valves (6.01%) (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.15, low certainty of the evidence). The included study did not report the effect of these interventions on mortality, quality of life or head circumference. Ventricular size reduction may be similar in those with programmable valves and non-programmable valves (low certainty of the evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Standard shunt valves for hydrocephalus compared to anti-syphon or self-adjusting CSF flow-regulating valves may cause little to no difference on the main outcomes of this review, however we are very uncertain due to the low to very low certainty of evidence. Similarly, different types of standard valves and external differential programmable pressure valves versus non-programmable valves may be associated with similar outcomes. Nevertheless, this review did not include valves with the latest technology, for which we need high-quality randomised controlled trials focusing on patient-important outcomes including costs.

RESULTS

Demographics and Outcomes of the Institutional Cohort

Six patients underwent placement of LCS between October 2023 and April 2024. There were 4 females (67%). The median age was 36 years [IQR 31-43]. The median body mass index was 32 [IQR 24-49]. Symptoms described were headache in all patients and visual obscurations in 4 patients (67%). Two patients (33%) had documented papilledema. All patients had slit ventricles on computed tomography and underwent LP as part of their IIH workup. The median OP was 31 cmH 2 O [IQR 30-41]. Five of 6 patients had a previous shunt procedure, with 4 of 5 having had more than 1 shunt revision.

LCS was successfully completed in all cases without intraoperative complications. The median operative time was 88.5 minutes [IQR 79.5-158.8]. One patient developed low-pressure headaches on standing and required the addition of a gravitational unit (a SHUNTASSISTANT 2.0 Valve [Aesculap]) during the same admission. There was no bleeding complication or dislodgement from the vein. The median length of stay was 4 days [IQR 1-13 days]. The median postoperative day at discharge was 1.5 [IQR 1-6.5]. All patients were discharged home.

At the time of writing, 5 of 6 patients reported improved headaches at the last follow-up visit, with 4 of 5 patients reporting that their high-pressure headaches were completely resolved. The patient who did not have headache improvement at the last follow-up initially reported remarkable relief at the first follow-up visit, but the symptoms returned at the one-month follow-up. The median time to the last follow-up visit was 1 month [IQR 1-2 months]. During this period, 1 patient's lumbar catheter migrated into the suprafascial pocket and required revision. This led to a modification of the surgical technique in subsequent cases, specifically anchoring to the lumbar drain to the fascia using silicone dips.

Of the 2 patients with documented papilledema preoperatively, 1 did not have a neuro-ophthalmological follow-up and 1 had documented improvement in papilledema. Table details patient characteristics and outcomes.

### Innovative application of point of care ultrasound in assessing ventriculo-peritoneal shunt patency [^e3135c75]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Preliminary Ex Vivo Study

A proof-of-concept study was planned using an ex vivo model to demonstrate the feasibility of studying the flow of fluid within the shunt tube using the medium-pressure and low-pressure VP Chabra TM Slit in spring type of regular-size hydrocephalus shunt system (Surgiwear Limited) (Figure 1,). The flow rate of the fluid, normal saline in this case, showed minimal variability over 3 compressions, with almost equal volumes of saline pushed out over 10 compressions. The flow rate and volume of saline pushed out on chamber compression were nearly identical across both low- and medium-pressure VP shunts (Table 1).

Technique of POCUS Use for Patency Check

A portable multimodality ultrasound (NextGen LOGQ e Ultrasound, GE Medical Systems) was used in the study. Patients were positioned supine with their heads tilted to the side opposite the placed shunt. The shunt chamber (also called a reservoir) was localized by palpation and confirmed using a linear ultrasound probe (Linear Array: C1-5-RS). The linear probe was placed 2 cm proximal to the chamber over the tube (Figure 1 B), and the ultrasound's motion mode was activated. The chamber was then compressed, and changes in the waveform were noted in the tube. The probe was subsequently moved 2 cm distal to the shunt chamber over the tube (Figure 1 C), and waveform changes were similarly noted upon chamber compression. A spike in the waveform indicated CSF movement inside the tube, and the velocity of the CSF column motion inside the tube was recorded for both proximal and distal CSF flow upon chamber compression. No measurements were recorded while the chamber was at rest, without applying compression.

### Evaluation of the ventriculocholecystic shunt-an overview of present practice in adult and pediatric hydrocephalus [^6cf39778]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The ventriculocholecystic shunt (VCS), also called a ventriculo-gallbladder or ventriculobiliary shunt, was first designed by Smith et al. and represents one of the 36 options of receptacles that have been explored for the purpose of adult and pediatric hydrocephalus treatment. When dealing with this neurosurgical pathology, the first treatment choice of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion is the ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, but in some instances, the device is rendered unfeasible due to various complications. These clinical contraindications steer the therapeutic decision towards other anatomical sites. If the peritoneum cannot support a shunt, the atrium is considered the next viable option. This propensity of electing the ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt as a second option is not guided necessarily by a standard protocol decision, but by the surgeons’ experience in this direction. With the exception of the atrial and pleural shunts, choosing one shunt over another has never undergone a rigorous statistically significant comparison, but has been generated only through the inability of performing a previously mentioned option. The VCS has only been tested when the peritoneum, atrium, or pleura failed in delivering a suitable therapeutic response. At this point, there are no guidelines that can regard the VCS as an immediate solution after the VP shunt, despite the large amount of pertinent studies that have delineated this technique.

The target of this review is to create a full view of the situations in which the VCS has been used for the past 50 years, along with associated physiology that could make it a proper biological candidate for CSF shunting, as well as the complications that could impair its usage in the long term. The questions raised by this review are related to the usefulness of this type of shunt in modern practice aiming to explore the hypothesis that the gallbladder might be a viable cavity that can indirectly relieve intracranial pressure.

### Trapped fourth ventricle: to stent, shunt, or fenestrate-a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^31124b7e]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Endoscopy should be considered as the first-line treatment of TFV due to its superior efficacy, durability, and similar safety, compared to shunt placement and its minimally invasive nature. Microsurgery should be considered as a second treatment option, due to its similar clinical outcomes and revision rate as endoscopy, but it is more invasive in nature.

### Trapped fourth ventricle: to stent, shunt, or fenestrate-a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^d41e0d74]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Trapped or isolated fourth ventricle (TFV) is a rare but critical neurosurgical condition, mostly occurring in pediatric patients, caused by a blockage of the in- and outlets of the fourth ventricle. The purpose of this study is to review all available data on the treatment options of TFV and to compare their safety, efficacy, and durability. MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched from inception to September 13, 2022, for prospective or retrospective cohorts, case-control studies, case series or case reports, reporting detailing outcomes of TFV patients, treated with an endoscopic-, microsurgical-, shunt placement,- or hybrid approaches to TFV. All authors were contacted to provide individual patient data. Eighty-seven articles (314 patients) were included in the individual patient data meta-analysis (IPD) and 9 (151 patients) in the cohort meta-analysis. The IPD revealed that primary endoscopic (aOR 0.21; [95% CI 0.08–0.57]) and microsurgical interventions (aOR 0.21; [95% CI 0.05–0.82]) were associated with a significantly lower revision rate, compared to shunt placement, when adjusted for confounders. Endoscopy was also associated with a significantly higher rate of clinical improvement (aOR 4.56; [95% CI 1.2–18]). The meta-analysis revealed no significant difference in revision rate between the endoscopic (0.33 [95% CI 0.0–0.52]) and shunt group (0.44 [95% CI 0.0–1.0]). Endoscopy should be considered as the first-line treatment of TFV due to its superior efficacy, durability, and similar safety, compared to shunt placement and its minimally invasive nature. Microsurgery should be considered as a second treatment option, due to its similar clinical outcomes and revision rate as endoscopy, but it is more invasive in nature.

### Reframing the clinical phenotype and management of cryptococcal meningitis [^1e9d1183]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Most CM cases in people living with HIV improve with antifungal treatment±(serial) therapeutic LPs, but a proportion require CSF diversion. Historically, lumbar drain has been preferred in this subgroup as most patients require only short-term drainage for 5–10 days. There are few reports of obstructive hydrocephalus in HIV-CM, and permanent CSF diversion is rarely required. In contrast, patients with non-HIV CM have higher rates of hydrocephalus and higher odds of requiring neurosurgical intervention. The mechanisms underlying hydrocephalus in this group are poorly understood, and further work is needed to elucidate contributory host/pathogen interactions. However, in a significant number of non-HIV CM patients, hydrocephalus may arise as a result of choroid plexitis, with associated narrowing of the fourth ventricle.

In middle-income and high-income countries, shunting is performed in 15%–20% of patients with CM. Retrospective cohort studies in Thailandand the USAhave identified hydrocephalus, raised baseline CSF opening pressure and non-HIV status as factors associated with higher odds of ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion. In the US cohort, immunocompetent patients had an OR of 6.3 for ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion. Interestingly, this study found increased odds of ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion in female patients, which is supported by similar findings in a study of 50 US adults with CM (98% of whom were living with HIV).A small, older study involving 10 adults with CM suggests that ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion is safe and effective, with no seeding of cryptococcal infection to the peritoneum or bloodstream, or persistent biofilm formation provided fungicidal therapy had already been started.

### Guideline for care of patients with the diagnoses of craniosynostosis: working group on craniosynostosis [^542d1e2b]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment is only indicated in case of increased ICP or progressively increasing ventricle width. Shunt placement produces an effect counter to the 1 intended in the treatment of craniosynostosis, that is, cranial expansion. Order and timing of treatment modalities have never been systematically investigated. Renierrecommends performing cranial vault expansion first, and then to proceed to shunt placement—provided this is clinically feasible. Collmann draws the attention to the fact that ventricle width increases after each cranial vault expansion, a phenomenon which should be distinguished from genuine hydrocephalus. Shunt placement is only indicated if increased ICP should persist and papilledema, in spite of adequate cranial vault expansion, should still be present after several weeks. In view of possible dislocation of bone fragments, Collmannrecommends delaying shunt placement to at least 2 months after the cranial vault expansion.

The following alternative treatment methods for hydrocephalus are available: posterior cranial fossa decompression, Chiari I malformation decompression, and third ventriculocisternostomy. Still, posterior cranial fossa decompression does not always exert a favorable effect on hydrocephalus. Renierlabels it as a challenging intervention which should be reserved for those patients when symptoms of tonsillar herniation are evident. Ventriculocisternostomy is not mentioned in the literature for this indication. Lumboperitoneal shunt presents a risk in case of tonsillar herniation.

There are no studies on the best way to organize follow-up of hydrocephalus. In view of the specific problems it would seem advisable to consult a neurosurgeon as soon as the MRI/MR-A shows indications for progressively increasing ventricle width and in the case of persisting papilledema. The same holds true if a shunt was placed indeed, as the diagnosis of anomalous drainage can be misleading.

Conclusions

Considerations

Although there is no published evidence that shunting is counterproductive to cranial vault expansion, this is nevertheless highly likely. The consequence of this supposition is that cranial vault expansion is to be preferred during shunting in case of dilated brain ventricles with signs of increased pressure. Even if an initial cranial vault expansion has already been performed it is worth considering if a second cranial vault expansion is indicated or feasible: for example in case of skull growth retardation, persisting small cranial volume, and insufficient or cosmetically less appealing initial correction. Shunt placement should be considered only if the cranial volume has proven to be sufficient.

### Guideline for care of patients with the diagnoses of craniosynostosis: working group on craniosynostosis [^687de787]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Recommendations

Hydrocephalus should be differentiated from ventriculomegaly using serial imaging.

Magnetic resonance image-scanning before the first cranial correction is indicated for all patients with syndromic or complex craniosynostosis. Ventriculomegaly is to be monitored using MRI-scanning and sixth-monthly fundoscopy. Progressively increasing ventricle width or papilledema is managed according to a multidisciplinary treatment plan.

Shunting is counterproductive to cranial vault expansion. This is why in hydrocephalus, too, all efforts should be directed at treating increased ICP by means of cranial vault expansion. Placement of a shunt is indicated if high ICP should persist for a prolonged time (2 months) after adequate cranial vault expansion.

### Trapped fourth ventricle: to stent, shunt, or fenestrate-a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^9feeeb5c]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Trapped or isolated fourth ventricle (TFV) is a relatively rare but critical condition, which usually occurs in patients who had a history of intraventricular hemorrhage, inflammation or infection, tumor removal, and ventricular shunt placement and is heralded by delayed symptomatology after a period of relative improvement. The pathophysiology of TFV is based on the arachnoidal blockage of the in and outlets of the fourth ventricle, the aqueduct of Sylvius, and the foramina of Magendie and Luschka, respectively. Therefore, the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compresses the cerebellum and eventually the brain stem, leading to a mixed cerebellar and brainstem syndrome with potentially fatal consequences, especially if the compression affects the lower medulla.

Treatment options consist of shunt placement, endoscopic and microsurgical fenestration. By far, the most common treatment is the placement of a fourth ventricle shunt. However, this procedure carries several risks, including infection, malposition, malfunction, and brain stem lesion. In recent years, given the evolution of endoscopic approaches, several papers have been reporting cases of patients treated by endoscopic aqueductoplasty, either with or without stent placement. The purpose of these techniques is to reestablish the communication between the TFVs, and the third ventricle or the subarachnoid space, obviating the need for a fourth ventricle shunt. Microsurgical fenestration of the fourth ventricle is more invasive and carries risks associated with posterior fossa craniotomies, especially in infants.

The purpose of this article is to review all available data on endoscopic, microsurgical, and shunt placement approaches to the treatment of TFV and to perform an individual patient data meta-analysis (IPD) in order to compare the safety, efficacy, and durability of these techniques.

### Pediatric hydrocephalus: systematic literature review and evidence-based guidelines. part 9: effect of ventricular catheter entry point and position [^5b4acbb1]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Object

The objective of this guideline was to answer the following question: Do the entry point and position of the ventricular catheter have an effect on shunt function and survival?

Methods

Both the US National Library of Medicine/MEDLINE database and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were queried using MeSH headings and key words specifically chosen to identify published articles detailing the use of CSF shunts for the treatment of pediatric hydrocephalus. Articles meeting specific criteria that had been delineated a priori were then examined, and data were abstracted and compiled in evidentiary tables.

Results

The search yielded 184 abstracts, which were screened for potential relevance to the clinical question of the effect of ventricular catheter entry site on shunt survival. An initial review of the abstracts identified 14 papers that met the inclusion criteria, and these were recalled for full-text review. After review of these articles, only 4 were noted to be relevant for an analysis of the impact of entry point on shunt survival; an additional paper was retrieved during the review of full-text articles and was included as evidence to support the recommendation. The evidence included 1 Class II paper and 4 Class III papers. An evidentiary table was created including the relevant articles. CONCLUSION/RECOMMEndation: There is insufficient evidence to recommend the occipital versus frontal point of entry for the ventricular catheter; therefore, both entry points are options for the treatment of pediatric hydrocephalus.

Strength Of Recommendation

Level III, unclear degree of clinical certainty.

Extraparenchymal neurocysticercosis (Table 3)—site-directed management is outlined as follows: For intraventricular (lateral or third ventricle), removal of cysticerci by minimally invasive neuroendoscopy is preferred when feasible, and most isolated nonadherent cysts “can be cured by neuroendoscopy and do not require subsequent antiparasitic drugs or shunt therapy if all cysticerci are removed.” For intraventricular (fourth ventricle), “either endoscopic or microsurgical cystectomy is suitable, depending on the experience of the surgeon,” with approaches including suboccipital microsurgical resection or lateral–third ventricular transaqueductal/posterior endoscopic routes. When surgical removal is not feasible (e.g., adherent cyst), “CSF diversion via a ventriculoperitoneal shunt” is recommended and “CSF diversion with medical therapy is the recommended approach.” Adjuvant medical therapy is restricted: “Medical therapy should be limited to patients in whom surgery is contraindicated,” and “A CSF diversion (shunt) should always be performed prior to chemotherapy if there is hydrocephalus.” For subarachnoid disease, “Surgical management of hydrocephalus” is emphasized; “Initial management should focus on treatment of hydrocephalus. This often requires ventriculoperitoneal shunting.” Antiparasitic therapy acknowledges reduced responsiveness to standard regimens, with options including “prolonged administration of albendazole (15 mg/kg/d for months) or combination therapy with albendazole (15 mg/kg/d) plus praziquantel,” and anti-inflammatory therapy is essential: “Concomitant administration of corticosteroids with antiparasitic drugs is essential.” Additional cautions include that “Untreated hydrocephalus is a contraindication to antiparasitic therapy and needs to be treated first,” and steroid dosing guidance: “Generally, 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone or 2–4 mg/kg/day of dexamethasone are administered 3–4 days before and during antiparasitic treatment.”

### Advancing treatment strategies for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review on studies comparing ventricular and lumbo-peritoneal shunts [^0748df54]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Nearly all of the included studies did not evaluate the impact of different valve types or pressure settings on clinical outcomes between the two groups, with only one study serving as an exception. While the study provides valuable insights into the use of programmable shunts for iNPH, there are several limitations to consider. First is the lack of comparison between different programmable valves, which could provide a clearer understanding of their varying effectiveness and suitability for individual patients. Secondly, the studies did not examine the influence of puncture site (frontal vs. parietal) on patient short-and long-term outcome. These factors could influence the success of shunt surgery, and their omission limits the ability to make definitive recommendations on the best technical approach for treating iNPH.

Therefore, despite the comparable effectiveness of the methods, the issue of patient selection remains a significant challenge. The variability in selection criteria introduces a bias that can compromise the objectivity of the results, underscoring the difficulty in achieving consistent and unbiased evaluations. Finally, it is important to note that these limitations reflect the current state of the literature rather than the quality of our review. We have critically assessed and synthesized the best available evidence, despite the inherent heterogeneity and data gaps across studies. This limits the generalizability of our findings and highlights the need for further high-quality studies to strengthen the evidence base. The small number of included studies also precludes robust subgroup analyses, which would have allowed a more nuanced understanding of effect modifiers and sources of heterogeneity. As a result, our conclusions should be interpreted with caution, recognizing that they may not fully capture the variability in clinical practice or patient populations.

### Endoscopic management of hydrocephalus in pediatric patients: a review of indications, techniques, and outcomes [^1e602d28]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Although ventriculoperitoneal shunting remains the treatment of choice for many children with hydrocephalus, advances in endoscopic technology have greatly expanded the treatment options for these patients. For selected patients with obstructive hydrocephalus, endoscopic third ventriculostomy and other endoscopic techniques offer substantial advantages over shunting. As with any surgical procedure, appropriate patient selection is critical to successful outcomes. This article reviews modern endoscopic techniques available to treat hydrocephalus, with a focus on selection criteria and outcomes.

### Pediatric hydrocephalus and the primary care provider [^737ed9d6]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Hydrocephalus is a pathologic condition that results in the disruption of normal cerebrospinal fluid flow dynamics often characterized by an increase in intracranial pressure resulting in an abnormal dilation of the ventricles. The goal of this article was to provide the necessary background information to understand the pathophysiology related to hydrocephalus, recognize the presenting signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus, identify when to initiate a workup with further studies, and understand the management of pediatric patients with a new and preexisting diagnosis of hydrocephalus.

### Electromagnetic-guided neuronavigation for safe placement of intraventricular catheters in pediatric neurosurgery [^2be3080f]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Object

Ventricular catheter shunt malfunction is the most common reason for shunt revision. Optimal ventricular catheter placement can be exceedingly difficult in patients with small ventricles or abnormal ventricular anatomy. Particularly in children and in premature infants with small head size, satisfactory positioning of the ventricular catheter can be a challenge. Navigation with electromagnetic tracking technology is an attractive and innovative therapeutic option. In this study, the authors demonstrate the advantages of using this technology for shunt placement in children.

Methods

Twenty-six children ranging in age from 4 days to 14 years (mean 3.8 years) with hydrocephalus and difficult ventricular anatomy or slit ventricles underwent electromagnetic-guided neuronavigated intraventricular catheter placement in a total of 29 procedures.

Results

The single-coil technology allows one to use flexible instruments, in this case the ventricular catheter stylet, to be tracked at the tip. Head movement during the operative procedure is possible without loss of navigation precision. The intraoperative catheter placement documented by screenshots correlated exactly with the position on the postoperative CT scan. There was no need for repeated ventricular punctures. There were no operative complications. Postoperatively, all children had accurate shunt placement. The overall shunt failure rate in our group was 15%, including 3 shunt infections (after 1 month, 5 months, and 10 months) requiring operative revision and 1 distal shunt failure. There were no proximal shunt malfunctions during follow-up (mean 23.5 months).

Conclusions

The electromagnetic-guided neuronavigation system enables safe and optimal catheter placement, especially in children and premature infants, alleviating the need for repeated cannulation attempts for ventricular puncture. In contrast to stereotactic techniques and conventional neuronavigation, there is no need for sharp head fixation using a Mayfield clamp. This technique may present the possibility of reducing proximal shunt failure rates and costs for hydrocephalus treatment in this age cohort.

### Heidelberg ETV score to assess success of ETV in patients with occlusive hydrocephalus: a retrospective single-center study [^86bb48db]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obstructive hydrocephalus is caused by obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways within the ventricles. A stenosis of the narrow sylvian aqueduct, which connects the third and fourth ventricles, is the most common cause of intraventricular blockage of the CSF pathways and is responsible for up to 66% of cases of hydrocephalus in pediatric and up to 49% in adult patients. The aqueduct stenosis (AS) could be a consequence of tectal tumor, brain cysts, genetic factors such as X-linked syndrome, infections, hemorrhage, or in association with CNS malformations such as spina bifida as well as many other pathologies. However, around 75% of AS cases are idiopathic.

Endoscopic third ventriculocisternostomy (ETV) and extracranial shunt systems such as ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) are used for treating occlusive hydrocephalus. ETV has become the standard treatment for obstructive hydrocephalus and is preferred over VPS, due to its lower complication and revision rates, and higher long-term success rate. However, failure rate of ETV is not negligible and varies between 26 and 40% according to various studies. To predict which patients would benefit from ETV, Kulkarni et al. developed the ETV success score (ETVSS) which takes into account the age of patients, etiology of hydrocephalus, and whether a previous shunt system exists, without considering preoperative imaging. Additionally, the bulging of the TVF observed on preoperative MR images has been shown to be relevant in patient selection for ETV as a treatment method for occlusive hydrocephalus.

### Management of hydrocephalus in patients with leptomeningeal metastases: an ethical approach to decision-making [^6ae3aea1]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Current surgical options

Current options for management of LM-associated hydrocephalus include: (1) shunt placement; (2) repeated lumbar punctures; (3) intraventricular reservoir placement; (4) endoscopic third ventriculostomy; or (5) no intervention with focus on pain management.

CSF diversionary procedures: ventroperitoneal or lumbar shunting

VPS involves placement of a catheter in the lateral ventricle, connected into the peritoneal cavity. VPS allows for rapid normalization of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and is thus commonly employed to relieve symptoms of hydrocephalus. Table 1 depicts studies that have previously reported symptoms and outcomes for patients with leptomeningeal disease-associated HC who have undergone shunting. Overall, these retrospective series have demonstrated significant improvement in hydrocephalus-associated symptoms following VPS placement, with rates of symptom improvement ranging from 75 to > 90% (Table 1) [,,–]. Shunting has also led to marked patient improvements in performance status, with post-surgical Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) increases of 10–20 points. While it has not been standard-of-care to intervene on patients with low performance scores, the minimal published data suggests that VPS may improve quality-of-life even in patients with low KPS.

Interventions and shunt insertions.

Extraction of ventricular cysts that can safely be removed is currently the recommended treatment of choice for obstructing and most nonobstructing cysts (Table 5). In the present series, cysts were surgically removed in 14/23 (60.9%) of patients; 11/23 (47.8%) by way of a craniotomy to remove fourth ventricular cysts and 3/23 (12.5%) by endoscopy. One large third ventricular cyst, obstructing flow through the foramina of Monroe was decompressed by fenestration. Nine of 23 (39.1%) cysts, including the fenestrated cyst, were not removed and five persons required a shunt. Altogether, obstruction and/or hydrocephalus were controlled with ventriculoperitoneal shunts in 10/23 (43.5%) persons and in one patient with a ventriculostomy by way of an endoscopy. Shunts failed in 4/10 (40.0%) patients, three from secondary infection, which required one or more shunt replacements.

### Practice guideline: idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: response to shunting and predictors of response: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^d397f060]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus—research priorities: The question of the efficacy of ventricular shunting for iNPH is important, and well-designed clinical trials of ventricular shunting in patients with iNPH are clearly needed, including a control intervention, randomized assignment, treatment masking, more objective outcome measures, and a sufficiently long observation period to document the duration of any benefit. Stratification of patients on the basis of possible Alzheimer disease (AD) using advanced neuroimaging or CSF markers may provide additional insights, as may evaluation of other comorbidities and functional status. It was estimated that 8,340 patients with iNPH underwent shunting in the United States from 2003 to 2009. Because this procedure is frequently performed in countries such as the United States and newer types of shunts are more expensive, it is important to know whether shunting is effective, and properly performed studies of diagnosis, predictors, and treatment are essential.

### Imaging normal pressure hydrocephalus: theories, techniques, and challenges [^a8999cf2]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of NPH continues to provoke debate. Although guidelines and best-practice recommendations are well established, there remains a lack of consensus about the role of individual imaging modalities in characterizing specific features of the condition and predicting the success of CSF shunting. Variability of clinical presentation and imperfect responsiveness to shunting are obstacles to the application of novel imaging techniques. Few studies have sought to interpret imaging findings in the context of theories of NPH pathogenesis. In this paper, the authors discuss the major streams of thought for the evolution of NPH and the relevance of key imaging studies contributing to the understanding of the pathophysiology of this complex condition.

### Episodic ventriculomegaly due to hypernatremia mimicking shunt malfunction: case report [^24479701]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with shunted hydrocephalus presenting with altered mental status and ventriculomegaly are generally considered to be in shunt failure requiring surgical treatment. The authors describe a case of shunted hydrocephalus secondary to a disseminated neuroectodermal tumor in a pediatric patient in whom rapid fluctuations in sodium levels due to diabetes insipidus repeatedly led to significant changes in ventricle size, with invasively confirmed normal shunt function and low intracranial pressure. This clinical picture exactly mimics shunt malfunction, requires urgent nonsurgical therapy, and underscores the importance of considering serum osmolar abnormalities in the differential diagnosis for ventriculomegaly.

Recommendations

Based on our results, endoscopy should be considered as the first treatment modality due to its lower revision rate and significantly higher overall clinical improvement, compared to shunt placement. Due to its similar clinical outcomes and revision rate as endoscopy but a more invasive nature, microsurgery should be considered as a second treatment option. The outcomes on safety of the microsurgical approach should be interpreted with caution because of a high amount of missing data in this group. Shunt placement could be considered as a last resort in the treatment of TFV, as it is sensitive for severe complications and showed a higher rate of revision, compared to microsurgery and endoscopy.

No recommendations could be made about the hybrid group, due to the vast amount of different treatment combinations included and the small populations within these subgroups.

Endoscopy could even be considered as the first treatment modality in the infant (< 1 year old) population, due to its minimally invasive nature and non-inferiority to the other treatment options (Supplementary Appendix: Table 1 and Table 2). Recommendations in regard to the infant population should be interpreted with caution due to the small study population. More research should be conducted on this topic to confirm these outcomes.

This study revealed no clear contra-indications for treating TFV patients with endoscopy; however, some studies suggest that endoscopy should primarily be performed in TFV patients with a short-segment aqueductal stenosis (< 5 mm). Endoscopic intervention for TFV patients with long-segment aqueductal stenosis (> 5 mm) is potentially unsafe, because of a high risk of upper brain stem damage. In most of the articles included in this systematic review, however, no data on the extent of aqueductal stenosis was reported in patients receiving endoscopic stenting. Future research should look into the possibilities of endoscopy for treating TFV patients, pre-selected based on the extent of aqueductal stenosis.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America's clinical practice guidelines for healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis [^b9934a9f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2017—Intraventricular antimicrobial dosing and administration lists daily intraventricular doses and key administration guidance. Recommended daily doses include amikacin 5–50 mg, amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.01–0.5 mg in 2 mL of 5% dextrose in water, colistin (formulated as colistimethate sodium) 10 mg, daptomycin 2–5 mg, gentamicin 1–8 mg, polymyxin B 5 mg, quinupristin/dalfopristin 2–5 mg, tobramycin 5–20 mg, and vancomycin 5–20 mg. Antimicrobial agents administered by the intraventricular or intrathecal route should be preservative free, and when given through a ventricular drain, the drain should be clamped for 15–60 minutes before opening the drain. Combined intravenous and intraventricular use of vancomycin may improve CSF vancomycin concentrations without side effects, but use of intraventricular antimicrobial agents was not recommended in infants. One randomized, controlled trial found a 3-times higher relative risk of mortality in infants with gram-negative meningitis treated with intraventricular gentamicin plus intravenous antimicrobials compared with intravenous therapy alone, and only half of the infants in the intraventricular gentamicin group had received only 1 dose. Initial dosing based on ventricular size recommends vancomycin 5 mg for slit ventricles, 10 mg for normal-sized ventricles, and 15–20 mg for enlarged ventricles, and dosing frequency based on CSF drainage volume is once-daily if >100 mL/day, every other day if 50–100 mL/day, and every third day if <50 mL/day. Given total CSF volume in adults (~125–150 mL) versus infants (~50 mL), intraventricular doses in infants should probably be reduced by 60% or more; a CSF drug concentration obtained 24 hours after the first dose can be presumed to be the trough, and the inhibitor quotient should exceed 10–20 for consistent CSF sterilization.
