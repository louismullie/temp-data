## Question

Switch from omeprazole to pantoprazole

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about switching from omeprazole to pantoprazole, including when to switch, how to dose, what to expect, and how to monitor. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical rationale for switching. Then, I should verify pharmacologic differences that justify the switch. Next, I will review guideline-supported strategies for switching and dosing. After that, I need to check for drug–drug interactions, especially with clopidogrel. Finally, I will consider special populations, monitoring, and a practical implementation plan with safety checks and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the clinical rationale for switching from omeprazole to pantoprazole. The most compelling reason is to mitigate CYP2C19-mediated drug–drug interactions, particularly with clopidogrel, where omeprazole impairs activation and increases platelet reactivity, whereas pantoprazole has minimal CYP2C19 inhibition and preserves antiplatelet effect in randomized studies and meta-analyses, even though clinical outcome data are mixed and largely observational [^112ibKDV] [^114TLBDk] [^111qU1kL] [^114x5NK8]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — while pharmacodynamic harm is consistent, large outcome trials are limited, so I should frame this as a pharmacologically sound, guideline-aligned preference rather than a proven mortality benefit [^116YLEPg].

> I need to check other valid reasons to switch beyond clopidogrel. Omeprazole has a higher propensity for clinically meaningful CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 interactions than pantoprazole, so patients on narrow therapeutic index drugs like warfarin, diazepam, phenytoin, or methotrexate may benefit from pantoprazole to reduce interaction risk, though I should confirm each concomitant medication individually before switching [^1161VuS7] [^113P73Jd]. But wait, what if the patient has GERD refractory to omeprazole? Guidelines support switching to a different PPI as a reasonable strategy, and pantoprazole is an appropriate alternative, though potency differences are modest and patient-specific factors matter more than the specific agent in many cases [^113P73Jd] [^113P73Jd].

> Next, I should review pharmacologic differences that make pantoprazole a safer switch in polypharmacy. Pantoprazole has lower CYP2C19 affinity and less clinically relevant CYP3A4 inhibition than omeprazole, translating to fewer drug–drug interactions and less variability in exposure across CYP2C19 phenotypes, which is particularly relevant for rapid or ultrarapid metabolizers who may under-respond to omeprazole [^1161VuS7] [^113P73Jd]. Hold on, I should verify potency claims — pantoprazole is slightly less potent than omeprazole in omeprazole-equivalent models, but clinically, equivalent doses generally yield comparable symptom control, so potency differences rarely mandate dose escalation when switching [^113WZvd9] [^113vav2A].

> I will now examine guideline-supported switching strategies and dosing. For GERD, the ACG supports switching PPIs when response is suboptimal, and AGA best practice advises reassessing after 4–8 weeks, then either doubling the dose or switching to a different PPI if symptoms persist, using the lowest effective dose long term [^112ZuRta] [^114c52tD]. Wait, let me verify the dose mapping — standard omeprazole 20 mg once daily maps to pantoprazole 40 mg once daily, and if already on omeprazole 40 mg once daily, pantoprazole 40 mg once daily is generally sufficient, with escalation to 40 mg twice daily only if symptoms remain uncontrolled after optimizing timing and adherence [^111fWdus] [^113WZvd9]. I should confirm timing — take pantoprazole 30–60 minutes before breakfast for once-daily dosing, and before breakfast and dinner if twice daily, to maximize acid suppression [^113WZvd9].

> Let me consider the clopidogrel interaction specifically, since this is the most evidence-rich scenario. Multiple randomized crossover studies show omeprazole increases platelet reactivity and nonresponder rates, whereas pantoprazole does not, supporting a switch to pantoprazole when PPI gastroprotection is needed in dual antiplatelet therapy [^112ibKDV] [^114TLBDk] [^111qU1kL]. I should double-check the clinical outcome data — observational meta-analyses and the prematurely stopped COGENT RCT suggest no clear increase in thrombotic events with omeprazole, but given the pharmacodynamic signal and guideline caution, pantoprazole remains the preferred PPI when clopidogrel is co-prescribed, especially in high-risk cardiovascular patients [^116YLEPg] [^114x5NK8].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and formulation considerations. In hepatic impairment, no dose adjustment is routinely required for pantoprazole, though I should monitor for adverse effects in severe liver disease. In renal impairment, no adjustment is needed for pantoprazole, which is convenient in multimorbidity [^113syATz]. For patients who cannot take oral therapy, pantoprazole is available intravenously with 1:1 oral-to-IV conversion for acid suppression, facilitating seamless transitions in the hospital setting [^1155wfiL] [^1149AB2i]. For older adults on long-term PPIs, I need to ensure indication review and consider de-prescribing if no valid indication exists, balancing risks and benefits in shared decision-making [^115VgCy6].

> Next, I should review what to expect after switching. Clinically, most patients experience comparable symptom control when switching from omeprazole to pantoprazole at equivalent doses, though a minority may need dose escalation or a second daily dose if symptoms persist despite optimal timing and adherence [^113WZvd9] [^116wxLyh]. Wait, let me verify rebound risk — abrupt PPI discontinuation can precipitate transient rebound acid hypersecretion, so if stopping omeprazole, tapering or bridging strategies can mitigate symptoms, though evidence for rebound is stronger in healthy volunteers than in patients, and guidelines still support switching without a mandatory taper in most cases [^112ZuRta] [^114STQkr].

> I need to ensure a safe monitoring plan. I should reassess symptoms 4–8 weeks after the switch, confirm adherence to pre-meal dosing, and review all concomitant medications for CYP2C19 interactions. If GERD symptoms are refractory, I should consider CYP2C19 phenotype testing and adjust therapy accordingly, recognizing evidence quality is limited but expert guidance supports this approach in selected patients [^114c52tD] [^114U64R6]. For patients on clopidogrel, I should consider platelet function testing if high on-treatment platelet reactivity is suspected, acknowledging that routine testing is not mandated and clinical judgment prevails [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize a practical implementation plan. First, confirm the indication for PPI therapy and document the reason for switching, especially clopidogrel co-therapy or interaction risk. Second, convert omeprazole 20 mg daily to pantoprazole 40 mg daily, or omeprazole 40 mg daily to pantoprazole 40 mg daily, with the option to escalate to 40 mg twice daily if symptoms persist after 4–8 weeks. Third, educate on pre-meal timing and adherence. Fourth, reconcile medications and flag CYP2C19 substrates for monitoring. Fifth, schedule follow-up at 4–8 weeks to assess efficacy and tolerability, and adjust the plan based on response and patient preferences [^112ZuRta] [^114c52tD] [^111fWdus].

> Finally, I should confirm safety counseling and documentation. I will counsel that pantoprazole has a favorable interaction profile but is not interaction-free, so new medications should be reviewed for compatibility. I will document the rationale for switching, the target dose, and the follow-up plan, and I will discuss the possibility of step-down or de-prescribing if the indication resolves, aligning with guideline emphasis on using the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary duration [^112ZuRta] [^115VgCy6].

Switching from omeprazole to pantoprazole is **clinically appropriate** when there is a need to reduce CYP2C19 drug interactions, especially with clopidogrel, or when omeprazole is not tolerated or ineffective [^112ZuRta] [^113WZvd9]. Pantoprazole and omeprazole have similar efficacy for GERD and peptic ulcer disease, so dose-for-dose switching is reasonable: omeprazole 20 mg daily to pantoprazole 40 mg daily, or omeprazole 40 mg daily to pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily if needed [^116renMv] [^111fWdus]. No taper is required, but monitor for rebound symptoms after stopping omeprazole and adjust pantoprazole dosing based on response [^112ZuRta] [^114STQkr].

---

## Clinical rationale for switching

Key reasons to switch from omeprazole to pantoprazole include:

- **CYP2C19 interactions**: Omeprazole inhibits CYP2C19, reducing clopidogrel activation and increasing cardiovascular risk; pantoprazole has minimal CYP2C19 inhibition and is preferred with clopidogrel [^112ibKDV] [^114TLBDk] [^111qU1kL].

- **Tolerability**: Switching PPIs can improve tolerability if omeprazole causes side effects (e.g. headache, diarrhea) [^113btZcj].

- **Efficacy**: If omeprazole is ineffective, switching to pantoprazole may improve symptom control [^112ZuRta] [^113WZvd9].

---

## Pharmacological differences relevant to switching

| **Parameter** | **Omeprazole** | **Pantoprazole** |
|-|-|-|
| CYP2C19 inhibition | Strong | Minimal |
| Drug interactions | Higher risk | Lower risk |
| Clinical efficacy | Similar | Similar |
| Formulations | Oral | Oral, IV |

---

## Recommended dosing strategy

- **Standard switch**: Omeprazole 20 mg daily → pantoprazole 40 mg daily [^116renMv] [^111fWdus].

- **High-dose switch**: Omeprazole 40 mg daily → pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily if needed [^111fWdus].

- **Timing**: Take pantoprazole 30–60 minutes before a meal for optimal acid suppression [^113WZvd9] [^111fWdus].

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety considerations

- **Efficacy**: Pantoprazole and omeprazole have similar efficacy for GERD and peptic ulcer disease [^114vcss9] [^111NYjMY].

- **Safety**: Pantoprazole has fewer CYP2C19 interactions, reducing adverse cardiovascular effects with clopidogrel [^112ibKDV] [^114TLBDk].

- **Long-term use**: Pantoprazole is safe for long-term use, with a modest increase in enteric infections noted in large trials [^116xEDfX].

---

## Potential challenges and mitigation strategies

- **Rebound symptoms**: Abrupt omeprazole cessation can cause rebound acid hypersecretion; consider tapering or adding an H2RA short term if needed [^112ZuRta] [^114STQkr].

- **Patient education**: Explain the reason for switching and proper dosing to ensure adherence [^111zeLSJ].

- **Monitoring**: Reassess symptoms 4–8 weeks after switching and adjust dosing as needed [^114c52tD].

---

## Special populations and considerations

In hepatic impairment, **no dose adjustment** is needed for pantoprazole [^notfound]. In renal impairment, **no dose adjustment** is required either [^116kpnbW]. During pregnancy, pantoprazole is **Category B** and is generally considered safe when clinically indicated. In pediatrics, pantoprazole is approved for children ≥ 5 years, with dosing by weight [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Indications**: Switch for CYP2C19 interactions, tolerability, or efficacy.

- **Dosing**: Omeprazole 20 mg → pantoprazole 40 mg daily; omeprazole 40 mg → pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily if needed.

- **Timing**: Take 30–60 minutes before a meal.

- **Monitoring**: Reassess at 4–8 weeks; taper omeprazole if rebound symptoms occur [^112ZuRta] [^114STQkr].

---

Switching from omeprazole to pantoprazole is **straightforward and safe**, with similar efficacy and fewer drug interactions. Use a dose-for-dose approach, monitor for rebound, and tailor to patient response.

Proton pump inhibitor dosing and potency — enteric-coated proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) control intragastric pH best when given before meals, specifically "30–60 minutes before breakfast for once-daily dosing and 30–60 minutes before breakfast and dinner for twice-daily dosing", and "Bedtime dosing is discouraged". Relative antisecretory potency differs across agents, with "pantoprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, esomeprazole, and rabeprazole" estimated at "0.23, 0.9, 1.00, 1.60, and 1.82 OEs, respectively". For persistent symptoms, switching PPIs is reasonable, and in a randomized study of patients on lansoprazole 30 mg once daily, "double the dose of lansoprazole" vs "switch to esomeprazole 40 mg once daily" were "equally effective", with "approximately 55%" in each arm improving; an omeprazole–sodium bicarbonate bedtime formulation "provides good control of intragastric pH in the first 4 hours of sleep".

### A pharmacoeconomic comparison of the efficacy and costs of pantoprazole and omeprazole for the treatment of peptic ulcer or gastroesophageal reflux disease in the Netherlands [^115tFrZ3]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The focus of treatment of patients with peptic ulcer or gastroesuphageal reflux disease has changed during the last 15 years, with a shift from histamine2-receptor antagonists to proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). From 1993 to 2000, expenditures for omeprazole (90% of total market share of PPIs) increased in The Netherlands from 68 million euros to 230 million euros. In 1999, expenditures for pantoprazole accounted for the majority of the rest of the market share for PPIs.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and costs of treatment with pantoprazole and omeprazole in The Netherlands.

Methods

First, we reviewed clinical studies that compared the efficacy of different dosages of omeprazole and pantoprazole. Second, we analyzed data from a nationwide database of drug prescriptions to determine the dosages used in daily practice in 1999. The data were based on a representative sample of approximately 40% of the Dutch community pharmacies. Third, we modeled the outcome of potential substitution of pantoprazole for omeprazole and the corresponding scenarios for nationwide cost savings using the prescription information from the nationwide database. Potential savings within the Dutch health care system were estimated.

Results

The 1999 prescription data indicated that pantoprazole treatment cost a mean 1.59 euros/d, compared with 2.12 euros/d for omeprazole (1.00 euro = 1.0487 US dollars). The mean cost per defined daily dose of omeprazole was 1.65 euros, compared with 1.59 euros for pantoprazole. Following the summary of product characteristics, treatment with pantoprazole appeared to be less costly for all indications. The projected annual cost savings for substituting pantoprazole for omeprazole on 90% of treatment days were estimated at 40.8 million euros. However, these projected savings may be offset by the costs of switching and the costs of upward dose adjustments that some patients may require.

Conclusions

Based on the available documentation about effectiveness and costs of omeprazole and pantoprazole, pantoprazole may provide a more favorable pharmacoeconomic profile than omeprazole. However, this is only true if the substitution of omeprazole by pantoprazole can be achieved without loss of efficacy or tolerability.

### Switching between intravenous and oral pantoprazole [^116X9ab3]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective antisecretory drugs available for controlling gastric acid acidity and volume. They are the drugs of choice in the treatment of moderate-to-severe gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypersecretory disorders, and peptic ulcers. Currently in the United States, they are only available in an oral formulation. However, pantoprazole will soon be available in an intravenous formulation and will extend the power of PPIs to inpatient hospital settings. Intravenous pantoprazole has been shown to be effective and safe in clinical trials. Intravenous pantoprazole is indicated for the treatment of patients who require PPI therapy but who are unable to take oral medication. Intravenous pantoprazole has been shown to maintain acid suppression in patients switched from oral PPIs, so no change in dosage is required when switching from one formulation to the other. Potential hospital-based uses for intravenous PPI therapy include perioperative use as prophylaxis for acid aspiration syndrome during induction of anesthesia, prophylaxis for stress-related mucosal disease, and management of gastrointestinal bleeding from stress or acid peptic disease.

### Individual proton pump inhibitors and outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease on dual antiplatelet therapy: a systematic review [^116YLEPg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

At present, very little randomized controlled trial evidence is available to answer this question. Smaller randomized controlled trials have been performed with pantoprazole 18 and omeprazole, 19 evaluating platelet reactivity and function as end points. These studies showed that platelet reactivity is higher in patients on concomitant clopidogrel and omeprazole therapy compared with those on clopidogrel alone or those on clopidogrel and concomitant pantoprazole; however, none of these studies were large enough or adequately powered to study clinical outcomes. The COGENT trial was designed to evaluate the effect of omeprazole versus placebo on thrombotic and bleeding outcomes in patients prescribed DAPT with clopidogrel for at least 12 months. 20 The trial enrolled only patients who were expected to receive at least 12 months of DAPT (with clopidogrel) and were not currently taking PPIs, H2 receptor antagonists, or other antacid GI agents. Unfortunately, the trial was stopped prematurely due to slow enrollment and lack of funding, but with the limited sample size and follow‐up available, patients taking omeprazole and DAPT versus those on DAPT alone had a similar risk of thrombotic events and a significantly decreased risk of GI bleeding. To date, these data represent the best available on the relationship between an individual PPI and adverse CV outcomes in patients with CAD. Despite these findings, the US Food and Drug Administration still issued a warning about the combination of omeprazole or esomeprazole with clopidogrel based on observational data.

When few randomized controlled trial data are available, researchers will often try to combine the best sources of data available to reach conclusions. Systematic reviews with meta‐analysis enable researchers and clinicians to use the findings across multiple studies and to increase power to answer important clinical questions. The results of our systematic review are consistent with a previous randomized controlled study 20 indicating that omeprazole is not associated with adverse CV events in patients with CAD on concomitant clopidogrel. For the remaining individual PPIs, including pantoprazole, lansoprazole, and esomeprazole, our observational results add to previous literature but are strictly hypothesis generating and point to the need for more randomized controlled trial evidence evaluating the efficacy and safety of these PPIs in patients with CAD on concomitant clopidogrel. There is currently no solid evidence to prompt the change of an individual PPI therapy to another to avoid interaction with clopidogrel. At this time, due to inconsistencies in the available data, consideration should be given to changing the guidelines to reflect this uncertainty.

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113btZcj]. Gastroenterology (2008). Medium credibility.

GERD — antisecretory drug selection and on-demand therapy highlights that circumstances in which one antisecretory drug might be preferable to another primarily relate to side effects or when the onset of effect is a prime consideration. The most common side effects of PPIs are headache, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain, and switching among alternative PPI drugs or to a lower dose can usually circumvent these side effects. For on-demand use, if a patient intends to take a drug only in response to symptoms, then it should be a rapidly acting drug, and the most rapidly acting agents are antacids, the efficacy of which can be sustained by combining them with an H2RA or a PPI.

### Pantoprazole sodium injection (Pantoprazole sodium) [^1118mANZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage for GERD Associated with a History of EE

Adult Patients

The recommended adult dosage of pantoprazole sodium for injection is 40 mg once daily by intravenous injection (over at least 2 minutes) or intravenous infusion (for 15 minutes) for up to 10 days. Discontinue pantoprazole sodium for injection as soon as the patient is able to tolerate oral treatment. Switch to an appropriate oral medication within 10 days of starting pantoprazole sodium for injection.

Pediatric use information is approved for Pfizer Inc.'s PROTONIX® I.V. (pantoprazole sodium) for Injection. However, due to Pfizer Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information.

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Pathological Hypersecretion Including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome

The recommended adult dosage of pantoprazole sodium for injection is 80 mg every 12 hours by intravenous injection (over at least 2 minutes) or intravenous infusion (for 15 minutes).
Adjust the frequency of dosing to individual patient needs based on acid output measurements. In those patients who need a higher dosage, 80 mg intravenously every 8 hours is expected to maintain acid output below 10 mEq/h.
When switching between intravenous to oral formulations of gastric acid inhibitors, consider the pharmacodynamic action of the drugs to ensure continuity of acid suppression.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^113vav2A]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

It is worth mentioning that currently available PPI regimens do not provide the same control of intragastric pH, evaluated both in terms of mean pH over the 24 hours and percentage of time spent at pH > 4. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in patients with GERD or taking NSAIDs. A large meta-analysis, including 57 studies measuring intragastric pH after different PPI regimens, found that the relative potencies of the five compounds, compared to omeprazole, were 0.23, 0.90, 1.60, and 1.82 for pantoprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, and rabeprazole, respectively. This lack of pharmacodynamic equivalence should be taken into account when switching from a given PPI to another.

PPIs are effective in obtaining symptom relief in both erosive and non-erosive disease. Their efficacy for the relief of regurgitation is, however, modest and considerably lower than that achieved for heartburn. The myth that PPIs are less effective in NERD has recently been dispelled by a meta-analysis showing that, when a functional investigation (pH-metry or pH-impedance recording) is added to a negative endoscopy to objectively confirm this condition, the estimated complete symptom response rate after PPI therapy is comparable to that observed in patients with erosive disease.

### AGA clinical practice update on the personalized approach to the evaluation and management of GERD: expert review [^113ZvqX9]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

GERD conclusion — For patients presenting with GERD symptoms, a stepwise diagnostic approach will identify mechanisms driving symptoms for a precision management approach. Patients should receive education on GERD pathophysiology and lifestyle modifications, and be involved in a shared decision-making model. A 4- to 8-week trial of single-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is considered safe and appropriate for patients with typical reflux symptoms and no alarm symptoms, with escalation to twice-a-day dosing or switching to a more potent acid suppressive agent if symptoms persist.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^1154uo8c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori — genotype-guided acid suppression selection and dosing: The guideline states, "we do not advocate testing for CYP2C19 genotype" solely to select acid suppression; for patients known to have rapid or ultrarapid genotypes, "we suggest esomeprazole or rabeprazole as the preferred PPI", and "if a different PPI is used, an increase in dose is suggested", with "an approved PCAB-based regimen" also appropriate; CPIC 2021 recommends increasing the starting daily dose by 100% (ultrarapid) or 50%–100% (rapid) if omeprazole, lansoprazole, or pantoprazole is chosen, with alternatives including esomeprazole or rabeprazole or selecting a PCAB "as they are not metabolized by CYP2C19".

### Interchangeable use of proton pump inhibitors based on relative potency [^116wxLyh]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Although proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used, their relative potency and ideal dosing regimens remain unclear. We analyzed data from randomized clinical trials that performed pH testing in patients receiving solid-dose PPI formulations (omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole) for a minimum of 5 days. We used omeprazole equivalency and the surrogate biomarker, percentage time pH > 4 over a 24-hour period (pH4time), to compare PPI effectiveness for different PPIs given once, twice, or 3 times daily. We found that increasing strength of once-daily PPIs (9–64 mg omeprazole equivalents) increased pH4time linearly from approximately 10.0 to 15.6 hours; higher doses produced no further increase in pH4time. Increasing the frequency to twice-daily PPI increased pH4time linearly, from approximately 15.8 to 21.0 hours. Three-times daily PPIs performed similarly to twice-daily PPIs. The costs of PPIs varied greatly, but the cost variation was not directly related to potency. We conclude that PPIs can be used interchangeably based on potency. Using twice-daily PPIs is more effective in increasing efficacy increasing once-daily PPI dosage. Omeprazole and lansoprazole (30 mg) and 20 mg of esomeprazole rabeprazole are functionally equivalent.

### AGA clinical practice update on the personalized approach to the evaluation and management of GERD: expert review [^114QP5yk]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) trial — best practice advice, clinicians should provide patients presenting with troublesome heartburn, regurgitation, and/or non-cardiac chest pain without alarm symptoms a 4- to 8-week trial of single-dose PPI therapy (BPA 4). Patients should be counseled to take the PPI 30 to 60 minutes prior to a meal. Education on literature emphasizing safety of PPIs for the treatment of GERD should be provided (BPA 3). Patient symptoms should be reassessed after a 4- to 8-week trial. With inadequate response, dosing can be increased to twice a day or switched to a more effective acid suppressive agent once a day (BPA 4). These can include PPIs that are more potent, less metabolized through the CYP2C19 pathway (eg, rabeprazole, esomeprazole), or available in an extended release formulation (eg, dexlansoprazole), as well as potassium competitive acid blockers when available. Routine re-evaluation of the treatment should be performed, and the PPI should be tapered to the lowest effective dose when there is adequate response (BPA 4) (Figure 1).

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^113xcsf1]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite PPIs carrying – like any other classes of drugs – some risks, they should not be denied to patients who are likely to benefit from them merely because of concerns about putative adverse effects. There is generally some equivalence between the acceptable burden of adverse effects and the severity of the illness being treated. However, patients with acid-related diseases are often otherwise "healthy" subjects, who take drugs for a given condition. What level of undesirable effects would be acceptable for them and who will bear the cost of treating any ensuing iatrogenic disease? A number of simple and potentially effective preventive measures should be recommended for some (if not all) safety concerns in order to minimize them.

First of all, PPI therapy should be evidence based. Decisions on whether or not to initiate or continue PPI therapy should be sound and PPIs should only be prescribed when there is an appropriate clinical indication. Clinical guidelines can certainly help. In this Position Paper, we have reviewed the current available guidelines, together with the systematic reviews and meta-analyses used to generate them, and synthesized the knowledge in a number of statements (i.e. Summaries of the current evidence) and in Table 3.

Table 3
Current indications of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy

Guidelines rely on both evidence and expert opinion; they are neither infallible nor a substitute for clinical judgment. They do, however, go beyond systematic reviews to recommend what should and should not be done in specific clinical circumstances. Despite guidelines being developed to improve quality of care received by patients, they have been criticized for recommending too little or too much, and even for providing reasons for national health systems or insurance payers to deny coverage. Guidelines are often inflexible and can actually harm by leaving insufficient room for clinicians to tailor care to individual patient circumstances and medical history. What is best for patients overall, as recommended by guidelines, may be inappropriate for individuals. Only evidence-based recommendations, which consider the balance between benefits and harms, and weigh these considerations using patient (rather than expert and societal) value, should be followed in everyday clinical practice. Taking these considerations into account, we have tried to distill the current evidence and provide physicians with clear patient-oriented recommendations, beyond cost and reimbursement issues. Medicine is a rapidly evolving field, however, and the validity of guidelines will not necessarily stand the test of time: indeed, today's assumptions may no longer be valid tomorrow. Healthcare providers should therefore stay tuned and constantly update their knowledge.

### All PPIs equivalent for treatment of GERD… [^114vcss9]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: Is there any difference between proton pump inhibitors for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Setting: Various Study Design: Meta-analysis. No difference was found for the following comparisons: pantoprazole 40 mg versus omeprazole 20 mg; pantoprazole 20 mg versus omeprazole 20 mg; lansoprazole 30 mg versus. omeprazole 20 mg; lansoprazole 15 mg versus omeprazole 20 mg; lansoprazole 30 mg versus omeprazole 40 mg; lansoprazole 30 mg versus pantoprazole 40 mg; rabeprazole 20 mg versus omeprazole 20 mg; rabeprazole 10 mg versus omeprazole 20 mg; and omeprazole 20 mg versus esomeprazole 20 mg. Only one comparison found a statistically significant difference between groups in the treatment of GERD: esomeprazole 40 mg versus omeprazole 20 mg.

However, as noted above, a comparison in 1, 306 patients of equivalent doses of 20 mg esomeprazole versus 20 mg omeprazole found no difference in endoscopic healing. The response rates for omeprazole 20 mg in the two studies comparing it with esomeprazole 40 mg were 65 and 67 percent — considerably lower than in other comparisons looking at this dose, in which the success rate was between 70 and 91 percent. This would make esomeprazole look more effective in comparison. Although this comparison has never been made directly, it seems highly likely that 40 mg omeprazole would be similar in effectiveness to 40 mg of esomeprazole. Bottom Line: There is no significant difference between equivalent doses of PPIs, including equivalent doses of esomeprazole and omeprazole. The decision to choose one over another should be based first on cost and second on individual patient response.

### When is proton pump inhibitor use appropriate? [^115fXd7s]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, Scarpignato et al. should be commended for this remarkable effort. In addition to the major points detailed above, there are numerous pearls pertinent to comparative PPI pharmacology and metabolism contained within the text. However, the overwhelming message is that the problem with PPIs is that they are good, very good. Consequently, there are a lot of valid indications for their use. However, clinicians cannot be complacent, thinking that the overwhelming efficacy of the drugs in the treatment of peptic esophagitis and ulcer disease will be matched in all other putative applications. Decisions to start, properly dose, continue, or discontinue PPI therapy should be personalized based on indication, effectiveness, patient preferences, and risk assessment. Guidelines are important, but they should not be inflexible. Clinicians need flexibility to tailor therapy to specific patient circumstances and experience. Only then does one achieve the optimal balance between risk and benefit.

ASGE GERD — patient values and preferences indicate that patients prioritize symptom control and can consider PPI reduction with clinician guidance. Patients value symptom control highly and worry about symptoms returning if the PPI is reduced. Patients are encouraged to consider reducing their PPI if a clinician provides advice and education. This review concluded that weaning and/or cessation of PPI is a preference-sensitive decision; therefore, patient attitudes should be elicited and incorporated into the decision-making process.

### Patient journey in erosive oesophagitis: real-world perspectives from US physicians and patients [^115DZLfe]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Treatment patterns

In the physician survey, omeprazole was the preferred first-line treatment option (60.8% of GIs and 56.4% of FPs/GPs), while pantoprazole was preferred as the second-line option (29.4% and 32.9%, respectively) (figure 1). In terms of first-line therapy, price (55.5%) and coverage by insurance (55.5%) were key drivers for choice of omeprazole, while coverage by insurance, price, and familiarity were key drivers for pantoprazole (52.0%, 50.0%, and 48.0%, respectively) (figure 2).

### Platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel in patients treated with omeprazole, pantoprazole, and famotidine: a prospective, randomized, crossover study [^114TLBDk]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Concerns about an inhibitory effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on clopidogrel metabolism have been raised. Because the pharmacological effect of clopidogrel is dependent on genetically determined activity of the hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes system, it is important to examine the interaction between different PPIs and high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) after controlling for genetic variability. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of 2 PPIs and a histamine-2 (H2) receptor-blocker on platelet reactivity in a crossover trial where each patient was alternately treated with each drug.

Hypothesis

Omeprazole reduces HPR more than other PPI or H2 blockers.

Methods

Patients treated with aspirin and clopidogrel for at least 1 month were assigned to 3 consecutive 1-month treatment periods during which they were treated with each of the 3 study medications twice daily: omeprazole 20 mg, famotidine 40 mg, and pantoprazole 20 mg. At the end of each treatment phase, platelet function was evaluated with the Verify Now system using 2 cutoff values (> 208 P2Y12 reaction units [PRUs] and > 230 PRUs) for the definition of HPR.

Results

Patients with HPR were older than those without HPR (62 ± 10 vs 55 ± 8 years, respectively, P = 0.03). HPR was more prevalent during omeprazole therapy compared to famotidine or pantoprazole (48%, 33%, and 31%, respectively, for the 208 PRU cutoff, P = 0.04; and 37%, 17%, and 23%, respectively, for the 230 PRU cutoff, P = 0.003).

Conclusions

After eliminating the effects of interindividual variability in clopidogrel metabolism, omeprazole therapy was associated with substantially more HPR than famotidine or pantoprazole.

Proton pump inhibitor hypersensitivity — Many patients with hypersensitivity to a PPI can tolerate an alternative PPI, and skin testing (usually to the culprit PPI, and to at least 1 other PPI) followed by oral challenge can identify candidate alternates; a successful desensitization protocol to omeprazole in the context of immediate IgE-mediated hypersensitivity has been published.

### Intragastric acidity after switching from 5-day treatment with intravenous pantoprazole 40 mg / D to 5-day treatment with oral esomeprazole 40 mg / D or pantoprazole 40 mg / D: an open-label crossover study in healthy adult volunteers [^112JBiq6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

After a course of IV proton pump inhibitor therapy, patients might require continued oral antisecretory therapy. A direct comparison of therapeutic alternatives could assist physicians in decisions regarding optimal acid-suppressive therapy. Oral esomeprazole might control intragastric acidity more effectively compared with other acid-suppressive agents after IV therapy.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare intragastric acid control on day 5 of administration of esomeprazole magnesium versus pantoprazole 40 mg PO QD after switching from 5 days of treatment with pantoprazole 40 mg IV in healthy volunteers.

Methods

This randomized, open-label, comparative, 2-way crossover study was conducted at the Oklahoma Foundation for Digestive Research, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, between October and December 2004. Healthy, Helicobacter pylori-negative adults were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dosing sequences: pantoprazole IV followed by esomeprazole PO or pantoprazole IV followed by pantoprazole PO. All study medications were administered for 5 days at a dose of 40 mg QD. IV pantoprazole was administered over 2 minutes; all medications were administered 30 minutes before breakfast. There was a 10- to 21-day washout period between each 10-day dosing period. All doses were administered at the study site. Before oral study drug administration on days 1 and 5, 24-hour pH monitoring was performed using a pH catheter positioned 10 cm distal to the lower esophageal sphincter in the stomach. The primary end point was percentage of time with pH > 4 (%t pH > 4) during the 24-hour pH-monitoring period. Tolerability was assessed using spontaneous reporting, laboratory analysis, and vital-sign measurement.

Results

Of 42 subjects randomized to treatment sequences, 4 were withdrawn during the study because of invalid pH data; 38 subjects (24 men, 14 women; mean [SD] age, 25.2 [8.1] years) had assessable data. Day-5%t pH > 4 was 68.5% with esomeprazole and 53.3% with pantoprazole (P < 0.001). Day-1%t pH > 4 was 62.5% with esomeprazole and 51.0% with pantoprazole (P < 0.001). The most common adverse events were rhinitis (2 subjects each with pantoprazole IV and PO; 1 subject with esomeprazole) and headache (2 subjects with esomeprazole; 1 subject with pantoprazole IV).

Conclusions

The results of this study in healthy adult volunteers suggest that switching from pantoprazole 40 mg IV to esomeprazole 40 mg PO QD more effectively suppresses intragastric acid compared with switching from pantoprazole 40 mg IV to pantoprazole 40 mg PO QD. All 3 treatments were well tolerated.

### What you need to know when you prescribe a proton pump inhibitor [^112ryaGH]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Ever since they were launched, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been regarded as profligate prescription interventions and have become a favourite target for pharmacy advisers. Now that they are cheap, with generic omeprazole 20 mg daily costing £1.88 per month (£24.51 per annum) in the UK, it is time to ask whether this status should be reviewed, whether there are areas where the message should be reversed and whether there are any circumstances in which the extra cost of branded PPIs or combined preparations is justified. Equally, with the recognition of an extended toxicity profile, is prescribing profligacy not an economic but a safety issue?

AGA Clinical Practice Update on GERD — lifestyle and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) optimization notes that most patients with non-severe GERD typically improve with optimization of lifestyle, PPI therapy, and adjunctive pharmacotherapy when appropriate, and aggressive lifestyle modifications and weight management should be utilized. PPI optimization includes ensuring adequate timing of dose, considering escalation to double dose, and/or switching to a different PPI. Exceptions include patients with erosive esophagitis (Los Angeles B or greater), biopsy proven Barrett's esophagus, and/or peptic stricture, who would require at least single-dose, long-term PPI therapy, and patients with severe GERD require indefinite long-term PPI therapy and/or an invasive anti-reflux procedure.

### The clinician's guide to proton-pump inhibitor discontinuation [^1131cXSG]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

There is increasing concern among patients and health care providers about the associations between PPI use and a multitude of potential adverse outcomes. Therefore, clinicians need to have a rational approach both to identifying PPI users who may not have an ongoing indication for their use and on how to encourage discontinuation of unnecessary PPI use. In this paper, we will provide a detailed review of the specific indications where the benefits of ongoing PPI use is of questionable value and will review the evidence on how to maximize the likelihood of being able to successfully discontinue PPI use while minimizing symptom recurrence.

### Differential effects of omeprazole and pantoprazole on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel in healthy subjects: randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover comparison studies [^112ibKDV]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Four randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover studies were conducted among 282 healthy subjects to investigate whether an interaction exists between clopidogrel (300-mg loading dose/75-mg/day maintenance dose) and the proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) omeprazole (80 mg) when they are administered simultaneously (study 1); whether the interaction, if any, can be mitigated by administering clopidogrel and omeprazole 12 h apart (study 2) or by increasing clopidogrel to 600-mg loading/150-mg/day maintenance dosing (study 3); and whether the interaction applies equally to the PPI pantoprazole (80 mg) (study 4). Relative to levels after administration of clopidogrel alone in studies 1,2,3, and 4, coadministration of PPI decreased the AUC(0–24) of the clopidogrel active metabolite H4 by 40, 47, 41, and 14% (P ≤ 0.002), respectively; increased maximal platelet aggregation (MPA) induced by 5 micromol/l adenosine diphosphate (ADP) by 8.0, 5.6, 8.1, and 4.3% (P ≤ 0.014), respectively; and increased the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation-platelet reactivity index (VASP-PRI) by 20.7, 27.1, 19.0 (P < 0.0001), and 3.9% (P = 0.3319), respectively. The results suggest that a metabolic drug-drug interaction exists between clopidogrel and omeprazole but not between clopidogrel and pantoprazole.

### Dyspepsia: challenges in diagnosis and selection of treatment [^113KFE2B]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Despite considerable study, the pathophysiology of dyspepsia remains obscure. This and other factors have impeded development of precise and effective treatment strategies.

Objective

This paper provides a brief review of the clinical syndrome of dyspepsia and its pathophysiology, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment.

Methods

To identify articles for inclusion in this review, a search of MEDLINE was conducted using the key word dyspepsia. Because the literature on this topic is voluminous and duplicative, the search was limited primarily to literature from the last decade and to articles concerning dyspepsia in adults.

Results

The symptoms of dyspepsia, which may include epigastric pain, heartburn. bloating, and early satiety, defy diagnosis in as many as 50% of patients, even after endoscopy and other appropriate studies. In the other half of patients, such causative disorders as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and gastric cancer may be diagnosed. Despite controversy regarding the selection of therapy, empiric treatment is common for apparent idiopathic dyspepsia. Histamine2-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), promotility agents, and coating agents have all been used as empiric therapy for dyspeptic symptoms. With empiric treatment, subsequent management is directed by the therapeutic response. In the absence of a definitive diagnosis, treatment is usually selected on the basis of the type and severity of symptoms, a thorough history and physical examination, and factors such as age and the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection. Five PPIs are currently available — lansoprazole, omeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, and esomeprazole — all with established efficacy in GERD and other acid-mediated disorders. The PPIs can be expected to be useful in certain patients with dyspepsia, and may be prescribed for patients who are found to re- spond to potent antisecretory therapy. Patients' concern about their symptoms, practical considerations, and restrictions imposed by managed care organizations may all affect the choice between empiric therapy and early endoscopy in patients with dyspepsia.

Conclusions

Despite the variety of therapeutic options available for the symptoms of dyspepsia, the many presentations of this condition and the uncertainty of the response to the currently available therapeutic options continue to pose a substantial clinical challenge.

### Pharmacologic features of proton pump inhibitors and their potential relevance to clinical practice [^115gqemD]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

In conclusion, PPIs differ slightly in their PK and PD properties and in their propensity to interact with other medications. Inhibition of acid secretion is a function of proton pump inhibition, and PPIs work in a similar fashion to achieve this goal. PK/PD principles can be used to optimize PPI therapy when considering issues related to administration, such as timing of drug delivery relative to the number of active pumps and the drug's AUC.

### Replacement of oral proton pump inhibitors with intravenous pantoprazole to effectively control gastric acid hypersecretion in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome [^113ZzdMo]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

In patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) or other conditions requiring oral doses of proton pump inhibitors, it frequently becomes necessary to use parenterally administered gastric acid inhibitors. However, i.v. histamine-2 receptor antagonists are not effective at usual doses and lose their effectiveness because of tachyphlaxis. With the approval in the United States of i.v. pantoprazole, a substituted benzimidazole available in i.v. formulation, it will become possible to acutely manage gastric acid secretion in the acute care setting of a hospital. This study was developed to monitor the safety and establish the efficacy of i.v. pantoprazole as an alternative to oral proton pump inhibitors for the control of gastric acid hypersecretion in patients with ZES.

Methods

The efficacy of replacing oral PPI therapy with i.v. pantoprazole was evaluated in 14 ZES patients. After study enrollment, patients taking their current doses of oral PPI (omeprazole or lansoprazole) were switched to pantoprazole i.v. for 6 days during an 8-day inpatient period in the clinical research center. Effective control was defined as an acid output (AO) of < 10 mEq/h (< 5 mEq/h in patients with prior gastric acid-reducing surgery).

Results

The mean age of the 14 patients enrolled in the study was 52.4 yr (range = 38–67). Mean basal AO was 0.55 ± 0.32 mEq/h and mean fasting gastrin was 1089 pg/ml (range = 36–3720). Four patients were also diagnosed with the multiple endocrine neoplasia type I syndrome, nine were male, and two had previously undergone acid-reducing surgery. Before study enrollment, gastric acid hypersecretion was controlled in nine of 14 patients with omeprazole (20–200 mg daily) and five of 14 with lansoprazole (30–210 mg daily). In the oral phase of the study all patients had adequate control of gastric acid secretion, with a mean AO of 0.55 ± 0.32 mEq/h (mean ± SEM). Thereafter, 80 mg of i.v. pantoprazole was administered b.i.d. for 7 days by a brief (15 min) infusion and the dose was titrated upward to a predetermined maximum of 240 mg/24 h to control AO. A dose of 80 mg b.i.d. of i.v. pantoprazole controlled AO in 13 of 14 of the patients (93%) for the duration of the study (p > 0.05 compared to baseline values for all timepoints). One sporadic ZES patient (oral control value = 0.65 mEq/h on 100 mg of omeprazole b.i.d. p.o.) was not controlled with 80 mg of i.v. pantoprazole b.i.d. and dosage was titrated upward to 120 mg b.i.d. after day 2.

Conclusions

There were no serious adverse events observed. Intravenous pantoprazole provides gastric acid secretory control that is equivalent to the acid suppression observed with oral proton pump inhibitors. Most ZES patients (93%) maintained effective control of AO previously established with oral PPIs when switched to 80 mg of i.v. pantoprazole b.i.d.; however, for difficult-to-control patients, doses > 80 mg b.i.d. may be required.

GERD empiric proton pump inhibitor (PPI) management — Patients with typical reflux symptoms without alarm symptoms can be offered a trial of single dose PPI therapy with response assessed in 4 to 8 weeks; responders can be weaned to the lowest effective dose and, if symptoms remain controlled, titrated to on demand therapy if possible, while patients needing maintenance on chronic PPI can be offered reflux testing at the 1-year time point to determine appropriateness of long term therapy; for non- or partial responders, a dose increase to twice a day or a switch to a more effective PPI can be offered, and if response remains suboptimal, esophageal testing is suggested; patients with isolated extra-esophageal GERD symptoms benefit most from upfront esophageal testing rather than an empiric PPI trial.

Investigators "found no significant differences between the PPI and placebo groups" for potential side effects "except for enteric infections (1.4% vs 1.0% in the PPI and placebo groups, respectively; OR 1.33; 95% CI, 1.01–1.75)", and "Pantoprazole for 3 years was not associated with any adverse event other than a modestly increased risk of developing enteric infections". Caveats noted include that "the trial had a maximum follow-up of 5 years" and that it "cannot exclude the possibility that PPIs confer a modest risk of any of these adverse events (i.e., the upper limit of the 95% CIs all are > 1)".

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^1161VuS7]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

PPI-related adverse events involve the GI tract as well as other organs and systems. The majority of these events have been summarized in comprehensive reviews, to which the reader is referred. The potential risks of long-term PPI therapy, along with the respective evidence summary, are outlined in Tables 1 and 2.

Table 1
Concerns about long-term therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): Digestive System

Table 2
Concerns about long-term therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): Extra-digestive effects

Gastric pH is relevant for the absorption of several drugs and its modification by antisecretory therapy may significantly modify their pharmacokinetics. PPIs also influence drug absorption and metabolism by interacting with adenosine triphosphate-dependent P-glycoprotein (e.g. inhibiting digoxin efflux) or with the CYP P450 enzyme system (e.g. decreasing simvastatin metabolism), thereby affecting both intestinal first-pass metabolism and hepatic clearance. A number of studies have shown that omeprazole (and, to a lesser extent, lansoprazole) carries a considerable potential for DDIs, since it has a high affinity for CYP2C19 and a somewhat lower affinity for CYP3A4. In contrast, pantoprazole and rabeprazole display a lower potential for DDIs. DDIs therefore represent a molecule-related effect rather than a class-effect.

These interactions are clinically relevant mostly for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. diazepam, warfarin, antipsychotics, etc.). In addition, PPI metabolism is very rapid in most Caucasian subjects (extensive metabolizers), so that their half-life ranges from only 0.5 to 2.1 hours. Indeed, the prevalence of poor metabolizers, potentially at increased risk of drug interactions, is as low as 1.2–3.8% in Europe as compared to 23% in Asia. This could explain why only few of the reported DDIs involving PPIs have been shown to be of clinical significance.

Recent studies have raised concerns about a possible adverse interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs (currently prescribed to patients who are receiving dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent upper GI bleeding) that could reduce the antithrombotic effect of the former and, therefore, lessen protection against CV events in high-risk patients. However, current evidence shows that, while concomitant use of some PPIs with clopidogrel does attenuate the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel, this effect is unlikely to be clinically relevant. Conversely, denying PPIs to patients at GI risk would result in increased life-threatening GI bleeding.

### Recent advances on the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^115BVyy5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Post-discharge management

For patients with lesions identified on endoscopy, it is recommended they be started on an oral anti-secretory agent. PPIs are the pharmacologic agent of choice in these patients; H 2 RAs are generally regarded as inadequate. This was demonstrated most recently by an excellent publication by Ng et al in 2010. 130 patients who experienced dyspepsia or bleeding while taking acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and were found to have peptic ulcers or multiple erosions at endoscopy were randomized to receive either famotidine 40 mg twice daily or pantoprazole 20 mg once daily (with evening placebo) for 7 weeks. All patients remained on ASA (160 mg daily), and were treated for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection if this was present. Patients on pantoprazole experienced significantly fewer symptoms from ulcers or erosions and, most importantly, significantly fewer bleeding episodes.

Practice guidelines recommend the use of PPI for all patients with previous ulcer bleeding who require treatment with any non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). They make particular note that the use of clopidogrel alone presents a greater risk for rebleeding than does the use of ASA combined with a PPI.

Many patients who experience upper GI bleeding are already taking or will eventually require treatment with ASA. While ASA is a known risk factor for the development of peptic ulcer disease, many patients should be taking ASA for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. As weighing the risks of bleeding versus coronary artery disease can be difficult, Sung et al recently performed a single-center, non-inferiority double blind RCT in Hong Kong wherein they randomized 156 patients who developed peptic ulcer bleeding while prescribed ASA to restart (immediately after endoscopic hemostasis) taking ASA 80 mg daily over 8 weeks or switch to placebo for 8 weeks. All patients were given daily omeprazole. Patients taking ASA had a non-significant increase in the rate of rebleeding, but also a significantly lower all-cause mortality rate (HR 0.2, 95% CI 0.05–0.90). This lends more credibility to the idea that ASA should be resumed in patients even after experiencing a bleeding ulcer. It would be useful if future studies compare less extreme strategies (e.g. restarting ASA immediately or 2 days after endoscopic hemostasis versus restarting in 7 days).

ASGE guideline on GERD — panel guidance on PPI use states that the panel strongly recommended medical management including PPIs at the lowest dose for the shortest time while initiating discussion about long-term management options for patients with confirmed GERD, and provided best practice advice including discussion of risks and benefits before starting therapy and consideration of de-escalation and dose optimization when symptoms are well controlled; the panel noted that data regarding clinical utility of CYP2C19 phenotype assessment and changing the PPI therapy are not robust but acknowledged assessing the phenotype when GERD symptoms are not responding in adherent patients; because the reviewed evidence demonstrated superiority of PPIs over H2 receptor blockers for GERD therapy, PPIs are favored for patients with erosive esophagitis and uncontrolled GERD with confirmed objective acid reflux study, while H2 receptor blockers may be used as an adjunct, as needed therapy, and when faster onset of action might be required on a case-by-case basis.

### Omeprazole, but not pantoprazole, reduces the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel: a randomized clinical crossover trial in patients after myocardial infarction evaluating the clopidogrel-PPIs drug interaction [^115MTRVM]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are usually prescribed to patients undergoing dual antiplatelet therapy to decrease the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Recent studies have raised concerns that PPIs could reduce clopidogrel's efficacy by competitive inhibition of cytochrome P450 2C19 isoenzyme. All PPIs are metabolized by cytochrome P450 2C19, although to varying degrees, and according to in-vitro studies, pantoprazole is the weakest inhibitor of this isoenzyme. We hypothesized that this drug interaction might not be a class effect.

Methods

One month after an acute myocardial infarction 34 consecutive patients undergoing dual antiplatelet therapy were prospectively analyzed. Platelet function was measured (VerifyNow system), in each patient, in three consecutive clinical scenarios: (i) first, after a 1-month washout period, without any PPI, (ii) after a 4-week period taking omeprazole 40 mg, and (iii) after another 1-month washout period, followed by 4-weeks taking pantoprazole 40 mg. In this crossover trial, patients were first randomized to receive either omeprazole or pantoprazole.

Results

We observed a significant reduction in clopidogrel's effect when patients were initiated with omeprazole; the mean P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) increased from 202 ± 52 to 235 ± 58 with omeprazole (P < 0.001). With pantoprazole, clopidogrel efficacy was preserved (PRU 215 ± 54, P = 0.16). Without any PPI, 26% of patients were 'nonresponders' to clopidogrel (PRU > 240) but when patients started omeprazole, this proportion increased to 45 versus 23% with pantoprazole.

Conclusion

In this randomized crossover study analyzing patients after acute myocardial infarction, omeprazole coadministration showed a significant pharmacodynamic interaction with clopidogrel, whereas pantoprazole did not. These data suggest that the clopidogrel-PPIs drug interaction may not be a class effect.

### Prevalence and differences in the co-administration of drugs known to interact: an analysis of three distinct and large populations [^114A7gXA]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The lack of awareness, overuse, and misuse of PPI, together with the elevated number of drug interactions associated with omeprazole (phenytoin, methotrexate, and several benzodiazepine derivatives, among others), makes omeprazole one of the most significant culprits of DDIs. Indeed, in our study, omeprazole is the third and fourth most dispensed drug in Blumenau and Catalonia, respectively. Conversely, in Indianapolis, it is the 44th. Therefore, we simulated the substitution of omeprazole with alternative PPI — such as pantoprazole and lansoprazole––as a possible but actionable public health intervention. Such an intervention would reduce 20% of all men and 23% of all women currently administering a DDI in Catalonia (Additional file 1: Fig. S13b). This means 156,210 women and 92,533 men would be DDI-free in Catalonia if another PPI substituted their omeprazole prescription.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^113TqAKu]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

GERD and NERD are chronic, relapsing diseases. Six months after cessation of treatment, symptomatic relapse is rapid and frequent (i.e. in 90% of endoscopy-positive and 75% of endoscopy-negative patients). PPIs, both at a full and half dose, are able to maintain patients in remission, with a superior efficacy of the full dose (NNT = 9.1). Esomeprazole 20 mg is the only step-down dose PPI able to maintain a significantly higher proportion of GERD patients in symptomatic remission, as compared to lansoprazole 15 mg or pantoprazole 20 mg.

Since PPIs do not correct the underlying pathophysiological motor abnormalities responsible for GERD, a continuous treatment is required to maintain all patients in remission. In the LOTUS trial, comparing long-term esomeprazole therapy with anti-reflux surgery (ARS), the estimated remission rate at 5 years was 92%, higher than that reported with omeprazole in the SOPRAN study (57%). However, while the PPI dose in the SOPRAN trial was fixed, in the LOTUS investigation, patients whose reflux symptoms were not adequately controlled by a standard maintenance regimen (i.e. esomeprazole, 20 mg/day) were allowed to increase the dosage to 40 mg once daily and then to 20 mg twice daily. This dose titration may have contributed to the improved remission rate and suggests that long-term maintenance therapy should be individualized. Indeed, the number and severity of relapses are highly variable amongst patients. Infrequent reflux symptoms are less likely to be chronic and may respond to different management strategies. There are basically three different long-term approaches for GERD treatment with PPIs: continuous (i.e. every day), intermittent (i.e. cycles of daily PPI administration), or on-demand (i.e. symptom-driven) therapy, each selected on the basis of patients' clinical characteristics.

### Factors influencing the shift of patients from one proton pump inhibitor to another: the effect of direct-to-consumer advertising [^115X9eKA]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Switching from one proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to another is common, and may be related to factors other than efficacy and tolerability.

Objectives

The purposes of this study were to describe the incidence of therapeutic switching among PPI users, quantify direct ambulatory medical costs of switching, and characterize the relationship between product switching and variables hypothesized to influence a switch (eg, direct-to-consumer [DTC] advertising, structure of insurance coverage, disease diagnosis).

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of health plans using 1998 data. The subjects were employees and dependents with employer-sponsored health insurance contributing to the Medstat Market-Scan administrative dataset. Using a commercially available database to quantify DTC advertising by marketing area, market-specific expenditures were matched to eligible subjects. Among PPI users, we identified those who switched from one product to another (switchers) and compared their utilization and spending with nonswitchers. We then evaluated the relationship between drug use and variables hypothesized to affect switching: DTC advertising, insurance characteristics, patient diagnosis, diagnostic procedures, comorbidities, age, and sex.

Results

The analysis used data for 396,500 individuals from 47 unique markets that were geographically well distributed, with population density similar to that of the United States overall. The sample was also comparable with US census estimates for age and sex among working adults and their dependents. Only 620 (6.3%) of PPI users switched products during the 1998 calendar year. Annual diagnostic and drug costs were > US $400 higher for switchers than nonswitchers. Subjects in areas with high levels of DTC advertising were 43% more likely to switch from lansoprazole to omeprazole than those in the low-expenditure areas. Additionally, patients paying prescription drug copayments > US $5 were 12% less likely to switch from lansoprazole to omeprazole than patients paying lower copayments.

Conclusions

In these privately insured patients using PPIs, product switching was associated with increased treatment costs. DTC advertising and patient cost-sharing were important predictors of product switching.

### AGA clinical practice update on De-prescribing of proton pump inhibitors: expert review [^115VgCy6]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Description

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most commonly used medications in the world. Developed for the treatment and prevention of acid-mediated upper gastrointestinal conditions, these agents are being used increasingly for indications where their benefits are less certain. PPI overprescription imposes an economic cost and contributes to polypharmacy. In addition, PPI use has been increasingly linked to a number of adverse events (PPI-associated adverse events [PAAEs]). Therefore, de-prescribing of PPIs is an important strategy to lower pill burden while reducing real costs and theoretical risks. The purpose of this clinical update was to provide Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements about how to approach PPI de-prescribing in ambulatory patients.

Methods

Our guiding principle was that, although PPIs are generally safe, patients should not use any medication when there is not a reasonable expectation of benefit based on scientific evidence or prior treatment response. Prescribers are responsible for determining whether PPI use is absolutely or conditionally indicated and, when uncertainty exists, to incorporate patient perspectives into PPI decision making. We collaboratively outlined a high-level "process map" of the conceptual approach to de-prescribing PPIs in a clinical setting. We identified the following 3 key domains that required BPA guidance: documentation of PPI indication; identifying suitable candidates for consideration of de-prescribing; and optimizing successful de-prescribing. Co-authors drafted 1 or more potential BPAs, supported by literature review, for each domain. All co-authors reviewed, edited, and selected or rejected draft BPAs for inclusion in the final list submitted to the American Gastroenterological Association Governing Board. Because this was not a systematic review, we did not carry out a formal rating of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: All patients taking a PPI should have a regular review of the ongoing indications for use and documentation of that indication. This review should be the responsibility of the patient's primary care provider. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: All patients without a definitive indication for chronic PPI should be considered for trial of de-prescribing. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Most patients with an indication for chronic PPI use who take twice-daily dosing should be considered for step down to once-daily PPI. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Patients with complicated gastroesophageal reflux disease, such as those with a history of severe erosive esophagitis, esophageal ulcer, or peptic stricture, should generally not be considered for PPI discontinuation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Patients with known Barrett's esophagus, eosinophilic esophagitis, or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis should generally not be considered for a trial of de-prescribing. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: PPI users should be assessed for upper gastrointestinal bleeding risk using an evidence-based strategy before de-prescribing. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Patients at high risk for upper gastrointestinal bleeding should not be considered for PPI de-prescribing. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Patients who discontinue long-term PPI therapy should be advised that they may develop transient upper gastrointestinal symptoms due to rebound acid hypersecretion. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: When de-prescribing PPIs, either dose tapering or abrupt discontinuation can be considered. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: The decision to discontinue PPIs should be based solely on the lack of an indication for PPI use, and not because of concern for PAAEs. The presence of a PAAE or a history of a PAAE in a current PPI user is not an independent indication for PPI withdrawal. Similarly, the presence of underlying risk factors for the development of an adverse event associated with PPI use should also not be an independent indication for PPI withdrawal.

### AGA clinical practice update on integrating potassium-competitive acid blockers into clinical practice: expert review [^112EHbGe]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Bleeding peptic ulcer — Best Practice Advice 9 states that although there is currently insufficient evidence for clinicians to use P-CABs as first-line therapy in patients with bleeding gastroduodenal ulcers and high-risk stigmata, their rapid and potent acid inhibition raises the possibility of their utility. After endoscopic hemostasis for high-risk stigmata ulcer bleeding, 194 patients across 6 centers in Thailand were randomized to oral vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily for 3 days then 20 mg once daily for 28 days versus high-dose PPI with pantoprazole intravenous infusion 8 mg/h for 3 days then omeprazole 20 mg twice daily for 28 days; the vonoprazan regimen was noninferior to PPI for rebleeding at 3 days, 7 days, and 30 days (7.1% vs 10.4%, risk difference, 3.3%; 95% CI, −11.2% to 4.7%). Higher doses of P-CABs for short periods, for prophylaxis against high-risk upper GI ulcer rebleeding, warrant further study.

### Comparison of omeprazole and pantoprazole influence on a high 150-mg clopidogrel maintenance dose the PACA (proton pump inhibitors and clopidogrel association) prospective randomized study [^111qU1kL]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to compare the effect of 2 proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on platelet response to clopidogrel after coronary stenting for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE ACS).

Background

Use of omeprazole has been reported to significantly decrease the clopidogrel antiplatelet effect because of cytochrome P450 interaction. Because all PPIs are metabolized by CYP2C19, but to a varying degree, we hypothesized that the reported negative omeprazole-clopidogrel drug interaction may not be caused by a class effect.

Methods

A total of 104 patients undergoing coronary stenting for NSTE ACS were prospectively included and randomized to omeprazole or pantoprazole 20 mg. They received at discharge 75-mg aspirin and 150-mg clopidogrel. Platelet reactivity index (PRI) vasoactive stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) was used to assess clopidogrel response and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced aggregation for platelet reactivity (ADP-Ag).

Results

After 1 month, patients receiving pantoprazole had a significantly better platelet response to clopidogrel as assessed with the PRI VASP: 36 ± 20% versus 48 ± 17% (p = 0.007). We identified more clopidogrel nonresponders in the omeprazole group than in the pantoprazole group: 44% versus 23% (p = 0.04), odds ratio: 2.6 (95% confidence interval: 1.2 to 6.2). Conversely, we did not observe any significant difference in platelet reactivity with ADP-Ag between the omeprazole and pantoprazole groups: 52 ± 15% and 50 ± 18%, respectively (p = 0.29).

Conclusions

The present findings suggest the preferential use of pantoprazole compared with omeprazole in patients receiving clopidogrel to avoid any potential negative interaction with CYP2C19.

ASGE guideline — Recommendation 4 for proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy in GERD states that in patients with symptomatic and confirmed GERD with predominant heartburn symptoms, the ASGE recommends medical management with PPIs at the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible period of time while initiating discussion about long-term management options (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). In patients with suboptimal clinical response to PPI therapy, the ASGE suggests testing CYP2C19 polymorphism and adjusting PPI dosage and/or selection accordingly (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). Best practice advice includes that patients on chronic PPI therapy (> 6 months) should be considered for optimization and de-escalation, providers should carefully consider risks, benefits, and alternatives of PPI use, and prescribers should be aware that adverse events in prospective data have been limited to a modest increased risk of enteric infections with a need for robust long-term data to confirm or refute other putative adverse events.

### What does this article say? [^114VxhsR]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Four studies of pantoprazole 40 mg versus omeprazole 20 mg found no difference. Six studies of lansoprazole 30 mg versus omeprazole 20 mg found no difference. Two studies of rabeprazole 20 mg versus omeprazole 20 mg found no difference. Two studies of esomeprazole 40 mg versus omeprazole 20 mg found a small difference. The "cure rate" of 79. 6 versus
67. 3 percent results in a number needed to treat of 8. The six remaining studies were a hodge-podge group of trials comparing various PPIs at different doses, none of which demonstrated any superiority. Mark: This is a classic example of a "straw man comparison. " A straw man comparison is when a study intentionally compares drugs of differing doses in order to set up one as a clear "winner" in effectiveness. In the study comparing esomeprazole with omeprazole, esomeprazole did better.

Well, that's no surprise — esomeprazole is the active isomer of omeprazole, and the study authors used a dosage four times that of omeprazole. Breaking this down, they used 40 mg of active drug esomeprazole versus 10 mg of active drug omeprazole, and guess what. The drug not going off patent did better. And who sponsored the study. Astra-Zeneca, the manufacturer. As for the nine studies on peptic ulcer disease, they found the same results as those found with GERD, except this time, pantoprazole 40 mg barely had better endoscopic healing than omeprazole 20 mg at four weeks. But I have the same complaints as I did with the GERD studies regarding the use of unequal dosages and using endoscopic cure rates as the end point. And do I even have to do the H. pylori results. Sixteen studies with no differences noted among any PPIs.

### A therapeutic substitution policy for proton pump inhibitors: clinical and economic consequences [^116SuGPj]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

With the growing need to provide prescription drug benefits to older patients and to contain costs, it will be necessary to direct that coverage so as to make expenditures as efficient as possible. We evaluated the clinical and economic consequences of coverage restriction for 3 leading proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in a large-scale natural experiment.

Methods

The study design was a time-trend analysis in the setting of a provincial drug benefits program in British Columbia, Canada. We studied all British Columbia residents aged 66 or older (N = 501,104) using linked data on all prescription drug dispensings, physician services, and hospitalizations between January 2002 and June 2004. The new policy restricted coverage to rabeprazole and required treatment failure with a histamine H2 blocker. More widely used PPIs (omeprazole, pantoprazole, and lansoprazole) had to be paid for out of pocket, unless the physician requested an exemption. The main outcome measures were utilization of PPIs, drug discontinuation rates, gastrointestinal hemorrhage rates, and drug expenditures.

Results

Utilization of the restricted PPIs declined sharply after the policy change (-14,850 daily doses per month per 10,000 residents, P < .0001), whereas use of the covered PPI increased sharply (+19,300, P < .0001), with 45% of all PPI users switching to the covered agent within 6 months. We found no increased use of H2 blockers or stopping of gastroprotective drugs. There was no increase in the monthly rate of hospitalization for gastrointestinal hemorrhage after the PPI restriction (P = 0.35) even though the study had the power to detect increases of 24 events per 10,000 residents with 95% confidence. There was a slight increase in physician visits 3 months after the policy change (P = 0.01) for a 2-month period when 9% of new rabeprazole users were switched back to a restricted PPI. In the first 6 months of the policy change, the provincial health plan saved at least 2.9 million Canadian dollars as a result of the policy change.

Conclusions

Coverage restriction of 3 leading PPIs led to substantial utilization changes and savings, without increased noncompliance or clinical complication.

### Therapeutic choices in reflux disease: defining the criteria for selecting a proton pump inhibitor [^115UkEu7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is among the most common disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, with symptoms affecting a substantial proportion of the US population on a daily basis. Heartburn and related symptoms arise from a number of pathophysiologic mechanisms, including dilated intercellular spaces, increased duration of acid reflux, greater proximal extent of reflux, and esophageal sensitivity. Chronic reflux may result in serious complications, such as esophageal erosions or ulceration, stricture, and Barrett esophagus. The goals of GERD therapy are to relieve patients' symptoms and prevent complications. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) represent the most effective treatment option for GERD, relieving symptoms, healing erosions, and maintaining a healed mucosa. Differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics among the PPIs may result in differences in intragastric pH holding time as well as the onset of symptom relief. Lansoprazole and esomeprazole produce similar degrees and onset of symptom relief, with both providing greater symptom relief as compared with omeprazole. Although manufactured as capsules containing enteric-coated granules, lansoprazole, omeprazole, and esomeprazole maintain their high level of pharmacologic efficacy when the capsule contents are emptied into soft foods or various liquids. Lansoprazole and pantoprazole also are manufactured as intravenous formulations, and lansoprazole is available as strawberry-flavored granules for oral suspension and as an orally disintegrating tablet. These alternative routes of administration are particularly beneficial in the management of acid-related disorders in infants, children, the elderly, and patients of all ages who have difficulty swallowing or are unable to swallow intact capsules or tablets and those in the critical care setting.

### Agreement of different drug-drug interaction checkers for proton pump inhibitors [^113P73Jd]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most commonly prescribed drug classes and are used for both the prevention of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)–induced ulcers and the treatment of acid-related disorders (eg, gastroesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcer disease). A large body of evidence documented an increased risk of severe adverse drug reactions (ADRs), especially with long-term and inappropriate use of these drugs, also due to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions (DDIs).

PPIs may alter the absorption and bioavailability of medications with pH-dependent solubility by increasing gastric pH. Furthermore, PPIs are mainly metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system, particularly CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, thus potentially modifying the metabolism of coadministered drugs via competitive inhibition. However, intraclass differences in CYP affinity exist. In particular, omeprazole has been shown to carry a relevant potential for DDIs due to its higher affinity for CYP2C19 and moderate affinity for CYP3A4, while pantoprazole has the lowest potential for pharmacokinetic interactions. Furthermore, compared with omeprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, and rabeprazole exhibit a weaker potential for DDIs, although they have been less extensively investigated.

### AGA clinical practice update on De-prescribing of proton pump inhibitors: expert review [^116qZweR]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — patient and clinician behavior regarding proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reports that concern about PPI-related complications is common, with nearly 40% having made an attempt at discontinuing PPIs, of whom 83% did so without being advised to by a physician. It also states that three-quarters of physicians reported that they have altered treatment plans because of concerns about PPIs, and approximately 80% state that they would discontinue PPIs after being presented with a clinical scenario of a patient at high risk of upper GI bleeding. The document cautions that the discontinuation of PPIs in patients with definite indications on the basis of concern about the unproven risk may lead to both recurrent symptoms and serious complications, and concludes, Therefore, physicians should not use concern about unproven complications of PPI use as a justification for PPI de-prescribing if there remain ongoing valid indications for PPI use.

### Are proton pump inhibitors the first choice for acute treatment of gastric ulcers? A meta analysis of randomized clinical trials [^111WKtTi]. BMC Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Gastric ulcers are a frequent problem in the United States. Proton pump inhibitors have been shown to increase healing rates and improve clinical symptoms. The objective of this study is to compare gastric ulcer healing rates for patients treated with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (omeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, or lansoprazole), an histamine 2- receptor antagonist (ranitidine) or placebo.

Methods

A literature search was conducted to identify randomized, controlled clinical trials that included a PPI in at least one treatment arm and assessed the gastric ulcer healing rates endoscopically. The healing rates were estimated for each treatment at specific time points, and Rate Ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for each trial.

Results

Sixteen trials met the inclusion criteria: four compared a PPI versus placebo, nine compared a PPI versus ranitidine (no trials of rabeprazole versus ranitidine met the inclusion criteria), and three compared a newer PPI (lansoprazole, pantoprazole or rabeprazole) versus omeprazole. In relation to ranitidine, the pooled RR of PPIs (lansoprazole, omeprazole and pantoprazole) was 1.33 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.42) at four weeks. In each trial, greater improvement in the studied clinical symptoms was found with the newer PPIs (rabeprazole, pantoprazole and lansoprazole) when compared to omeprazole.

Conclusion

In this study treatment with PPIs resulted in higher healing rates than ranitidine or placebo. This evidence suggests that the first choice for gastric ulcer treatment for the greater relief of symptoms is one of the newer PPIs.

### Which patients with GERD… [^111xan92]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

All over-the-counter and prescription PPIs offer similar relief of GERD symptoms; therefore, physicians should choose the appropriate PPI based on cost, formulary availability, and patient response. 2, 5 PPIs are more effective for relieving GERD symptoms than H 2 antagonists, and may be more cost-effective than step therapy. In one randomized controlled trial, domperidone plus omeprazole was superior to omeprazole alone; 6. 7 These trials compared equivalent doses of four PPIs: esomeprazole 20 mg, omeprazole 20 mg, pantoprazole 20 mg, and rabeprazole 10 mg. All had similar times to initial relief of symptoms and complete relief of symptoms at four weeks. One RCT supported switching PPIs if the initial choice was ineffective.

9 A Cochrane review found that PPIs are more effective at relieving GERD symptoms than H 2 antagonists, 7 and an RCT supported the cost- and clinical effectiveness of starting with a PPI rather than step therapy with an H 2 antagonist when treating reflux esophagitis.

One RCT comparing omeprazole 20 mg twice daily plus domperidone 10 mg three times daily vs. omeprazole 20 mg twice daily found decreased symptoms with a mean improvement using a validated symptom score. 6 However, a meta-analysis of 12 RCTs found that the combination of a prokinetic and PPI did not improve symptoms and was associated with more adverse effects than a PPI alone.
11. EVIDENCE SUMMARY Although up to 10% of patients with chronic reflux symptoms will have Barrett esophagus.

3, 4 If medication timing is problematic, dexlansoprazole can be considered because it has similar effectiveness regardless of meal timing. Also, patients with significant nighttime reflux symptoms may benefit from omeprazole/sodium bicarbonate because of its effectiveness in controlling nighttime pH. Endoscopy should be limited to patients who do not respond to appropriate PPI therapy.

A matter for concern is the interaction between PPIs and clopidogrel. Based on pharmacokinetic studies, PPI therapy reduces the efficacy of clopidogrel by interfering with the hepatic CYP2C19-based activation. However, the clinical relevance of such a phenomenon is largely controversial. Indeed, a panel of experts of the European Society of Cardiology recently suggested that there is no conclusive evidence to discourage PPI use with clopidogrel due to a potential increased risk of ischemic events. Further, the only prospective study (the COGENT trial) demonstrated that omeprazole significantly reduces the rate of composite GI events but did not show any increase in the composite CV events in patients at high CV risk. Additionally, a recent meta-analysis, while confirming that the pharmacodynamic interaction between PPI and clopidogrel has no clinical significance, actually suggests that PPIs are a marker of increased CV risk in patients taking clopidogrel rather than a direct cause of worse outcomes. Nevertheless, PPIs that lack inhibition of CYP2C19 (i.e. pantoprazole or rabeprazole) might be preferred in clopidogrel users. No significant interaction between PPIs and the new antiplatelet agents (prasugrel or ticagrelor) has been documented.

Co-administration of aspirin and clopidogrel is associated with synergistic effects in causing serious GI bleeding. Indeed, epidemiological studies have invariably shown that combination of two antiplatelet drugs produces significant excess risk of UGIB. PPI co-treatment is also effective in reducing the risk of UGIB in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy. It is worthwhile mentioning that – among patients with dual antiplatelet therapy and PPI co-therapy – GI bleeding episodes are more frequent in the lower GI tract; this changing pattern of bleeding likely reflects the success of gastroprotection.

Anticoagulants, either vitamin K antagonists or novel oral anticoagulants, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban, do not cause gastroduodenal mucosa injury per se. These medications may, however, facilitate bleeding of pre-existing PUs. While gastroprotection is generally not advised, unless a concomitant anti-platelet or NSAID therapy is prescribed, a very recent retrospective cohort study found that PPI co-therapy is associated with reduced risk of warfarin-related upper GI bleeding. As expected, the risk reduction was greatest in patients also taking antiplatelet drugs and/or NSAIDs, but was still significant in those without concurrent use of these medications.

### Prevention of NSAID-associated gastrointestinal lesions: a comparison study pantoprazole versus omeprazole [^111h67aH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Aim

To investigate tolerability and efficacy of pantoprazole 20 mg, once daily (o.d.), pantoprazole 40 mg o.d., and omeprazole 20 mg o.d., in patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug(s) (NSAIDs).

Methods

Included in this randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group study were rheumatic patients (> 55 yr) on continual NSAIDs and with at least one more recognized risk factor that contributes to the development of gastrointestinal (GI) injury. Study duration was 6 months, and the treatment consisted of pantoprazole 20 mg o.d. (N = 196), pantoprazole 40 mg o.d. (N = 199), or omeprazole 20 mg o.d. (N = 200). Patients took NSAID(s) (except COX-2 inhibitors), had no more than five erosions/petechiae in the upper GI tract, no current peptic ulcers or reflux esophagitis, and had at most moderate intensity GI symptoms. Endoscopy was performed at baseline, 3, and 6 months. The primary end points were lack of "therapeutic failure" and lack of "endoscopic failure" at 6 months.

Results

After 6 months, the probabilities to remain in remission were 90% pantoprazole 20 mg o.d., 93% pantoprazole 40 mg o.d., and 89% omeprazole 20 mg o.d. for lack of "therapeutic failure"; 91% pantoprazole 20 mg o.d., 95% pantoprazole 40 mg o.d., and 93% omeprazole 20 mg o.d. for lack of "endoscopic failure".

Conclusions

For patients taking NSAIDs continually, pantoprazole 20 mg o.d., pantoprazole 40 mg o.d., or omeprazole 20 mg o.d. provide equivalent, effective, and well-tolerated prophylaxis against GI lesions, including peptic ulcers.

### Proton pump inhibitors and their drug interactions: an evidence-based approach [^115cBQcz]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

The proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective antisecretory agents used to treat acid-related disorders. As such, they are frequently prescribed for patients who are concurrently using other medications. PPIs may interact with other drugs through numerous mechanisms. The most important include competitive inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P (CYP) 450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism, and alteration of the absorption of other drugs via changes in gastric pH levels. Poor metabolizers, who lack CYP2C19, may be particularly predisposed to drug interactions. Although the potential for drug interactions is high, few clinically significant interactions have been reported for the PPIs. Nevertheless, caution is indicated when certain drugs are co-prescribed with these agents. The incidence of clinically significant drug interactions increases proportionately with the number of drugs taken and with the age of the patient. The drug interaction with the greatest clinical importance is the reduction in benzodiazepine clearance by omeprazole.

### Editorial: just how "difficult" is it to withdraw PPI treatment? [^116QQsYa]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Two recent studies-one of which is published in this edition of the American Journal of Gastroenterology-have reported that new dyspeptic or reflux symptoms may develop among previously asymptomatic individuals after withdrawal of a short course of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It has been suggested that this is attributable to rebound gastric acid hypersecretion, and that the same phenomenon explains why some patients become chronic PPI users and physicians experience "difficulty" in withdrawing PPI treatment from patients. Although we congratulate the authors of both studies for their controlled observations, we question the generalizability of these observations and hypotheses to the clinical domain. PPI treatment continues to be the optimal management strategy for most patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease and is indicated for chronic use as ulcer prophylaxis in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug takers at high risk for bleeding. However, as with all drugs, PPIs should be dosed appropriately, and should be reserved for patients with conditions for which there is clear evidence of benefit from therapy.

GERD — CYP2C19 genotype and PPI dosing reports that PPI metabolism is affected by the genotypical variability of CYP2C19, and although not widely implemented, there may be a role for assessment of CYP2C19 polymorphism with therapy adjustment in patients with GERD refractory to PPI therapy. A meta-analysis of 19 studies found that analysis of 8 studies showed rapid metabolizers with reflux esophagitis had an increased risk of being refractory to PPI therapy compared with poor metabolizers (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.02–2.66; P = 0.04). For patients who are rapid or ultrarapid metabolizers, the PPI dosage should be increased to 3 times daily or switched to a different PPI, such as rabeprazole, which is less reliant on this metabolic pathway than other PPIs.

### New-generation proton pump inhibitors: overcoming the limitations of early-generation agents [^113PoNq9]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are now generally considered the drugs of choice for treatment of patients with serious or refractory acid-related diseases. However, despite some popular notions to the contrary, these agents are not equivalent in their pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and efficacy profiles. When the two newest PPIs, rabeprazole and esomeprazole, are compared with the older drugs in this class (omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole), the newer PPIs offer several key advantages over older agents, particularly in terms of the management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Rabeprazole and esomeprazole achieve more rapid and profound inhibition of acid secretion than do older agents, and they sustain this suppression to provide acid control and symptom relief over 24 h. The balanced hepatic metabolism of rabeprazole, involving both cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated reactions in the liver and nonenzymatic reactions, appears to confer an advantage over older PPIs in that genetic polymorphisms for CYP 2C19 do not significantly influence rabeprazole clearance and, potentially, clinical efficacy. The metabolism of esomeprazole also involves CYP 2C19, but the pharmacokinetic effects of genetic differences in the expression of this enzyme are not known. However, esomeprazole is also intended to minimize pharmacological variability. Unlike esomeprazole, the use of rabeprazole is not complicated by clinically significant drug-drug interactions of the type that have been reported for omeprazole and the wide range of medications metabolized by CYP 2C19.

14.1 Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Associated with a History of Erosive Esophagitis

A multicenter, double-blind, two-period placebo-controlled study was conducted to assess the ability of pantoprazole sodium injection to maintain gastric acid suppression in patients switched from pantoprazole delayed-release tablets to pantoprazole sodium injection GERD patients (n = 65, 26 to 64 years; 35 female; 9 Black, 11 Hispanic, 44 White, 1 other) with a history of EE were randomized to receive either 20 or 40 mg of oral pantoprazole once per day for 10 days (period 1), and then were switched in period 2 to either daily pantoprazole sodium injection or placebo for 7 days, matching their respective dose level from period 1. Patients were administered all test medication with a light meal. Maximum acid output (MAO) and basal acid output (BAO) were determined 24 hours following the last day of oral medication (day 10), the first day (day 1) of intravenous administration and the last day of intravenous administration (day 7). MAO was estimated from a 1 hour continuous collection of gastric contents following subcutaneous injection of 6.0 mcg/kg of pentagastrin.

This study demonstrated that, after 10 days of repeated oral administration followed by 7 days of intravenous administration, the oral and intravenous dosage forms of pantoprazole 40 mg are similar in their ability to suppress MAO and BAO in patients with GERD and a history of EE (see Table 4). Also, patients on oral pantoprazole who were switched to intravenous placebo experienced a significant increase in acid output within 48 hours of their last oral dose (see Table 4). However, at 48 hours after their last oral dose, patients treated with pantoprazole sodium injection had a significantly lower mean basal acid output (see Table 4) than those treated with placebo.

In patients with suboptimal clinical response to PPI therapy, the ASGE suggests testing CYP2C19 polymorphism and adjusting PPI dosage and selection accordingly (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Best practice advice states that patients who have been on long-term PPI therapy (> 6 months) should be considered for optimization and de-escalation of medical management, providers should carefully consider the risks, benefits, and alternatives of PPI use for patients with GERD, and providers prescribing PPI therapy should be aware that adverse events from PPI in prospective data have been limited to a modest increased risk of enteric infections; however, there is a need for robust long-term data to prove or disprove any other putative adverse events.

### Gastric acid control with esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole: a five-way crossover study [^116oZ1Qz]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Proton pump inhibitors owe their clinical efficacy to their ability to suppress gastric acid production. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare intragastric pH following standard doses of esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole and rabeprazole.

Methods

This randomized, open-label, comparative five-way crossover study evaluated the 24-h intragastric pH profile of oral esomeprazole 40 mg, lansoprazole 30 mg, omeprazole 20 mg, pantoprazole 40 mg, and rabeprazole 20 mg once daily in 34 Helicobacter pylori-negative patients aged 18–60 yr with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Patients were randomly assigned to one of five treatment sequences and study drug was taken on 5 consecutive mornings 30 minutes prior to a standardized breakfast. A washout period of at least 10 days separated each treatment phase.

Results

Thirty-four patients provided evaluable data for all five comparators. The mean number of hours of evaluable pH data was ≥ 23.75 hours. On day 5, intragastric pH was maintained above 4.0 for a mean of 14.0 h with esomeprazole, 12.1 h with rabeprazole, 11.8 h with omeprazole, 11.5 h with lansoprazole, and 10.1 h with pantoprazole (p ≤ 0.001 for differences between esomeprazole and all other comparators). Esomeprazole also provided a significantly higher percentage of patients with an intragastric pH greater than 4.0 for more than 12 h relative to the other proton pump inhibitors (p < 0.05). The frequency of adverse events was similar between treatment groups.

Conclusions

Esomeprazole at the standard dose of 40 mg once daily provided more effective control of gastric acid at steady state than standard doses of lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole in patients with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

### The potential interaction between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors: a systematic review [^112LEFJK]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Methods

We reviewed the MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic databases from January 1, 2005, to October 7, 2010, without any language restriction, combining search terms for clopidogrel ("clopidogrel" OR "Plavix" OR "thienopyridine"), PPIs ("PPI" OR " omeprazole" OR "lansoprazole" OR "pantoprazole" OR "esomeprazole" OR "rabeprazole") with those for cardiovascular outcomes ("mortality" OR "cardiovascular disease" OR "heart disease" OR "CAD" OR "MI" OR "UA" OR "coronary angiography" OR "coronary restenosis" OR "PCI" OR "stroke") and drug interaction ("interaction" OR " inhibition" OR " CYP2C19"). References of relevant identified articles were hand-searched for additional studies. Abstracts from medical organization conferences (American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, European Society of Cardiology and Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics) were manually searched from 2005. A priori it was decided that only articles reporting clinical outcomes would be retained. Mechanistic in vitro studies measuring platelet aggregation were therefore excluded. Two investigators independently reviewed articles for inclusion and study quality. Both reviewers examined the methodology component independently of the study results, but given the publicity surrounding the individual studies it was impossible to ensure that the reviewers were totally blinded to the outcomes. It was planned to resolve disagreements by consensus, but there was perfect agreement between the investigators on their initial assessments. This systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines (see online Additional file 1).

Overall study quality was defined as high for well-performed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) as they exhibit the best internal validity. Observational studies are considered of lower quality as they have less internal validity due to numerous potential biases and consequently could attain a maximum moderate quality score. By following published guidelines to improve the reporting of observational studies and specifically to mitigate against potential biases, we qualitatively evaluated all the observational studies for their propensity for the most common and important biases (selection, confounding and misclassification), thereby allowing their final classification into moderate- or low-quality levels. Overall observational study quality was judged to be moderate if the propensity for bias was low and specific methods to minimize bias were employed (explicit consideration of the time dependency of drug exposure and appropriate clinical outcome assessment to minimize misclassification, multiple methods to assess confounding and multivariate sensitivity analyses to test the independence and robustness of their results). Alternatively, studies were judged to be at moderate risk for bias and hence a low quality score.

### Pantoprazole based therapies in Helicobacter pylori eradication: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111NYjMY]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Aim

To perform a systematic review on the efficacy of pantoprazole based therapies in Helicobacter pylori eradication, and to conduct a meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of pantoprazole and other proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) when co-prescribed with antibiotics.

Methods

Studies evaluating pantoprazole combined with antibiotics were considered. Only randomized clinical trials comparing pantoprazole and other PPIs when co-prescribed with antibiotics, and differing only in the PPI (pantoprazole vs other), were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Bibliographical searches in several electronic databases, and manual search of abstracts from congresses, were conducted. The percentage (weighted mean) of patients with eradication success was calculated. Meta-analysis was performed combining the odds ratios (ORs) of the individual studies in a global OR.

Results

The mean eradication rate with pantoprazole plus clarithromycin for 14 days was 60%. Cure rates with 7 day pantoprazole based triple regimens were higher: pantoprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin (78%); pantoprazole, clarithromycin and nitroimidazole (84%); and pantoprazole, amoxicillin and nitroimidazole (74%). Twelve studies comparing pantoprazole and other PPIs were selected for the meta-analysis, including 534 and 603 patients, respectively. The mean eradication rate for H. pylori using pantoprazole plus antibiotics was 83%, and 81% when other PPIs were used (OR = 1; 95% confidence interval (CI) from 0.61 to 1.64). When sub-analysis was performed, including only studies comparing pantoprazole with omeprazole, or pantoprazole with lansoprazole, differences were also statistically non-significant. The meta-analysis of the six studies prescribing equivalent doses of all PPIs demonstrated similar results with pantoprazole and with other PPIs (OR = 1.07; 95% CI from 0.71 to 1.62), the results being statistically homogeneous.

Conclusions

Pantoprazole achieves similar cure rates to those of omeprazole and lansoprazole when co-prescribed with antibiotics for the eradication of H. pylori infection.

### Potentially inappropriate proton-pump inhibitor prescription in the general population: a claims-based retrospective time trend analysis [^115KftXv]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Definition and assessment of potentially inappropriate proton-pump inhibitor prescribing

Based on a literature review covering 34 clinical practice guidelines in 2017, we extracted PPI dosage and treatment regimens on 57 different PPI indications. Thereof we derived a 365-day cumulative pantoprazole dose equivalent of 11.5 g as a cut-off for inappropriateness. This cut-off reflects an evidence-based maximal-dose scenario, based on three hypothetical sequential phases: (1) an 8-week double-dose therapeutic treatment phase (2 × 40 mg of pantoprazole dose equivalents, i.e. for severe erosive esophagitis), (2) a 4-week tapering to a therapeutic dose (1 × 40 mg), (3) a maintenance dose (1 × 20 mg) for the remainder of the year. The resulting cumulative yearly dose of 11.2 g of pantoprazole equivalents was rounded up to 11.5 g. PIPPI was then determined by screening every observed person day for a preceding 365-day cumulative dose exceeding 11.5 g. To clarify we give a practical example: if 100 tablets pantoprazole 40 mg were dispensed 1 December 2016, this corresponded to 4000 mg added to the balance sheet of one patient. If the same patient repeated this process twice (i.e. adding another 8000 mg and therefore 12,000 mg in total) before 30 November 2017, then this patient would be regarded as a dispenser of PIPPI for 2017 (on the day of the third dispensing, i.e. when 11.5 g are exceeded).

Since the introduction of omeprazole in 1989, several other PPIs have become available in the United States. The intravenous form of pantoprazole is now available, and the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved the newest PPI, esomeprazole, in 2001. Short-term safety of the oldest agents, omeprazole and lansoprazole, has been well established. 2 The safety profiles of the newer agents, rabeprazole and pantoprazole, appear to be similar to those of the older agents. 2, 5, 7 PPIs are only contraindicated if the patient has a known history of hypersensitivity to them, and they should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic disease.

Omeprazole is a pregnancy category C agent; the others are pregnancy category B medications. PPIs are not recommended for use in breast-feeding mothers. 8–12. 2, 5 This is an important consideration in patients taking medications with a narrow therapeutic window, such as diazepam, phenytoin, and warfarin. Omeprazole has the greatest potential for altering cytochrome P activity; the other PPIs are less likely to cause clinically significant drug interactions with these agents. 5, 13 Table 2 2, 5 illustrates the effects of PPIs on several medications. 2 blockers, or sucralfate. PPIs are the treatment of choice for large or complicated ulcers, 2, 16 and they may also be used for prevention of NSAID–induced ulcers. Omeprazole at a dosage of 20 mg daily has been shown to be better tolerated and associated with a lower relapse rate than misoprostol at a dosage of 200 mcg twice daily.

### The potential interaction between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors: a systematic review [^114o47J8]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

*Biases considered are selection, confounding and misclassification; the probability of bias in the studies available as abstracts was deemed uncertain.

Procedures to minimize bias include multiple sensitivity analyses for varying drug exposures, multiple methods for control of confounding and time-varying analysis for misclassification.

*High study quality was reserved for RCTs. For observational studies, moderate study quality required low propensity for bias and specific efforts to minimize bias. Otherwise, quality was assessed as low.

# Calculated by combining high- and low-dose PPI groups.

Among the full published studies judged to be methodologically weak, several potential biases (selection, residual confounding, immortal time and interpretative) were noted. Ten of 13 studies judged to be of low quality reported a statistically significant association for a harmful clopidogrel-PPI interaction, while none of the five moderate-quality studies found an association (P = 0.007).

Each individual study evaluated a combined exposure to any PPI for the assessment of their primary endpoint, with the exception of the experimental study, which was restricted to omeprazole. One study did report a difference between pantoprazole and nonpantoprazole PPIs in their association with adverse clinical outcomes, but the corrected proper statistical analysis actually revealed no difference. No other study demonstrated a clinically significant difference in clinical outcomes among the different PPIs.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Best Practice Advice 8: Patients who discontinue long-term proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy should be advised that they may develop transient upper gastrointestinal symptoms due to rebound acid hypersecretion; rebound acid hypersecretion is a physiologic phenomenon that can occur with discontinuation of prolonged PPI therapy, and PPIs inhibit gastric acid production, resulting in an increase in intragastric pH.

### Impact of proton pump inhibitor use on the comparative effectiveness and safety of prasugrel versus clopidogrel: insights from the treatment with adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitors: longitudinal assessment of treatment patterns and events after acute coronary syndrome (TRANSLATE-ACS) study [^114hDRSg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

This large observational study compared the effectiveness and safety of prasugrel versus clopidogrel with and without concomitant administration of PPI among a large population of acute MI patients who underwent PCI. Our study has several notable findings. First, PPIs were prescribed in fewer than 1 in 5 post‐MI patients in routine clinical practice. PPI prescription was typically reserved for those who were older, had a greater prevalence of medical comorbidities, and were more likely to present with NSTEMI. Second, even after multivariable adjustment, patients prescribed PPI use at discharge were associated with higher 1‐year risks of MACE and GUSTO moderate/severe bleeding than those discharged without a PPI. Finally, the adjusted risk of MACE and GUSTO moderate/severe bleeding was not significantly different between prasugrel‐ and clopidogrel‐treated patients, irrespective of PPI use.

An expert consensus statement has provided recommendations regarding the use of PPIs in the setting of DAPT based on the increased risk of bleeding, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding events. 3 Nevertheless, concerns that PPIs can lead to decreased antiplatelet effects when coadministered with clopidogrel have diminished enthusiasm for routine PPI use in the setting of DAPT. 11 Several studies have analyzed the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction of PPIs and P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors, including clopidogrel and prasugrel. Sibbing et al demonstrated a significant influence on platelet response to clopidogrel for the PPI omeprazole but not for pantoprazole or esomeprazole. Patients under concomitant treatment with clopidogrel and omeprazole demonstrated 30% higher values of adenosine diphosphate–induced platelet aggregation, presumably due to the dependence of CYP2C19 isoenzyme for the metabolism of both clopidogrel and omeprazole. 12 Similar results were demonstrated in the Omeprazole Clopidogrel Aspirin (OCLA) study in which omeprazole coadministration with clopidogrel led to a 30% increase in platelet function parameters. 13

### Prediction of response to PPI therapy and factors influencing treatment outcome in patients with GORD: a prospective pragmatic trial using pantoprazole [^113LNWSk]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Geographical and ethnic differences in the nature, prevalence and presentation of GORD are recognised but less is known about possible differences in response to treatment. Unfortunately, it is not clear whether the geographical variation in responses is a reflection of fundamental differences in GORD biology or an artefact of the study. Minor differences in local systems of patient recruitment, for example, may have had an effect on patient outcomes. Consequently, we do not wish to suggest any interpretation of the observed geographical variation.

Prompted by reports that treatment outcome may be predicted by symptom severity before or shortly after commencing treatment, the potential for the ReQuest™ questionnaire to predict the response to treatment was comprehensively evaluated and the results show that some predictive capability is possible both in respect of response and non-response (Table 4). The results that relate to the baseline are especially interesting in that a prediction of treatment outcome before the treatment begins could potentially help the physician in managing patient expectation. However, the probabilities of correct prediction shown in Figure 4 are perhaps lower than physicians would wish and the proportion of patients for whom no prediction could be made was higher. However, using an abbreviated form of ReQuest™, (ReQuest in Practice™), scores obtained from the questionnaire were more accurate than the physicians' conventional clinical enquiry in identifying patients whose symptoms would still be controlled after stepping down from full dose to half dose PPI. In this context at least, therefore, prediction based on the systematic assessment of symptom burden is potentially valuable, being more reliable than ordinary clinical judgment.

### Gaviscon® vs. omeprazole in symptomatic treatment of moderate gastroesophageal reflux. a direct comparative randomised trial [^111W3CGe]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Choice of the lower limit

In non-inferiority studies, the lower limit is classically set at 50% of the reference substance effect in comparison to placebo. Previous studies showed that the time to a 24-h heartburn-free period was 19–21 days with placebo, 4–5 days with rabeprazole 20 mg, and 2 days with pantoprazole 20 mg or omeprazole 20 mg (at least 16 days' difference between placebo and PPI). Halving this difference gives a non-inferiority limit of 8 days, which was neither ethically nor clinically acceptable.

The most recent study reported a value of 1.8 ± 0.8 day for omeprazole 20 mg. The GOOD trial hypothesized that omeprazole 20 mg provides a time to onset of the first 24-h heartburn-free period of 2 ± 1 days. As patients recorded symptoms 4 times a day, the non-inferiority of Gaviscon ® would be demonstrated by a clinically relevant value of 0.5 days less than for omeprazole 20 mg.

For the non-inferiority test, the mean time difference in onset of the first 24-h heartburn-free period between treatment groups was used, with its 95%CI. If the lower limit (0.5 days) was within this confidence interval, the non-inferiority hypothesis was taken to be confirmed.

Sample size calculation

For an α-risk of < 5% and power of 95%, the requisite sample size was 88 assessable patient data sets per group. To allow for incomplete recording of symptoms by patients and loss to follow-up (< 10%), 30% extra patients were to be recruited: i.e. 120 patients per group. In all, 240 patients were required in order to meet the primary endpoint. 90 investigation centres were set up, recruiting three patients each with a 3.5 month deadline.

### AGA clinical practice update on the personalized approach to the evaluation and management of GERD: expert review [^111zeLSJ]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

As many as one-half of all patients with suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) do not derive benefit from acid suppression. This review outlines a personalized diagnostic and therapeutic approach to GERD symptoms.

Methods

The Best Practice Advice statements presented here were developed from expert review of existing literature combined with extensive discussion and expert opinion to provide practical advice. Formal rating of the quality of evidence or strength of recommendations was not the intent of this clinical practice update. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Clinicians should develop a care plan for investigation of symptoms suggestive of GERD, selection of therapy (with explanation of potential risks and benefits), and long-term management, including possible de-escalation, in a shared-decision making model with the patient. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Clinicians should provide standardized educational material on GERD mechanisms, weight management, lifestyle and dietary behaviors, relaxation strategies, and awareness about the brain-gut axis relationship to patients with reflux symptoms. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Clinicians should emphasize safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for the treatment of GERD. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Clinicians should provide patients presenting with troublesome heartburn, regurgitation, and/or non-cardiac chest pain without alarm symptoms a 4- to 8-week trial of single-dose PPI therapy. With inadequate response, dosing can be increased to twice a day or switched to a more effective acid suppressive agent once a day. When there is adequate response, PPI should be tapered to the lowest effective dose. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: If PPI therapy is continued in a patient with unproven GERD, clinicians should evaluate the appropriateness and dosing within 12 months after initiation, and offer endoscopy with prolonged wireless reflux monitoring off PPI therapy to establish appropriateness of long-term PPI therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: If troublesome heartburn, regurgitation, and/or non-cardiac chest pain do not respond adequately to a PPI trial or when alarm symptoms exist, clinicians should investigate with endoscopy and, in the absence of erosive reflux disease (Los Angeles B or greater) or long-segment (≥ 3 cm) Barrett's esophagus, perform prolonged wireless pH monitoring off medication (96-hour preferred if available) to confirm and phenotype GERD or to rule out GERD. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Complete endoscopic evaluation of GERD symptoms includes inspection for erosive esophagitis (graded according to the Los Angeles classification when present), diaphragmatic hiatus (Hill grade of flap valve), axial hiatus hernia length, and inspection for Barrett's esophagus (graded according to the Prague classification and biopsied when present). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Clinicians should perform upfront objective reflux testing off medication (rather than an empiric PPI trial) in patients with isolated extra-esophageal symptoms and suspicion for reflux etiology. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: In symptomatic patients with proven GERD, clinicians should consider ambulatory 24-hour pH-impedance monitoring on PPI as an option to determine the mechanism of persisting esophageal symptoms despite therapy (if adequate expertise exists for interpretation). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Clinicians should personalize adjunctive pharmacotherapy to the GERD phenotype, in contrast to empiric use of these agents. Adjunctive agents include alginate antacids for breakthrough symptoms, nighttime H2 receptor antagonists for nocturnal symptoms, baclofen for regurgitation or belch predominant symptoms, and prokinetics for coexistent gastroparesis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Clinicians should provide pharmacologic neuromodulation, and/or referral to a behavioral therapist for hypnotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, diaphragmatic breathing, and relaxation strategies in patients with functional heartburn or reflux disease associated with esophageal hypervigilance reflux hypersensitivity and/or behavioral disorders. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: In patients with proven GERD, laparoscopic fundoplication and magnetic sphincter augmentation are effective surgical options, and transoral incisionless fundoplication is an effective endoscopic option in carefully selected patients. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: In patients with proven GERD, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is an effective primary anti-reflux intervention in obese patients, and a salvage option in non-obese patients, whereas sleeve gastrectomy has potential to worsen GERD. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: Candidacy for invasive anti-reflux procedures includes confirmatory evidence of pathologic GERD, exclusion of achalasia, and assessment of esophageal peristaltic function.

### Strategies for discontinuation of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in patients with long-term PPI administration: a randomized controlled trial [^115iTWp5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Establishing a strategy to safely and securely discontinue PPI is considered very meaningful. Another meaningful point of this study is that by explaining this study, patients will understand that a PPI is a drug that must be taken while considering its necessity.

We predict that the proportion of patients who successfully discontinue PPI will be higher in the group in which PPI administration is gradually tapered and discontinued than in the group in which PPI administration is abruptly discontinued. On the other hand, we expect that many participants may succeed in discontinuing PPI regardless of the discontinuation strategy due to the explanation that discontinuation is necessary.

By comparing the background characteristics between participants who are able to discontinue PPI and those who are not able to discontinue PPI, it may be possible to clarify factors related to the difficulty of PPI discontinuation.
