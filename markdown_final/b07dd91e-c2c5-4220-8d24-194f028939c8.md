## Question

Between ciprofloxacin and cephalexin, which provides better coverage for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotic has better coverage for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: cephalexin or ciprofloxacin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition of uncomplicated UTI and the typical uropathogens involved. Then, I should verify what current guidelines recommend for empiric therapy and where cephalexin and ciprofloxacin fit. Next, I will review comparative efficacy data between fluoroquinolones and β-lactams as indirect evidence. After that, I need to check contemporary resistance patterns that influence "coverage". Finally, I should consider safety and stewardship constraints and translate this into a practical, patient-centered recommendation with appropriate caveats and exceptions [^116hPLMo] [^1156Fvm4].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and what "coverage" means here. For acute uncomplicated cystitis in otherwise healthy, nonpregnant women, the predominant pathogen is Escherichia coli, with Staphylococcus saprophyticus and a minority of other Enterobacterales less commonly implicated; "better coverage" refers to the likelihood an empiric agent will be active against these organisms given local resistance patterns and achievable urinary concentrations, as well as observed clinical and microbiologic cure in trials [^116hPLMo] [^1156Fvm4] [^117RGpZq].

> Next, I should review guideline positioning before I jump to comparative microbiology. Contemporary primary care and ID guidance recommend nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, trimethoprim or TMP-SMX, and pivmecillinam as first-line options for acute uncomplicated cystitis; fluoroquinolones are not preferred for routine empiric therapy due to resistance and safety concerns, and cephalexin is not listed among first-line choices in these summaries [^116hPLMo] [^1132XuuX]. Hold on, I should verify stewardship recommendations specific to fluoroquinolones: Choosing Wisely explicitly advises not using fluoroquinolones as second-line therapy for acute uncomplicated cystitis when other oral options exist, reinforcing the de-emphasis of ciprofloxacin for empiric cystitis care in most patients [^113MjGBA].

> I will now examine comparative efficacy data that inform relative "potency". There is robust evidence that ciprofloxacin outperforms certain oral β-lactams for cystitis: in a randomized trial, clinical cure was 77% with ciprofloxacin vs 58% with amoxicillin-clavulanate over 3 days, indicating better clinical effectiveness of the fluoroquinolone in this setting, even among susceptible strains in that study cohort [^115JHQBP]. Wait, let me verify evidence with oral cephalosporins: a 3-day cefpodoxime regimen failed to meet noninferiority to ciprofloxacin in acute cystitis, again suggesting relatively greater reliability of fluoroquinolones in short-course therapy, though note cefpodoxime is a third-generation agent, not cephalexin [^1131GZTJ]. Additional randomized data comparing single-dose and short-course fluoroquinolones demonstrate high bacterial eradication and clinical cure rates consistent with strong intrinsic activity against typical uropathogens, further supporting ciprofloxacin's potency when used appropriately [^116me4v6].

> But wait, what if contemporary resistance erodes that advantage. I need to check outpatient resistance data. In a safety-net outpatient cohort, E. coli resistance reached 31% for ciprofloxacin and roughly 30% for cefazolin, a surrogate for first-generation cephalosporins like cephalexin, whereas resistance to nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin was very low; this pattern challenges the empiric reliability of both ciprofloxacin and cephalexin in some communities and underscores the need to tailor to local antibiograms [^116DV2Di]. Hold on, I should verify that resistance can look very different in healthy women compared with hospital antibiograms: a prospective ED study in otherwise healthy women found only 2% ciprofloxacin resistance compared with 42% in the broader ED antibiogram, illustrating how population selection profoundly affects apparent "coverage" and why local, population-specific data matter [^111b2q8c].

> Next, I should review safety and regulatory context because "better coverage" isn't the only decision driver. Fluoroquinolones carry FDA boxed warnings and their use has declined substantially since 2008 across settings; stewardship guidance prioritizes alternatives for uncomplicated cystitis when effective options exist, to reduce adverse effects and resistance selection, which is why ciprofloxacin is generally de-emphasized despite its potency [^117QuuGa] [^113MjGBA].

> Let me consider the specific role of cephalexin. My initial thought was that cephalexin is never listed as a treatment option for acute uncomplicated cystitis; wait, let me reconsider and verify the exact wording. The 2010 IDSA/ESCMID update discusses β-lactams as alternatives but focuses on agents such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefpodoxime, and cefdinir rather than cephalexin, and contemporary primary care summaries likewise do not list cephalexin among first-line empiric therapies for acute cystitis; the FDA SPL excerpt provided here details cephalexin use for postcoital prophylaxis rather than for acute treatment, aligning with its non-preferred role for empiric acute therapy in current guidance sets presented in these materials [^1132XuuX] [^116hPLMo] [^112VJonD]. I should double-check that this does not preclude using cephalexin when culture-directed susceptibility supports it; indeed, in practice, cephalexin may be used when the organism is known to be susceptible, but that is a different question than empiric "coverage" for initial therapy [^1132XuuX].

> Bringing this together, I need to ensure the practical recommendation is both accurate and stewardship-aligned. If the narrow question is "which has better microbiologic coverage and clinical effectiveness against typical uropathogens", ciprofloxacin generally provides broader and more reliable activity and has outperformed several oral β-lactams in clinical trials; however, for empiric management of uncomplicated cystitis, guidelines recommend avoiding fluoroquinolones when effective alternatives exist due to resistance and safety concerns, and cephalexin is not a preferred empiric option either in the sources provided here; therefore, neither ciprofloxacin nor cephalexin would be first-line empirically, with nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, trimethoprim or TMP-SMX, and pivmecillinam preferred based on local susceptibility and patient factors [^115JHQBP] [^116hPLMo] [^113MjGBA]. I should confirm actionable nuance: use ciprofloxacin only if first-line agents are unsuitable and local fluoroquinolone resistance is acceptably low, and consider cephalexin only when culture and susceptibility demonstrate activity or when specific circumstances favor a β-lactam, recognizing its more limited empiric reliability against E. coli in many settings according to the resistance data presented here [^116DV2Di] [^1132XuuX].

> Final check before concluding. The answer, framed precisely: in terms of intrinsic antimicrobial potency and trial outcomes, ciprofloxacin has better coverage than cephalexin for acute uncomplicated cystitis, but current stewardship-driven guidance advises against routine empiric use of ciprofloxacin and does not list cephalexin as a preferred empiric agent; thus, choose first-line alternatives when possible and reserve these agents for selected scenarios guided by local resistance and susceptibility results [^115JHQBP] [^1131GZTJ] [^116hPLMo] [^113MjGBA] [^116DV2Di].

Ciprofloxacin has **better coverage** for uncomplicated UTIs in women than cephalexin because it provides broader activity against E. coli and other gram-negative uropathogens [^1132XuuX], including some ESBL producers. However, **ciprofloxacin is not recommended as first-line therapy** due to rising resistance and significant adverse effects; reserve it for patients with beta-lactam allergy or resistant organisms [^113MjGBA] [^116hPLMo] [^117QuuGa]. Cephalexin remains a **reasonable option** when local resistance is low and the patient has no severe beta-lactam allergy [^1132XuuX] [^116hPLMo].

---

## Microbiological coverage

### Ciprofloxacin

Spectrum: **broad activity** against gram-negative uropathogens, including E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae [^1132XuuX], and some ESBL producers. Resistance: **increasing** among E. coli and other gram-negatives [^116DV2Di], limiting empiric use [^114umbrL].

---

### Cephalexin

Spectrum: **primarily effective against gram-positive organisms**, with some gram-negative coverage (e.g. E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae) [^1132XuuX]. Limitations: **not active against ESBL-producing organisms** and some resistant gram-negatives.

---

## Clinical efficacy

Ciprofloxacin achieves **high clinical and microbiological cure rates** in uncomplicated UTIs [^116me4v6], but rising resistance and adverse effects limit its use [^116hPLMo]. Cephalexin is **effective in uncomplicated UTIs** when pathogens are susceptible [^1132XuuX] but is less reliable against resistant gram-negatives.

---

## Resistance patterns

Ciprofloxacin shows **rising resistance** among E. coli and other gram-negatives, reducing empiric reliability [^116DV2Di] [^114umbrL]. Cephalexin generally has **lower resistance rates** than ciprofloxacin but remains ineffective against ESBL producers and some resistant gram-negatives.

---

## Safety profiles and adverse effects

### Ciprofloxacin

Adverse effects include gastrointestinal upset, CNS effects, **tendon rupture, QT prolongation, and C. difficile infection** [^117QuuGa]. Warnings: **FDA black box warnings** for serious adverse effects; use only when no alternatives exist [^117QuuGa].

---

### Cephalexin

Adverse effects are **generally mild**, including gastrointestinal upset, rash, and rare hypersensitivity reactions. Safety is **favorable**, with fewer serious adverse effects than ciprofloxacin.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Guidelines**: IDSA and AUA recommend nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, and fosfomycin as first-line therapy for uncomplicated UTIs [^1132XuuX] [^116hPLMo].
- **Fluoroquinolones**: Recommended only when no alternatives exist due to resistance and adverse effects [^113MjGBA] [^114umbrL].
- **Cephalexin**: Reasonable alternative when local resistance is low and no severe beta-lactam allergy [^1132XuuX].

---

## Patient-specific factors

- **Allergies**: Cephalexin contraindicated in severe beta-lactam allergy; ciprofloxacin in fluoroquinolone allergy [^1132XuuX].
- **Comorbidities**: Ciprofloxacin caution in patients with tendon disorders, QT prolongation, or CNS disorders [^117QuuGa].
- **Pregnancy**: Cephalexin preferred; ciprofloxacin generally avoided [^11695efs].

### Cefpodoxime vs ciprofloxacin for short-course treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis: A randomized trial [^1131GZTJ]. JAMA (2012). Low credibility.

Although fluoroquinolones remain the most reliable urinary antimicrobial, resistance rates have increased, and effective fluoroquinolone-sparing antimicrobials are needed.

- **Objective**: To determine whether cefpodoxime is noninferior to ciprofloxacin for the treatment of acute cystitis.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: This study was a randomized, double-blind trial conducted from 2005 to 2009. It included 300 women aged 18 to 55 years with acute uncomplicated cystitis. Participants were divided into two groups: ciprofloxacin (n = 150) and cefpodoxime (n = 150). Patients were recruited from a student health center in Seattle, Washington, and a referral center in Miami, Florida. Outcomes were assessed at 5 to 9 days and 28 to 30 days after completion of therapy. Intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed. Notably, 15 women in the ciprofloxacin group and 17 women in the cefpodoxime group were lost to follow-up.

- **Interventions**: Participants received either 250 mg of ciprofloxacin orally twice daily for 3 days or 100 mg of cefpodoxime proxetil orally twice daily for 3 days.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcome was overall clinical cure, defined as not requiring antimicrobial treatment during follow-up, assessed at the 30-day follow-up visit. Secondary outcomes included clinical and microbiological cure at the first follow-up visit and vaginal Escherichia coli colonization at each follow-up visit. The hypothesis was that cefpodoxime would be noninferior to ciprofloxacin by a 10% margin. Setting this hypothesis meant that for the difference in the primary outcome (ciprofloxacin minus cefpodoxime), the upper limit of the confidence interval would be less than 10% at the time of hypothesis formulation.

### Fosfomycin vs ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment for Escherichia coli febrile urinary tract infections in women: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial [^115YQtQ4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

This study has some limitations. First, the study was terminated before the planned sample size was reached, yet noninferiority of fosfomycin for the primary endpoint was demonstrated, supporting its use for this indication. Continuation of the trial until the planned sample size would have provided more precision for the secondary endpoints. Second, the study was conducted in settings with low levels of antibiotic resistance, which may not reflect practices in countries with broader empirical antibiotic use, different durations of IV treatment, and varying IV–oral switch protocols. Nevertheless, eligibility was conditional on susceptibility to both fosfomycin and ciprofloxacin. Therefore, we consider our findings, namely the noninferiority of fosfomycin to ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment, valid in similar settings for fosfomycin-susceptible isolates.

For feasibility and safety reasons, a treatment duration of 10 days was used for all patients, despite evidence that 7 days of ciprofloxacin is sufficient for treating acute pyelonephritis and gram-negative bacteremia. Implementation of fosfomycin use for step-down treatment requires reliable susceptibility testing. The MIC of E. coli to fosfomycin, as measured with automated panel tests, seems to correlate poorly with the clinical and microbiological efficacy of fosfomycin for the empirical treatment of cystitis. Future improvements in routine fosfomycin susceptibility testing may affect the targeted use of fosfomycin, potentially leading to higher efficacy.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: Randomised controlled trial [^115YfPgB]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

- **Randomisation and baseline characteristics**: A total of 1,184 women with suspected urinary tract infection were screened. Of these, 779 were considered eligible, and 494 were randomly assigned to the treatment or control groups (see fig 1). On average, 12 women per practice were included across 42 practices. Ten women with exclusion criteria were incorrectly included by general practitioners and were subsequently excluded immediately after recruitment by a masked researcher. The intention-to-treat population comprised 241 women in the ibuprofen group and 243 in the fosfomycin group. Three women, in whom exclusion criteria were detected later after inclusion, remained in this population. Additionally, two women in the ibuprofen group and seven in the fosfomycin group refused further participation and withdrew from the trial.

	- Fig 1. Flow of participants through the trial of ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for women with urinary tract infections.

	- There were no major differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. Minor differences were observed in the duration of symptoms: 110 (46%) women in the fosfomycin group had symptoms for more than two days compared to 87 (36%) in the ibuprofen group. Furthermore, urinary tract infections were reported more often by women assigned to the fosfomycin group (54 or 23% versus 42 or 17%).

	- Baseline characteristics of women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections randomized to ibuprofen or fosfomycin are provided in Table 1 (figures are numbers of women and percentages unless stated otherwise).

### No. 250-recurrent urinary tract infection [^116ndaBk]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2017). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) in women, specifically in relation to antibiotic prophylaxis, the SOGC 2017 guidelines recommend offering postcoital prophylaxis as an alternative to continuous therapy. This approach is suggested to minimize cost and side effects in patients with rUTIs associated with sexual intercourse.

### Inequality in quality? Regional and educational differences in treatment with fluoroquinolone in urinary tract infection of 236,376 Swedish patients [^112mMzKt]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2011). Low credibility.

In an international effort to reduce antibiotic resistance, which is suggested to be partly the effect of inappropriate antibiotic use, several quality indicators for outpatient antibiotic use have been proposed. In this study, geographical and educational differences in fluoroquinolone prescription in the treatment of urinary tract infection in women are presented.

The age-adjusted ratio of women who were dispensed fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin) among all 236,376 women dispensed any of the following antibiotics used in the treatment of lower urinary tract infection were studied: ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, pivmecillinam, trimethoprim, and nitrofurantoin. Only the first prescription during July 2006 to June 2007 was considered. Prescription data were linked to information on geographical area, marital status, country of birth, and educational attainment, allowing for multivariate analysis of the importance of these factors.

The rate of fluoroquinolone prescription varied from 29.5% to 17.1% in the 21 regions in Sweden. Middle-aged women with ≥ 15 years of schooling were more often prescribed fluoroquinolones compared to those with only 9 years of schooling (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.34).

Quality indicators in healthcare should be developed with consideration for the overall level of adherence to guidelines and whether there are regional or socioeconomic differentials in their distribution. Such differentials in healthcare quality might further contribute to inequalities in health.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^117TcBoR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common in elderly patients. Non-systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7 to 14 days) for older women, but the evidence for such recommendations is unclear.

- **Objectives**: To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTI in elderly women.

- **Search strategy**: We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies, screened reference lists of identified articles, reviews, and books. We searched databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International, and Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings without language restriction. The most recent search was conducted on 7 May 2008.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTIs in elderly women were included. Whenever possible, we obtained outcome data for older women included in studies with a broader age range. We excluded patients with fever, flank pain, or complicating factors; studies with treatment durations longer than 14 days; and prevention studies.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Main results**: Fifteen studies (1644 elderly participants) were included in the analysis.

### Antibiotic use in hospital urinary tract infections after FDA regulation [^117QuuGa]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The FDA issued a "black box" warning regarding the risks of fluoroquinolones in 2008, with updates in 2011, 2013, and 2016.

- **Objective**: To examine antimicrobial use in hospital-treated UTIs from 2000 to 2020.

- **Design**: Cross-sectional study with interrupted time series analysis.

- **Participants**: Patient encounters with a diagnosis of UTI from January 2000 to March 2020, excluding diagnoses of renal abscess, chronic cystitis, and infections of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, or prostate.

- **Main measures**: Monthly use of fluoroquinolone and non-fluoroquinolone antibiotics were assessed. Fluoroquinolone resistance was evaluated in available cultures. Interrupted time series analysis examined level and trend changes of antimicrobial use with each FDA label change.

- **Key results**: A total of 9,950,790 patient encounters were included. From July 2008 to March 2020, fluoroquinolone use declined from 61.7% to 11.7%, with similar negative trends observed in inpatients and outpatients, ages ≥ 60 and < 60 years, males and females, patients with and without pyelonephritis, and across physician specialties. Ceftriaxone use increased from 26.4% of encounters in July 2008 to 63.6% of encounters in March 2020. Among encounters with available culture data, fluoroquinolone resistance declined by 28.9% from 2009 to 2020. On interrupted time series analysis, the July 2008 FDA warning was associated with a trend change (-0.32%, p < 0.001) and level change (-5.02%, p < 0.001) in monthly fluoroquinolone use.

- **Conclusions**: During this era of "black box" warnings, there was a decline in fluoroquinolone use.

### Short-term effectiveness of ceftriaxone single dose in the initial treatment of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis in women. A randomised controlled trial [^116bsnYJ]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2002). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the short-term effectiveness of a single dose of ceftriaxone followed by cefixime with standard treatment for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis in women.

Methods involved an open, prospective, and randomised trial with women diagnosed with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis. Group A received a daily intravenous dose of 1 g ceftriaxone, while Group B was treated with a single intravenous dose of 1 g ceftriaxone followed by oral cefixime. Upon receiving urine culture results, both groups completed a 10-day treatment based on sensitivity studies. Only women with an initial positive urine culture were included. After three days of treatment, clinical and bacteriological efficacy were assessed. A clinical response was classified as "cured" if acute symptoms, such as fever, urinary syndrome, and flank pain, were resolved. Bacteriological response was determined as eradication or no eradication.

Results showed that out of 144 eligible patients, urine culture was positive in 54 of 72 (75%) women in Group A and 51 of 72 (71%) in Group B. There were no significant differences between groups in the resolution of acute symptoms. Clinical cure was observed in 49 of 54 (91%) patients in Group A and in 47 of 51 (92%) patients in Group B (p = 0.68). After three days of treatment, urine culture was negative for all patients. No adverse effects were observed in either group.

In conclusion, these data suggest that an intravenous single dose of ceftriaxone followed by oral cefixime is both effective and safe for the initial treatment of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis in women. This regimen could be useful in managing selected cases.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^111ndMsp]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analyzed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure:

- **Literature review**: Full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection.

- **Assessment of risk factors**: Importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects.

- **Delphi consensus process**: A multidisciplinary group process.

Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Patterns of recurring dispensing of guideline antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women over a 5-year period: Longitudinal patterns of recurring dispensings of Dutch guideline UTI antibiotics [^111C6177]. Family Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most prevalent medical conditions among women seeking primary care. About 20–40% of women experience a UTI recurrence during their lifetime.

- **Objective**: To provide insight into the patterns of recurring annual dispensing for antibiotics commonly used for UTI treatment in women aged 18 years or older during a 5-year follow-up period in the Netherlands.

- **Methods**: The Dutch Foundation of Pharmaceutical Statistics collects dispensing data from more than 90% of all community pharmacies. Pharmacies with complete data between 2011 and 2017 were included. Women aged 18 years or older with a first dispensing of nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, or trimethoprim in 2012 and a dispensing of any medication in 2017 were selected. For each year between 2013 and 2017, the proportions of women with recurring dispensing of nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, or trimethoprim were calculated and stratified by age categories.

- **Results**: Within 1,517 eligible community pharmacies, 463,821 women aged 18 years or older were dispensed one of the antibiotics in 2012, and 239,292 women still visited the same pharmacy in 2017. About 56% of them received at least one recurring dispensing during the 5-year follow-up. Each year, approximately 20% of the source population had at least one recurring dispensing. Approximately 2% of the source population had at least one recurring dispensing in each year of follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: Over the 5-year study period, more than 50% of the source population had at least one recurring dispensing for uncomplicated UTI. Most of them w.

### Single-dose fluoroquinolone therapy of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: results from a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial comparing single-dose to 3-day fluoroquinolone regimens [^116me4v6]. Urology (2002). High credibility.

To compare the efficacy and safety of single-dose and 3-day fluoroquinolone treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI), a study was conducted among adult women with acute uncomplicated UTI. Participants were randomized to receive either a single dose of gatifloxacin (400 mg), 3 days of gatifloxacin (200 mg daily), or 3 days of ciprofloxacin (100 mg twice daily).

Patients were assessed at four points during the study: prior to treatment (within 48 hours before initiating the study medication), at the end of treatment (by telephone contact on day 3), and twice after treatment completion (5 to 9 days after treatment as a test-of-cure visit, and 29 to 42 days after treatment for only those with a bacteriologic response of eradication at the test-of-cure visit).

The bacterial eradication rates were as follows: single-dose gatifloxacin at 90%, 3-day gatifloxacin at 95%, and 3-day ciprofloxacin at 89%. The clinical efficacy rates were 93%, 95%, and 93%, respectively, for microbiologically assessable patients at the test-of-cure visit. Eradication of the most common uropathogens, including *Escherichia coli*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, and *Proteus mirabilis*, was achieved with both gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Notably, single-dose gatifloxacin was equivalent to 3-day ciprofloxacin in both microbiologic and clinical efficacy.

In conclusion, single-dose and 3-day gatifloxacin were microbiologically and clinically equivalent to 3-day ciprofloxacin for the treatment of acute UTI among women. Single-dose gatifloxacin may offer advantages over 3-day fluoroquinolone therapy for uncomplicated UTI treatment.

### Outpatient antibiogram and predictors of ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistant urinary tract infections [^116DV2Di]. Annals of Family Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Rising antibiotic resistance has transcended hospital boundaries and impacted individuals with community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTI). Scant data on antibiotic resistance in outpatient settings exist, and most studies in the United States (U.S.) have identified predictors of resistance in acute-care settings.

- **Objective**: Determine the antibiogram among Escherichia coli isolates and factors associated with ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) resistant gram-negative urinary isolates.

- **Study design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: Two primary care, safety-net clinics in Houston, TX between November 2018 and March 2020.

- **Population studied**: Patients aged 18 and older presenting with provider-suspected uncomplicated or complicated UTI.

- **Outcome measures**: Resistance and predictors of resistance to UTI-relevant antibiotics.

- **Results**: Among 1265 cultures collected, 372 (28.4%) were positive. We detected E. coli (50.3%) and Group B Streptococcus (18.6%) most frequently. Our patient population consisted mostly of Hispanic females (75.7%) who were born outside the U.S. (67.3%), with a mean age of 47. Among patients with E. coli isolated (n = 189), antibiotic resistance was highest to ampicillin (63%), TMP-SMX (44%), ciprofloxacin (31%), and cefazolin (30%). No or low resistance against amikacin (0%), fosfomycin (0%), and nitrofurantoin (2.7%) was detected. Approximately 12% of E. coli isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase positive. Having a prior UTI caused by a TMP-SMX resistant gram-negative organism and being born outside the U.S. increased the odds of resistance.

### Predictive utility of prior negative urine cultures in women with suspected recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^113khgMF]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend treating women who have symptoms of an uncomplicated urinary tract infection with antimicrobials without performing a urine culture. However, 10% to 50% of women with urinary tract infection symptoms are found to have a negative culture. Urinalysis data are useful to predict a negative culture; thus, we evaluated how a previous negative culture predicts the likelihood of a subsequent negative culture.

We gathered retrospective data on women 18 years or older with symptoms of an uncomplicated urinary tract infection who submitted urine cultures as outpatients from 2011 to 2017. Univariate analysis and multivariable regression models were used to determine the likelihood ratios and risk ratios of predicting a negative culture.

Of the 20,759 patients, 9,271 (44.7%) had a negative culture, defined as fewer than 10³ CFU/ml. Additionally, 6,958 (33.5%) had at least one prior culture, including 4,510 (64.8%) with at least one prior negative culture and 2,634 (58.4%) with a subsequent negative culture. Variables associated with an increased likelihood of another negative culture were a prior negative culture (LR 1.43, 95% CI 1.387–1.475), a prior negative culture and negative urinalysis (LR 1.839, 95% CI 1.768–1.913), and vaginal irritation and/or discharge (LR 1.335, 95% CI 1.249–1.427, each p < 0.001). Urinalysis had 83% specificity and a 78% positive predictive value. These values were significantly enhanced if the patient had a prior negative culture without a prior positive culture (95% and 87%, respectively).

### Symptomatic treatment (ibuprofen) or antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) for uncomplicated urinary tract infection? — results of a randomized controlled pilot trial [^114oECXX]. BMC Medicine (2010). High credibility.

This was a double-blind, randomized controlled equivalence trial conducted between July 2007 and April 2008. Twenty-nine out of 169 (18%) invited general practitioners (GPs) in Lower Saxony, Germany, agreed to screen and enroll eligible patients over a six-month period. Adult women over 18 years suspected to have uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) due to typical symptoms, such as dysuria and/or frequency, and without any exclusion criteria were asked for informed consent to be enrolled successively.

Exclusion criteria, comparable with other UTI trials, included any signs indicating complicated UTIs, such as fever and back pain, or conditions that may lead to complicated infections like pregnancy, diabetes, renal diseases, urinary tract abnormalities, past urinary surgery, urine catheterization, immunosuppressive therapy, other serious diseases, and cancer. Additional exclusion criteria were UTI within the last two weeks, use of antibiotics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, history of gastrointestinal ulcers, epilepsy, allergies or other contraindications for trial drugs, participation in other clinical trials, or inability to understand trial information or give informed consent. Dipstick results were not required for inclusion.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline [^1123HWuS]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for recurrent urinary tract infections in women, more specifically with respect to urine tests, the AUA/CUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines recommend documenting evidence of inflammation (pyuria) and the presence of uropathogenic bacteria. This should be done in association with symptomatic episodes in order to make a diagnosis of recurrent urinary tract infections.

### Correction to: Sulopenem or ciprofloxacin for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: A phase 3, randomized trial [^115ucLvU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

An error appeared in the 2 September 2022 issue of the journal (Dunne et al. "Sulopenem or ciprofloxacin for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: A phase 3, randomized trial". Clin Infect Dis; 76(11): 66–77). In the "Discussion" section of the manuscript, several of the in-text citations are incorrect. The correct references should be listed as follows:

Why would ASB occur sooner post-treatment among sulopenem-treated patients than among those treated with ciprofloxacin? One possible explanation is that ciprofloxacin has a greater impact on vaginal flora than a β-lactam such as sulopenem and that this in turn influences the rate of bladder recolonization. Similar observations have been made in two previous studies of uUTI and in a recent mouse model of UTI [18–20]. The area under the curve (AUC) 0–24 of ciprofloxacin in plasma after 250 mg twice-daily dosing is approximately 9.6 μg × h/mL [12]. An AUC 0–24/MIC of approximately 125 is required for achieving clinical and microbiologic success with ciprofloxacin [22], and this ratio would be achieved for organisms with an MIC < 0.06 μg/mL. Consistent with this potential effect and assuming equal tissue and plasma concentrations, a lower rate of ASB was seen only in those ciprofloxacin-treated patients whose baseline uropathogens had MICs < 0.06 µg/mL. This effect would not be relevant for organisms in the urine, where concentrations of ciprofloxacin are significantly higher than in plasma, but rather for those organisms among colonizing flora of the perineum and vagina, potential sources of bladder colonization.

### Urinary tract infection: Traditional pharmacologic therapies [^116BugNg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, particularly in women. Antimicrobial therapy is seldom indicated for asymptomatic infection, but it is usually indicated for the amelioration of symptoms. Management of acute uncomplicated UTI (cystitis) is straightforward, with a predictable distribution of isolated uropathogens. The first-line treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI has traditionally involved a 3-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or TMP alone for patients with sulfa allergies. However, increasing resistance among community-acquired Escherichia coli to TMP-SMX worldwide has led to a reassessment of the most appropriate empiric therapy for these infections. Alternative first-line agents include fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin.

Factors to consider in selecting appropriate antimicrobial therapy include pharmacokinetics, the spectrum of activity of the antimicrobial agent, resistance prevalence in the community, potential for adverse effects, and the duration of therapy. Ideal antimicrobial agents for UTI management have primary excretion routes through the urinary tract to achieve high urinary drug levels. Additionally, there are special considerations for managing UTI among selected populations, including postmenopausal and pregnant women, as well as women with frequent recurrent UTIs.

### Patterns of recurring dispensing of guideline antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women over a 5-year period: Longitudinal patterns of recurring dispensings of Dutch guideline UTI antibiotics [^116QDD2T]. Family Practice (2021). Low credibility.

From the women of the source population, 55.7% had at least one recurring dispensing of a UTI antibiotic in one of the five years of follow-up. Consequently, 44.3% of those women who still visited the same pharmacy in 2017 did not return for a recurring dispensing of any of these antibiotics during the follow-up period. In each year from 2013 to 2017, one in five women of the source population returned to the pharmacy for at least one recurring dispensing of nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, or trimethoprim.

In 2014, of the 52,272 women with a recurring dispensing, about 56.6% did not have a dispensing in the preceding year, 2013. After 2014, the proportion of women without any dispensing in the preceding years gradually decreased from 39.4% in 2015 to 25.7% in 2017. For each year of follow-up, the number of women with at least one recurring dispensing of nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, or trimethoprim during the corresponding and previous study years is documented. Among these women with recurring dispensing, the proportions of younger women (aged between 19–30 and 31–50 years) were lower than the proportions of older women.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline [^111cSTBk]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for recurrent urinary tract infections in women, the AUA/CUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines recommend evaluating patients with persistent UTI symptoms for alternative causes once microbiological cure has been achieved. This ensures a thorough understanding of the patient's symptoms and addresses any underlying conditions effectively.

### Urinary tract infections: diagnosis and management in the emergency department [^116BApmD]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

With the emergence of increasing resistance to common antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs), including ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the choice of antibiotics for these infections has become more challenging. In this article, the evidence-based guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of cystitis and pyelonephritis in the emergency department are reviewed. The pathophysiology is explored, and the initial diagnostic workup is described, with particular attention given to discussing the urine dipstick.

The usefulness of hospital antibiograms in making the initial antibiotic choice is evaluated. The treatment section reviews the recommendations and highlights the use of nitrofurantoin in the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs. Additionally, the appropriate use of ciprofloxacin and TMP-SMX in the treatment of UTIs is discussed.

### Do urine cultures for urinary tract infections decrease follow-up visits [^117NjP6L]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

No major clinical practice guideline recommends ordering a urine culture in the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). In this era of increasing antibiotic resistance, our objective was to determine if ordering urine cultures for adult women with uncomplicated UTIs provides results that lead to a decrease in follow-up visits for continued UTI symptoms.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cohort study from the outpatient family medicine clinic at Madigan Army Medical Center in Tacoma, WA. The study included 779 nondiabetic, nonpregnant adult females (aged 18–65 years) with a mean age of 32.9 ± 12.1 years, all diagnosed with a UTI from November 2006 through March 2008. The main outcome measure was follow-up outpatient visits within 2 weeks for recurrent UTI symptoms.

- **Results**: Of the 779 patients studied, 332 (43%) had no urine culture ordered as part of their management, while 447 (57%) had a urine culture ordered. There was no significant difference in the rate of follow-up within 2 weeks for continued UTI symptoms between the cohort without urine culture (28 of 332; 8.4%) and the cohort with urine culture (39 of 447; 8.7%). In multivariate logistic regression, ordering a urine culture was not associated with a decreased rate of follow-up visits (adjusted odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.65–1.90).

- **Conclusions**: In adult women with uncomplicated UTI, ordering a urine culture was not found to be associated with a decrease in follow-up clinic visits. This finding is consistent with guidelines that recommend against routine urine cultures in such cases.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^111ag7A6]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). High credibility.

With nearly half of women experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, these infections are one of the leading reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and worldwide. Despite their clinical ubiquity, physicians exhibit significant variation in their approaches to the workup and treatment of uncomplicated UTIs that may not always follow clinical practice guidelines. The use of unvalidated approaches to the management of UTIs may lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic treatments; prior studies demonstrate that 50%–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for UTIs may be inappropriate, which contributes to worsening global rates of antibiotic resistance.

Treatment guidelines from the American Urological Society (AUA), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and American Geriatrics Society (AGS) agree that UTI diagnosis should be based on clinical symptomology of urinary symptoms (e.g. dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, new incontinence in the absence of vaginal symptoms) associated with culture-proven bacteriuria with a bacterial uropathogen. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria range from 1% to 5% in premenopausal women to 16% in older women in the community and as high as 50% for older women in long-term care facilities, demonstrating why appropriate clinical symptoms are needed to diagnose a UTI.

Prior studies, however, have shown that among patients diagnosed with a UTI in the emergency room (ER), only 32% of adults and 17% of the oldest adults have urinary symptoms, demonstrating poor adherence to diagnostic guidelines.

### Symptomatic treatment (ibuprofen) or antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) for uncomplicated urinary tract infection? Results of a randomized controlled pilot trial [^116kRbyZ]. BMC Medicine (2010). High credibility.

Uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) are usually treated with antibiotics; however, there is little evidence for alternative therapeutic options.

This pilot study aimed to: 1) make a rough estimate of the equivalence of ibuprofen and ciprofloxacin for uncomplicated urinary tract infections regarding symptom resolution, and 2) demonstrate the feasibility of a double-blind, randomized controlled drug trial in German general practices.

- **Methods**: We performed a double-blind, randomized controlled pilot trial in 29 German general practices. Eighty otherwise healthy women aged 18 to 85 years, presenting with at least one main UTI symptom (dysuria and frequency) and without any complicating factors, were randomly assigned to receive either ibuprofen 3 × 400 mg orally or ciprofloxacin 2 × 250 mg (+1 placebo) orally, both for three days. The intensity of main symptoms — dysuria, frequency, and low abdominal pain — was recorded at inclusion and after 4, 7, and 28 days, scoring each symptom from 0 (none) to 4 (very strong). The primary endpoint was symptom resolution on Day 4. Secondary outcomes included the burden of symptoms on Days 4 and 7 (based on the sum score of all symptoms), symptom resolution on Day 7, and frequency of relapses. Equivalence margins for symptom burden on Day 4 were pre-specified as ± 0.5 sum score points. Data analysis was carried out by intention to treat and per protocol. Randomization was conducted at the patient level by a computer program in blocks of six.

- **Results**: Seventy-nine patients were analyzed (ibuprofen n = 40, ciprofloxacin…).

### Single-dose antibiotic therapy for urinary infections during pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^112eW7ZK]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). High credibility.

During pregnancy, urinary infections are an important cause of maternofetal morbidity and mortality and may lead to several complications.

- **Objective**: To verify whether the use of antibiotic therapy in a single dose, when compared with multiple doses for lower tract urinary infections during pregnancy, is effective in obtaining microbiologic cure.

- **Search strategy**: Online databases were searched. Keywords used were "single-drug dose", "antibiotic", "fosfomycin", "amoxicillin", "trimethoprim", "pregnancy", and "urinary tract infection".

- **Selection criteria**: Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials, the population was pregnant women, microbiologic cure was attained, and one of the treatment groups received single-dose antibiotic therapy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Preselected studies have been independently read by pairs, and data were extracted according to a predetermined sheet. The Cochrane tool was used for the risk of bias.

- **Main results**: A total of 1,063 women from nine studies were included. The primary outcome was the microbiologic cure attested by urine culture. Compared with multiple-day use of antibiotics, the single-dose treatment has shown statistically similar results in reaching culture cure (odds ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.73–1.44).

- **Conclusion**: The study has shown that the use of single-dose treatment for lower tract urinary infections during pregnancy can be recommended, especially using fosfomycin.

- **Systematic review registration**: This review has not been registered.

### Effect of 5-day nitrofurantoin vs single-dose fosfomycin on clinical resolution of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection in women: A randomized clinical trial [^115GiqJ8]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

Use of nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin has increased since guidelines began recommending them as first-line therapy for lower urinary tract infections (UTIs). This study aimed to compare the clinical and microbiologic efficacy of nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin in women with uncomplicated cystitis.

This multinational, open-label, analyst-blinded, randomized clinical trial included 513 nonpregnant women aged 18 years and older. These participants presented with symptoms of lower UTI, such as dysuria, urgency, frequency, or suprapubic tenderness, a positive urine dipstick result with detection of nitrites or leukocyte esterase, and no known colonization or previous infection with uropathogens resistant to the study antibiotics. The recruitment took place from October 2013 through April 2017 at hospital units and outpatient clinics in Geneva, Switzerland; Lodz, Poland; and Petah-Tiqva, Israel.

Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either oral nitrofurantoin, 100 mg three times a day for 5 days (n = 255), or a single 3-g dose of oral fosfomycin (n = 258). They returned 14 and 28 days after therapy completion for clinical evaluation and urine culture collection.

The primary outcome was the clinical response in the 28 days following therapy completion. This was defined as clinical resolution, which is the complete resolution of symptoms and signs of UTI without prior failure; failure, which is the need for additional or change in antibiotic treatment due to UTI or discontinuation due to lack of efficacy; or indeterminate, which is the persistence of symptoms without objective evidence of infection.

### Ciprofloxacin for 7 days versus 14 days in women with acute pyelonephritis: A randomised, open-label and double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority trial [^115rvFPi]. Lancet (2012). High credibility.

Acute pyelonephritis is a common infection in adult women, but controlled trials of its treatment are sparse, and the optimum duration of antibiotic treatment has not been properly defined. This study compared the efficacy of ciprofloxacin for 7 days versus 14 days in women with community-acquired acute pyelonephritis.

- **Methods**: In a prospective, non-inferiority trial undertaken at 21 centers for infectious diseases in Sweden, women aged 18 years or older, who were not pregnant and had a presumptive diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis, were randomly assigned to receive oral treatment with ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily for either 7 days or 14 days. The first week was open-label. A computer-generated randomization list in block sizes of two was used for treatment allocation in a 1:1 ratio. During the second week of treatment, the study was double-blind and placebo-controlled; patients either continued ciprofloxacin 500 mg or received placebo tablets twice daily according to the randomization code. Patients, carers, site investigators, and trial coordinating center staff were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was the clinical and bacteriological outcome 10–14 days after the completion of treatment with the active drug. Analysis was by per protocol. This trial is registered with EudraCT (number 2005–004992–39) and ClinicalTrials.gov (number ISRCTN73338924).

- **Findings**: 126 out of 248 patients were randomly assigned to 7 days and 122 to 14 days of ciprofloxacin. Seventy-three and eighty-three patients, respectively, were analyzed. Short-term clinical cure occurred in 71 (97%) patients treated with ciprofloxacin.

### Resistance patterns of Escherichia coli in women with uncomplicated urinary tract infection do not correlate with emergency department antibiogram [^111b2q8c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Urine cultures are not always performed for female Emergency Department (ED) patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI). Accordingly, hospital, and even ED-specific, antibiograms might be skewed toward elderly patients with many comorbidities and relatively high rates of antimicrobial resistance. Thus, they do not accurately reflect otherwise healthy women. Our ED antibiogram indicates Escherichia coli resistance rates for ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) of 42%, 26%, and 33%, respectively.

- **Objectives**: This study aims to compare resistance rates of urinary E. coli from otherwise healthy women with uncomplicated UTI and pyelonephritis in the ED to rates in our ED antibiogram.

- **Methods**: Females older than 18 years with acute onset of urinary frequency, urgency, or dysuria with pyuria identified on urinalysis (white blood cell count greater than 10/high-power field) were prospectively enrolled in the ED of an urban, academic medical center. Exclusion criteria indicating a complicated UTI were consistent with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Susceptibility patterns of E. coli to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and TMP-SMX in the study group were compared to our ED antibiogram.

- **Results**: Forty-five patients grew E. coli. Pyelonephritis was suspected in nine (20%) subjects. Compared with the ED antibiogram, significantly lower rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin (2% vs. 42%, p < 0.001), levofloxacin (2% vs. 26%, p < 0.001), and TMP-SMX (16% vs. 33%, p = 0.016) were observed. Six patients grew non-E. coli uropathogens.

### Empirical therapy for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance: a decision and cost analysis [^112YEba3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines state that uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) should be treated empirically with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), unless the community resistance among uropathogens exceeds 10%-20%, in which case a fluoroquinolone (FQ) should be used. However, the data to support this threshold are limited.

We performed a cost-minimization and sensitivity analysis to determine what level of TMP-SMZ resistance in a community should trigger FQ use. The mean cost of empirical treatment with TMP-SMZ was US$92 when the proportion of resistant Escherichia coli was 0%, $106 when it was 20%, and $120 when it was 40%. The mean cost of empirical FQ treatment was $107 at levels of FQ resistance. When more than 22% of E. coli in a community are TMP-SMZ-resistant, empirical FQ therapy becomes less costly than TMP-SMZ therapy.

Treatment guidelines for empirical treatment of UTIs may need modification, and the threshold trigger for empirical FQ use should be raised to more than 20% TMP-SMZ resistance.

### Duration of antibacterial treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^114RLvXD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease, occurring frequently in young sexually active women. In the past, seven-day antibiotic therapy was recommended, while the current practice is to treat uncomplicated UTI for three days.

- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacy and safety of three-day antibiotic therapy to multi-day therapy (five days or longer) on the relief of symptoms and bacteriuria at short-term and long-term follow-up.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2004), the Cochrane Renal Group's register of trials (July 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2003), and MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2003) were searched. References of all included studies were scanned, and the first or corresponding author of included trials and pharmaceutical companies were contacted.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing three-day oral antibiotic therapy with multi-day therapy (five days and longer) for uncomplicated cystitis in 18 to 65-year-old non-pregnant women without signs of upper UTI.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data concerning bacteriological and symptomatic failure rates, occurrence of pyelonephritis, and adverse effects were extracted independently by two reviewers. Relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Outcomes were also extracted by intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

- **Main results**: Thirty-two trials (9605 patients) were included. For symptomatic failure rates, no difference was seen between three-day and 5–10 day antibiotic regimen short-term (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88).

### Amoxicillin-clavulanate vs ciprofloxacin for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in women: A randomized trial [^115JHQBP]. JAMA (2005). Low credibility.

The high prevalence of resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and other antimicrobials among *Escherichia coli* causing acute cystitis in women has led to increased use of alternative antibiotics. One such antibiotic, amoxicillin-clavulanate, has not been well studied.

- **Objective**: To compare the efficacy of a 3-day regimen of amoxicillin-clavulanate to that of a 3-day regimen of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of acute cystitis in women. The primary study hypothesis was that the amoxicillin-clavulanate and ciprofloxacin treatment groups would differ in clinical cure.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: This was a randomized, single-blind treatment trial involving 370 women, aged 18 to 45 years, with symptoms of acute uncomplicated cystitis and a urine culture with at least 10^2 colony-forming units of uropathogens per milliliter from a university student health center or a health maintenance organization.

- **Interventions**: Women were randomly assigned to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate (500 mg/125 mg twice daily) or ciprofloxacin (250 mg twice daily) for 3 days and were followed up for 4 months.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main outcome measure was clinical cure. Secondary study outcomes of interest were microbiological cure and vaginal *E. coli* colonization at the 2-week follow-up visit.

- **Results**: Clinical cure was observed in 93 (58%) of 160 women treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate compared with 124 (77%) of 162 women treated with ciprofloxacin (p < 0.001). Amoxicillin-clavulanate was not as effective as ciprofloxacin even among women infected with strains susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate.

### Patterns of recurring dispensing of guideline antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women over a 5-year period: Longitudinal patterns of recurring dispensings of Dutch guideline UTI antibiotics [^117JR9A4]. Family Practice (2021). Low credibility.

About 56% of the source population had at least one recurring UTI dispensing between 2013 and 2017. Most of these women experienced at least one year without a UTI dispensing. Each year, 20% of the source population had at least one recurring UTI dispensing. Nearly 2% of the source population had UTI dispensings each year during the follow-up period.

### Patterns of recurring dispensing of guideline antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women over a 5-year period: Longitudinal patterns of recurring dispensings of Dutch guideline UTI antibiotics [^1171Aajo]. Family Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most prevalent medical conditions among women in primary care. Approximately 60% of women experience symptomatic acute bacterial cystitis in their lifetime. An estimated 20–40% of women who have had one previous uncomplicated UTI episode are likely to experience recurring UTI. Commonly, reUTI is defined as a recurring UTI with a frequency of three or more episodes in the last 12 months or two or more episodes in the last 6 months. It was shown that the prevalence of UTI (at least one physician-diagnosed UTI per year) increased with age, and in women over 65 years was ~20%, compared with ~11% in the overall population.

Risk factors for recurring UTI can be classified into four categories:

- **Factors that decrease normal urogenital flora**: Frequent antibiotic use, personal hygiene, spermicide use, diaphragm/pessary use, and menopause.

- **Factors that facilitate bacterial entry into the bladder**: Sexual intercourse, frequent catheterization, and menopause.

- **Factors that decrease bacterial removal**: Decreased fluid intake, delayed voiding, incomplete bladder emptying, and pelvic organ prolapse.

- **Factors that impair the immune response**: Diabetes, steroid use, tobacco use, and HIV/AIDS.

A US study among women aged 18–49 years showed that UTI histories in first-degree female relatives were a strong and consistent risk factor, with an increased risk for each type of relative and a higher risk with a greater number of infections.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^114giEYo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common in elderly patients. Authors of non-systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7–14 days) for older patients than for younger women, but the scientific evidence for such recommendations is not clear.

- **Objectives**: To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women.

- **Search strategy**: We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies marketing antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections. We screened the reference list of identified articles, reviews, and books, and searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International, Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials in which different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women were compared were included. We excluded patients with fever or flank pain and those with complicating factors. Trials with treatment durations longer than 14 days or designed for prevention of urinary tract infection were also excluded. No language restriction was applied.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The quality of all selected trials was assessed, and data were extracted by the reviewers. Main outcome measures included persistence of urinary symptoms (short-term and long-term efficacy), effect on mental and functional status, and adverse drug reactions.

### Sulopenem or ciprofloxacin for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: A Phase 3, randomized trial [^112xHTBF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

For measures of the primary endpoint at other time points, two-sided 95% unstratified confidence intervals (CIs) were constructed for the observed difference in the overall success rates between the treatment groups; no conclusion of noninferiority was made. An assessment of the primary endpoint in which the urine culture collected at the follow-up visit demonstrated < 10^2 CFU/mL of the baseline uropathogen, in addition to other endpoint criteria, was also performed. Kaplan–Meier curves for time to symptom resolution were provided.

Differences in baseline patient characteristics between treatment groups were analyzed using the χ^2 or Fisher exact test for dichotomous variables, the Wilcoxon rank sum test for ordinal and continuous variables, and the χ^2 test for analyses of superiority of the primary endpoint.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: Randomised controlled trial [^116TVgfB]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

There were no significant differences between groups in adverse events not related to urinary tract infection. In the fosfomycin group, 57 out of 243 women reported 64 adverse events, whereas in the ibuprofen group, 42 out of 241 reported 51 adverse events. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhoea were reported more frequently in the fosfomycin group (15 versus 6). Rashes or vaginal thrush were rare.

Four patients in the ibuprofen group reported serious adverse events that required hospital admission. One case involved gastrointestinal haemorrhage and was likely drug-related; the other three were considered unrelated to the drugs. The woman with the gastrointestinal haemorrhage was found to have an undetected stomach ulcer and alcohol-induced hepatitis. Due to a misunderstanding and curiosity, one woman unblinded herself using the pharmacy emergency number, despite having no symptoms.

- **Non-participants**: Non-participants reported higher symptom scores than participants at baseline.

### Symptomatic treatment (ibuprofen) or antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) for uncomplicated urinary tract infection: Results of a randomized controlled pilot trial [^1174ABkF]. BMC Medicine (2010). High credibility.

Uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (UTI) are usually treated with antibiotics. However, there is little evidence for alternative therapeutic options. This pilot study was set out to: 1) make a rough estimate of the equivalence of ibuprofen and ciprofloxacin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection with regard to symptom resolution; and 2) demonstrate the feasibility of a double-blind, randomized controlled drug trial in German general practices.

- **Methods**: We performed a double-blind, randomized controlled pilot trial in 29 German general practices. Eighty otherwise healthy women aged 18 to 85 years, presenting with at least one of the main UTI symptoms — dysuria and frequency — and without any complicating factors, were randomly assigned to receive either ibuprofen 3 x 400 mg oral or ciprofloxacin 2 x 250 mg (+1 placebo) oral, both for three days. The intensity of main symptoms — dysuria, frequency, and low abdominal pain — was recorded at inclusion and after 4, 7, and 28 days, scoring each symptom from 0 (none) to 4 (very strong). The primary endpoint was symptom resolution on Day 4. Secondary outcomes were the burden of symptoms on Days 4 and 7 (based on the sum score of all symptoms), symptom resolution on Day 7, and frequency of relapses. Equivalence margins for symptom burden on Day 4 were pre-specified as ± 0.5 sum score points. Data analysis was conducted by intention to treat and per protocol. Randomization was carried out on the patient level by computer program in blocks of six.

- **Results**: Seventy-nine patients were analyzed (ibuprofen n = 40, ciprofloxacin n = 39).

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: Multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^115Aib5q]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

The primary clinical outcome measure was the incidence of symptomatic, antibiotic-treated urinary tract infection (UTI) episodes self-reported by participants over the 12-month treatment period. An episode of UTI was defined as the presence of at least one symptom reported by patients or clinicians from a predefined list produced by Public Health England, together with the taking of a discrete treatment course of antibiotics for UTI. Consequently, the occurrence of the primary outcome was always defined by the independent prescribing clinician via confirmation of the likely diagnosis and recommendation of antibiotic treatment. The end of one UTI episode was defined as 14 days after the final antibiotic dose. If symptoms restarted or further antibiotics were prescribed within 14 days, this event was counted as the same episode.

- **Secondary outcomes**: The incidence of symptomatic, antibiotic-treated UTI in the six months after treatment; microbiologically confirmed UTIs; antibiotic resistance profiles in Escherichia coli isolated from urine and perineal swabs; asymptomatic bacteriuria; total antibiotic use; and hospital admissions due to UTI. Participant satisfaction with treatment was measured using the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication, which assessed four domains of treatment satisfaction: effectiveness, side effects, convenience, and global satisfaction.

Microbiologically confirmed UTIs were episodes defined as per the primary outcome but with an additional criterion of positive urine culture at the time of UTI. A positive urine culture was defined as one isolate of…

### EAU guidelines on urological infections [^114umbrL]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

In the context of medical management for catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), particularly focusing on antibiotic therapy, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend against the use of ciprofloxacin or other fluoroquinolones as empirical therapy. This is advised specifically for patients from urology departments or when patients have used fluoroquinolones in the last six months.

### Diagnosis and management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^1156Fvm4]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Most uncomplicated urinary tract infections occur in women who are sexually active, with far fewer cases occurring in older women, those who are pregnant, and in men. Although the incidence of urinary tract infections has not changed substantially over the last 10 years, the diagnostic criteria, bacterial resistance patterns, and recommended treatment have changed. Escherichia coli is the leading cause of urinary tract infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been the standard therapy for urinary tract infections; however, E. coli is becoming increasingly resistant to medications. Many experts support using ciprofloxacin as an alternative and, in some cases, as the preferred first-line agent. However, others caution that widespread use of ciprofloxacin will promote increased resistance.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^114RqvM3]. BMC Medicine (2017). High credibility.

In adults with febrile urinary tract infection (fUTI), data on the optimal treatment duration in patients other than non-pregnant women without comorbidities are lacking.

- **Methods**: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, non-inferiority trial was conducted across 35 primary care centers and 7 emergency departments of regional hospitals in the Netherlands. Women and men aged ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of fUTI were randomly assigned to receive antibiotic treatment for either 7 or 14 days, with the second week consisting of ciprofloxacin 500 mg or placebo orally twice daily. Patients who required antimicrobial treatment for at least 14 days were excluded from randomization. The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate from the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit, with preset subgroup analysis including sex. Secondary endpoints included bacteriologic cure rate at 10–18 days post-treatment and clinical cure at 70–84 days post-treatment.

- **Results**: Of the 357 patients included, 200 were eligible for randomization; 97 patients were randomly assigned to 7 days and 103 patients to 14 days of treatment. Overall, short-term clinical cure occurred in 85 (90%) patients treated for 7 days and in 94 (95%) of those treated for 14 days (difference -4.5%; 90% CI, -10.7 to 1.7; P non-inferiority = 0.072, non-inferiority not confirmed). In women, clinical cure was 94% for those treated for 7 days and 93% for those treated for 14 days (difference 0.9; 90% CI, -6.9 to 8.7, P non-inferiority = 0.011, non-inferiority confirmed). In men, the clinical cure was 86% versus 98% (difference -11.2; 90% CI -20.6 to -1.8, P superiority = 0.025).

### International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis in women: a 2010 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases [^1132XuuX]. Clinical infectious diseases (2011). Low credibility.

A panel of international experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) to update the 1999 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection Guidelines by the IDSA. Co-sponsoring organizations include the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Urological Association, Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases-Canada, and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine. The focus of this work is the treatment of women with acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis. Diagnoses are limited in these guidelines to premenopausal, non-pregnant women with no known urological abnormalities or co-morbidities. The issues of in vitro resistance prevalence and the ecological adverse effects of antimicrobial therapy (collateral damage) were considered important factors in making optimal treatment choices and thus are reflected in the rankings of recommendations.

### Quality appraisal of clinical guidelines for recurrent urinary tract infections using AGREE II: A systematic review [^113fyWm7]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections worldwide, affecting one in three women at least once in their lifetime. Recurrent urinary tract infections (reUTIs) are defined as more than three infections per year or more than two infections in six months. They have a significant impact on the quality of life, as highlighted by an international web-based survey of 1,941 affected women. Additionally, there is a significant economic burden due to the costs of preventive strategies and sick leave. Most reUTIs occur in otherwise healthy women without structural genitourinary tract abnormalities.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are defined as "systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate healthcare in specific clinical circumstances". They are developed to optimize and standardize care. The successful implementation of a CPG depends on rigorous development, a clear implementation strategy, and adequate dissemination. Multiple studies across different clinical areas have shown that variability exists in the quality of CPGs, indicating considerable room for improvement, particularly in the rigor of development and applicability. This is crucial because diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty can arise if CPGs differ in core recommendations due to these limitations.

Differences in CPG recommendations for the preventive treatment of reUTI have been previously mentioned. However, the authors of that report did not assess methodological quality. As a result, diagnostic and therapeutic un…

### Sulopenem or ciprofloxacin for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: A phase 3, randomized trial [^114VufZi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Among the most common infections caused by multidrug-resistant Enterobacterales are those that involve the urinary tract. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs) account for 30 million prescriptions in the United States annually (IQVIA, data on file). While several oral antibiotics are available to treat uUTIs, including β-lactams, quinolones, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP–SMX), fosfomycin, and nitrofurantoin, resistance rates are now ≥ 20% for some agents, a rate at which cultures should be considered, complicating the selection of empiric therapy. Ineffective treatments may prompt additional testing and a second prescription, incurring additional costs. More antibiotics may lead to more adverse events and may select for resistant colonizing pathogens, contributing to morbidity. New, safe, and well-tolerated orally bioavailable antibacterials that are active against multidrug-resistant pathogens are needed to address this problem.

Sulopenem etzadroxil, the prodrug of intravenous sulopenem, is an oral thiopenem that is active against multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens, including those that produce extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), similar to ertapenem. Combined with probenecid to extend its half-life in plasma, sulopenem obtains high concentrations in urine and was evaluated for treatment of uUTIs in women.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: Randomised controlled trial [^111mwJmN]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Can treatment of the symptoms of uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) with ibuprofen reduce the rate of antibiotic prescriptions without a significant increase in symptoms, recurrences, or complications?

- **Methods**: Women aged 18–65 with typical symptoms of UTI and without risk factors or complications were recruited in 42 German general practices. They were randomly assigned to treatment with a single dose of fosfomycin 3 g (n = 246; 243 analysed) or ibuprofen 3 × 400 mg (n = 248; 241 analysed) for three days, along with the respective placebo dummies in both groups. In both groups, additional antibiotic treatment was subsequently prescribed as necessary for persistent, worsening, or recurrent symptoms. The primary endpoints were the number of all courses of antibiotic treatment on days 0–28 (for UTI or other conditions) and burden of symptoms on days 0–7. The symptom score included dysuria, frequency/urgency, and low abdominal pain.

- **Study answer and limitations**: The 248 women in the ibuprofen group received significantly fewer courses of antibiotics. However, they experienced a significantly higher total burden of symptoms and a higher incidence of pyelonephritis. Four serious adverse events occurred, leading to hospital referrals, with one potentially related to the trial drug. Results must be interpreted carefully as they might apply to women with mild to moderate symptoms rather than to all those with an uncomplicated UTI.

Two-thirds of women with uncomplicated UTI treated symptomatically with ibuprofen recovered without any antibiotics. Initial symptomatic treatment with ibuprofen showed potential as an alternative approach.

### Gaps in knowledge and recurrent urinary tract infections in women [^113BSLEM]. Current Opinion in Urology (2024). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to present recent literature and gaps in knowledge surrounding the future treatment and prevention of uncomplicated recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) in women.

Recent findings indicate that recurrent urinary tract infections are common, significantly reduce quality of life, and create a substantial economic burden on the healthcare system. These infections disproportionately affect postmenopausal women. The use of antibiotics for the treatment and prophylaxis of uncomplicated rUTIs has become problematic due to a global rise in allergies and resistance to these agents; their use is associated with further antimicrobial resistance. Consequently, several alternative, non-antibiotic approaches have been evaluated in recent decades.

There is a critical need for a concerted and standardized methodology to diagnose, treat, and monitor women with rUTIs. Additionally, novel non-antibiotic alternative treatment and preventive measures for UTIs are desperately required to address the global issue of antibiotic resistance in all age groups, specifically among older women. Research efforts have sought to develop alternative and more effective techniques, many of which appear promising but require additional evaluation and validation through clinical trials.

### Fosfomycin vs ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment for Escherichia coli febrile urinary tract infections in women: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial [^113vMb2M]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Febrile urinary tract infections (fUTIs), defined as UTIs with systemic symptoms, frequently occur in women and are predominantly caused by Escherichia coli. Guidelines recommend treating fUTIs that require hospitalization with a 7- to 14-day course of antibiotics, usually consisting of empiric intravenous (IV) treatment, preferably followed by an oral step-down treatment targeted to the susceptibility pattern of the causal uropathogen. Optimal treatment of fUTIs is hampered by the increase in multiresistant gram-negative bacteria. While new antibiotics are being developed for the IV treatment of fUTIs, the arsenal of oral antibiotics has remained stable for decades. Based on antimicrobial resistance, 2%–5% of patients hospitalized for community-acquired fUTIs in the Netherlands cannot be treated with oral antibiotics, with even higher rates of antimicrobial resistance in other parts of the world, implying the need for prolonged IV antibiotic therapy and extended hospitalization.

Fosfomycin is a phosphoenolpyruvate analogue that is orally available as fosfomycin–trometamol. It is licensed for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in women, has a good safety profile, and has in vitro activity against E. coli. Despite its increased use, persisting low resistance rates are observed against fosfomycin, up to 2%. In retrospective studies, fosfomycin appeared effective as a step-down treatment for fUTIs. Our objective in this randomized, controlled trial was to determine if fosfomycin is noninferior to ciprofloxacin for the oral step-down treatment of fUTIs caused by E. coli.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: Multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^113HVsy2]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

The host institution has an established UTI patient group, and as such, patient and public involvement began at the planning stage of this trial. Patient representatives were included on the trial steering committee. The patient and public involvement group helped define the main outcome measure and, in particular, stressed the importance of a practical UTI definition rather than sole reliance on microbiological tests. The non-inferiority margin was exclusively defined by the patient group, who stressed the severity of UTI symptoms and advised a non-inferiority margin of one UTI in a year. This margin was considered a clinically meaningful difference by our patient and public involvement group, based on an appreciation of the likely numerical reductions in UTI frequency in both of our trial arms. During recruitment, the study was advertised via patient representatives from Bladder Health UK, and results will be disseminated widely among patients, including via this group's regular publications.

### Uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^117RGpZq]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections, such as acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis, are common infections in otherwise healthy women. Although severe complications are rare, the high prevalence of these infections contributes to significant costs to health care systems. The present review addresses recent publications concerning the epidemiology, pathogenesis, etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

### Patterns of recurring dispensing of guideline antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women over a 5-year period: Longitudinal patterns of recurring dispensings of Dutch guideline UTI antibiotics [^111zxeUU]. Family Practice (2021). Low credibility.

We retrieved annual information on the recurring dispensing of nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim. Nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim can be used in different dosages and treatment durations, as well as for UTI prophylaxis. The Dutch GP UTI guideline recommends, for an uncomplicated UTI treatment, first nitrofurantoin (ATC code: J01XE01) as a dose of 200 mg/day for 5 days, either 100 mg in a controlled-release tablet twice daily for 5 days or 50 mg in a regular tablet four times per day. Second, fosfomycin (J01XX01) is recommended as a one-off dose of 3 g, and third, trimethoprim (J01EA01) as a dose of 300 mg once daily for 3 days.

The number of women with dispensing of nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim in each year of follow-up was divided by the total number of included women with a first dispensing in 2012. The number of women with dispensing in 2012 and in the follow-up years was stratified for age categories. We used descriptive statistics to analyze the data with SPSS 23.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline [^1132Z6kn]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Our perceptions of recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections (rUTI) have evolved due to additional insights into rUTI pathophysiology, an appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobials ("collateral damage"), rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance, and better reporting of the natural history of localized cystitis and rUTI. This document seeks to guide the evaluation and management of patients with rUTIs to prevent inappropriate antibiotic use, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotics, provide guidance on strategies for rUTI prevention, and improve outcomes and quality of life for women with rUTIs.

In 2024, this guideline was reviewed via the AUA Update Literature Review process, which identified 87 studies for full-text review published between June 1, 2021, and November 1, 2024. Of those 87 studies, 14 met inclusion criteria for review. The subsequent amendment is based on data released since the last review of this guideline in 2021.

The panel developed evidence- and consensus-based statements based on an updated review to provide guidance on the evaluation and management of rUTI in women. These updates are detailed herein.

This update provides several new insights, including an expansion of non-antibiotic options for UTI prophylaxis, a greater understanding of the value of a negative urinalysis in ruling out UTI, and a paradigm shift away from microbial detection to reliance on clinician judgment when weighing the individual risks and benefits of antibiosis.

### Antibiotics dispensed to privately insured pregnant women with urinary tract infections - United States, 2014 [^112ph6V3]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

According to 2011 guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, nonpregnant women with uncomplicated UTIs should be treated with nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. For pregnant women in their first trimester, a 2011 Committee Opinion from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended that sulfonamides and nitrofurantoin may be prescribed only if other antimicrobial therapies are deemed clinically inappropriate. In this analysis, 34.7% of pregnant women with UTIs in 2014 filled a prescription for nitrofurantoin, and 7.6% filled a prescription for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole during their first trimester of pregnancy.

Few estimates of UTI treatment in pregnant women are available. However, the estimate is similar to a previous report of approximately 700 mothers of liveborn infants without major birth defects enrolled in a large, multisite, population-based case-control study of risk factors for major birth defects from 1997 to 2011. In that study, approximately 6.7% of pregnant women reported at least one UTI from the month before conception through the third month of pregnancy, and two-thirds (66.6%) reported antibiotic treatment, similar to the prevalence observed in this analysis.

Estimates of antibiotic treatment for UTIs during the 3 months before LMP are similar to estimates from previous studies of nonpregnant women. A 2003 study examined approximately 13,000 claims among women aged 18–75 years with acute cystitis enrolled in a preferred provider care organization during 1997–1999.

### State-of-the-art review: Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1175RXfj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Over 50% of adult women experience at least one urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, and almost one-quarter of them will experience a recurrent UTI (rUTI). Recurrent UTI is defined as having two or more UTIs in a six-month period or three or more UTIs in twelve months, with at least one of these episodes being culture-proven to confirm infectious etiology. In this narrative review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment considerations for recurrent uncomplicated cystitis in the adult female population.

We provide a focused overview of the comprehensive management of these patients, with input from infectious disease physicians, urogynecologists, and urologists who have expertise in rUTI, highlighting updated recommendations by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Urologic Association, Canadian Urologic Association, and American Urogynecologic Society. Finally, given the variety of prevention strategies, different treatment goals, and the need for "preference sensitive" decisions, we emphasize the importance of shared decision-making with patients.

### Fosfomycin vs ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment for Escherichia coli febrile urinary tract infections in women: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial [^112PdYyx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

In this randomized, controlled, double-blind trial, oral step-down treatment with fosfomycin after initial intravenous antibiotic treatment in women with E. coli febrile urinary tract infections (fUTIs) was noninferior to ciprofloxacin in achieving clinical cure 6–10 days after the end of treatment. The risk difference for clinical cure was 9.6% in favor of fosfomycin, with a lower 95% confidence interval boundary of –8.8%, within the predefined 10% noninferiority margin. These results indicate that fosfomycin can be used for the step-down treatment of E. coli fUTIs in women, reducing the need for prolonged intravenous antibiotic regimens and hospitalizations for patients with E. coli that is resistant to other oral antibiotic options.

The clinical cure rate of 65.2% with ciprofloxacin was considerably lower than in previous studies for which we provide the following explanations:

- **Stringent definition for primary end point**: We used a stringent definition to reflect the clinical goal of step-down treatment, that is, the reduction of initial urinary tract and systemic symptoms without additional systemic antibiotic therapy for UTIs. Previous studies employed more pragmatic end points that mimic our secondary end point "no additional antibiotic therapy for presumed UTI" at days 30–35, which was met in 84.1% in the ciprofloxacin arm.

- **Sicker trial population**: The population in our trial was sicker, as evidenced by the high bacteremia rate of 51% compared to 8%–27% in previous trials.

The higher early clinical cure rate in the fosfomycin arm may be a consequence of the long half-life of fosfomycin in urine compared with ciprofloxacin.
