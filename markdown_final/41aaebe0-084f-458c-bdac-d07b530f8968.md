## Question

dilute ceftriaxone with normal saline and set velocity for drip

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to dilute ceftriaxone with normal saline and set the appropriate infusion rate for an IV drip, including details on preparation, recommended infusion time, concentration, safety checks, and practical steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled infusion time and whether 30 minutes is the standard for adults. Then, I should verify the recommended concentration range for IV infusion and whether normal saline is an appropriate diluent. Next, I will calculate a practical dilution example for a 1 g dose and double-check the math. After that, I need to review key safety constraints, especially calcium-containing solutions and neonatal precautions. Finally, I will consider special populations, stability, and administration technique, and then synthesize a concise, clinically actionable answer with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the labeled infusion time so I don't jump to conclusions. Multiple FDA sources consistently instruct that ceftriaxone should be administered intravenously by infusion over 30 minutes for adults, with neonates requiring 60 minutes to mitigate bilirubin encephalopathy risk, so the default adult infusion duration is 30 minutes, not faster, unless a protocolized exception applies [^111TSdNw] [^112qNb4N] [^111cJpAd].

> Wait, let me verify the concentration range before calculating volumes. The FDA labeling recommends IV concentrations between 10 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL, and normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) is an appropriate and commonly used diluent for these concentrations, which aligns with compatibility data and OPAT guidance emphasizing stability across common IV solutions and containers [^111TSdNw] [^112qNb4N] [^112LjuHA].

> I will now examine a practical dilution for a 1 g adult dose. Targeting a mid-range concentration of 20 mg/mL, I need 1000 mg divided by 20 mg/mL, which equals 50 mL total volume, so I should dilute 1 g ceftriaxone to 50 mL normal saline and infuse over 30 minutes, and I should double-check that this sits squarely within the 10–40 mg/mL window, which it does [^111TSdNw] [^112qNb4N].

> Hold on, I should verify the calcium warning because this is a frequent pitfall. Ceftriaxone must not be reconstituted or co-administered with calcium-containing solutions such as Ringer's, Hartmann's, or lactated Ringer's due to risk of ceftriaxone–calcium precipitation, and in neonates this is contraindicated outright given reported fatalities, so I need to ensure the line is flushed thoroughly if calcium-containing infusions are used sequentially in older patients [^115jt1BQ] [^113z34FU] [^116U4tTJ] [^111jiHkG].

> Let me consider special populations so I don't overgeneralize. In neonates, extend the infusion to 60 minutes and avoid any calcium exposure, in pediatrics the same concentration range and 30-minute infusion generally apply with weight-based dosing, and in older adults or those with severe renal or hepatic impairment, I should confirm whether dose adjustments are needed — FDA labeling notes no routine adjustment for renal or hepatic impairment up to 2 g/day, but some summaries advise a maximal 2 g/day if both organs are severely impaired, so I should reconcile this with local policy and patient-specific factors [^115jt1BQ] [^111TSdNw] [^115ySYZD] [^111z5EAZ].

> Next, I should review administration technique and compatibility. After reconstitution, ceftriaxone should be diluted to the desired concentration in normal saline and infused over 30 minutes, and if other antimicrobials like vancomycin, aminoglycosides, or fluconazole are required, they should be given sequentially with a compatible flush between doses to avoid incompatibility, which is particularly important in busy infusion settings [^111TSdNw] [^117BmusM] [^116praxK].

> I need to ensure stability and visual inspection steps are not overlooked. Ceftriaxone solutions in the 10–40 mg/mL range are stable at room temperature for 24 hours in normal saline or dextrose, and I should always inspect for particulates or discoloration before administration, discarding if anything is abnormal, which is a simple but critical safety check [^111TvmfJ].

> But wait, what if rapid administration is being considered? Some emergency departments have used IV push for ceftriaxone during shortages with low observed adverse reaction rates, yet this remains off-label and should be reserved for institutional protocols with established safety monitoring, so I should not generalize IV push outside such frameworks [^1133com2] [^114rgHiN].

> Let me reconsider the final synthesis to ensure internal consistency. For a 1 g adult dose, dilute to 50 mL in normal saline for a final concentration of 20 mg/mL and infuse over 30 minutes, confirm the solution is clear and free of particulates, avoid any calcium-containing solutions in the same line, and extend to 60 minutes in neonates, adjusting for pediatric weight-based dosing and any organ impairment considerations per local policy and labeling nuances [^111TSdNw] [^112qNb4N] [^115jt1BQ].

Ceftriaxone should be diluted to **10–40 mg/mL in 0.9% NaCl** [^111TvmfJ] for IV infusion, and each dose should be administered over **30 minutes** [^112qNb4N] for adults and children older than 28 days. For neonates, infuse over **60 minutes** [^115jt1BQ] to reduce the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy. Avoid calcium-containing solutions (e.g. Ringer's, lactated Ringer's) [^116U4tTJ] due to precipitation risk; flush the line between sequential administrations if calcium is needed [^117FriqZ]. Adjust the dose for renal or hepatic impairment [^115ySYZD] and monitor for hypersensitivity [^112Ajo21] and biliary sludging [^112tbfZf].

---

## Recommended dilution and concentration

- **Diluent**: 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline) is appropriate and compatible for IV infusion [^111TvmfJ].

- **Concentration**: Dilute to 10–40 mg/mL (1–4 g per 100 mL) [^111TSdNw]; lower concentrations may be used if needed [^111cJpAd].

- **Example**: 1 g ceftriaxone in 100 mL normal saline yields 10 mg/mL; 2 g in 100 mL yields 20 mg/mL.

---

## Recommended infusion time (velocity)

- **Adults and children > 28 days**: Infuse over 30 minutes [^111TSdNw] [^112qNb4N].

- **Neonates (≤ 28 days)**: Infuse over 60 minutes [^115jt1BQ] to reduce bilirubin encephalopathy risk [^115jt1BQ].

- **Rapid infusion**: Avoid; increased risk of biliary sludging and precipitates [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations and precautions

- **Calcium-containing solutions**: Do not mix with Ringer's or lactated Ringer's [^113z34FU]; precipitation can occur. If sequential use is necessary, flush thoroughly between infusions [^117FriqZ].

- **Renal/hepatic impairment**: Adjust dose if both are significantly impaired [^115ySYZD]; monitor for neurological adverse effects [^112Ajo21].

- **Hypersensitivity**: Monitor for reactions; discontinue if severe allergy occurs [^112Ajo21].

Clinical Pharmacology

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Average plasma concentrations of ceftriaxone following a single 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion of a 0.5, 1 or 2 g dose and intramuscular (IM) administration of a single 0.5 (250 mg/ml or 350 mg/ml concentrations) or 1 g dose in healthy subjects are presented in Table 1.

TABLE 1. Ceftriaxone Plasma Concentrations After Single Dose Administration

*IV doses were infused at a constant rate over 30 minutes.

ND = Not determined.

Ceftriaxone was completely absorbed following IM administration with mean maximum plasma concentrations occurring between 2 and 3 hours post-dose. Multiple IV or IM doses ranging from 0.5 to 2 g at 12- to 24-hour intervals resulted in 15% to 36% accumulation of ceftriaxone above single dose values. Ceftriaxone concentrations in urine are shown in Table 2.

TABLE 2. Urinary Concentrations of Ceftriaxone After Single Dose Administration

ND = Not determined.

Thirty-three percent to 67% of a ceftriaxone dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug and the remainder was secreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as microbiologically inactive compounds. After a 1 g IV dose, average concentrations of ceftriaxone, determined from 1 to 3 hours after dosing, were 581 mcg/ml in the gallbladder bile, 788 mcg/ml in the common duct bile, 898 mcg/ml in the cystic duct bile, 78.2 mcg/g in the gallbladder wall and 62.1 mcg/ml in the concurrent plasma

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme arthritis persistent after oral antibiotics — IV ceftriaxone use is supported by the guideline's rationale: Resolution of cases of Lyme arthritis with ceftriaxone tends to be higher than with other oral antibiotics or IV penicillin, and therefore ceftriaxone is suggested for patients who continue to have arthritis after a course of oral antibiotics. We suggest a 2-week course of IV ceftriaxone that can be extended to 4 weeks if resolution is not complete.

### Is there a rationale for the continuous infusion of cefepime? A multidisciplinary approach [^116UwxJ8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2003). Low credibility.

This review is the fruit of multidisciplinary discussions concerning the continuous administration of beta-lactams, with a special focus on cefepime. Pooling of the analyses and viewpoints of all members of the group, based on a review of the literature on this subject, has made it possible to test the hypothesis concerning the applicability of this method of administering cefepime. Cefepime is a cephalosporin for injection which exhibits a broader spectrum of activity than that of older, third-generation cephalosporins for injection (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime). The specific activity of cefepime is based on its more rapid penetration (probably due to its zwitterionic structure, this molecule being both positively and negatively charged) through the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, its greater affinity for penicillin-binding proteins, its weak affinity for beta-lactamases, and its stability versus certain beta-lactamases, particularly derepressed cephalosporinases. The stability of cefepime in various solutions intended for parenteral administration has been studied, and the results obtained demonstrated the good compatibility of cefepime with these different solutions. These results thus permit the administration of cefepime in a continuous infusion over a 24-h period, using two consecutive syringes.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Ceftriaxone may be administered intravenously or intramuscularly.

Do not use diluents containing calcium, such as Ringer's solution or Hartmann's solution, to reconstitute ceftriaxone vials or to further dilute a reconstituted vial for IV administration because a precipitate can form. Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can also occur when ceftriaxone is mixed with calcium-containing solutions in the same IV administration line. Ceftriaxone must not be administered simultaneously with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition via a Y-site. However, in patients other than neonates, ceftriaxone and calcium-containing solutions may be administered sequentially of one another if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid (see WARNINGS).

There have been no reports of an interaction between ceftriaxone and oral calcium-containing products or interaction between intramuscular ceftriaxone and calcium-containing products (IV or oral).

Neonates

Hyperbilirubinemic neonates, especially prematures, should not be treated with ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone is contraindicated in premature neonates (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Ceftriaxone is contraindicated in neonates (≤ 28 days) if they require (or are expected to require) treatment with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition because of the risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Intravenous doses should be given over 60 minutes in neonates to reduce the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy.

Pediatric Patients

For the treatment of skin and skin structure infections, the recommended total daily dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg given once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day). The total daily dose should not exceed 2 grams.

For the treatment of acute bacterial otitis media, a single intramuscular dose of 50 mg/kg (not to exceed 1 gram) is recommended (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE).

For the treatment of serious miscellaneous infections other than meningitis, the recommended total daily dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg, given in divided doses every 12 hours. The total daily dose should not exceed 2 grams.

In the treatment of meningitis, it is recommended that the initial therapeutic dose be 100 mg/kg (not to exceed 4 grams). Thereafter, a total daily dose of 100 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 4 grams daily) is recommended. The daily dose may be administered once a day (or in equally divided doses every 12 hours). The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 14 days.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Ceftriaxone Injection is contraindicated in patients with known allergy to the cephalosporin class of antibiotics. Solutions containing dextrose may be contraindicated in patients with known allergy to corn or corn products.

Neonates (≤ 28 days)

Hyperbilirubinemic neonates, especially prematures, should not be treated with Ceftriaxone Injection. In vitro studies have shown that ceftriaxone can displace bilirubin from its binding to serum albumin, leading to a possible risk of bilirubin encephalopathy in these patients.

Ceftriaxone Injection is contraindicated in neonates if they require (or are expected to require) treatment with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition because of the risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

A small number of cases of fatal outcomes in which a crystalline material was observed in the lungs and kidneys at autopsy have been reported in neonates receiving ceftriaxone and calcium-containing fluids. In some of these cases, the same intravenous infusion line was used for both ceftriaxone and calcium-containing fluids and in some a precipitate was observed in the intravenous infusion line. At least one fatality has been reported in a neonate in whom ceftriaxone and calcium-containing fluids were administered at different time points via different intravenous lines; no crystalline material was observed at autopsy in this neonate. There have been no similar reports in patients other than neonates.

Ceftriaxone is one of the most common antibiotics prescribed for hospitalized children in the United States. However, ceftriaxone is not dosed consistently. Sepsis/serious bacterial infection had high dosing variability. Dosing for central nervous system infection was frequently suboptimal. Future efforts should focus on optimizing and standardizing ceftriaxone dosing.

### Combination testing confirming clindamycin induced acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis [^1144TD7x]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

The drug tested and type of cutaneous reaction are important factors in the diagnostic value of PT and delayed IDT. In AGEP, PT has up to 58% sensitivity for specific implicated medications, with positive results for the most frequent agents associated with AGEP, defined as agents for which a 10% dilution in petroleum has resulted in positive PT for approximately 15% to 30% of patients. Limited data are available on delayed IDT, but the consensus is that it may be a potentially useful tool.,

In this case, the patient received multiple medications including ceftriaxone, intravenous contrast, clindamycin, and naproxen all of which are potential culprits. With polypharmacy and an unclear trigger, utilizing both PT and delayed IDT can help identify the culprit by increasing the likelihood of a positive test result. Utilizing both testing strategies were beneficial due to the variable sensitivity and specificity and preparations of medications – ceftriaxone, contrast, clindamycin are sterile and appropriate for IDT and clindamycin, amoxicillin, and naproxen were available for PT. The overlap testing options provided additional confirmatory testing for this patient.

Confirming the causative agent through objective testing is essential, relying on likelihood, frequency, or timing of administration can lead to mislabeling of drug allergies. This is problematic as it could lead to unnecessary avoidance of safer, more effective medications or inadvertently receiving the culprit medication again. In this case, clindamycin was positive on both PT and delayed IDT, which provided clarity to the trigger and single drug avoidance while allowing the patient to take all other medications in the future if needed. This case report highlights the importance of combination patch and intradermal testing to confirm medication(s) culprits in AGEP. We encourage ongoing collaboration with dermatology and allergy specialists to further best practices for drug culprit evaluation in AGEP.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^112APtUZ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Parenteral Treatment

Randomized trials have demonstrated the efficacy of parenteral regimens. Clinical experience should guide decisions regarding transition to oral therapy, which usually can be initiated within 24–48 hours of clinical improvement. For women with tubo-ovarian abscesses, > 24 hours of inpatient observation is recommended.

Recommended Parenteral Regimens for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
Ceftriaxone 1 g IV every 24 hours
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours
plus
Metronidazole 500 mg orally or IV every 12 hours
or
Cefotetan 2 g IV every 12 hours
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours
or
Cefoxitin 2 g IV every 6 hours
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours

Because of the pain associated with IV infusion, doxycycline should be administered orally when possible. Oral and IV administration of doxycycline and metronidazole provide similar bioavailability. Oral metronidazole is well absorbed and can be considered instead of IV for women without severe illness or tubo-ovarian abscess when possible. After clinical improvement with parenteral therapy, transition to oral therapy with doxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day and metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day is recommended to complete 14 days of antimicrobial therapy.

### Experience developing national evidence-based clinical guidelines for childhood pneumonia in a low-income setting – making the GRADE? [^115hzoJZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

(c) Antibiotic treatment of very severe pneumonia: chloramphenicol versus benzyl penicillin/ampicillin and gentamicin

Two trials compared the effectiveness of benzyl penicillin/ampicillin combined with gentamicin versus chloramphenicol for very severe pneumonia. Duke et al (2002) studied 1116 children in Papua New Guinea while Asghar et al (2008) recruited 958 children from eight sites in seven developing countries. A meta-analysis of the two studies yielded a pooled risk ratio of treatment failure of 0.79, 95% CI 0.66–0.94 in favor of penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamicin.

(d) Antibiotic treatment of very severe pneumonia: benzyl penicillin/ampicillin and gentamicin versus ceftriaxone

We found no experimental data directly comparing outcomes following treatment of very severe childhood pneumonia using the recommended antibiotics against ceftriaxone, a common regimen used by clinicians in Kenya. One small trial (n = 97) from Turkey compared benzyl penicillin combined with chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone at day 10 of treatment for radiologically-confirmed severe and very severe pneumonia while another small trial (n = 71) compared intravenous benzyl penicillin combined with gentamicin with intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate in Indian children with severe hypoxemic pneumonia. Neither trial reported a superior regimen. Failure to report on the process of randomization and allocation concealment in the study conducted in Turkey was considered a serious limitation and therefore the evidence was graded downwards by one level. This quality of evidence was further downgraded on account of serious indirectness of population and comparison as well as imprecision. The evidence from the study conducted in India was also graded downwards for indirectness of population and comparison and imprecision. The overall quality of evidence was regarded to be very low addressing the question of whether ceftriaxone is better than benzyl penicillin plus gentamicin (Table 6).

Important Administration Instructions

Do not use in series connections.
Do not introduce additives into the DUPLEX® Container.
Administer Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection intravenously over approximately 30 minutes.
After the indicated stability time periods, unused portions of solutions should be discarded.
Vancomycin, amsacrine, aminoglycosides, and fluconazole are physically incompatible with ceftriaxone in admixtures. When any of these drugs are to be administered concomitantly with ceftriaxone by intermittent intravenous infusion, it is recommended that they be given sequentially, with thorough flushing of the intravenous lines (with 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose in water (D5W)) between the administrations.
Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection should not be physically mixed with or piggybacked into solutions containing other antimicrobial drugs due to possible incompatibility [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]
Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can also occur when Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection is mixed with calcium-containing solutions in the same IV administration line. Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection must not be administered simultaneously with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition via a Y-site. However, in patients other than neonates, Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection and calcium-containing solutions may be administered sequentially of one another if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
There have been no reports of an interaction between ceftriaxone and oral calcium-containing products or interaction between intramuscular ceftriaxone and calcium-containing products (IV or oral).

### Fatal bacterial meningitis possibly associated with substandard ceftriaxone – Uganda, 2013 [^1175f6WE]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). Low credibility.

The burden of disease from bacterial meningitis is highest in low-income countries (1). Early initiation of antibiotic therapy is important in reducing the risk for mortality. Current treatment guidelines recommend the use of an expanded-spectrum cephalosporin (cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) (2), but these therapies increasingly are limited by drug resistance, and are threatened by the proliferation of substandard and falsified medicines (3,4). In February 2013, a case of bacterial meningitis following a middle ear infection was diagnosed in an adolescent at the Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. Once-daily treatment with 2 g of intravenous ceftriaxone administered according to guidelines failed, and the patient died. To determine whether the patient's treatment failure and subsequent death might be related to the ceftriaxone product administered, a sealed vial similar to the one administered to the patient was analyzed at the University of Ottawa, Canada, and was found to contain only 0.455 g of the drug, not 1 g as stated by the manufacturer. This would have resulted in subtherapeutic dosing. Substandard medicines are a global problem that disproportionately affects low-income countries, leading to fatal consequences and promoting the emergence of drug resistance (4).

Before therapy with ceftriaxone:one is instituted, careful inquiry should be made to determine whether the patient has had previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins, penicillins and other beta-lactam agents or other drugs. This product should be given cautiously to penicillin and other beta-lactam agent sensitive patients. Antibacterial drugs should be administered with caution to

any patient who has demonstrated some form of allergy, particularly to drugs. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require the use of subcutaneous epinephrine and other emergency measures. As with all beta-lactam antibacterial agents, serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity reactions (i.e., anaphylaxis) have been reported. In case of severe hypersensitivity reactions, treatment with ceftriaxone must be discontinued immediately and adequate emergency measures must be initiated.

Interaction with Calcium-Containing Products

Interaction with Calcium-Containing Products

Do not use diluents containing calcium, such as Ringer's solution or Hartmann's solution, to reconstitute Ceftriaxone for Injection vials or to further dilute a reconstituted vial for IV administration because a precipitate can form. Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can also occur when Ceftriaxone for Injection is mixed with calcium-containing solutions in the same IV administration line. Ceftriaxone for Injection must not be administered simultaneously with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition via a Y-site. However, in patients other than neonates, Ceftriaxone for Injection and calcium-containing solutions may be administered sequentially of one another if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with

a compatible fluid. In vitro studies using adult and neonatal plasma from umbilical cord blood demonstrated that neonates have an increased risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, CONTRAINDICATIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

WARNINGS

Precipitation with Ceftriaxone

Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can occur when ceftriaxone is mixed with calcium-containing solutions, such as Ringer's Injection USP, in the same intravenous administration line. Do not administer ceftriaxone simultaneously with Ringer's Injection USP via a Y-site.

Deaths have occurred in neonates (28 days of age or younger) who received concomitant intravenous calcium-containing solutions with ceftriaxone resulting from calcium-ceftriaxone precipitates in the lungs and kidneys, even when separate infusion lines were used. Ringer's Injection USP is contraindicated in neonates receiving ceftriaxone.

However, in patients other than neonates, ceftriaxone and Ringer's Injection USP may be administered sequentially if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid [see Contraindications, Warnings, Drug Interactions, Pediatric Use].

The administration of intravenous solutions can cause fluid and/or solute overload resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states or pulmonary edema. The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration. The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentration.

Solutions containing sodium ions should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal insufficiency, and in clinical states in which there is sodium retention with edema.

Solutions containing potassium ions should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with hyperkalemia, severe renal failure, and in conditions in which potassium retention is present.

In patients with diminished renal function, administration of solutions containing sodium or potassium ions may result in sodium or potassium retention.

Solutions containing calcium ions should not be administered through the same administration set as blood because of the likelihood of coagulation.

Macrolides, clindamycin, and ceftriaxone in AOM — efficacy limits and dosing are as follows: Macrolides such as erythromycin and azithromycin have limited efficacy against both H influenzae and S pneumoniae, and clindamycin lacks efficacy against H influenzae. For suspected penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae, clindamycin alone (30–40 mg/kg per day in 3 divided doses) may be used, but it will likely not be effective for multidrug-resistant serotypes. In patients who are persistently vomiting or cannot otherwise tolerate oral medication, ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg, administered intramuscularly in 1 or 2 sites in the anterior thigh, or intravenously) has been demonstrated to be effective for initial or repeat treatment of AOM, and more than 1 dose may be required to prevent recurrence within 5 to 7 days after the initial dose.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:

Ceftriaxone for Injection may be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. Do not use diluents containing calcium, such as Ringer's solution or Hartman n's solution, to reconstitute Ceftriaxone for Injection vials or to further dilute a reconstituted vial for IV administration because a precipitate can form. Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can also occur when Ceftriaxone for Injection is mixed with calcium-containing solutions in the same IV administration line. Ceftriaxone for Injection must not be administered simultaneously with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition via a Y-site. However, in patients other than neonates, Ceftriaxone for Injection and calcium-containing solutions may be administered sequentially of one another if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid (see WARNINGS).

There have been no reports of an interaction between ceftriaxone and oral calcium-containing products or interaction between

intramuscular ceftriaxone and calcium-containing products (IV or oral).

NEONATES:

NEONATES:

Hyperbilirubinemic neonates, especially prematures, should not be treated with Ceftriaxone for Injection. Ceftriaxone for Injection is

contraindicated in premature neonates (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Ceftriaxone: one for Injection is contraindicated in neonates (s 28 days) if they require (or are expected to require) treatment with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition because of the risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Intravenous doses should be given over 60 minutes in neonates to reduce the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy

Compatibility and Stability

Do not use diluents containing calcium, such as Ringer's solution or Hartmann's solution, to reconstitute ceftriaxone for injection vials or to further dilute a reconstituted vial for IV administration. Particulate formation can result.

Ceftriaxone has been shown to be compatible with Flagyl® IV (metronidazole hydrochloride). The concentration should not exceed 5 to 7.5 mg/mL metronidazole hydrochloride with ceftriaxone 10 mg/mL as an admixture. The admixture is stable for 24 hours at room temperature only in 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose in water (D5W). No compatibility studies have been conducted with the Flagyl® IV RTU® (metronidazole) formulation or using other diluents. Metronidazole at concentrations greater than 8 mg/mL will precipitate. Do not refrigerate the admixture as precipitation will occur.

Vancomycin, amsacrine, aminoglycosides, and fluconazole are incompatible with ceftriaxone in admixtures. When any of these drugs are to be administered concomitantly with ceftriaxone by intermittent intravenous infusion, it is recommended that they be given sequentially, with thorough flushing of the intravenous lines (with one of the compatible fluids) between the administrations.

Ceftriaxone for injection solutions should not be physically mixed with or piggybacked into solutions containing other antimicrobial drugs or into diluent solutions other than those listed above, due to possible incompatibility (see WARNINGS).

### Calcium gluconate [^117FriqZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Arrhythmias with Concomitant Cardiac Glycoside Use

Cardiac arrhythmias may occur if calcium and cardiac glycosides are administered together. Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Administration of Calcium Gluconate Injection should be avoided in patients receiving cardiac glycosides. If concomitant therapy is necessary, Calcium Gluconate Injection should be given slowly in small amounts and with close ECG monitoring [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.2 End-Organ Damage due to Intravascular Ceftriaxone-Calcium Precipitates

Concomitant use of ceftriaxone and Calcium Gluconate Injection is contraindicated in neonates (28 days of age or younger) due to cases of fatal outcomes in neonates in which a crystalline material was observed in the lungs and kidneys at autopsy after ceftriaxone and calcium were administrated simultaneously through the same intravenous line. Concomitant administration can lead to the formation of ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates that may act as emboli, resulting in vascular spasm or infarction [see Contraindications (4)].

In patients older than 28 days of age, ceftriaxone and Calcium Gluconate Injection may be administered sequentially, provided the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid. Do not administer Ceftriaxone simultaneously with Calcium Gluconate Injection via a Y-site in any age group.

5.3 Tissue Necrosis and Calcinosis

Intravenous administration of Calcium Gluconate Injection and local trauma may result in calcinosis cutis due to transient increase in local calcium concentration. Calcinosis cutis can occur with or without extravasation of Calcium Gluconate Injection, is characterized by abnormal dermal deposits of calcium salts, and clinically manifests as papules, plaques, or nodules that may be associated with erythema, swelling, or induration. Tissue necrosis, ulceration, and secondary infection are the most serious complications.

If extravasation occurs or clinical manifestations of calcinosis cutis are noted, immediately discontinue intravenous administration at that site and treat as needed.

5.4 Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Cardiac Arrhythmias with Rapid Administration

Rapid injection of Calcium Gluconate Injection may cause vasodilation, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, syncope and cardiac arrest. To avoid adverse reactions that may follow rapid intravenous administration, Calcium Gluconate Injection should be diluted with 5% dextrose or normal saline and infused slowly. If rapid intravenous bolus of Calcium Gluconate Injection is required, the rate of intravenous administration should not exceed 200 mg/minute in adults and 100 mg/minute in pediatric patients and ECG monitoring during administration is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Ceftriaxone is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Average plasma concentrations of ceftriaxone following a single 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion of a 0.5, 1 or 2 g dose in healthy subjects are presented in Table 2. Multiple IV doses ranging from 0.5 to 2 g at 12- to 24-hour intervals resulted in 15% to 36% accumulation of ceftriaxone above single-dose values.

TABLE 2: Ceftriaxone Plasma Concentrations After Single-Dose Administration

Over a 0.15 to 3 g dose range in healthy adult subjects, the mean elimination half-life ranged from 5.8 to 8.7 hours, plasma clearance ranged from 0.58 to 1.45 L/hour, and renal clearance ranged from 0.32 to 0.73 L/hour.

Distribution

Ceftriaxone is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins and the binding of ceftriaxone decreases with increasing concentration from a value of 95% at plasma concentrations less than 25 mcg/mL to 85% at plasma concentration of 300 mcg/mL. Over a 0.15 to 3 g dose range in healthy adult subjects, the apparent volume of distribution ranged from 5.8 to 13.5 L.

Ceftriaxone crosses the blood placenta barrier.

Ceftriaxone penetrates the inflamed meninges of infants and pediatric patients. The average values of maximum plasma concentration, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations, elimination half-life, plasma clearance and volume of distribution after a 50 mg/kg IV dose and after a 75 mg/kg IV dose in pediatric patients suffering from bacterial meningitis are shown in Table 3.

TABLE 3: Average Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Ceftriaxone in Pediatric Patients With Meningitis

After a 1 g IV dose, average concentrations of ceftriaxone, determined from 1 to 3 hours after dosing, were 581 mcg/mL in the gallbladder bile, 788 mcg/mL in the common duct bile, 898 mcg/mL in the cystic duct bile, and 78.2 mcg/g in the gallbladder wall compared to a corresponding concentration of 62.1 mcg/mL in plasma.

Excretion

Ceftriaxone concentrations in urine are shown in Table 4.

TABLE 4: Urinary Concentrations of Ceftriaxone After Single-Dose Administration

Thirty-three percent to 67% of a ceftriaxone dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug and the remainder was secreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as microbiologically inactive compounds.

The elimination of ceftriaxone is not altered by probenecid.

Results

Study characteristics

After systematic literature search, we identified a total of 112 studies with reports on the toxicity of ceftriaxone from 28 countries, including 22 RCTs, 19 prospective and 7 retrospective cohort studies, 1 case–control study, 2 case series and 61 case reports (figure 1). The 112 studies included 5717 paediatric patients who received ceftriaxone and documented 1136 ADRs in total (online supplementary appendix 1). Nearly 40% of the ADRs (423/1136) were from RCTs and 31.4% (357/1136) from prospective cohort studies (table 1). The age of patients was from 1 month to 18 years. The daily dosage and duration of ceftriaxone ranged from 30 to 120 mg/kg/day and 2–50 days (online supplementary appendix 1). Lack of allocation concealment (3/22, 14%) or unclear reporting regarding allocation concealment (14/22, 64%) was the major source of risk of bias in RCTs. Lack of comparability was the major concern in cohort studies. Online supplementary appendix 2 presents the risk of bias for each individual study. Only one study had a high risk of bias in four domains (Cannavino et al) and one in three domains (Biner et al).

WARNINGS

Precipitation with Ceftriaxone

Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can occur when ceftriaxone is mixed with calcium-containing solutions, such as 5% Dextrose in Lactated Ringer's Injection, in the same intravenous administration line. Do not administer ceftriaxone simultaneously with 5% Dextrose in Lactated Ringer's Injection via a Y-site.

Deaths have occurred in neonates (28 days of age or younger) who received concomitant intravenous calcium-containing solutions with ceftriaxone resulting from calcium-ceftriaxone precipitates in the lungs and kidneys, even when separate infusion lines were used. 5% Dextrose in Lactated Ringer's Injection is contraindicated in neonates receiving ceftriaxone.

However, in patients other than neonates, ceftriaxone and 5% Dextrose in Lactated Ringer's Injection may be administered sequentially if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid [see Contraindications, Warnings, Drug Interactions, Pediatric Use].

Solutions containing lactate are not for use in the treatment of lactic acidosis.

Solutions containing lactate should be used with great care in patients with metabolic or respiratory alkalosis, and in those conditions in which there is an increased level or an impaired utilization of lactate, such as severe hepatic insufficiency.

The administration of intravenous solutions can cause fluid and/or solute overload resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states or pulmonary edema. The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration. The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentration.

Solutions containing sodium ions should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal insufficiency, and in clinical states in which there is sodium retention with edema.

Solutions containing potassium ions should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with hyperkalemia, severe renal failure, and in conditions in which potassium ions retention is present.

In patients with diminished renal function, administration of solutions containing sodium or potassium ions may result in sodium or potassium retention.

Solutions containing calcium ions should not be administered through the same administration set as blood because of the likelihood of coagulation.

### Challenges of antibiotic formulations and administration in the treatment of bloodstream infections in children under five admitted to kisantu hospital, democratic republic of Congo [^117WkJVS]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

Inaccurate dosing and at-risk manipulation of intravenous antibiotics.

Data on the technique of intravenous antibiotic administration were recorded after December 2021. Intravenous ciprofloxacin administration (n = 148 regimens monitored after December 2021) faced several shortcomings. In half (50.7%; (75/148) of the cases, adult-dose ciprofloxacin perfusion vials designed for single use were inappropriately used as multidose vials by dividing them in two aliquots, one for the morning and one for the evening dose. In two other cases, ciprofloxacin vials were divided in three or four aliquots, respectively. Aliquoting was performed on a visual estimation with a tape as volume indicator (Figure 2), resulting in approximate dosing. Further, gross rounding of doses to half-full or full ciprofloxacin vials resulted in an administered dose that was a minimum of 5 mg/kg/day lower (≥ 16% lower) than the prescribed dose (20 or 30 mg/kg/day) in 21.6% (32/148) of intravenous ciprofloxacin administrations, and a minimum of 5 mg/kg/day higher (≥ 16% higher) in 4.1% (6/148) of cases. Finally, in a quarter (37/148, 25.0%) of cases, in an attempt to administer the correct dose, nurses drew up the exact volume of ciprofloxacin from a perfusion vial with a syringe and (slowly) injected this directly intravenous (previously called intravenous flush) instead administering it correctly in a perfusion over 30 to 60 minutes.

We searched the Cochrane Library, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and Opengrey up to April 2019. We also searched proceedings of eight congresses to a maximum of 10 years, and we contacted trial authors for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials that included men and women, regardless of age, with definitive diagnoses of neurosyphilis, including HIV-seropositive patients. We compared any antibiotic regime (concentration, dose, frequency, duration), compared to any other antibiotic regime for the treatment for neurosyphilis in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected eligible trials, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias. We resolved disagreements by involving a third review author. For dichotomous data (serological cure, clinical cure, adverse events), we presented results as summary risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We identified one trial, with 36 participants​ diagnosed ​with syphilis and HIV. The participants were mainly men, with a median age of 34 years. This trial, ​funded by a pharmaceutical company, compared ceftriaxone in 18 participants (2 g daily for 10 days), with penicillin G, also in 18 participants (4 million/Units (MU)/intravenous (IV) every 4 hours for 10 days). The trial reported incomplete and inconclusive results. Three of 18 (16%) participants receiving ceftriaxone versus 2 of 18 (11%) receiving penicillin G achieved serological cure (RR 1.50; 95% CI: 0.28 to 7.93; 1 trial, 36 participants very low-quality evidence); and 8 of 18 (44%) participants receiving ceftriaxone versus 2 of 18 (18%) participants receiving penicillin G achieved clinical cure (RR 4.00; 95% CI: 0.98 to 16.30; 1 trial, 36 participants very low-quality evidence). Although more participants who received ceftriaxone achieved serological and clinical cure compared to those who received penicillin G, the evidence from this trial was insufficient to determine whether there was a difference between treatment with ceftriaxone or penicillin G. In this trial, the authors reported what would usually be adverse events as symptoms and signs in the follow-up of participants. Furthermore, this trial did not evaluate recurrence of neurosyphilis, time to recovery nor quality of life. We judged risk of bias in this clinical trial to be unclear for random sequence generation, allocation, ​and blinding of participants, and high for incomplete outcome data, potential conflicts of interest (funding bias), and other bias, due to the lack of a sample size calculation. We rated the quality of evidence as very low.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to low quality and insufficient evidence, it was not possible to determine whether there was a difference between treatment with ceftriaxone or Penicillin G. Also, the benefits to people without HIV and neurosyphilis are unknown, as is the ceftriaxone safety profile. Therefore, these results should be interpreted with caution. This conclusion does not mean that antibiotics should not be used for treating this clinical entity. This Cochrane Review has identified the need of adequately powered trials, which should be planned according to Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) recommendations, conducted and reported as recommended by the CONSORT statement. Furthermore, the outcomes should be based on patients' perspectives taking into account Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) recommendations.

Compatibility and Stability

Do not use diluents containing calcium, such as Ringer's solution or Hartmann's solution, to reconstitute ceftriaxone vials or to further dilute a reconstituted vial for IV administration. Particulate formation can result.

Ceftriaxone has been shown to be compatible with Flagyl®IV (metronidazole hydrochloride). The concentration should not exceed 5 to 7.5 mg/mL metronidazole hydrochloride with ceftriaxone 10 mg/mL as an admixture. The admixture is stable for 24 hours at room temperature only in 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose in water (D5W). No compatibility studies have been conducted with the Flagyl®IV RTU®(metronidazole) formulation or using other diluents. Metronidazole at concentrations greater than 8 mg/mL will precipitate. Do not refrigerate the admixture as precipitation will occur.

Vancomycin, amsacrine, aminoglycosides, and fluconazole are incompatible with ceftriaxone in admixtures. When any of these drugs are to be administered concomitantly with ceftriaxone by intermittent intravenous infusion, it is recommended that they be given sequentially, with thorough flushing of the intravenous lines (with one of the compatible fluids) between the administrations.

Ceftriaxone solutions should not be physically mixed with or piggybacked into solutions containing other antimicrobial drugs or into diluent solutions other than those listed above, due to possible incompatibility (see WARNINGS).

### Safety and local tolerability of intramuscularly administered ertapenem diluted in lidocaine: a prospective, randomized, double-blind study versus intramuscular ceftriaxone [^112aAnQ4]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Ertapenem is a new, structurally unique, parenteral beta-lactam antimicrobial agent that can be administered once daily.

Objective

This study compared the local tolerability of ertapenem 1 g once a day administered intramuscularly (IM) versus IM ceftriaxone, with both drugs reconstituted in lidocaine.

Methods

In this prospective, double-blind, multicenter study, adult patients with lower respiratory tract infection, skin infection, or urinary tract infection requiring initial parenteral therapy were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to treatment with IM ertapenem 1 g once daily or IM ceftriaxone 1 g once daily. Although study drugs were administered by unmasked personnel, the patients, investigators, and the sponsor medical reviewer were blinded. Patients who improved clinically could be switched to oral amoxicillin-clavulanate after at least 2 days of IM therapy. Tolerability and safety analyses were carried out for the treated population, and efficacy analyses were performed for the modified intent-to-treat population.

Results

A total of 117 patients were randomized. The 87 patients in the ertapenem group and 30 in the ceftriaxone group received IM therapy for a mean duration of 4.1 and 3.8 days, respectively. During treatment, 35.6% (31/87) of patients treated with ertapenem and 43.3% (13/30) of those treated with ceftriaxone experienced ≥ 1 symptom at the local injection site; the most common symptom was tenderness, followed by pain. Symptoms were moderate to severe in only 1 patient (1.1%) in the ertapenem group and 3 patients (10.0%) in the ceftriaxone group. Clinical drug-related adverse events were reported during IM therapy in 14 patients (16.1%) in the ertapenem group and 5 patients (16.7%) in the ceftriaxone group. Mean ± SD creatine kinase concentrations, measured in all patients, were 204.8 ± 234.8 U/L at the end of IM ertapenem therapy and 382.9 ± 721.1 U/L at the end of IM ceftriaxone therapy; at follow-up, values had returned to normal or had decreased in all cases.

Conclusions

Ertapenem 1 g (reconstituted in lidocaine) administered once daily IM was generally well tolerated. The tolerability and safety profiles of IM ertapenem therapy in this study were comparable to those of IM ceftriaxone therapy.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Ceftriaxone may be administered intravenously or intramuscularly.

Do not use diluents containing calcium, such as Ringer's solution or Hartmann's solution, to reconstitute ceftriaxone vials or to further dilute a reconstituted vial for IV administration because a precipitate can form. Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can also occur when ceftriaxone is mixed with calcium-containing solutions in the same IV administration line.

Ceftriaxone must not be administered simultaneously with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition via a Y-site. However, in patients other than neonates, ceftriaxone and calcium-containing solutions may be administered sequentially of one another if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid (see WARNINGS).

There have been no reports of an interaction between ceftriaxone and oral calcium-containing products or interaction between intramuscular ceftriaxone and calcium-containing products (IV or oral).

Neonates

Hyperbilirubinemic neonates, especially prematures, should not be treated with ceftriaxone for injection. Ceftriaxone is contraindicated in premature neonates (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Ceftriaxone is contraindicated in neonates (≤ 28 days) if they require (or are expected to require) treatment with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition because of the risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Intravenous doses should be given over 60 minutes in neonates to reduce the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy.

Pediatric Patients

For the treatment of skin and skin structure infections, the recommended total daily dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg given once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day). The total daily dose should not exceed 2 grams.

For the treatment of acute bacterial otitis media, a single intramuscular dose of 50 mg/kg (not to exceed 1 gram) is recommended (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE).

For the treatment of serious miscellaneous infections other than meningitis, the recommended total daily dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg, given in divided doses every 12 hours. The total daily dose should not exceed 2 grams.

In the treatment of meningitis, it is recommended that the initial therapeutic dose be 100 mg/kg (not to exceed 4 grams). Thereafter, a total daily dose of 100 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 4 grams daily) is recommended. The daily dose may be administered once a day (or in equally divided doses every 12 hours). The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 14 days.

### Ceftriaxone [^1173J4Q2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Average plasma concentrations of ceftriaxone following a single 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion of a 0.5, 1 or 2 g dose and intramuscular (IM) administration of a single 0.5 (250 mg/mL or 350 mg/mL concentrations) or 1 g dose in healthy subjects are presented in Table 1.

ND = Not determined.

Ceftriaxone was completely absorbed following IM administration with mean maximum plasma concentrations occurring between 2 and 3 hours post-dose. Multiple IV or IM doses ranging from 0.5 to 2 g at 12- to 24-hour intervals resulted in 15% to 36% accumulation of ceftriaxone above single dose values.

Ceftriaxone concentrations in urine are shown in Table 2.

ND = Not determined.

Thirty-three percent to 67% of a ceftriaxone dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug and the remainder was secreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as microbiologically inactive compounds. After a 1 g IV dose, average concentrations of ceftriaxone, determined from 1 to 3 hours after dosing, were 581 mcg/mL in the gallbladder bile, 788 mcg/mL in the common duct bile, 898 mcg/mL in the cystic duct bile, 78.2 mcg/g in the gallbladder wall and 62.1 mcg/mL in the concurrent plasma.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Average plasma concentrations of ceftriaxone following a single 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion of a 0.5, 1 or 2 gm dose in healthy subjects are presented in Table 1.

Multiple IV doses ranging from 0.5 to 2 gm at 12- to 24-hour intervals resulted in 15% to 36% accumulation of ceftriaxone above single dose values.

Ceftriaxone concentrations in urine are shown in Table 2.

Thirty-three percent to 67% of a ceftriaxone dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug and the remainder was secreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as microbiologically inactive compounds. After a 1 gm IV dose, average concentrations of ceftriaxone, determined from 1 to 3 hours after dosing, were 581 mcg/mL in the gallbladder bile, 788 mcg/mL in the common duct bile, 898 mcg/mL in the cystic duct bile, 78.2 mcg/gm in the gallbladder wall and 62.1 mcg/mL in the concurrent plasma.

Over a 0.15 to 3 gm dose range in healthy adult subjects, the values of elimination half-life ranged from 5.8 to 8.7 hours; apparent volume of distribution from 5.78 to 13.5 L; plasma clearance from 0.58 to 1.45 L/hour; and renal clearance from 0.32 to 0.73 L/hour. Ceftriaxone is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins, and the binding decreased from a value of 95% bound at plasma concentrations of < 25 mcg/mL to a value of 85% bound at 300 mcg/mL. Ceftriaxone crosses the blood placenta barrier.

### Intravenous ceftriaxone and calcium in the neonate: assessing the risk for cardiopulmonary adverse events [^116EjacQ]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Unsolicited reports regarding potentially serious adverse drug reactions in neonates and young infants were reported to the Food and Drug Administration, leading to changes in the package label for ceftriaxone. This report describes and summarizes the reported cases that led to safety concerns regarding the concurrent administration of intravenous ceftriaxone and calcium in this age group.

Methods

Nine reported cases were assessed. The Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database was searched for potential drug interactions in patients who were receiving concomitant ceftriaxone and calcium therapy.

Results

Eight of the reported 9 cases (7 were ≤ 2 months of age) represented possible or probable adverse drug events. There were 7 deaths. None of the cases were reported from the United States. The dosage of ceftriaxone that was administered to 4 of 6 infants for whom this information was available was between 150 and 200 mg/kg per day. The rate of occurrence of these serious adverse drug reactions cannot be accurately determined from available data.

Conclusions

The concurrent use of intravenous ceftriaxone and calcium-containing solutions in the newborn and young infant may result in a life-threatening adverse drug reaction. Contributing factors for infants in this report may include the use of ceftriaxone at dosages higher than those approved by the Food and Drug Administration, intravenous "push" administration, and administration of the total daily dosage as a single infusion.

PEDIATRIC PATIENTS:

PEDIATRIC PATIENTS:

For the treatment of skin and skin structure infections, the recommended total daily dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg given once a day (or in

equally divided doses twice a day). The total daily dose should not exceed 2 grams. For the treatment of acute bacterial otitis media, a single intramuscular dose of 50 mg/kg (not to exceed 1 gram) is recommended (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). For the treatment of serious miscellaneous infections other than meningitis, the recommended total daily dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg, given in divided doses

every 12 hours. The total daily dose should not exceed 2 grams. In the treatment of meningitis, it is recommended that the initial therapeutic dose be 100 mg/kg (not to exceed 4 grams). Thereafter, a total daily dose of 100 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 4 grams daily) is recommended. The daily dose may be administered once a day (or in equally divided doses every 12 hours). The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 14 days.

ADULTS:

ADULTS:

The usual adult daily dose is 1 to 2 grams given once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day) depending on the type and severity of infection. The total daily dose should not exceed 4 grams. If Chlamydia trachomatisis a suspected pathogen, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added, because ceftriaxone sodium has no activity against this organism. For the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections, a single intramuscular dose of 250 mg is recommended. For preoperative use (surgical prophylaxis), a single dose of 1 gram administered intravenously 1/2 to 2 hours before surgery is recommended. Generally, Ceftriaxone for Injection therapy should be continued for at least 2 days after the signs and symptoms of infection have disappeared. The usual duration of therapy is 4 to 14 days; in complicated infections, longer therapy may be required.

When treating infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, therapy should be continued for at least 10 days. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with impairment of renal or hepatic function (see PRECAUTIONS).

The dosages recommended for adults require no modification in elderly patients, up to 2g per day, provided there is no severe renal and hepatic impairment (see PRECAUTIONS).

### Challenges of antibiotic formulations and administration in the treatment of bloodstream infections in children under five admitted to kisantu hospital, democratic republic of Congo [^112ZBmkG]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

Prescribed antibiotic doses were not rounded to doses that were feasible to administer.

Antibiotic dosing and dosing frequency were relatively consistent among prescribers, except for gentamicin with a third of children being prescribed 5 mg/kg/day (neonatal dose) instead of 7.5 mg/kg/day. For comparison of the dosing and dosing frequency of the antibiotic regimens to those proposed in the WHO AWaRe antibiotic book, we refer to. Intravenous ceftriaxone was dosed twice instead of once daily in half (49.8%, 747/1,554) of the children, of whom 74.0% (553/747) weighted more than 10 kg. This on-site practice was based on the content of one ceftriaxone vial (1,000 mg), that is, for a child weighing ≥ 10 kg a ceftriaxone dose of 100 mg/kg, two vials are needed, hence the local preference to divide in two doses per day.

Prescription was calculated according to weight but not rounded to doses that were feasible to administer in 78.2% (1,795/2,296) of antibiotic regimens — that is, they required a direct intravenous injection (previously called intravenous flush) accuracy of < 0.2 mL, an infusion or suspension volume accuracy of < 1 mL, splitting of nonscored tablets, or splitting of scored tablets in smaller pieces than supported by the scoring line. For example, a child of 3.8 kg was prescribed 28.5 mg of gentamicin (7.5 mg/kg/dose), which required the nurse to draw up 0.71 mL of gentamicin for subsequent dilution and administration, while only a syringe of 5 mL with 0.2-mL graduation was available for administration.

### The effects of ceftriaxone by intravenous push on adverse drug reactions in the emergency department [^1133com2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

At our hospital, a shortage of sterile saline bags led to changing ceftriaxone from intravenous infusion to intravenous push. We examined if this change led to an increase in adverse reactions.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective chart analysis on patients 18 and older that were administered ceftriaxone in the ED between January to March 2018. Research assistants recorded information about possible adverse reactions. Adverse reactions were defined as any noxious or unintended response to a drug given at therapeutic doses. Potential adverse reactions were independently reviewed by three EM clinicians and confirmed by an adverse drug reaction probability scale. The primary outcome was the rate of adverse reactions for IVP administration of ceftriaxone.

Results

831 encounters were identified, 77 were excluded due to erroneous or missing data, and a total of 753 were included. Study demographics include an average age of 52.8, a female majority (54.2%) and predominantly black patient population (41.5%). A total of 24 cases were potential adverse reactions. After independent review, only one of the 24 cases was determined to be an adverse reaction to ceftriaxone from IVP. The total adverse event rate observed was 1/753 or 0.13%.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrates that the rate of adverse reactions for IVP is lower than previously reported. Given the demonstrated safety of IVP administration, future studies are warranted to determine the implications for ED efficiency and cost benefits from this change in drug delivery.

Adults

The usual adult daily dose is 1 to 2 grams given once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day) depending on the type and severity of infection. The total daily dose should not exceed 4 grams.

If Chlamydia trachomatis is a suspected pathogen, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added, because ceftriaxone sodium has no activity against this organism.

For the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections, a single intramuscular dose of 250 mg is recommended.

For preoperative use (surgical prophylaxis), a single dose of 1 gram administered intravenously 1/2 to 2 hours before surgery is recommended.

Generally, ceftriaxone therapy should be continued for at least 2 days after the signs and symptoms of infection have disappeared. The usual duration of therapy is 4 to 14 days; in complicated infections, longer therapy may be required.

When treating infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, therapy should be continued for at least 10 days.

No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with impairment of renal or hepatic function (see PRECAUTIONS).

The dosages recommended for adults require no modification in elderly patients, up to 2 g per day, provided there is no severe renal and hepatic impairment (see PRECAUTIONS).

Directions for Use

Intramuscular Administration

Reconstitute ceftriaxone sodium powder with the appropriate diluent (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Compatibility and Stability).

Inject diluent into vial, shake vial thoroughly to form solution. Withdraw entire contents of vial into syringe to equal total labeled dose.

After reconstitution, each 1 mL of solution contains approximately 250 mg or 350 mg equivalent of ceftriaxone according to the amount of diluent indicated below. If required, more dilute solutions could be utilized. A 350 mg/mL concentration is not recommended for the 250 mg vial since it may not be possible to withdraw the entire contents.

As with all intramuscular preparations, ceftriaxone should be injected well within the body of a relatively large muscle; aspiration helps to avoid unintentional injection into a blood vessel.

Intravenous Administration

Ceftriaxone should be administered intravenously by infusion over a period of 30 minutes, except in neonates where administration over 60 minutes is recommended to reduce the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy. Concentrations between 10 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL are recommended; however, lower concentrations may be used if desired. Reconstitute vials with an appropriate IV diluent (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Compatibility and Stability).

After reconstitution, each 1 mL of solution contains approximately 100 mg equivalent of ceftriaxone. Withdraw entire contents and dilute to the desired concentration with the appropriate IV diluent.

### Ceftriaxone efficacy for Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease in the hollow fiber and translation to sustained sputum culture conversion in patients [^113byS7V]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

There are some limitations to our study. First, the PK/PD limitation is that we did not perform a formal dose fractionation study. It could be that the unlike with gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli, ceftriaxone is not a %T MIC linked drug against MAC. Second, the estimates for ELF-to-plasma ratios come from a single clinical study and had been assumed to be lower than what was demonstrated. Thus, caution is required in interpreting our results. Third, even though ceftriaxone treatment will be once daily, the intravenous route still poses a challenge for a disease currently treated with oral regimens. Fourth, our results will need to be confirmed in the clinic. Finally, our results were generated using ceftriaxone monotherapy, and its effectiveness in combination therapy is as of yet to be shown. In that respect, drugs with which ceftriaxone does not demonstrate antagonism will need to be identified in further HFS-MAC studies.

In summary, ceftriaxone has a potent bactericidal effect against multiple MAC strains. We propose to combine ceftriaxone with other effective anti-MAC agents to develop new and shorter duration chemotherapy regimens to treat pulmonary MAC infections.

COMPATIBILITY AND STABILITY

COMPATIBILITY AND STABILITY

Do not use diluents containing calcium, such as Ringer's solution or Hartman n's solution, to reconstitute Ceftriax: one for Injection vials or to further dilute a reconstituted vial for IV administration. Particulate formation can result. Ceftriaxone:one has been shown to be compatible with Flagyl IV (metronidazole hydrochloride). The concentration should not exceed 5 to 7.5 mg/ml metronidazole hydrochloride with ceftriaxone 10 mg/ml as an admixture. The admixture is stable for 24 hours at room temperature only in 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose in water (DSW). No compatibility studies have been conducted with the Flagyl® IV RTU® (metronidazole) formulation or using other diluents. Metronidazole at concentrations greater than 8 mg/ml will precipitate. Do not refrigerate the admixture as precipitation will occur. Vancomycin, amsacrine, aminoglycosides, and fluconazole are incompatible

with ceftriaxone in admixtures. When any of these drugs are to be administered concomitantly with ceftriaxone by intermittent intravenous infusion, it is recommended that they be given sequentially, with thorough flushing of the intravenous lines (with one of the compatible fluids) between the administrations. Ceftriaxone for Injection solutions should not be physically mixed with or piggybacked into solutions containing other antimicrobial drugs or into diluent solutions other than those listed above, due to possible incompatibility (see WARNINGS).

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^116p3mip]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD portal hypertension — acute variceal hemorrhage (AVH) initial management guidance states that all patients with known or suspected cirrhosis presenting with acute gastrointestinal bleeding should be initiated on vasoactive therapy and intravenous antibacterial therapy prior to endoscopy; following endoscopy, vasoactive therapy should be continued for 2–5 days; intravenous antibacterial treatment should be tailored, with ceftriaxone 1 g/24 hours for up to 5 days commonly used, and therapy can be discontinued once bleeding is controlled and in absence of an active infection; packed red blood cell transfusions should target a hemoglobin ~ 7 g/dL unless higher targets are required; fresh frozen plasma and platelet transfusions should not be administered based on international normalized ratio or platelet count targets because there is no evidence of benefit and, for fresh frozen plasma, there is evidence of potential harm; upper endoscopy should be performed within 12 hours of presentation with AVH, and if esophageal variceal bleeding is confirmed, EVL should be performed.

### Safety of subcutaneous versus intravenous ceftriaxone administration in older patients: a retrospective study [^1131GuiZ]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics play a central role in infection management. In older patients, antibiotics are frequently administered subcutaneously. Ceftriaxone pharmacokinetics after subcutaneous administration is well documented, but little data are available on its safety.

Methods

We compared the occurrence of adverse events associated with ceftriaxone administered subcutaneously versus intravenously in ≥ 75-year-old patients. We used data from a single-center, retrospective, clinical-administrative database to compare the occurrence of adverse events at day 14 and outcome at day 21 in older patients who received ceftriaxone via the subcutaneous route or the intravenous route at Rennes University Hospital, France, from May 2020 to February 2023.

Results

The subcutaneous and intravenous groups included 402 and 3387 patients, respectively. Patients in the subcutaneous group were older and more likely to receive palliative care. At least one adverse event was reported for 18% and 40% of patients in the subcutaneous and intravenous group, respectively (RR = 2.21). Mortality at day 21 was higher in the subcutaneous route group, which could be linked to between-group differences in clinical and demographic features.

Conclusions

In ≥ 75-year-old patients, ceftriaxone administered by the subcutaneous route is associated with less-adverse events than by the intravenous route. The subcutaneous route, which is easier to use, has a place in infection management in geriatric settings.

### 2018 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline for the management of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy [^112LjuHA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) — administration considerations — states that a suitable antimicrobial for OPAT should have favorable physical and chemical characteristics and should have adequate stability once reconstituted across common IV solutions, containers, and storage/use conditions. As an example, ampicillin-sulbactam is only stable for 3 days once formulated, so more than once weekly delivery of medications will be required for home infusion. Stability may vary with diluent, final drug concentration, container type, and storage conditions, and the pH and osmolality of IV solutions may influence the vascular access device (VAD) needed. Delivery options include several devices; selection should be based on patient preferences/capabilities, drug characteristics, VAD, and cost/insurance coverage. Intravenous push is rapid and convenient for many cephalosporins but may exceed some patients' or caregivers' dexterity or physical ability, long infusion times are not easily reimbursed by all insurance carriers, and gravity delivery is simplest and least expensive but less convenient due to longer infusion times.

### Effect of intravenous push and piggyback administration of ceftriaxone on mortality in sepsis [^114rgHiN]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a lack of evidence-based guidelines for the administration methods of ceftriaxone in emergency departments (EDs), resulting in the reliance on individual institutional protocols for decision-making.

Objective

This study was performed to compare the effects of administering ceftriaxone via intravenous push (IVP) and intravenous piggyback (IVPB) on 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.

Methods

This was a retrospective study of patients aged 18 years or older with sepsis or septic shock who visited an ED and were treated with ceftriaxone as an initial antibiotic between March 2010 and February 2019. Patients were divided into the IVP group and the IVPB group based on the administration method. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between antibiotic administration methods and 28-day mortality.

Results

During the study period, a total of 939 patients were included in the final analysis, and the overall mortality rate was 12.2%. The antibiotic administration time was significantly lower in the IVP group than in the IVPB group, and the rates of antibiotic administration within 1 h and within 3 h were higher in the IVP group than in the IVPB group (p < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in 28-day mortality between the two groups (hazard ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.69–1.65).

Conclusions

IVP administration of ceftriaxone reduced the time of antibiotic administration compared with IVPB, but there was no difference in 28-day mortality.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions to Ceftriaxone, Cephalosporins, Penicillins, or Other Drugs

Serious, occasionally fatal, hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported with ceftriaxone. Before therapy with Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection is instituted, careful inquiry should be made to determine whether the patient has had previous immediate hypersensitivity reactions to ceftriaxone, cephalosporins, penicillins, or other drugs. Exercise caution if this product is to be given to penicillin-sensitive patients because cross-hypersensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterials has been clearly documented and may occur in up to 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy. If an allergic reaction to Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection occurs, discontinue the drug. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require treatment with epinephrine and other emergency measures including oxygen, corticosteroids, intravenous fluids, intravenous antihistamines, pressor amines, and airway management, as clinically indicated.

5.2 Interaction with Calcium-containing Products

Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can occur when Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection is mixed with calcium-containing solutions in the same IV administration line. Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection must not be administered simultaneously with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition via a Y-site. However, in patients other than neonates, Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection and calcium-containing solutions may be administered sequentially of one another if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with 0.9% sodium chloride injection or D5W. In vitro studies using adult and neonatal plasma from umbilical cord blood demonstrated that neonates have an increased risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]

5.3 Neurological Adverse Reactions

Serious neurological adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing surveillance with ceftriaxone use. These reactions include encephalopathy (disturbance of consciousness including somnolence, lethargy, and confusion), seizures, myoclonus, and non-convulsive status epilepticus [see Adverse Re actions (6.2)]. Some cases occurred in patients with severe renal impairment who did not receive appropriate dosage adjustment. However, in other cases, neurological adverse reactions occurred in patients receiving an appropriate dosage adjustment. The neurological adverse reactions were reversible and resolved after discontinuation. If neurological adverse reactions associated with Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection therapy occur, discontinue Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection and institute appropriate supportive measures. Make appropriate dosage adjustments in patients with severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

### Evaluating ceftriaxone 80 mg / kg administration by rapid intravenous infusion – A clinical service evaluation [^112Ga5tR]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

In pediatric ambulatory care, the speed of medication infusion can have major impact on healthcare staff workload and the number of children able to be treated by services designed to reduce inpatient length of stay. In many regions of the world, local and supraregional guidelines allow ceftriaxone infusions of ≥ 50 mg/kg in infants and children up to 12 years of age to be given over 10 minutes. The generic European summary of product characteristics for ceftriaxone does not state a specific infusion time for this dose range, although 1 manufacturers' summary of product characteristics in the United Kingdom states a 30-minute minimum infusion time. We conducted a formal service evaluation of a change in practice at a large UK pediatric children's hospital and demonstrated the clinical feasibility, safety, and high parent satisfaction of 10-minute ceftriaxone infusions for prescribed doses ≥ 50 mg/kg. This approach can improve patient flow within hospital-based ambulatory services as well as by community nursing teams administering antibiotics at home.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Average plasma concentrations of ceftriaxone following a single 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion of a 0.5, 1 or 2 g dose and intramuscular (IM) administration of a single 0.5 (250 mg/mL or 350 mg/mL concentrations) or 1 g dose in healthy subjects are presented in Table 1.

* IV doses were infused at a constant rate over 30 minutes.

Ceftriaxone was completely absorbed following IM administration with mean maximum plasma concentrations occurring between 2 and 3 hours post-dose. Multiple IV or IM doses ranging from 0.5 to 2 g at 12 to 24 hour intervals resulted in 15% to 36% accumulation of ceftriaxone above single dose values.

Ceftriaxone concentrations in urine are shown in Table 2.

Thirty-three percent to 67% of a ceftriaxone dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug and the remainder was secreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as microbiologically inactive compounds. After a 1 g IV dose, average concentrations of ceftriaxone, determined from 1 to 3 hours after dosing, were 581 mcg/mL in the gallbladder bile, 788 mcg/mL in the common duct bile, 898 mcg/mL in the cystic duct bile, 78.2 mcg/g in the gallbladder wall and 62.1 mcg/mL in the concurrent plasma.

### Safety of ceftriaxone in paediatrics: a systematic review [^112tbfZf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ceftriaxone is a parenteral cephalosporin with broad antimicrobial activity and a long elimination half-life of 8 hours. Studies have shown that ceftriaxone is effective for severe acute infections such as meningitis, sepsis and pneumonia. Ceftriaxone is widely used in paediatric patients of all ages.

As a consequence of widespread use, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have increasingly been reported. Concurrent use of intravenous ceftriaxone and calcium-containing solutions in neonates and young infants has been associated with calcium precipitation. Biliary pseudolithiasis and urolithiasis have also been reported in paediatric patients. There is a lack of overall assessment of the safety of ceftriaxone, one of the most widely used antibiotics in paediatric patients. This is therefore the reason for performing this systematic review. The aims of this systematic review are: (1) to systematically evaluate the categories and incidences of ADRs in paediatric patients aged from birth to 18 years old; (2) to identify the most common ADRs and the most serious ADRs associated with ceftriaxone in paediatric patients; and (3) to explore the risk factors of serious ADRs.

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^114MB2np]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — perioperative management of ascites in cirrhosis — states that ascites should be managed aggressively before surgical procedures and that, in patients with symptomatic ascites, large-volume total abdominal paracentesis should be performed preoperatively with intravenous albumin in a dose of 6–8 g for each liter of ascites fluid removed; once oral medications are tolerated, daily antibiotic prophylaxis can be resumed in patients with a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or low ascites total protein; although preoperative antibiotics are of uncertain efficacy, an antibiotic such as ceftriaxone can be administered prophylactically in a dose of 1 g of every 24 hours intravenously until oral intake is possible again; preoperative thoracentesis is only recommended for moderate to large pleural effusions that compromise respiratory function, and administration of intravenous fluid and blood products should be limited perioperatively to avoid increasing extracellular volume, ascites, and portal venous pressure.
