## Question

Can a patient still have celiac disease if transglutaminase IgA is negative but immunoglobulin A is elevated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a negative tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTG-IgA) with an elevated total serum IgA can still be consistent with celiac disease, and what the next diagnostic steps should be if clinical suspicion remains high. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what each test result actually means and whether elevated total IgA alters tTG-IgA performance. Then, I should review real-world sensitivity and negative predictive value of tTG-IgA and why false negatives occur. Next, I will check guideline-directed next steps when serology is negative but suspicion persists, including additional serologies, HLA typing, and biopsy. Finally, I will consider assay variability, the role of seronegative celiac disease, and synthesize a practical, reference-aligned plan forward.

> Let me first confirm the interpretation: a negative tTG-IgA means the assay did not detect IgA antibodies specific to TG2, while an elevated total IgA simply indicates the patient is not IgA-deficient; the latter does not "cancel out" a negative disease-specific test or intrinsically degrade its performance, and total IgA is checked primarily to identify selective IgA deficiency that would necessitate IgG-based testing [^1112WvMf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about test sufficiency; I need to check real-world performance. Although tTG-IgA is the preferred single screening test, its sensitivity in practice varies across assays and populations, and false negatives do occur, with multicenter and "real-world" data showing lower sensitivity than research settings and documenting patients with villous atrophy despite negative tTG-IgA [^113JSsam] [^1178Mr4M] [^114pJ67q].

> Hmm, wait a minute — some older single-center work suggested an excellent negative predictive value, even approaching 100%, which could mislead one to over-rely on a negative tTG-IgA; but let me verify with newer, broader data. The more recent multicenter prospective Bi. A. CeD study demonstrated that a small but important fraction of adults with biopsy-proven villous atrophy have negative tTG-IgA, so a negative result does not categorically exclude celiac disease when pretest probability is high; I should correct my thinking accordingly [^113nWy4D] [^112ubWDU].

> I should also consider mechanisms for false negatives and context. Let me think about factors such as early or mild histologic disease, patchy involvement, reduced gluten exposure before testing, immunosuppression, or laboratory assay differences; these can all reduce circulating autoantibody levels or test detection and thereby yield a negative tTG-IgA despite genuine disease, particularly in partial villous atrophy where sensitivity is known to fall in clinical practice [^117519A3] [^112UPVwr].

> Next, I should review what the guidelines advise when tTG-IgA is negative but the clinical picture still strongly suggests celiac disease. The ACG and AGA recommend not stopping at a single negative serology in high-suspicion scenarios; instead, measure total IgA (already elevated here, ruling out deficiency), then obtain endomysial antibody IgA (EMA-IgA) and deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies (DGP IgA/IgG), and proceed to endoscopic duodenal biopsy if serology is discordant with symptoms or risk profile [^113ijxun] [^111t5q8u] [^112UPVwr].

> But wait, what if all serologies remain negative and suspicion is still high? I should confirm HLA-DQ2/DQ8 status, because the absence of both essentially rules out celiac disease and can help close the evaluation; conversely, HLA positivity maintains the possibility and supports moving forward with biopsy in discordant cases [^115sDvN2] [^116iStFL].

> I will now examine the role of biopsy and seronegative presentations. Seronegative celiac disease is a recognized entity in which patients with convincing symptoms and risk factors may have negative serology but show Marsh 3 villous atrophy; in such high pretest probability cases, duodenal biopsy remains the adjudicating test and should not be deferred solely because tTG-IgA is negative [^111TwUao] [^113ijxun].

> Hold on, I should verify assay and threshold issues that can confuse interpretation. There is substantial inter-assay variability in tTG performance and in the predictive value of very high titers, including at the commonly cited 10× upper limit of normal threshold, with recent North American data showing high but assay-dependent PPV and reminding us that thresholds must be locally validated and cannot compensate for a negative result in a high-suspicion patient [^1163Egfh] [^116cJERa] [^1178Mr4M].

> Let me consider a practical, stepwise approach without losing the thread: if tTG-IgA is negative and total IgA is elevated, I should reassess clinical probability, ensure the patient remains on a gluten-containing diet during testing, add EMA-IgA and DGP IgA/IgG, and if any serology is positive or suspicion remains high, proceed to upper endoscopy with adequate duodenal sampling; if all serology is negative and suspicion persists, obtain HLA-DQ2/DQ8, recognizing that HLA negativity effectively excludes disease, while HLA positivity supports biopsy or, in particularly equivocal cases, adjunctive tools such as mucosal or biopsy-supernatant anti-TG2 testing may help clarify the diagnosis [^113ijxun] [^111t5q8u] [^1132tUm8].

> Therefore, I should conclude clearly: a negative tTG-IgA does not rule out celiac disease even when total IgA is high, and guideline-concordant next steps include obtaining EMA and DGP assays, considering HLA typing, and proceeding to duodenal biopsy when clinical suspicion remains high, rather than falsely reassuring the patient based on a single negative serologic result [^113ijxun] [^111t5q8u].

No, a negative transglutaminase IgA (tTG-IgA) with elevated total IgA **does not confirm celiac disease** and **does not exclude it** when clinical suspicion is high. tTG-IgA is the **preferred initial test** [^113JSsam], with high sensitivity and specificity [^112ubWDU], but false negatives can occur due to assay variability [^1178Mr4M], early or patchy disease, or low gluten intake [^113ijxun]. Elevated total IgA **does not cause false-negative tTG-IgA results**. If suspicion persists, order EMA-IgA and DGP-IgG, and proceed to duodenal biopsy [^113ijxun] if serology remains negative despite high clinical suspicion.

---

## Diagnostic role of tTG-IgA in celiac disease

- **tTG-IgA as initial test**: tTG-IgA is the preferred initial serologic test [^113JSsam] for celiac disease in patients with normal IgA levels [^114nTakV].

- **High accuracy**: tTG-IgA has high sensitivity and specificity [^112ubWDU], making it a reliable screening tool [^113JSsam].

- **False negatives**: False negatives can occur due to assay variability [^1178Mr4M], early or patchy disease [^112ubWDU], or low gluten intake [^113ijxun].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated total IgA

Elevated total IgA indicates increased immunoglobulin production, often driven by chronic inflammation or autoimmunity. It **does not cause false-negative tTG-IgA results**. Common causes of elevated IgA include chronic liver disease, autoimmune disorders, chronic infections, and monoclonal gammopathies.

---

## Diagnostic approach when tTG-IgA is negative but total IgA is elevated

When tTG-IgA is negative but total IgA is elevated, **follow this approach**:

| **Step** | **Diagnostic action** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm tTG-IgA result | Repeat tTG-IgA [^1178Mr4M] to exclude lab error or variability |
| 2 | Additional serology | Test EMA-IgA and DGP-IgG to increase sensitivity |
| 3 | Duodenal biopsy | If suspicion remains, perform biopsy [^113ijxun] to confirm or exclude celiac disease |
| 4 | Consider other causes | Evaluate for other causes of elevated IgA (e.g. liver disease, autoimmune disorders) |

---

## Clinical scenarios where celiac disease may be present despite negative tTG-IgA

- **Early or patchy disease**: Early or patchy mucosal involvement [^112ubWDU] can yield negative tTG-IgA.

- **Low gluten intake**: Reduced gluten intake before testing [^113ijxun] can cause false negatives.

- **Assay variability**: Differences between assays [^1178Mr4M] can affect results.

---

## Recommended follow-up and additional testing

- **Repeat serology**: Repeat tTG-IgA and add EMA-IgA [^111t5q8u] and DGP-IgG.

- **Duodenal biopsy**: Perform biopsy [^113ijxun] if suspicion remains high despite negative serology.

- **Evaluate other causes**: Assess for other causes of elevated IgA (e.g. liver disease, autoimmune disorders) [^112UPVwr].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

A negative tTG-IgA with elevated total IgA **does not confirm celiac disease** and **does not exclude it** when clinical suspicion is high [^113ijxun]. Management should include **repeat serology** with additional antibodies [^111t5q8u] and progression to **duodenal biopsy** [^113ijxun] to confirm or exclude disease, continued monitoring and reassessment if the initial evaluation is inconclusive, and evaluation for other causes of elevated IgA [^112UPVwr].

Whether coeliac disease in adults can be diagnosed with serology alone remains controversial. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of serum anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTG-IgA) in the diagnosis of coeliac disease.

- **Methods**: In this multicentre, prospective cohort study, adult participants (aged ≥ 18 years) with suspected coeliac disease, without IgA deficiency, who were not on a gluten-free diet and had a local serum tTG-IgA measurement, were enrolled from Feb 27, 2018, to Dec 24, 2020. These participants were from 14 tertiary referral centres (ten from Europe, two from Asia, one from Oceania, and one from South America) and underwent local endoscopic duodenal biopsy. Local serum tTG-IgA was measured with 14 different test brands, and concentration was expressed as a multiple of each test's upper limit of normal (ULN), defined as positive when greater than 1 times the ULN. The main study outcome was the reliability of serum tests for the diagnosis of coeliac disease, as defined by duodenal villous atrophy (Marsh type 3 or Corazza-Villanacci grade B). Histology was evaluated by the local pathologist, with discordant cases (positive tTG-IgA without duodenal villous atrophy or negative tTG-IgA with duodenal villous atrophy) re-evaluated by a central pathologist. The reliability of serum tests for the prediction of duodenal villous atrophy was evaluated according to sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for categorical and continuous data.

- **Findings**: We enrolled 436 participants with suspected coeliac disease to analyze the reliability of serological tests in predicting duodenal villous atrophy.

### Progression of pediatric celiac disease from potential celiac disease to celiac disease: a retrospective cohort study [^112FBUiS]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Based on our study findings and previous work, a subset of children with elevated celiac serologies are at risk of subsequently being diagnosed with this disorder. The percentage we report, 4%, is likely to underestimate this risk because we did not systematically follow all patients with normal biopsies in this retrospective review. This study highlights the importance of close monitoring of patients who present to providers with concern for celiac disease and are found to have elevated anti-TTG IgA concentrations, even if their initial biopsy was negative. Additionally, our study suggests that even if the anti-TTG IgA levels are only modestly elevated, it may still be worthwhile to obtain a small bowel biopsy, as some of these patients have evidence of villous atrophy. These data suggest that changes in diagnostic protocols and disease categorization might be warranted to optimize the management of children with suspected celiac disease.

Tissue transglutaminase-2 (TG2)-based immunoassays are the cornerstone of diagnosis in celiac disease (CeD), with a reported pooled sensitivity as high as 98%. However, a few small, single-center studies have questioned their sensitivity in clinical practice. Moreover, commercial kits use variable TG2 antigens, with cutoffs determined by using small, poorly defined populations. Variation in diagnostic performance of anti-TG2 assays in different racial and geographic populations has not yet been studied. We compared the inter-assay and intra-assay variations in diagnostic performance of four immunoglobulin (Ig)A-anti-TG2 assays in Canadian and Indian populations.

### Clinical value of immunoglobulin A antitransglutaminase assay in the diagnosis of celiac disease [^116jPiYa]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Our goal was to evaluate the possible correspondence between antitissue transglutaminase of immunoglobulin A class levels and the stage of mucosal damage in patients affected by celiac disease. In addition, we assessed the clinical use of antitissue transglutaminase values to predict biopsy results.

One thousand eight hundred eighty-six consecutive patients with symptoms suggestive of celiac disease and 305 healthy controls underwent determination of serum levels of immunoglobulin A and antitissue transglutaminase. An intestinal biopsy was performed in subjects with antitissue transglutaminase levels ≥ 4 IU/mL and in subjects with negative antitissue transglutaminase levels but with clinical suspicion of celiac disease. Histologic grading of celiac disease was consistent with the Marsh classification.

One hundred eighty-six subjects with positive antitissue transglutaminase levels and 91 patients with negative antitissue transglutaminase levels were submitted to biopsy. In all healthy subjects, antitissue transglutaminase results were negative. Histologic evaluations in patients with positive antitissue transglutaminase levels gave the following results: type 0 in 25 patients, type 1 in 3 patients, type 2 in 4 patients, type 3a in 22 patients, type 3b in 74 patients, and type 3c in 58 patients. None of the patients with negative antitissue transglutaminase levels showed histologic findings suggestive of celiac disease. The mean antitissue transglutaminase values in patients without mucosal atrophy were significantly lower than in patients with mucosal atrophy.

### Diagnosis and management of adult coeliac disease: guidelines from the British Society of Gastroenterology [^114usnJc]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Serological detection plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of coeliac disease, relying on the identification of specific antibodies: endomysial antibodies (EMAs, also known as AEAs), IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgA-TG2, also referred to as a-TTG or TTA), and/or deamidated antigliadin antibodies (DGP, in either IgA or IgG isotype). Notably, IgG-TG2 testing is particularly useful in patients with known IgA deficiency.

There is ongoing debate regarding the exclusive use of non-invasive tests for diagnosing coeliac disease. Recently, the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) proposed new guidelines for diagnosing coeliac disease in children. According to these guidelines, in symptomatic pediatric patients where IgA-TG2 levels exceed ten times the upper limit of normal and EMA antibodies are confirmed positive on a separate blood sample, along with positive HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8, biopsies may not be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of coeliac disease.

In adults, while a similar strategy has been proposed, there are compelling arguments for retaining the biopsy as the gold standard for diagnosing coeliac disease. A recent study from the UK National External Quality Assessment Service indicates that not all commercial IgA-TG2 kits offer results that are reliable, making the ESPGHAN guidelines not universally applicable and unsuitable for use in the UK. Additionally, with around 2% of patients with coeliac disease being IgA deficient (0.2% in the general population), the typical serology tests based on IgA-TG2 and EMA could lead to false negatives and reduced test sensitivity. For patients known to be IgA deficient, IgG-TG2 or IgG-DGP antibodies should be used, or alternatively, these patients should directly proceed to biopsy.

### Titers of anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody correlate well with severity of villous abnormalities in celiac disease [^1137Vsig]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

We reviewed our celiac disease (CeD) database to study if anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody (ab) titers correlate with the severity of villous abnormalities in Indian patients and to determine a cutoff value of anti-tTG ab fold-rise, which could best predict CeD.

- **Background**: Guidelines for diagnosing CeD suggest that biopsy could be avoided in some patients with high anti-tTG ab titer.

- **Study**: We reviewed a cohort of 366 anti-tTG ab-positive individuals in whom duodenal biopsies were performed. Anti-tTG ab was obtained before the initiation of a gluten-free diet. The results were expressed in terms of fold-rise by calculating the ratio of observed values to the cutoff value. CeD was diagnosed if, in addition to positive serology, patients had villous atrophy (> Marsh grade 2) and an unequivocal response to a gluten-free diet.

- **Results**: The mean anti-tTG fold-rise in groups with Marsh grade ≤ 2 was 2.6 (± 2.5), grade 3a was 4.0 (± 3.9), 3b was 5.7 (± 5.1), and 3c was 11.8 (± 8.0). The positive likelihood ratio for diagnosing CeD was 15.4 and 27.4 at 12- and 14-fold-rise of anti-tTG ab titer, respectively. The positive predictive value of the diagnosis of CeD was 100% when the anti-tTG ab titer was 14-fold higher than the cutoff value. Fifty-seven (43.9%) individuals with anti-tTG titer rise < 2-fold high also had CeD.

- **Conclusions**: As the severity of villous abnormality increases, the titer of anti-tTG also rises. The presence of villous atrophy can be predicted at very high anti-tTG ab titer. In contrast to emerging belief, mucosal biopsies should be performed even if anti-tTG ab titer is < 2 times higher.

### Celiac disease [^116G8FdJ]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

As many as one in every 100 to 200 persons in the United States has celiac disease, a condition resulting from an inappropriate immune response to the dietary protein gluten. The manifestations of celiac disease range from no symptoms to overt malabsorption with involvement of multiple organ systems and an increased risk of some malignancies. When celiac disease is suspected, initial testing for serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies is useful because it offers adequate sensitivity and specificity at a reasonable cost. A positive IgA tTG result should prompt small bowel biopsy with at least four tissue samples to confirm the diagnosis. However, 3 percent of patients with celiac disease have IgA deficiency; therefore, if the serum IgA tTG result is negative but clinical suspicion for the disease is high, a serum total IgA level may be considered.

Screening of asymptomatic patients is not recommended. The basis of treatment for celiac disease is adherence to a gluten-free diet, which may eliminate symptoms within a few months. Patients should also be evaluated for osteoporosis, thyroid dysfunction, and deficiencies in folic acid, vitamin B12, fat-soluble vitamins, and iron, and treated appropriately. Serum IgA tTG levels typically decrease as patients maintain a gluten-free diet.

### Outcome measures in coeliac disease trials: The Tampere recommendations [^115QiE96]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Serology is a cornerstone in the diagnostic workup for coeliac disease. IgA auto-antibodies to TG2 and IgG antibodies to deamidated gliadin peptides (DGPs) are central diagnostic tests for active coeliac disease. In IgA-sufficient patients, IgA-anti-TG2 is the most predictive and reproducible single test, although IgA EMA performs similarly well in some expert laboratories and is often used as a confirmatory test. IgG anti-DGP displays similar sensitivity as IgA anti-TG2 but has lower specificity.

Selection of optimal serological tests is mandatory because not all commercial assays perform equally well. Importantly, calculation of results and thus numerical values for the same samples may also differ, and only tests with a multipoint calibration curve give values proportional to serum antibody concentration. Differences in assays can make interpretation in and comparisons between clinical trials difficult. This difficulty is in part due to different epitopes that are detected by different tests, different calibration, or to antibodies with lower avidity and specificity. Thus, an important shortcoming when using serology to evaluate the outcome of gluten challenge is the wide range of response.

When the UK National External Quality Assessment consortium tested the same positive samples in 14 commercial anti-TG2 assays, large differences in antibody levels were found, consistent with substantial variability for antibodies used in the diagnosis of coeliac disease.

Overall, a correlation exists between IgA-anti-TG2 antibody titres and the severity of mucosal damage by histology, as well as the histological outcome.

### Identification of a new coeliac disease subgroup: Antiendomysial and anti-transglutaminase antibodies of IgG class in the absence of selective IgA deficiency [^111HqRYX]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to increase the sensitivity of the antiendomysial antibody (EMA) test by also evaluating EMAs of the IgG1 isotype.

Over the last 2 years, serum EMAs IgA and IgG1 were determined in 1,399 patients referred to our gastrointestinal unit due to clinical suspicion of malabsorption. Serum anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies IgA and IgG, as well as total IgA levels, were also investigated. Furthermore, EMAs IgA and IgG1 were evaluated in biopsy culture supernatants. Biopsy specimens were also subjected to histological and immunohistochemical evaluation. Twenty-six patients with gastroenterological disease other than coeliac disease (CD) were used as a disease control group. Ninety-nine blood donors were used as a healthy control group.

Diagnosis of CD was based on histological findings in 110 out of the 1,399 patients showing EMA IgA positivity, and in a further 56 out of the 1,399 patients presenting both EMA IgA and IgG1 positivity in sera as well as in culture supernatants. Of the remaining 1,233 EMA IgA-negative patients, 60 showed only EMA IgG1 positivity both in sera and in culture supernatants. It is noteworthy that anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies IgG (anti-tTG) were positive in all 60 EMA IgG1-positive patients as well. By contrast, a selective IgA deficiency was found in only 11 out of the 60 EMA IgG1-positive patients. Villous height/crypt depth ratio was < 3:1 in 38 of the 60 EMA IgG1-positive patients (63.3%), whilst overexpression of ICAM-1 and CD25 was observed in all these patients.

### Survey of the initial management of celiac disease antibody tests by ordering physicians [^113adZ9c]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

For appropriate interpretation and management of a positive screening test, it is essential to stratify patients into low-risk groups, who are unlikely to have celiac disease, and identify high-risk patients who require an intestinal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate their response to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Although awareness of celiac disease is growing, adults without gastrointestinal symptoms experience a mean delay in diagnosis of 42 months. Such long delays negatively impact patient quality of life and increase healthcare utilization and costs.

The study reflects the goals of the "Choosing Wisely" campaign, which seeks to encourage physicians to make effective choices ensuring high-quality care. To improve how physicians order, interpret, and follow celiac serology tests, it is crucial to identify incorrect assumptions in laboratory test interpretation and subsequently develop educational tools to enhance primary care physician management decisions.

### A novel serogenetic approach determines the community prevalence of celiac disease and informs improved diagnostic pathways [^116iStFL]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Changing perspectives on the natural history of celiac disease (CD), new serology and genetic tests, and amended histological criteria for diagnosis cast doubt on past prevalence estimates for CD. We set out to establish a more accurate prevalence estimate for CD using a novel serogenetic approach.

- **Methods**: The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ genotype was determined in 356 patients with 'biopsy-confirmed' CD, and in two age-stratified, randomly selected community cohorts of 1,390 women and 1,158 men. Sera were screened for CD-specific serology.

- **Results**: Only five 'biopsy-confirmed' patients with CD did not possess the susceptibility alleles HLA-DQ2.5, DQ8, or DQ2.2, and four of these were misdiagnoses. HLA-DQ2.5, DQ8, or DQ2.2 was present in 56% of all women and men in the community cohorts. Transglutaminase (TG)-2 IgA and composite TG2/deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) IgA/IgG were abnormal in 4.6% and 5.6%, respectively, of the community women and 6.9% and 6.9%, respectively, of the community men. In the screen-positive group, only 71% and 75%, respectively, of women and 65% and 63%, respectively, of men possessed HLA-DQ2.5, DQ8, or DQ2.2. Medical review was possible for 41% of seropositive women and 50% of seropositive men, leading to biopsy-confirmed CD in 10 women (0.7%) and 6 men (0.5%). Based on relative risk for HLA-DQ2.5, DQ8, or DQ2.2 in all TG2 IgA or TG2/DGP IgA/IgG screen-positive subjects, CD affected 1.3% or 1.9%, respectively, of females and 1.3% or 1.2%, respectively, of men. Serogenetic data from these community cohorts indicated an overarching trend in diagnosis patterns.

### IgA anti-transglutaminase autoantibodies at type 1 diabetes onset are less frequent in adult patients and are associated with a general celiac-specific lower immune response in comparison with nondiabetic celiac patients at diagnosis [^112jB14Z]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

CD is a well-documented comorbidity of DM1. In this study, we demonstrated that the IgA-tTGAb frequency at DM1 onset is significantly higher in patients aged ≤ 18 years, being 2.2 times more frequent than in adult patients. This result reinforces previous findings that showed a lower age of DM1 onset is associated with a higher risk of developing CD. It is possible that distinct genetic susceptibility might contribute to the differences between the two age groups.

Gender biases in the susceptibility and severity of autoimmune diseases are well-recognized, and a female prevalence of CD was demonstrated in long-standing diabetes. We found that, also at DM1 diagnosis, celiac-specific IgA-tTG immunoreactivity is prevalent in females, especially when aged ≤ 18 years. The absence of other gender associations in this study may be explained by the limited number of adult patients found to be autoantibody-positive.

The comparison of celiac-specific humoral immunoreactivities shown by IgA-tTGAb+ DM1 (biopsied or not) and screen-detected nondiabetic CD patients at diagnosis provided additional interesting data. We found that the concomitant presence of DM1 and CD strongly influences the quantitative and qualitative expression of the celiac-specific humoral immunoreactivity, which at DM1 onset is significantly lower in comparison with nondiabetic patients at CD diagnosis. Only anti-actin autoantibody immunoreactivity, a marker of CD intestinal damage severity, did not differ between DM1 and CD patients. The impact of CD on the clinical characteristics of DM1 patients is controversial, probably because…

### Utility in clinical practice of immunoglobulin A anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody for the diagnosis of celiac disease [^117519A3]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

This study investigates the sensitivity and specificity of the anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody test in clinical practice through commercial laboratories, where test characteristics may differ from research laboratories.

- **Methods**: We examined 122 patients suspected of having celiac disease, all of whom had anti-tTG antibody serologies and underwent upper endoscopy with duodenal biopsies. Celiac disease patients were classified as either classic (exhibiting diarrhea or other malabsorption symptoms) or silent (asymptomatic). Biopsies were further classified into partial (Marsh IIIA) or total (Marsh IIIB or IIIC) villous atrophy.

- **Results**:
	- The anti-tTG antibody test demonstrated an overall sensitivity of 70.6%, specificity of 65.0%, positive predictive value of 91.1%, and negative predictive value of 30.2%.
	- Sensitivity was notably higher in patients with total villous atrophy (90.0%) compared to those with partial villous atrophy (42.3%) [P < .0001].
	- A significant difference in sensitivity and specificity was observed between the two most utilized commercial laboratories. Lab #1 showed a sensitivity of 40.0% compared to 86.4% for Lab #2 [P < .0001]. Specificity was 100.0% for Lab #1 and 41.7% for Lab #2 [P = 0.02].

- **Conclusions**: The sensitivity of the anti-tTG antibody in clinical practice is not as high as previously reported by research laboratories, particularly in patients with partial villous atrophy. Additionally, there is considerable variability in test characteristics between commercial laboratories.

Early diagnosis and treatment with a gluten-free diet reduces mortality and the prevalence of associated disorders in celiac disease (CD). A simple "in the office" test of anti-transglutaminase antibodies might be of great help in first-line screening for CD.

- **Aims**: We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of two commercial kits based, respectively, on rapid detection of IgA-IgG anti-human-transglutaminase antibodies (anti-h-tTG) in serum and IgA anti-h-tTG antibody in one drop of whole blood. These assays were compared to a well-established enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique.

- **Methods**: Serum samples were analyzed from 114 biopsy-confirmed celiacs, 120 healthy controls, 20 first-degree relatives of celiacs, and 75 diseased controls. The whole blood samples were analyzed from 51 biopsy-confirmed celiacs and 100 controls.

- **Results**: The serum-based test was positive in all 114 celiacs (sensitivity 100%). Among the controls, there were seven healthy blood donors, one first-degree relative, and three diseased controls who tested positive (specificity 94.9%). The blood drop-based assay testing IgA antibodies was positive in 46 of 51 (sensitivity 90.2%), and since three of the five patients testing negative had total IgA deficiency, the sensitivity value can be increased to 95.8%. All 100 controls tested negative (specificity 100%).

- **Conclusions**: The commercial kits described here produce high values of sensitivity and specificity. This offers the general practitioner who suspects a possible case of CD the real possibility to look for anti-h-tTG antibodies effectively.

- **Celiac disease**:

- **Recommendations**: Consider screening children with type 1 diabetes for celiac disease by measuring tissue transglutaminase or antiendomysial antibodies, with documentation of normal total serum IgA levels, soon after the diagnosis of diabetes. Testing should be considered in children with growth failure, failure to gain weight, weight loss, diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal pain, or signs of malabsorption, or in children with frequent unexplained hypoglycemia or deterioration in glycemic control. Consider referral to a gastroenterologist for evaluation with possible endoscopy and biopsy for confirmation of celiac disease in asymptomatic children with positive antibodies. Children with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease should be placed on a gluten-free diet and have consultation with a dietitian experienced in managing both diabetes and celiac disease.

Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder that occurs with increased frequency in patients with type 1 diabetes (1–16% of individuals compared with 0.3–1% in the general population). Symptoms include diarrhea, weight loss or poor weight gain, growth failure, abdominal pain, chronic fatigue, malnutrition due to malabsorption, other gastrointestinal problems, and unexplained hypoglycemia or erratic blood glucose concentrations.

Screening for celiac disease includes measuring serum levels of tissue transglutaminase or antiendomysial antibodies, then small bowel biopsy in antibody-positive children.

### Tests for serum transglutaminase and endomysial antibodies do not detect most patients with celiac disease and persistent villous atrophy on gluten-free diets: a meta-analysis [^111GXDwH]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Aims: Tests to measure serum endomysial antibodies (EMA) and antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG) were developed to screen for celiac disease in patients consuming gluten. However, they are commonly used to monitor patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD). We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the sensitivity and specificity of tTG IgA and EMA IgA assays in identifying patients with celiac disease who have persistent villous atrophy despite a GFD.

Methods: We searched PUBMED, EMBASE, BIOSIS, SCOPUS, clinicaltrials.gov, Science Citation Index, and Cochrane Library databases through November 2016. Inclusion criteria were studies of subjects with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease, follow-up biopsies, and measurement of serum antibodies on a GFD, biopsy performed on subjects regardless of symptoms, or antibody test results. Our analysis excluded subjects with refractory celiac disease, undergoing gluten challenge, or consuming a prescribed oats-containing GFD. Tests were considered to have positive or negative findings based on manufacturer cut-off values. Villous atrophy was defined as a Marsh 3 lesion or villous height:crypt depth ratio below 3.0. We constructed forest plots to determine the sensitivity and specificity of detection for individual studies. For the meta-analysis, a bivariate random effects model was used to jointly model sensitivity and specificity.

Results: Our search identified 5408 unique citations. Following review of abstracts, 442 articles were reviewed in detail. Only 26 studies (6 of tTG assays, 15 of EMA assays, and 5 of tTG and EMA as

### Influence of age and genetic risk on anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA titers [^115u3nBa]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

False-positive results of anti-tissue-transglutaminase (tTG) IgA autoantibodies have been reported in subjects with a genetic risk for celiac disease (CD). The aims of this retrospective study were to assess the prevalence of false-positive tTG titers in patients at risk of CD compared with symptomatic children and to evaluate the influence of age and indication for testing on tTG titers.

All tTG results measured in our institution during a 33-month period were evaluated. Patients with known CD were excluded. Indications for testing were either symptoms suggestive of CD (group 1) or a history of being at risk for CD (group 2). Duodenal biopsies were recommended if titers were positive (≥ 10 U/mL) and offered if borderline (≥ 4 to < 10 U/mL).

The final analysis included 2056 patients, with 1707 belonging to group 1 and 349 to group 2. All 65 patients with positive tTG results underwent biopsy (group 1: 57, group 2: 8). Celiac disease was confirmed in 61 subjects (median titer: 107.8 U/mL, range 12.0–1748 mL, not significant between groups 1 and 2), whereas 4 had normal histology (10.2–25.2 U/mL). Three out of 16 patients with borderline results underwent biopsy and had normal histology. Borderline titers were more common in group 2 patients (2.6% vs 0.4%, P < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis in patients with negative tTG results (n = 1975) revealed that titers were independently related to age (P < 0.05) and indication for testing (P < 0.001).

The influence of age and genetic predisposition/risk has to be taken into account when interpreting tTG IgA titers in patients being evaluated for CD.

- **Hypothyroidism**: Consider screening children with type 1 diabetes for thyroid disease using thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies soon after diagnosis. Measuring TSH concentrations soon after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, after metabolic control has been established, is reasonable. If normal, consider rechecking every 1–2 years, especially if the patient develops symptoms of thyroid dysfunction, thyromegaly, or an abnormal growth rate.

- **Transition from pediatric to adult care**: As teens transition into emerging adulthood, health care providers and families must recognize their many vulnerabilities and prepare the developing teen, beginning in early to mid-adolescence and at least one year prior to the transition.

### What is the role of serologic testing in celiac disease? A prospective, biopsy-confirmed study with economic analysis [^114mWiPw]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

The optimal serologic tests for the detection of celiac disease and follow-up assessment remain controversial. Our aim was to evaluate all immunologic assays for diagnosing celiac disease using the gold standard of duodenal biopsy. We also assessed whether tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody is a quantitative marker for histologic severity.

- **Methods**: Consecutive adult patients referred for gastroscopy without a previously known diagnosis of celiac disease were recruited (group 1). Concurrently, patients with a known diagnosis of celiac disease on a gluten-free diet for more than 1 year undergoing repeat duodenal biopsy were identified (group 2). All patients had duodenal biopsies and serologic analysis performed for immunoglobulin (Ig) A and antibodies to human immunoglobulin (IgA-tTG), IgA-gliadin, IgG-gliadin, and IgA-endomysial antibody.

- **Results**: Two thousand patients were recruited in the first group. Seventy-seven (3.9%) patients were diagnosed with new celiac disease. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for IgA tTG were 90.9%, 90.9%, 28.6%, and 99.6%. When adopting a 2-step approach using tTG first and then EMA, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 85.7%, 98.6%, 71.7%, and 99.7%, respectively. The use of nondeamidated IgA/IgG gliadin antibodies conferred no additional diagnostic benefit when considering the detection of adult celiac disease. In the second group, 48 patients with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet were identified. Sixteen…

### Can tissue transglutaminase antibody titers replace small-bowel biopsy to diagnose celiac disease in select pediatric populations [^116c87EU]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Use of screening tests for celiac disease has increased the number of patients referred for evaluation. It has been proposed that the subgroup of patients with very high tissue transglutaminase antibody (TTG) titers is positive for celiac disease, and a small-bowel biopsy is not necessary for diagnosis. A gluten-free diet should be attempted, and if the patient's symptoms do not improve, then a biopsy should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

- **Methods**: A chart review of data for 103 patients who underwent both TTG testing and a small-bowel biopsy was performed. The impact of using TTG values of > 100 U and 100 U was examined. Positive biopsy results were found in 48 of 49 cases. Only 7 of 16 patients with TTG values of 20 to 100 U exhibited positive biopsy results. Three patients with TTG levels of 100 U and 100 and < 20 U and IgA levels were verified. The sensitivity and specificity were very high.

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2011 [^112tVLeU]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Celiac disease in children with type 1 diabetes requires careful monitoring. These children should be screened for celiac disease by measuring tissue transglutaminase or anti-endomysial antibodies, ensuring normal total serum IgA levels soon after the diagnosis of diabetes. Testing should be repeated if the child experiences growth failure, failure to gain weight, weight loss, diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal pain, signs of malabsorption, frequent unexplained hypoglycemia, or deterioration in glycemic control. Children with positive antibodies should be referred to a gastroenterologist for evaluation through endoscopy and biopsy. For those with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease, a gluten-free diet is advised, along with consultation from a dietitian skilled in managing both diabetes and celiac disease.

### What are the sensitivity and specificity of serologic tests for celiac disease? Do sensitivity and specificity vary in different populations [^114pJ67q]. Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

A number of serologic tests are available commercially for identifying individuals who require an intestinal biopsy examination to diagnose celiac disease (CD). The aim of this study was to determine which test, or combination of tests, was most sensitive and specific for this purpose. We performed a literature review of studies that determined the sensitivity and specificity of serologic tests for CD. Studies that compared biopsy examination-confirmed cases of CD with controls with normal intestinal histology were selected for analysis.

Sensitivities and specificities for the antigliadin tests were highly variable. Immunoglobulin (Ig)G-based antigliadin (AGA) tests generally were poor in both parameters, whereas the IgA-based test was poorly sensitive but more specific. The IgA endomysium (EMA-IgA) and tissue transglutaminase (TTG-IgA) tests were both highly sensitive and specific, with values for both parameters exceeding 95% in most studies.

There were no identifiable differences between adults and children with respect to these tests. There was no evidence that a combination of tests was better than a single test using either the EMA-IgA or TTG-IgA. Either the EMA-IgA or TTG-IgA test is most useful for identifying individuals with CD. The variability and generally lower accuracy associated with the AGA tests make them unsuitable for screening purposes. There is no advantage to using a panel of tests as opposed to a single test.

Because these data were obtained largely from studies conducted in a research setting, it is possible the tests will be less accurate when used in broader clinical practice.

### Survey of the initial management of celiac disease antibody tests by ordering physicians [^113KQ6ux]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The only statistical difference was between the appropriately and inappropriately managed patients with a TTG (tissue transglutaminase antibody) ≥ 10 x ULN (upper limit of normal) (9/101) versus the nonresponders with a TTG ≥ 10 x ULN (17/73) (p-value provided in additional file).

- **Management within four months**: Of those with TTG ≥ 3 x ULN and positive EMA (anti-endomysial antibody), appropriate management within four months was observed.

- **Moderately elevated TTG (3–10 x ULN)**: Eight out of 15 cases were likely false positives. The TTG was repeated a median of 3.5 months later (range 2.5 to 15 months). The TTG returned to normal in six patients or was only 1.5 x ULN in two.

- **Low TTG (< 3 x ULN)**: Of the 36 cases, four had known celiac disease, six were referred for subspecialty evaluation, and 26 had a repeat TTG a median of six months later (range 1–18 months). In 18 patients, the TTG had normalized upon repeat testing.

### Pediatric celiac disease and selective IgA deficiency: Unexpected sequence of events [^11771hBZ]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Selective IgA deficiency (IgAD) is the most common primary immunodeficiency, frequently leading to only minor clinical complaints. IgAD may be associated with autoimmune diseases such as celiac disease (CeD). Although IgAD is thought to precede CeD and autoimmunity, the association between the two conditions has not been clarified.

- **Methods**: Routine techniques were used to measure serum IgA and celiac diagnostic markers, such as transglutaminase 2 IgA (TG2-IgA) and deamidated gliadin IgG, and for immunohistochemistry for IgG, IgM, and IgA.

- **Results**: We report two childhood cases of complete IgA deficiency that evolved after the diagnosis of CeD and the start of a gluten-free diet. Histology showed persistence of IgA in the intestinal mucosa.

- **Conclusion**: Both children with CeD showed IgA deficiency that unexpectedly developed after the initiation of a gluten-free diet. This supports IgA deficiency as a process that develops gradually and occurs due to specific defects in immunoregulation.

### Selective IgA deficiency [^111MCG4b]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

There is a wide spectrum of clinical findings in IgA deficiency. Patients with IgA deficiency may be identified among blood bank donors without any clinical findings. In fact, 85–90% of IgA-deficient individuals are asymptomatic. This high percentage is interesting and remains a puzzle to be solved since IgA is such a significant immunoglobulin in immune defense. Some patients with IgA deficiency have a tendency to develop respiratory infections, gastrointestinal infections and disorders, allergies, autoimmune conditions, and malignancies.

- **Re-sinopulmonary infections**: Infections of the respiratory system are the most common findings in individuals with IgA deficiency. These infections are mostly due to bacteria, such as Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Some patients may develop end organ damage, such as bronchiectasis, secondary to recurring or chronic infections. Patients with associated antibody deficiency, such as IgG2 subclass deficiency, have a higher chance of having more severe infections and complications.

- **Gastrointestinal infections/disorders**: IgA-deficient individuals have a tendency to develop infections and disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Giardiasis, malabsorption, lactose intolerance, celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, nodular lymphoid hyperplasia, and malignant proliferation are among the associated diseases. Since the protective barrier of the gastrointestinal system is impaired in IgA deficiency, protozoa such as Giardia lamblia can adhere to the epithelium, proliferate, and cause infection.

### Predictors of celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes and positive tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A [^113WcQdn]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Low credibility.

For the 66 subjects who had EMA collected (Figure S1), 41 (62%) tested positive. All subjects with an EMA titer of ≥ 1:80 (n = 24) were diagnosed with CD. TTG IgA values for these subjects were all ≥ 10 times the ULN; seven had levels > 4000 CU (upper limit of detection), seven were > 100 times the ULN, and the remaining subjects ranged from 14 to 91 times the ULN. Subjects were categorized according to TTG IgA followed by EMA (Figure 1). Notably, nine subjects with a positive EMA did not have CD. Of these, five did not have EMA dilutions available, and four were positive at 1:40 or lower. Ten subjects did not have TTG IgA results available for review within the 180-day timeframe before endoscopy, and two were IgA deficient with alternative positive testing. Four subjects met the CD diagnosis criteria according to the European Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) guidelines with positive EMA and TTG IgA ≥ 10 times the ULN, but they were not found to have CD on endoscopy. Two of these subjects had subsequent testing and biopsies consistent with CD 16–20 months later. Of the 41 subjects with a positive EMA, 32 had a biopsy diagnostic of CD (PPV = 0.78). For the 12 asymptomatic subjects with a positive EMA, eight had a confirmatory biopsy (PPV = 0.67).

Subjects were categorized by the degree of TTG IgA elevation to determine if there was a stratification of PPV. For subjects with TTG IgA elevated 1 to < 5, 5 to < 10, and ≥ 10 times the ULN, the respective PPVs were 0.34, 0.40, and 0.85. Only one asymptomatic patient had TTG IgA 5 to < 10 times the ULN, limiting this portion of the model.

### Selective IgA deficiency [^117677e4]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Laboratory evaluation

IgA deficiency should be considered in patients exhibiting respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, allergies, and autoimmune disorders. Additionally, an immunologic evaluation for IgA deficiency is warranted in cases of anaphylaxis secondary to a blood product transfusion, celiac disease, and a family history of IgA deficiency and/or common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). It is prudent to consider medications that may cause decreased serum levels of IgA in the patient.

Evaluation of suspected IgA deficiency generally includes a complete blood count with differential, quantitative serum immunoglobulin levels, serum IgG subclasses, specific antibody responses to protein and polysaccharide antigens, and lymphocyte subsets. Additionally, laboratory testing for associated conditions, such as infections, allergies, or celiac disease, should be performed. Celiac disease screening should include IgG isotype antibodies against gliadin and tissue transglutaminase, as IgA isotype antibodies may not be detected due to the IgA deficiency.

### Predictors of celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes and positive tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A [^117J7ZVU]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Low credibility.

- **Results**: Of the 2179 patients aged 0–22 years in our T1DM registry, 205 underwent EGD, and 116 unique patients underwent EGD for possible CD during the study timeframe. Seven patients had more than one endoscopy; six due to persistent TTG elevation and one due to initial histology lacking intraepithelial lymphocytosis, which was repeated 3 months later.

This resulted in a total of 123 endoscopies to evaluate CD, with each considered a separate subject for analysis. All subjects included had a TTG IgA measured at some point, but those measurements were analyzed only if conducted within the established timeframes (180 days before or up to 90 days after endoscopy). Of the 123 subjects, 74 (60%) were diagnosed with CD. No significant differences were found between subjects with or without CD in age, sex, race, or ethnicity. The average time from T1DM diagnosis to EGD was 3.5 years, with a shorter time to diagnosis in CD subjects. There were differences regarding family history of CD between groups, although many subjects with CD had missing documentation. Overall, 34 of 123 (28%) subjects were asymptomatic, and there was no significant difference in reported symptom prevalence between groups. When analyzing individual symptoms, none were significantly more common in patients with CD.

### Diagnostic value of persistently low positive TGA-IgA titers in symptomatic children with suspected celiac disease [^114SJqN5]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). Low credibility.

While the algorithm to diagnose celiac disease (CD) in children with elevated anti-transglutaminase IgA (TGA-IgA) titers (> 10 times the upper limit of normal, ULN) is well defined, the management of children with low TGA-IgA values represents a clinical challenge. We aimed to identify the diagnostic value of persistently low positive TGA-IgA titers in predicting CD in children.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively analyzed children with symptoms or signs of CD who were not eligible for a no-biopsy approach. We included children with at least two TGA-IgA measurements, endomysial antibody (EMA) assessment, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies. TGA-IgA values were provided as multiples of ULN. Patients were classified into groups based on median TGA-IgA values: A (TGA-IgA > 1 ≤ 5 × ULN, defined as "low-positive"), B (TGA-IgA > 5 < 10 × ULN, "moderate-positive"), and C (controls).

- **Results**: Data of 281 children were analyzed. Of 162 children in group A, CD was diagnosed in 142 (87.7%), whereas normal duodenal mucosa was found in 20. In group B, all 62 children (100%) received a CD diagnosis. Group C included 57 controls. EMA were undetectable in 31 (15%) of mucosal atrophy cases. On the receiver-operating characteristic curve (area under the curve = 0.910), a mean value of 1.7 ULN showed a sensitivity of 81.4% and specificity of 81.8% to predict mucosal damage.

- **Conclusions**: Repeated low or moderate TGA-IgA values (< 5 ULN or < 10 ULN) are good predictors of a CD diagnosis. Symptomatic children with persistently low positive TGA-IgA titers should undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2013 [^114Mc4ez]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

- **Celiac disease**: Consider screening children with type 1 diabetes for celiac disease by measuring tissue transglutaminase or antiendomysial antibodies, with documentation of normal total serum IgA levels, soon after the diagnosis of diabetes. Testing should be considered in children with growth failure, failure to gain weight, weight loss, diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal pain, or signs of malabsorption. It is also important in children with frequent unexplained hypoglycemia or deterioration in glycemic control. Consider referral to a gastroenterologist for evaluation with possible endoscopy and biopsy for confirmation of celiac disease in asymptomatic children with positive antibodies. Children with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease should be placed on a gluten-free diet and have consultation with a dietitian experienced in managing both diabetes and celiac disease.

Measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations soon after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, after metabolic control has been established, is reasonable. If normal, consider rechecking every 1–2 years, especially if the patient develops symptoms of thyroid dysfunction, thyromegaly, or an abnormal growth rate.

### Rapid immunochromatography on fresh intestinal biopsy is highly accurate in detecting intestinal antitransglutaminase antibodies [^1132tUm8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Celiac disease (CeD) is a common gluten-dependent autoimmune condition affecting 1%–2% of the global population. In patients with positive serologic markers (IgA anti-transglutaminase 2 [anti-TG2] and antiendomysium [EMA]) and duodenal villous atrophy, the diagnosis of CeD is clear-cut. However, 10%–30% of patients evaluated for suspected CeD show only mild histopathologic changes and fluctuating serologic markers, a condition identified as potential CeD, or present with seronegative villous atrophy. In such cases, the diagnosis may remain uncertain.

Intestinal antitransglutaminase 2 antibodies (I-anti-TG2) are a marker of CeD. I-anti-TG2 are produced by specific activated B lymphocytes in the small intestinal mucosa before the appearance of serum anti-TG2 or mucosal damage. I-anti-TG2 have high sensitivity and specificity for CeD and identify those patients with potential CeD who are at risk of progression to villous atrophy. Their use in clinical practice could therefore help improve the accuracy of the overall testing strategy for CeD both in patients in whom the diagnosis is equivocal and in patients with potential CeD or seronegative villous atrophy.

I-anti-TG2 can be detected by double immunofluorescence staining on frozen duodenal sections (deposit technique) or using an endomysial antibody assay in the supernatants of duodenal biopsies after incubation with gliadin fragments for 72 hours (EMA biopsy). The diagnostic accuracy of these techniques is comparable because they both have high sensitivity and specificity.

### High-titre circulating tissue transglutaminase-2 antibodies predict small bowel villous atrophy, but decision cut-off limits must be locally validated [^116cJERa]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Numerous studies suggest that high levels of circulating immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase-2 (TTG2) antibodies predict coeliac disease with high specificity. Accordingly, it has been suggested that duodenal biopsy may not be routinely required for diagnostic confirmation where quantitative serology identifies the presence of high antibody titres. However, defining a cut-off TTG2 threshold is problematic, as the multiple available assay methods are not harmonized and most studies have focused on the paediatric population.

Recent paediatric guidelines proposed a TTG2 antibody diagnostic cut-off at 10× the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the method; however, concerns remain about errors of generalization, both between methods and laboratories. In this study, we used retrospective laboratory data to investigate the relationship between TTG2 antibody levels and Marsh 3 histology in the seropositive population of adults and children at a single centre. Among 202 seropositive patients with corresponding biopsies, it was possible to define a TTG2 antibody cut-off with 100% specificity for Marsh 3 histology, at just over 10× ULN for the method.

However, UK National External Quality Assurance Scheme returns during the study period showed a wide dispersion of results and poor consensus, both between methods and between laboratories using the same method. Our results support the view that high-titre TTG2 antibody levels have strong predictive value for villous atrophy in adults and children, but suggest that decision cut-offs to guide biopsy requirement will require local validation.

### Immunoglobulin A deficiency in celiac disease [^111n9jEY]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

To determine the prevalence and significance of immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency and partial deficiency in patients with celiac disease (CD), a study was conducted. Selective IgA deficiency is a common primary immunoglobulin deficiency with a higher prevalence in CD patients. However, the prevalence and significance of IgA deficiency and partial deficiency in CD patients in the United States had not been previously examined.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted involving 1498 adults and 317 children seen at a University Medical Center. The results showed that there were 26 patients (22 adults, 4 children) with CD who were IgA deficient, and 11 (9 adults, 2 children) with CD who were partially IgA deficient. The prevalence of IgA deficiency/partial deficiency was similar among adults and children, at 2.1% and 1.9%, respectively (P = 0.99). Among adults, 29% of IgA-deficient/partially deficient patients had concomitant autoimmune disease compared to 12% of CD patients with normal IgA levels (P = 0.0081). All four IgA-deficient patients who had persistently positive IgG celiac serologies while adhering to a gluten-free diet and were rebiopsied had a normal repeat biopsy. These patients were found to have positive tissue transglutaminase IgG and antigliadin IgG.

The study concludes that selective IgA deficiency/partial deficiency is present in 2% of CD patients at this referral center and is equally prevalent among adults and children. Furthermore, IgA-deficient/partially deficient adults had a higher prevalence of concomitant autoimmune disease than those without IgA deficiency.

### Prevalence of tissue transglutaminase antibodies and IgA deficiency are not increased in juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a case-control study [^1151Q6vm]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Since IgA deficiency can cause a false negative on a CD antibody test, it is recommended that serum IgA levels be measured when evaluating for CD. Of the studies reported in Table 4, only three specifically mentioned the prevalence of IgA deficiency in their cohorts, which ranged from 0 to 0.9%. The prevalence of IgA deficiency was 0 among 108 Italian children with JIA and 96 Turkish children with JIA.

While ours is the largest cohort, the study does have some limitations. Our controls were older compared to the cases, which might explain in part why the controls had a higher prevalence of tTG positivity. Cases were enrolled from two different institutions. The study was performed on banked serum, so information regarding the diets of the subjects in the year prior to testing was not recorded in the chart. To avoid false negative tests, we only included subjects older than three years of age. We did not test the nine IgA deficient subjects for tTG or DGP IgG antibodies or for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antigens; hence, we may have underestimated the prevalence of CD slightly. Though 1% of our case subjects were IgA deficient, it is unlikely that most of them had CD. A study of 126 IgA deficient children found the prevalence of anti-tTG antibodies was 21%, and the prevalence of CD was 8.7%. A second study found that the prevalence of anti-tTG IgG was 9.8% among 174 blood donors with IgA deficiency. Thus, we believe that excluding the IgA deficient individuals is unlikely to have influenced our overall findings. We collected tTG IgA from diagnosed JIA patients and controls, but we did not test further.

### Adult population screening for coeliac disease: Comparison of tissue-transglutaminase antibody and anti-endomysial antibody tests [^115Qj6SB]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Serological screening tests for coeliac disease have significantly advanced the diagnosis of this condition. The very high specificity (almost 100%) of anti-endomysial antibody detection has been repeatedly confirmed, whereas a lower specificity (90–95%) is found with anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody assays. In the study by Malekzadeh and colleagues, a group of study participants were identified with raised anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, but the endomysial antibody test was negative in 86%. Although many of these participants were found to have raised intra-epithelial lymphocytes in their small intestinal mucosa, there is currently insufficient evidence to confidently diagnose gluten-sensitive disease in these patients. Hence, their report that a minimum prevalence of 1:104 of gluten sensitivity is found in the general population of Iran is likely to be an overestimate and requires confirmation.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for celiac disease, particularly in the management of refractory disease, AGA 2019 guidelines recommend performing endoscopic biopsies to assess healing in patients with persistent or relapsing symptoms without other obvious explanations. This is advised even when anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA results are negative.

### A novel serogenetic approach determines the community prevalence of celiac disease and informs improved diagnostic pathways [^113q4kWe]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Cases diagnosed were assumed to be the excess of HLA-DQ2.5/8/2.2 subjects in those screened by TG2 IgA (models A to E), or composite antigen ELISA (models F to H), as detailed in Table 1.

Model A (initial testing for TG2 IgA followed by small bowel biopsy) is widely recommended in clinical guidelines, but according to the Medicare Australia item costs, it is more expensive and results in more (unnecessary) gastroscopies than the model (model B) including HLA-DQ genotyping to exclude 'gene-negative' TG2 IgA false-positive patients prior to biopsy. Including both confirmatory EMA and HLA-DQ genotyping for TG2 IgA-seropositive patients, but still performing gastroscopies in all of this patient group (model C) modestly increases cost. This model has the advantage that cases with a pre-biopsy likelihood of CD greater than 90% can be identified to minimize the risk of biopsy false-negatives.

Model D is based on the revised ESPGHAN 2012 criteria for symptomatic children, avoiding the requirement for biopsy in patients with TG IgA levels greater than 10 × ULN who have confirmatory EMA and HLA-DQ genotyping. Only 0.2% of men and 0.3% of women in the community would be expected to have levels of TG2 IgA above 10 × ULN, and model D was little different from model A in its cost and clinical impact.

Model E is based on the revised ESPGHAN 2012 criteria for asymptomatic children at increased risk. The initial test is HLA-DQ genotyping followed by biopsy if TG2 IgA is greater than 3 × ULN, or if TG2 IgA is raised but is less than 3 × ULN, then confirmatory EMA is performed.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for celiac disease, specifically in relation to serologic testing, the ACG 2013 guidelines recommend obtaining total IgA levels in patients with a high probability of CD, considering the possibility of IgA deficiency. Alternatively, it includes both IgA and IgG-based testing, such as IgG deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies, in these high-probability patients.

Screening guidelines in North America for celiac disease recommend additional IgG-based testing for younger children. Our multicenter retrospective study showed that the anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody test should be the recommended initial test in all children, including those ≤ 24 months of age.

### Celiac disease: Common questions and answers [^11749mDG]. American Family Physician (2022). Low credibility.

Celiac disease is an immune-mediated multisystem disorder that affects genetically susceptible individuals exposed to gluten-containing grains such as wheat, barley, and rye. The condition can develop at any age and presents with a variety of manifestations such as diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, bloating, malabsorption, and failure to thrive. Most adult patients exhibit nonclassic symptoms, including less specific gastrointestinal symptoms or extraintestinal manifestations like anemia, osteoporosis, transaminitis, and miscarriage.

Immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase serologic testing is the recommended initial screening for all age groups. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with small bowel biopsy is advised to confirm the diagnosis in most patients, including those with a negative serologic test but where clinical suspicion of celiac disease persists. Biopsies may be avoided in children with high immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase levels (i.e. 10 times the upper limit of normal or more) and a positive test for immunoglobulin A endomysial antibodies in a second serum sample. Genetic testing for human leukocyte antigen alleles DQ2 or DQ8 may be performed in select cases.

A lifelong gluten-free diet is the primary treatment for celiac disease. Patients may benefit from support groups and education on common and hidden sources of gluten, gluten-free substitutes, food labeling, balanced meal planning, dining out, dining during travel, and avoiding cross-contamination. Patients with celiac disease who do not respond to a gluten-free diet should.

### What happens to patients with positive tissue transglutaminase and endomysium antibody results in general practice [^117FBceY]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

A previous study showed that many patients with positive gut-related antibodies (anti-tissue transglutaminase [TTG] and/or anti-endomysium [EMA] antibodies), indicative of coeliac disease, were not offered a duodenal biopsy, despite the recommendation of the British Society for Gastroenterology guidelines.

- **Aims/methods**: To investigate whether the addition of a comment on the advisability of referral to a gastroenterologist and biopsy to each positive gut-related antibody result would improve the referral rate to investigate possible coeliac disease.

- **Results**: The referral rate improved from 30.1% of patients who were referred and 18% subsequently biopsied before the addition of the comment, to 79.8% who were referred after the introduction of a specific laboratory comment attached to positive antibodies to TTG and/or EMA. All patients with these positive antibodies who were referred for consultant opinion were subsequently biopsied.

- **Conclusions**: To ensure that British Society for Gastroenterology guidelines are followed, laboratories should incorporate more explicit details on the recommended course of action for general practitioners on their receipt of positive gut antibodies to TTG/EMA.

### Utility of testing patients, on presentation, for serologic features of celiac disease [^115iUuEB]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Aims: Celiac disease shares features of other disorders and can be diagnosed conclusively only based on duodenal histology analysis, which is not practical for screening purposes. Serologic analysis might be used to identify candidates for biopsy analysis. Our aim was to develop a simple diagnostic approach that all clinicians could follow to increase the percentage of patients accurately diagnosed with celiac disease at initial presentation.

Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of data from 752 patients (88 with celiac disease, none were IgA deficient) who attended a UK district general hospital from January 2007 through December 2008 and underwent biopsy analysis and serologic tests to measure endomysial antibodies and IgA antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG). Patients avoiding gluten in their diet were excluded. Patients were assigned to one of four groups:

- **High-risk**: Based on the presence of anemia, chronic diarrhea, unintentional weight loss, or dermatitis herpetiformis.
- **Low-risk**: Based on factors such as dyspepsia, abnormal liver function, ataxia, or chronic cough.
- **Nutrient deficiency**: Based on the levels of iron, vitamins B12 and D, or folate.
- **Screening**: Patients with type 1 diabetes or a family history of celiac disease.

Patients with celiac disease were identified using the modified Marsh criteria (grades 1–3) for interpreting duodenal histology. We compared clinical category, serology profiles, and biopsy results between patients with and without celiac disease.

Results: Celiac disease was diagnosed in 64 of 565 patients in the high-risk category.

### Is immunoglobulin A anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody a reliable serological marker of coeliac disease [^113nWy4D]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody is increasingly used as a diagnostic tool in the serological investigation of coeliac disease. However, positive predictive values of immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-tTG for coeliac disease in prospective studies have been disappointing, and false-positive results are reported.

- **Objective**: To assess the clinical utility of cascade testing for anti-tTG and anti-endomysium antibody (AEA).

- **Patients**: Two unselected retrospective cohorts from routine diagnostic investigation for possible gluten-sensitive enteropathy were examined. Group 1 comprised 57 cases seropositive for anti-tTG, and Group 2 comprised 52 cases seronegative for anti-tTG. In both groups, all cases had also undergone small-intestinal biopsy.

- **Methods**: Patients were assessed for the presence of IgA anti-tTG by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and for IgA AEA by immunofluorescence.

- **Results**: The positive predictive value of IgA anti-tTG for biopsy-confirmed coeliac disease was 54%. The positive predictive value of dual positivity for anti-tTG and AEA was 97%. The negative predictive value of IgA anti-tTG was 100%.

- **Conclusions**: The data presented here support the use of IgA anti-tTG as an initial screen for coeliac disease. Coeliac disease is unlikely when IgA anti-tTG is absent. However, many false-positive results are seen, and clinical utility and diagnostic efficiency are markedly improved if positive results are confirmed with the more accurate, but labor-intensive, AEA assay.

### Predictors of celiac disease in patients with type 1 diabetes and positive tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A [^115JnkJA]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Low credibility.

The prevalence of celiac disease (CD) among children is approximately 1%, whereas it is estimated to be 5%–8% among children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) recommends screening for CD with total immunoglobulin A (IgA) and tissue transglutaminase (TTG) IgA. If testing is positive, endoscopy is indicated to confirm the diagnosis. NASPGHAN further recommends children at high risk for CD undergo screening even if asymptomatic, and that screening may be repeated periodically.

There is a lack of standardization in TTG IgA assays universally, including methods and the upper limit of normal (ULN). False positive elevations in TTG IgA are common and can lead to unnecessary endoscopies. Some populations, including children with T1DM, have transiently elevated TTG IgA levels, which may fluctuate over time. The degree of elevation is positively correlated with CD diagnosis; studies show a high positive predictive value (PPV) for TTG IgA greater than 10 times the ULN in general pediatric populations and in children with T1DM, with the PPV ranging from 79% to 100%. One study suggests a cut-off of 11 times the ULN as a criterion to prompt endoscopy and avoid unnecessary procedures. However, many patients with CD do not have such high TTG IgA levels. Therefore, additional information, including symptoms, complications of CD (e.g. iron deficiency anemia, elevated aminotransferases), or alternative serologies, may help achieve this goal.

Endomysial antibody (EMA) is a…

### IgA anti-transglutaminase autoantibodies at type 1 diabetes onset are less frequent in adult patients and are associated with a general celiac-specific lower immune response in comparison with nondiabetic celiac patients at diagnosis [^112sM1in]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

- **Comparison of celiac-specific autoantibody frequency**:

	- Figure 1 illustrates the comparison of celiac-specific autoantibody frequency, titers, and mean number of autoantibody positivities per patient in newly diagnosed DM1 and nondiabetic CD patients at diagnosis. The y-axis indicates the percent of serum IgA-tTG, IgG-tTG, DGP, and actin autoantibody-positive patients at diagnosis, while the x-axis reports the groups of patients analyzed for each single celiac-specific autoantibody. To the right of the figure, the y-axis illustrates, for the same set of patients, the mean number of autoantibody positivities found in each group. At the bottom of the figure, for DM1 A, DM1 B, and CD patients, the mean Ab indexes relative to each celiac-specific autoantibody investigated and their eventual statistical significances were reported. CD refers to biopsy-confirmed celiac patients, DM1 A refers to nonbiopsied IgA-tTGAb + DM1 patients, and DM1 B refers to IgA-tTGAb + DM1 patients confirmed as celiac by intestinal biopsy.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for celiac disease, specifically in relation to serologic testing, the ACG 2023 guidelines recommend considering the acquisition of a combination of tissue transglutaminase IgA and endomysial antibodies in a second blood sample for diagnosing celiac disease in pediatric patients. Similar tests should be considered for symptomatic adult patients who are unwilling or unable to undergo upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.

### Transglutaminase IgA antibodies in a celiac disease mass screening and the role of HLA-DQ genotyping and endomysial antibodies in sequential testing [^114dS1kn]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate hypothetical screening strategies in a Swedish celiac disease (CD) mass screening. Of 10,041 Swedish sixth graders born in 1993 invited to a population-based CD mass screening, 7208 participated. Anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) immunoglobulin (Ig) A were analyzed in all children, and total serum IgA (s-IgA) in 7161 children. Additional analyses of tTG-IgG, endomysial antibodies (EMA) IgA and IgG, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles were performed according to a standardized protocol. Children with elevated levels of serological markers were recommended to undergo a small intestinal biopsy to verify diagnosis, and 153 children with CD were thus identified. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPVs), and negative predictive values (NPVs) were calculated, and receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted.

By lowering the cutoff for tTG-IgA, 17 additional cases of CD were identified at the cost of 32 biopsies. All children with tTG-IgA > 50 U/mL (10 times the recommended upper limit of normal) had gluten enteropathy. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for tTG-IgA was 0.988. All cases carried HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8, as did 53% of the controls. For different hypothetical screening strategies, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV ranged between 87.6% and 100%, 99.5% and 99.9%, 79.7% and 89.7%, and 99.7% and 100%, respectively. Efforts to increase sensitivity by lowering the tTG-IgA cutoff would result in an increased number of small intestinal biopsies and lower PPV.

### Positive predictive value of tissue transglutaminase IgA for celiac disease [^1163Egfh]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Recent changes in European diagnostic criteria allow for serologic diagnosis of celiac disease in children. Those guidelines have not been adopted in North America; hence, we aim to assess the positive predictive value (PPV) of tissue transglutaminase (tTG) immunoglobulin A (IgA) assays used in North America in identifying histologic findings of celiac disease.

- **Methods**: Multicenter retrospective cohort study of children (< 18 years) with an elevated tTG IgA within 6 months of an esophagogastroduodenoscopy between January 2016 and December 2021. Biopsy-confirmed celiac disease was determined by the presence of intraepithelial lymphocytosis and villous atrophy. The primary outcomes were the PPV of an elevated tTG IgA and tTG IgA greater than or equal to 10 times the upper limit of normal (10× ULN).

- **Results**: Overall, 4019 children (63.3% female; 9% type 1 diabetes, 2% Down syndrome) were included. Histologic findings were consistent with celiac disease for 3321 children (PPV = 82.6% [95% CI, 81.4–83.8]). Among the 1739/4019 (43.2%) children with tTG IgA greater than or equal to 10× ULN, 1651 had biopsy-confirmed celiac disease (PPV10× = 94.9% [95% CI, 93.8–95.9]). Five percent (88/1739) of children did not have histologic findings of celiac disease, including 41/1739 (2%) with normal histology. Diagnostic accuracy of tTG IgA varied widely among assays used in North America (PPV range: 71.5%-88.8%; PPV10× range: 89.3%-97.3%). Assays performed worse in children with type 1 diabetes (PPV10× 89% [95% CI, 83.5–92.8]).

### Quality not quantity for transglutaminase antibody 2: The performance of an endomysial and tissue transglutaminase test in screening coeliac disease remains stable over time [^111yMp6w]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) have published guidance for the diagnosis of coeliac disease. However, some controversy exists regarding the advice on stratifying levels of immunoglobulin (IgA) tissue transglutaminase antibody (TG2) test positivity due to the absence of test standardization and the unclear indication for testing equivocal samples. Using repeat service audit, we demonstrate that a combination of TG2 followed by IgA endomysial antibodies (EMA) is the best strategy for all degrees of mucosal abnormality with our test combination.

Reliance on immunoassay titre is not as effective and cannot be applied consistently across populations without assay standardization. Guidelines advocating the use of tests should involve experts in laboratory diagnostics and external quality assurance to ensure that errors of generalization do not occur and that test performance is achievable in routine diagnostic use.

### Autoantibodies and CD: past and future of celiac antibody testing [^115hx2rC]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Celiac disease (CD) is triggered by the consumption of gluten-containing cereals, to which patients mount a T-lymphocyte and antibody response in both immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G classes, coupled with autoantibody production against self-proteins, predominantly type-2 (tissue) transglutaminase (TG2). TG2 autoantibodies are biologically active and bind to their target protein in the patients' tissues, including the gut and extraintestinal tissues. This peculiar systemic anti-TG2 reaction is dependent on the presence of dietary gluten and ceases after its elimination. As both anti-TG2 and anti-gliadin antibodies are activity markers, their detection is valuable for disease recognition and therapy monitoring.

High concentrations of serum anti-TG2 antibody positivity, supported by highly specific positivity for endomysial antibodies, have become a critical component of celiac disease diagnosis. However, serum antibodies as indirect markers have limitations and are not able to replace histology analysis in all cases. Studies focusing on tissue-bound antibodies may further improve our understanding of their role.
