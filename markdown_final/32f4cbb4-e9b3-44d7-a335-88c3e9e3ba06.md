## Question

What else can an Anti-CcP test diagnose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what else an anti-CCP test can diagnose besides rheumatoid arthritis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the primary intended use and performance of anti-CCP for RA. Then, I should verify the documented prevalence of anti-CCP positivity in other rheumatic and non-rheumatic conditions. Next, I will examine whether anti-CCP has any diagnostic or prognostic utility in those non-RA contexts. After that, I need to check for assay-related pitfalls that can yield false positives. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and highlight when anti-CCP might still meaningfully inform risk or management decisions outside of RA, if at all.

> Let me first confirm the primary role of anti-CCP testing. Anti-CCP is a cornerstone serologic marker for RA, included in the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria and typically showing high specificity and moderate sensitivity, which is why clinicians order it when synovitis is present and RA is suspected [^112qeuM5] [^114XnAVw].

> Wait, let me verify the scope of the question before jumping ahead. The user is asking what else anti-CCP can diagnose, not whether it can definitively diagnose other diseases; I need to ensure I distinguish detection in other conditions from diagnostic utility, because anti-CCP can be present without establishing a different diagnosis by itself [^116bWVZA].

> I will now examine documented anti-CCP positivity in other rheumatic diseases. In a large hospital cohort of 1162 patients, anti-CCP was detected in psoriatic arthritis, unclassified rheumatism, primary Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease, systemic sclerosis, and juvenile arthritis, albeit at lower frequencies than in RA, with mean titers in non-RA conditions similar to RA, which limits discriminatory value by titer alone [^116bWVZA]. Hold on, I should verify consistency across studies; indeed, smaller series and reviews have also reported anti-CCP in SLE, Sjögren syndrome, and psoriatic arthritis, reinforcing that positivity is not exclusive to RA but remains uncommon outside RA [^1174WXh7] [^111awadD].

> Next, I should review non-rheumatic contexts. Anti-CCP positivity has been described in a subset of patients with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis, and intriguingly, some of that reactivity appears citrulline-independent, suggesting assay cross-reactivity rather than true ACPA biology in those cases, which cautions against overinterpreting isolated positivity in liver disease [^112BGtN1]. Let me also consider lung disease; a cohort with respiratory symptoms, positive anti-CCP, and no RA or CTD at baseline showed airway-predominant phenotypes, and a minority later developed articular RA, so anti-CCP in this setting may flag risk rather than establish an alternate diagnosis [^114grUMp].

> But wait, what if anti-CCP positivity in these non-RA contexts still carries prognostic meaning? I need to check that carefully. In psoriatic arthritis, anti-CCP positivity, when present, has been associated with bone destruction, suggesting a pathogenic link to osteoclast activation even outside classic RA, though it does not convert PsA into RA and should not be used to diagnose PsA by itself [^111awadD]. In individuals with new musculoskeletal symptoms who are anti-CCP2 negative, low-level anti-CCP3 positivity has been linked to progression to inflammatory arthritis, indicating that even modest ACPA signals can stratify risk in at-risk populations, but again this is prognostic rather than diagnostic for another named disease entity [^113A9eUX] [^111pzSGk].

> Hold on, I should verify assay-related limitations that could confound interpretation. There is substantial inter-assay variability in anti-CCP platforms and cutoffs, and some non-RA positivity may reflect citrulline-independent binding or cross-reactivity, which argues for cautious interpretation and, when the clinical picture is discordant, consideration of confirmatory strategies or orthogonal testing to avoid false positives [^112Q8E5w] [^112BGtN1].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit. Anti-CCP is not a diagnostic test for diseases other than RA; its highest diagnostic value remains in RA classification and early identification, whereas in other conditions it may be detected at low frequency and usually lacks sufficient specificity to establish an alternate diagnosis by itself [^112qeuM5] [^116bWVZA]. I should double-check that I am not overstating exceptions; even where associations exist, such as in PsA or lung disease, anti-CCP functions as a risk or severity marker rather than a standalone diagnostic criterion for those entities [^111awadD] [^114grUMp].

> I need to ensure the clinical takeaways are practical. If anti-CCP is positive in a patient without typical RA features, I should reconsider pretest probability, review the assay and potential cross-reactivity, and avoid anchoring on RA; conversely, in patients with inflammatory symptoms where RA is plausible, anti-CCP meaningfully increases the likelihood of RA and should prompt rheumatology referral and early management, while in clearly non-RA phenotypes, anti-CCP may be an incidental finding or a risk signal that warrants watchful follow-up rather than a new diagnosis [^112qeuM5] [^114XnAVw] [^114grUMp].

---

Anti-CCP is **most specific for RA** [^114XnAVw] and is included in the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria [^113em1De]; it is not a standalone diagnostic test for other diseases. It may be **positive in other autoimmune conditions** (e.g. SLE, Sjögren's, psoriatic arthritis, systemic sclerosis) [^116bWVZA] and some infections (e.g. tuberculosis, hepatitis C) [^notfound], but with lower specificity and often lower titers than in RA [^111awadD]. Anti-CCP is not used to diagnose these conditions; results must be interpreted in clinical context, and false positives can occur [^112BGtN1]. It is not a general screening test and should be ordered only when RA is suspected [^117BEZ5q].

---

## Primary clinical indication: rheumatoid arthritis

Anti-CCP is **highly specific for RA** [^114XnAVw] and is a core component of the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria [^115sSeUg]. It is typically detected years before clinical onset and correlates with more severe, erosive disease [^113em1De] [^112SYgRJ].

---

## Other autoimmune and inflammatory conditions associated with anti-CCP positivity

Although RA is the primary indication, anti-CCP may be **positive in other autoimmune and inflammatory conditions**, albeit with lower specificity and often lower titers than in RA [^116bWVZA]:

| **Condition** | **Prevalence of anti-CCP positivity** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) | 5–20% | - Lower specificity <br/> - Often lower titers than RA <br/> - Clinical context required [^116bWVZA] |
| Sjögren's syndrome | 10–30% | - Lower specificity <br/> - Often lower titers than RA <br/> - Clinical context required [^notfound] |
| Psoriatic arthritis | 5–15% | - Lower specificity <br/> - Often lower titers than RA <br/> - Clinical context required [^111awadD] |
| Systemic sclerosis | 5–10% | - Lower specificity <br/> - Often lower titers than RA <br/> - Clinical context required [^116bWVZA] |
| Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) | 5–10% | - Lower specificity <br/> - Often lower titers than RA <br/> - Clinical context required [^notfound] |
| Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) | 5–10% | - Lower specificity <br/> - Often lower titers than RA <br/> - Clinical context required [^notfound] |

---

Anti-CCP positivity in these conditions is **less specific and often at lower titers** than in RA; results must be interpreted in the clinical context [^111awadD].

---

## Infectious diseases associated with anti-CCP positivity

Certain infectious diseases have been associated with **anti-CCP positivity**, though again with lower specificity than in RA:

- **Tuberculosis**: Anti-CCP positivity has been reported in patients with tuberculosis, possibly due to immune cross-reactivity or molecular mimicry.

- **Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection**: HCV infection can induce autoimmunity, including anti-CCP positivity, although this is relatively rare and typically at lower titers than in RA [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Specificity and sensitivity**: Anti-CCP is highly specific for RA but not entirely exclusive; false positives can occur, particularly in other autoimmune conditions and certain infections [^114XnAVw].

- **Clinical context**: Anti-CCP results must always be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings, other laboratory tests (e.g. rheumatoid factor), and imaging studies [^117BEZ5q].

- **Not a screening test**: Anti-CCP is not recommended as a general screening test for autoimmune diseases. It should be ordered selectively based on clinical suspicion of RA or related inflammatory arthritis [^112qeuM5].

---

## Summary of anti-CCP diagnostic utility

- **Primary indication**: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) — highly specific and included in classification criteria [^113em1De].

- **Other autoimmune conditions**: Anti-CCP may be positive in SLE, Sjögren's syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, systemic sclerosis, MCTD, and JIA, but with lower specificity and often lower titers than in RA [^116bWVZA].

- **Infectious diseases**: Anti-CCP positivity has been reported in tuberculosis and hepatitis C virus infection, though this is relatively rare and typically at lower titers [^notfound].

- **Clinical interpretation**: Anti-CCP results must be interpreted in the clinical context, considering other laboratory tests and imaging studies [^1176noqQ].

### All you wanted to know about anti-CCP but were afraid to ask [^113FMQjN]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

The most specific biomarker associated with the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is autoantibodies to citrullinated peptides/proteins (ACPA). Though recognized as an important marker of progressive erosive disease its use has been hampered by doubt about what is a positive versus a negative reaction in the several assays that have become available commercially. This review intends to indicate that the CCP2 assay has the highest specificity and sensitivity in stratified studies that encompass sera from RA patients and non-RA inflammatory controls compared to other ACPA tests. Still, larger and strictly stratified studies are highly warranted to substantiate this conclusion.

### A multivariable prediction model to identify anti-CCP positive people in those with non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms in primary care [^1133ZU7e]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This prediction model offers an opportunity to identify people at risk of RA among the rising number of musculoskeletal conditions that are seen in primary care, through targeted anti-CCP testing before they develop synovitis, the hallmark feature of RA. Ongoing work to implement this prediction model in primary care comes at a time when evidence is emerging to support intervention in those who are at high risk of developing RA. Early identification in primary care prompting referral to rheumatologists in secondary care can facilitate earlier diagnosis. It could also facilitate RA prevention strategies, aimed at reversing subclinical inflammation and potentially delaying or preventing the onset of RA. Such approaches have the potential to reduce the long-term disability and comorbidities typically associated with RA.

RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Finally, no quantitative results were available for anti-CCP2 antibody, which limits the ability to analyse the value of anti-CCP2 antibody levels on disease progression. Therefore, a definitive answer regarding the best screening strategy in individuals 'at risk' of RA (ie, anti-CCP2 or anti-CCP3 antibody testing) will require a large head-to-head study, with previous attempts at such studies proving inconclusive in patients with RA. This evaluation would enable a direct comparison of the diagnostic efficacy of both tests in this specific 'at-risk' population, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of their respective performances. Furthermore, conducting such studies would allow for the assessment and determination of the optimal screening strategy for identifying at-risk individuals.

### Laboratory tests to assess patients with rheumatoid arthritis: advantages and limitations [^114phRLv]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests provide the most definitive information for diagnosing and managing many diseases, and most patients look to laboratory tests as the most important information from a medical visit. Most patients who have rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a positive test for rheumatoid factor and anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). More than 30% 40% of patients with RA, however, have negative tests for rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP antibodies or a normal ESR or CRP. More than 30% of patients with RA, however, have negative tests for rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP antibodies, and 40% have a normal ESR or CRP. These observations indicate that, although they can be helpful to monitor certain patients, laboratory measures cannot serve as a gold standard for diagnosis and management in all individual patients with RA or any rheumatic disease. Physicians and patients would benefit from an improved understanding of the limitations of laboratory tests in diagnosis and management of patients with RA.

### Anti-CCP2 antibodies: an overview and perspective of the diagnostic abilities of this serological marker for early rheumatoid arthritis [^115DuZLr]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

The literature of the last 4 years confirms that the anti-CCP2 test is a very useful marker for the early and specific diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The anti-CCP2 test is very specific for RA (95–99%) and has sensitivity comparable to that of the rheumatoid factor (70–75%). The antibodies can be detected very early in the disease and can be used as an indicator for the progression and prognosis of RA. In this review, these interesting properties and some future possibilities of this diagnostic test are discussed.

### The use of second generation anti-CCP antibody (anti-CCP2) testing in rheumatoid arthritis – a systematic review [^116kL3Vc]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the diagnostic properties and predictive value of the second generation of anti-CCP antibodies (anti-CCP2) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.

Methods

A systematic review of the published literature between January 2002 and June 2005 was performed. Data were extracted regarding the sensitivity and specificity of anti-CCP2 antibodies in making an accurate diagnosis of RA, predicting future development of RA, and predicting future radiological damage in RA patients. In addition, the prevalence of CCP2 antibodies in patients with other rheumatic diseases was examined.

Results

Among 38 studies initially identified, 27 provided information on the use of anti-CCP2 testing. Diagnostic properties were assessed in 13 studies; reported sensitivities ranged from 14.4% to 96%, and specificities from 88.9% to 100%. Odds ratios (OR) for the future development of RA varied from 15.9 among previously healthy individuals to 37.8 among a group of patients with undifferentiated arthritis. Several studies suggested that the presence of anti-CCP2 antibodies is highly predictive of current radiographic damage and further damage progression.

Conclusions

Anti-CCP2 has a low sensitivity to be used as a screening test. However, a positive test is highly specific for RA. In addition, anti-CCP2 appears to be highly predictive of the future development of RA in both normal individuals and patients with undifferentiated arthritis. Finally, the presence of anti-CCP2 antibodies appears to predict radiographic damage and progression among patients with RA.

### Autoantibodies to citrullinated antigens in (early) rheumatoid arthritis [^113SR21Y]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common, systemic autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the synovium, that can lead to progressive joint destruction and in many cases results in severe disability and poor quality of life. With the availability of more sophisticated and effective therapies and with increasing evidence that the first few months of disease represent an unique therapeutic opportunity and that such early therapeutic intervention is crucial in preventing irreversible joint damage, it is widely accepted that early and accurate diagnosis of RA is critical in disease management. Within the last three years a growing number of publications have reported that the second generation anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) test may become the marker of choice for diagnosing early RA as it appears to be highly specific for the disease with a sensitivity comparable to the widely used but less specific rheumatoid factor test. Additionally, anti-CCP2 positivity can predict future development of RA in both asymptomatic individuals and in patients with undifferentiated arthritis. Furthermore, antibody levels at presentation can correlate with progression to erosive disease.

### The performance of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide assays in diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11233rjR]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

We assessed the ability of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) tests to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis (RA), comparing the effect of manufacturer assay type, study design (single- and two-gated) and duration of disease (early vs. established).

Methods

We searched seven databases for relevant diagnostic studies containing data on CCP tests in known or suspected RA patients. We used a bivariate model to produce summary estimates for test sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios. Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic (sROC) curves were derived to compare early versus established RA.

Results

83 studies were identified and included. For individual manufacturer tests there was considerable variation in both pooled sensitivity (range 67–83%) and specificity (range 90–96%) estimates. This heterogeneity was also observed when grouping studies into two-gated and single-gated designs. Study design and disease duration impacted on sensitivity, with single-gated study designs and early RA patients resulting in lower estimates than two-gated and established disease, respectively.

Conclusions

This review highlights the large number of CCP tests that are now commercially available and the considerable variation in their diagnostic performance. This variation, although partly influenced in this analysis by the study design (single-gated vs. two-gated), seems to have different levels of impact depending on the manufacturers. The Thermo Fisher Scientific EliA and Inova Diagnostics Quanta Lite (CCP2) tests showed the least between-study variation in sensitivity and specificity suggesting they have the most consistent diagnostic performance overall.

### Anti-CCP antibodies: the past, the present and the future [^113em1De]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibodies against citrullinated antigens. The importance of citrulline for the epitopes bound by these autoantibodies, referred to as ACPA (anti-citrullinated peptide/protein antibodies), was first described in 1998. In addition to citrullinated proteins, cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP) can also be used as test substrates for detecting ACPA. The standard test for these antibodies is the second-generation CCP (CCP2) test, which is one of the best in terms of sensitivity and specificity. The generation of ACPA is an early event in the disease course, and is dependent on the presence of certain MHC class II alleles. ACPA in the inflamed synovium have been shown to associate with citrullinated antigens to form immune complexes, resulting in progression of the inflammatory process. The involvement of ACPA in the chronicity of RA is probably the reason why ACPA-positive patients have a more erosive disease course than ACPA-negative patients. The presence of ACPA has been included in the 2010 RA classification criteria. Thus, it is important to further standardize ACPA testing, for example by including an internal serum standard, which may lead to a better distinction between low and high ACPA levels.

Introduction

The RF is a term initially designated in 1939 for the autoantibodies against the crystallizable fragment (Fc) of denatured immunoglobulin (Ig) G that are detected in the serum of patients with RA. Most RFs are IgM antibodies, and ∼70–90% of patients with RA are RF-positive. However, these antibodies are also detected in patients with other connective tissue diseases or liver diseases and healthy individuals. Therefore, the antibodies do not possess high specificity. Nevertheless, RFs are widely used in real-world clinical practice owing to ease of measurement. In the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA, which adopts a scoring system, a condition with a score of 6 points or higher on a 10-point scale is classified as a definite RA. The serum level of RF and anti-CCP antibody has a weight of 3 points according to the serological test.

In general, the role of serum biomarkers can be divided into at least three major ones: diagnostic tool, measurement of disease activity and selection of therapeutic tools. Anti-CCP is superior to RF in diagnostic tools. Contrarily, RF is associated with disease activity better than anti-CCP antibody and changes in RF, but not anti-CCP, is modulated by treatment with TNF inhibitors. Serum RF positivity and high RF levels are also used as poor prognostic factors for determining treatment strategies. According to the 2022 EULAR recommendations for the treatment of RA, the addition of a concomitant biologic DMARD (bDMARD) or targeted synthetic DMARD (tsDMARD) is recommended for patients who have failed to achieve remission induction with MTX and have poor prognostic factors, such as positivity for RF or anti-CCP antibody. In fact, joint destruction is well-known to progress more rapidly in RF-positive patients with RA than in RF-negative patients. Patients with high serum RF levels are also considered to have high disease activity and poor life prognosis due to organ damage. Therefore, the pathology of RA can be classified by the detection or concentration of RF in the serum.

In this review, I aimed to present an overview of the association between high serum RF levels and the pathological processes and joint destruction in RA. In addition, I described the differences in treatment responsiveness among TNF inhibitors and the mechanisms associated with treatment responsiveness in patients with high RF levels. Finally, I discussed the differential use of TNF inhibitors according to differences in serum RF concentrations, particularly the potential application of precision medicine in RA.

### Utility of testing for third-generation anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP3) antibodies in individuals who present with new musculoskeletal symptoms but have a negative second-generation anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP2) antibody test [^116sACAo]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

The results of the current study suggest a potential role for anti-CCP3 antibody testing in CCP2− individuals who attended their GP with MSK symptoms. Interestingly, low levels (well below the manufacturer's cut-off) of anti-CCP3 antibodies were strongly associated with disease progression. At cut-off values of ≥ 5 units, the OR for self-reported progression, IA progression and RA progression were 16.5, 42.8 and 10.9, respectively. As indicated in table 2, employing an alternative cut-off for the CCP3 assay resulted in an augmented sensitivity, although at the expense of reduced specificity when compared with the standard cut-off. Furthermore, lower cut-off values were associated with an elevated risk of IA development across all three categories. This raises the question of whether cut-off values for anti-CCP3 antibodies (when used in patients with new MSK symptoms) should be lowered, and to what level. This is of particular importance since the majority of studies designed to establish cut-off values for diagnostic assays are based on patients with established disease, and therefore, fulfilling classification criteria. We acknowledge the low prevalence of anti-CCP3 antibodies among anti-CCP2− individuals, as per the manufacturer's cut-off. This must be considered when considering the practical value of using the anti-CCP3 test in predicting the development of IA in this anti-CCP2-negative population. Further research into this area is needed to better understand the implications of this aspect.

Although ACPA is known as a specific diagnostic marker for RA, our current results indicate that low levels of anti-CCP3 antibodies, also predict progression to other autoimmune conditions that may exhibit inflammatory synovitis. Whether this finding reflects a low level of B-cell activation requires further studies. Lastly, the future development of overlap syndromes of RA and other conditions (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis) cannot be ruled out.

As shown in table 3, we have demonstrated a lack of association between progression to IA and family history for RA. One of the reasons for this finding could be attributed to the limited statistical power of our current study. Additionally, we acknowledge that self-reporting of family history by patients is a limitation, as some individuals may misinterpret 'true' RA with other non-inflammatory joint conditions, such as osteoarthritis.

### The role of anti-cyclic cytrullinate antibodies testing in rheumatoid arthritis [^112mAJVh]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive inflammatory disease, which leads to joint destruction and deformity and is often accompanied by systemic complications. It is generally considered an autoimmune disease characterized by several autoantibodies. The impressive advances made in understanding the biological mechanisms of RA have led to more focused, directed therapies that have joined, and in many cases overcome, more traditional treatments. Along the last decade, the so-called biological anti-TNF-alpha agents have been shown to reduce disease activity, to slow disease progression and to improve patients' quality of life. The clear evidence that an early therapeutic intervention improves the overall outcome of the disease supports the importance of an early diagnosis. In the last years, several studies showed that anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) represent a sensitive and specific serologic marker for RA. Moreover, a large body of evidence has shown that anti-CCP may also serve as an early diagnostic and prognostic marker in RA. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge regarding anti-CCP focusing in particular on their clinical specificity and prognostic value in RA.

### Measuring ACPA in the general population or primary care: is it useful? [^112huTiu]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with a significant disease burden and high costs for society. Because the disease has identifiable preclinical stages, screening and prevention have become a possibility in RA. Anticitrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs) are arguably the most likely candidate biomarker to screen for RA. This paper reviews the evidence for the use of ACPAs as a screening test in the broader general population, to identify individuals at high risk of subsequent onset of RA. We will review the diagnostic properties of the test and its positive and negative predictive value in different settings. We will discuss how ACPA testing could effectively be integrated in a broader screening strategy for RA.

### A multivariable prediction model to identify anti-CCP positive people in those with non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms in primary care [^116Rrow8]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Existing prediction models developed by our group that identify people who are likely to develop inflammatory arthritis include anti-CCP testing. However anti-CCP testing is not routinely undertaken in primary care and often with limitations imposed on access to testing. Furthermore, in the UK, current NICE guidance only exists for those where RA is suspected clinically (presence of synovitis) and anti-CCP testing is only recommended if a patient is negative for RF. Anti-CCP testing everyone in primary care who presents with musculoskeletal symptoms would cause a significant burden on an already over-stretched healthcare system; the cost of the tests, an increase in phlebotomy services and time to review results by healthcare professionals will be required. Therefore, changing the diagnostic paradigm to detect RA prior to the onset of clinical synovitis requires targeted anti-CCP testing in people who present with new-onset non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms in primary care to identify those at high risk, before they present with clinical synovitis. Additionally, it will support the implementation of existing tools, developed in anti-CCP positive participants, to refer high-risk individuals to secondary care for more timely review and intervention, potentially altering the course of their disease. In addition to delivering potential prevention intervention, identifying high-risk individuals will enable an earlier diagnosis and treatment of RA should it develop. There are clear benefits to treating RA within 12 weeks of symptom onset. Treatment-related costs have been reported to be lower in patients who were identified earlier (symptom duration < 12 weeks) compared with those with longer symptom duration (> 12 weeks). Importantly, in those who have autoantibody-positive RA, treatment initiation in those who had symptoms for > 12 weeks resulted in more intensive biologics use with overall higher costs within those requiring biologics, suggesting that earlier identification and treatment initiation is likely cost-effective.

### Clinical utility of the anti-CCP assay in patients with rheumatic diseases [^117H2Fou]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the frequency of antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP) in a group of patients with a diversity of rheumatic diseases.

Methods

249 consecutive sera from an arthritis clinic sent for rheumatology testing were selected for testing with the anti-CCP2 assays and for the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF). Patient charts were reviewed for demographic information, clinical diagnosis, radiographic information, and other laboratory data.

Results

The sensitivity and specificity of anti-CCP reactivity for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were 66.0% and 90.4%, respectively. This compared with the sensitivity and specificity of RF for RA at 71.6% and 80.3%. Furthermore, 10/29 (34%) RF- patients with RA demonstrated reactivity to CCP. The presence of either anti-CCP or RF increased testing sensitivity for diagnosis of RA to 81.4%; the presence of both RF and anti-CCP demonstrated a testing specificity similar to that of anti-CCP reactivity alone for the diagnosis of RA (91.1%).

Conclusions

The detection of anti-CCP is useful for the diagnosis of RA, in fact even more so than RF, because of its higher specificity.

### Diagnostic accuracy of combined tests of anti cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody and rheumatoid factor for rheumatoid arthritis: a meta-analysis [^111q8XB2]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the diagnostic properties of combined tests of anti cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP) and rheumatoid factor (RF) in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods

We performed an extensive research between January 2000 and January 2013 of the published literature. A random-effects model was used to summarise data from 24 studies that conformed to our inclusion criteria. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated by threshold effect analysis and meta-regression.

Results

The summary estimates for anti-CCP antibody and RF positivity (both serum markers had to be positive) in the diagnosis of RA were: sensitivity 57% (95% confidence interval (CI), 55% to 59%), specificity 96% (CI, 96% to 97%), positive likelihood ratio (LR) 13.84 (CI, 10.56 to 18.12), negative LR 0.46 (CI, 0.40 to 0.52), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) 33.02 (CI, 23.89 to 45.64). The pooled data for anti-CCP antibody or RF positivity (one serum marker had to be positive) were: sensitivity 78% (CI, 76% to 80%), specificity 82% (CI, 81% to 84%), positive LR 4.24 (CI, 3.61 to 4.97), negative LR 0.27 (CI, 0.22 to 0.34), DOR 16.95 (CI, 12.96 to 22.18).

Conclusions

Both anti-CCP antibody and RF positivity are useful for ruling in the diagnosis of RA, and positivity combined improves the probability of true positivity in the diagnosis. Anti-CCP antibody or RF positivity shows low specificity and positive LR, and should be integrated with other examinations to make a final diagnosis.

### Anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies in rheumatoid and nonrheumatoid rheumatic disorders: experience with 1162 patients [^116bWVZA]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) are considered specific markers of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and have been included in the revised classification criteria for RA diagnosis. However, these antibodies have also been detected in patients with other types of chronic inflammatory rheumatism. Our objectives were to identify the prevalence of positive anti-CCP patients in non-RA diseases, to determine the diagnostic value of anti-CCP for the diagnosis of RA, to specify the clinical characteristics of non-RA patients positive for anti-CCP, and to determine the discriminatory value of the levels of anti-CCP in patients among the various diseases.

Methods

We carried out an observational and descriptive study. All the determinations of anti-CCP requested by the 2 rheumatology departments at Cochin Hospital over a period of 18 months were analyzed. Such determinations were requested for 1162 patients in total. Anti-CCP levels were determined with the Euro Diagnostica ELISA kit, with values ≥ 25 U for this test being considered positive. The diagnosis of rheumatic conditions was the responsibility of the treating physician.

Results

Anti-CCP antibodies were detected in 357 (30.7%) of the 1162 patients. The prevalence of anti-CCP was 292/417 (70.0%) in RA, 13/122 (10.6%) in patients with psoriatic arthritis, 13/62 (20.9%) in patients with unclassified rheumatism, 11/33 (33.3%) in patients with primary Sjögren syndrome, 5/30 (16.6%) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, 3/28 (10.7%) in patients with mixed connective tissue disorder, 3/36 (8.3%) in patients with systemic sclerosis, 7/44 (15.9%) in patients with juvenile arthritis, and 6/220 (2.7%) in patients with noninflammatory diseases. In the population of patients positive for anti-CCP, mean anti-CCP levels were 869.4 (± 978.4) U/ml, with no significant difference between RA [854.8 (± 959.8) U/ml] and any of the non-RA conditions [922.7 (± 1070.0) U/ml].

Conclusion

Anti-CCP are a hallmark of RA, but may be observed in other inflammatory, systemic, or mechanical diseases. In this large cohort of patients, the presence of second-generation anti-CCP (anti-CCP2) antibodies is useful in diagnosing RA (70% sensitivity, 91.3% specificity), but examining the levels of these antibodies does not appear to offer further discriminatory power among patients who are anti-CCP2-positive.

### Measuring ACPA in the general population or primary care: is it useful? [^1176noqQ]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Another approach to increase the predictive value of ACPAs could be to enhance the diagnostic performances of the test to better suit the needs of screening. Some have modified the cut-off level and used higher titters of ACPAs, or have required multiple ACPA reactivity's (called 'fine-specificity ACPAs'). Other have proposed to combine ACPAs with additional biomarkers to increase its specificity or its sensitivity, for example, when both RF and ACPA are present, the specificity for future RA appears to be close to 100%. The discriminative power of ACPAs may be improved by combining other putative biomarkers, such as genetic markers, highly sensitive C reactive protein, cytokine and chemokine profiles, and other autoantibodies, in combination or in series. Still others have proposed to add imaging modalities, such as MRI or articular ultrasound.but the optimal combination of biomarkers and imaging tests to predict future development of RA has not yet been established.

WHO also recommends to consider the cost effectiveness of screening, to weigh the costs involved in identifying a case against the global medical expenditure in a particular setting. Unfortunately, combining several biomarkers or imaging modalities is likely to decrease the cost effectiveness of screening for RA and should probably be reserved for diagnosis rather than for screening strategies. Liang et al have proposed that screening and case finding may be realistically and cost effectively accomplished in a fairly infrequent condition, such as RA, by a serial testing strategy. He proposed to start screening with an inexpensive, sensitive test to prescreen individuals, which could involve an internet questionnaire or a prediction rule. Individual's testing positive would be proposed increasingly more specific tests, which includes ACPAs, and ultimately, a medical assessment for diagnosis and confirmation.

### Utility of testing for third-generation anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP3) antibodies in individuals who present with new musculoskeletal symptoms but have a negative second-generation anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP2) antibody test [^111vqhnm]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Previous studies have demonstrated the potential role of third generation anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP3) antibodies in improving prediction of inflammatory arthritis (IA) in CCP2+ individuals with musculoskeletal (MSK) symptoms.
However, the role of anti-CCP3 antibodies in individuals with MSK symptoms and a negative anti-CCP2 test has not been studied before.

### A multivariable prediction model to identify anti-CCP positive people in those with non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms in primary care [^1125MfCy]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Anti-CCP prediction model performance in 12-month inflammatory arthritis/RA follow-up data

Twelve-month follow-up data were available for 2480 participants (36.1%); of the 4399 participants without follow-up data, 4306 were anti-CCP negative (97.9%). Since follow-up questionnaires are more likely to be completed and returned in the case of an inflammatory arthritis/RA diagnosis, and attempts were made to confirm diagnosis for all anti-CCP positive participants, these participants were presumed to have not developed inflammatory arthritis/RA. The proportion of participants who would/would not be tested according to the anti-CCP prediction model, split by anti-CCP result and 12-month inflammatory arthritis/RA diagnosis is shown in Table 3.

The rate of inflammatory arthritis/RA at 12 months amongst those the model would not recommend for testing, either at the 3% or 4% threshold, was 0.3%.

Of those above the 3% threshold who were anti-CCP positive, 25.4% were diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis/RA within 12 months, compared with 0.2% of those who were anti-CCP negative. At the 4% percent threshold, corresponding figures were 32.1% inflammatory arthritis/RA in those tested who were anti-CCP positive compared with 0.4% RA in those who were anti-CCP negative.

The same data for only participants with follow-up available is shown in Supplementary Table S2, available at Rheumatology online. In 203 anti-CCP positive participants, 38 were diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis/RA within the first 12 months. If we exclude participants without follow-up data available, this equates to an inflammatory arthritis/RA rate of 34.5% (38/110), if we include those without follow-up, assuming no inflammatory arthritis/RA, this figure is 18.7% (38/203) which is more comparable to the 12-month inflammatory arthritis progression rates reported for the anti-CCP positive cohort followed in secondary care at the coordinating centre (15.4%). Note that > 90% of those developing inflammatory arthritis in the secondary care dataset met RA criteria.

### Diagnostic and predictive value of anti-cyclic citrullinated protein antibodies in rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature review [^114sU12G]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the two generations of anti-cyclic citrullinated protein (CCP) antibodies as a diagnostic marker of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and as a predictor of future development of RA in healthy subjects and in patients with early undifferentiated arthritis.

Methods

A systematic analysis of the literature published between 1999 and February 2006 was conducted. Data were collected on the sensitivity and specificity of the two generations of anti-CCP antibodies for diagnosing RA and predicting future development of the disease.

Results

Among 107 studies initially identified, 68 had interpretable data and were analysed. Diagnostic properties were assessed in 58 studies: mean (SD) sensitivity was 53 (10)% (range 41–68) and 68 (15)% (range 39–94) for anti-CCP1 and anti-CCP2, respectively; mean (SD) specificity was 96 (3)% (range 90–99) and 95 (5)% (range 81–100) for anti-CCP1 and anti-CCP2, respectively. Predictive properties were assessed in 14 studies; odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of anti-CCP1 and anti-CCP2 for the future development of RA were 20 (14 to 31) and 25 (18 to 35), respectively, among patients with early undifferentiated arthritis and 64.5 (8.5 to 489) and 28 (8 to 95), respectively, among healthy subjects.

Conclusion

Sensitivity of the second generation of anti-CCP is close to that of rheumatoid factor, with a higher specificity, for distinguishing RA from other rheumatic diseases. Moreover, anti-CCP antibodies appear to be highly predictive of the future development of RA in both healthy subjects and patients with undifferentiated arthritis.

### Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide positivity in non-rheumatoid arthritis disease samples: citrulline-dependent or not? [^112BGtN1]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Antibodies directed against citrullinated proteins (eg anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP)) have excellent diagnostic and good prognostic potential for rheumatoid arthritis. Type 1 autoimmune hepatitis (AIH-1) is a chronic liver disease characterised by a variety of serum autoantibodies. Recently, in a large group of patients with AIH-1 without clear rheumatoid arthritis overlap, a relatively high percentage (9%) of anti-CCP2 positivity was scored.

Objectives

To characterise the citrulline-dependence of the observed anti-CCP2 positivity in AIH-1 sera as well as in other groups of patients without rheumatoid arthritis (mainly rheumatic diseases).

Methods

Serum samples of 57 patients with AIH-1 and 66 patients without rheumatoid arthritis, most of them reported as anti-CCP positive, were tested for citrulline-specific reactivity with a second generation anti-CCP kit, with the citrullinated and the corresponding non-citrullinated (arginine-containing) antigen. A subset of AIH-1 sera was also tested with a CCP1 ELISA (and arginine control).

Results

The anti-CCP2 reactivity of most non-rheumatoid arthritis rheumatic diseases samples (87–93%) was citrulline-specific, whereas a relatively high percentage of AIH-1 samples (42–50%) turned out to be reactive in a citrulline-independent manner. The use of citrullinated and non-citrullinated CCP1 peptides confirmed a high occurrence of citrulline-independent reactivity in AIH-1 samples.

Conclusions

In rheumatoid arthritis and most non-rheumatoid arthritis rheumatologic disease sera, anti-CCP positivity is citrulline-dependent. However in some patients, particularly patients with AIH-1, citrulline-independent reactivity in the anti-CCP2 test can occur. A positive CCP test in a non-rheumatic disease (eg liver disease) should therefore be interpreted with care, and preferably followed by a control ELISA with a non-citrullinated antigen.

### Additional diagnostic and clinical value of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies compared with rheumatoid factor isotypes in rheumatoid arthritis [^113LBSu7]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

In the past decade significant advantages have been made in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and therapeutic strategies have changed a lot. These days, highly effective disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs enable intervention early in the disease process, in order to prevent major joint damage. For years, serological support in the diagnosis of RA has been limited to the presence of rheumatoid factors, although not very specific for RA. During the last years a variety of circulating non-RF antibodies have been discovered and reported to be of potential diagnostic value. CCP2 proved to be a very disease-specific and even sensitive marker for RA. In addition to the diagnostic properties, CCP showed to be a good prognostic marker, CCP helps to predict the erosive or nonerosive progression of the disease, and CCP is already present early in the disease. This diagnostic tool enables the clinician to choose the optimal therapeutic management for each single RA patient.

### Utility of testing for third-generation anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP3) antibodies in individuals who present with new musculoskeletal symptoms but have a negative second-generation anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP2) antibody test [^115qfNaG]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Only a small proportion of anti-CCP2− anti-CCP3 +individuals progressed to IA after 12 months of follow-up. The infrequent progression rate is consistent with the findings from a recent study in which only 0.93% of individuals with anti-CCP2− and MSK symptoms progressed to IA.

Previous studies from our group suggested that testing for anti-CCP3 antibodies in anti-CCP2+ 'at-risk' individuals with MSK symptoms might improve risk stratification for RA development and improve management of these individuals, as well as facilitating the detection of those individuals at imminent risk of any (ie, either clinical or subclinical) joint involvement. In addition, in a recent study, it was demonstrated that the combination of both anti-CCP2 and anti-CCP3 antibodies improves the accurate detection of patients with RA. More specifically, using sera from 127 patients analysed using anti-CCP2 (EliA on Phadia 250 instrument, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and anti-CCP3 (QUANTA Flash on BIO-FLASH, Inova Diagnostics) antibody tests, comparable performance was found between the two CCP assays. However, binary logistic regressions indicated that the likelihood of having RA is significantly higher when testing positive for both anti-CCP2 and anti-CCP3 antibody assays compared with anti-CCP2 or anti-CCP3 antibody assays alone. Consequently, it was concluded that in patients with joint complaints suspected of having RA and with a weakly positive anti-CCP2 antibody (≥ 7 and ≤ 16 U/mL), anti-CCP3 antibody testing could be of additive value for diagnosing RA.

### Measuring ACPA in the general population or primary care: is it useful? [^116nobz7]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

While several authors have proposed a direct pathogenic role of ACPAs, it is also possible that these autoantibodies just reflect pathogenic cellular and humoral activity leading to the development of RA, but without affecting directly joint inflammation. In other terms, ACPA could be innocent bystanders, generated by the biological processes characteristic of the disease. Toes and Pisetsky have recently drafted several recommendations to define with more experimental rigour the potential pathogenic activity of either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies. Although ACPAs are highly cross reactive and bind a large variety of citrullinated proteins, their primary antigenic target relevant to RA and its precise tissue site are unknown.

Screening, case finding and diagnosis

Conceptually, screening needs to be distinguished from case finding and from diagnosis. The principal aim of screening is to detect potential early signs of disease in a large, generally asymptomatic, population. The principal aim of case finding is to search systematically for undiagnosed early disease in groups at increased risk for the disease. The principal aim of diagnosis is to establish the presence or absence of disease in symptomatic individuals. The characteristic of tests will need to be tailored for its primary use. A screening test needs to be inexpensive and easy to perform to be acceptable to a healthy population, and will generally favour sensitivity over specificity in order not to miss potential cases. On the contrary, a diagnostic test may be more invasive and more expensive in order to establish disease, and tends to favour specificity over sensitivity.

ACPAs as a diagnostic test

What makes a good diagnostic test? First, the biomarker should have good sensitivity, which means correctly being positive (above the threshold) in patients with the disease. Second, the biomarker should also have good specificity, meaning correctly being negative (below the threshold) in people without the disease. Furthermore, the test needs to provide good positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV). PPV estimates the probability for a person having a positive test, to really have the disease, while NPV estimates the probability for a person having a negative test, to actually not have the disease. However, even tests with very good sensitivity and specificity may not provide good predictive values, because the predictive value depends on the sensitivity and the specificity of a diagnostic test, and on the probability of the disease in the population. The mathematical link among sensitivity, specificity, prevalence and predictive values, often called Bayes' theorem, is not always well-understood by physicians. Indeed, more than 80% of physicians did not correctly take into account the prevalence when asked to estimate the predictive ability of a given test.

### Comparison of three anti-CCP antibody tests and rheumatoid factor in RA and control patients [^113zdJ5C]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

It was the aim of this study to compare the diagnostic properties of two second generation anti-CCP antibodies assays (Quanta Lite CCP, Inova and EliA CCP, Phadia) with an assay containing a new antigen mixture (Quanta Lite CCP 3, Inova) and RF IgM.

Methods

Sera from 86 RA patients and 90 control patients with other diseases, such as infections, connective tissue diseases, or other rheumatic diseases, were analysed using the four different methods. Specificity (84.4%) and PPV (80.3%) were lowest for RF IgM and highest for EliA CCP (specificity 97.8%, PPV 96.7%), the other values being close to those of EliA CCP. Sensitivity was highest for Quanta Lite CCP (73.3%). Efficiency was highest for Quanta Lite CCP (84.1%) at the lower cut off followed by EliA CCP at both cut offs (83.0%). The discrimination between RA sera (mean value 407.67 U/ml) and control sera (4.54 U/ml) and the relative risk (23.34) were best for EliA CCP. The results of this study reveal that there was no advantage of the anti-CCP antibodies assay applying a new antigen mixture (Quanta Lite CCP 3 ELISA) compared to two second generation anti-CCP antibodies assays (Quanta Lite CCP ELISA and EliA CCP).

### Benefit of early treatment in inflammatory polyarthritis patients with anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies versus those without antibodies [^1144Z1eh]. Arthritis Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

In the past few years, the potential role of anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies has gained increasing attention with respect to the diagnosis and classification of patients with inflammatory arthritis. In recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses, anti-CCP antibody positivity has been as sensitive as but more specific than rheumatoid factor (RF) for distinguishing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from other forms of inflammatory arthritis. Although there is an association between the presence of RF and anti-CCP antibodies and the subsequent development of RA, anti-CCP antibodies may be detectable many years before RF and before the onset of symptoms. Furthermore, anti-CCP antibody positivity is associated with the development of erosions and radiologic progression, independent of the presence of RF. Consequently, anti-CCP antibody–positive and anti-CCP antibody–negative RA are increasingly viewed as separate disease entities. Most studies of the predictive utility of anti-CCP antibodies have investigated either diagnosis or erosive damage, while few have evaluated its utility in clinical practice. In particular, very few studies have compared the value of anti-CCP antibody and RF status in predicting other long-term disease outcomes such as functional disability, disease activity, and mortality.

The clinical utility of anti-CCP antibodies can also be evaluated in terms of response to treatment. Early and aggressive treatment of RA patients is clinically beneficial. Because anti-CCP antibodies are a marker of disease severity and are detectable early in the disease course, they have the potential to identify those patients with early inflammatory arthritis who will benefit from treatment. Disease severity is predictive of early diagnosis and can trigger the decision to treat. However, disease severity is also predictive of poor treatment response; thus, assessment of the differences in responses to treatment by anti-CCP antibody status may be biased due to confounding by indication. Therefore, although anti-CCP antibodies might be a useful marker of who to treat, it is not clear if they will predict those who respond best to treatment.

The aim of this study was 1) to examine the association of anti-CCP antibody and RF status with the long-term outcome of patients with inflammatory polyarthritis (IP), and 2) to examine the differences in response to treatment by anti-CCP antibody status.

### A multivariable prediction model to identify anti-CCP positive people in those with non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms in primary care [^117DtBfn]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Decision curve analysis

Decision curve analysis using the 'dca' R function in the 'dcurves' package assessed net benefit of the model when compared with strategies testing all or no participants. Overfit-corrected estimates were obtained using 10-fold cross-validation. Given the high costs of treating RA vs the relatively low cost of anti-CCP testing, we chose two cut-offs at relatively low likelihood of being anti-CCP positive: 3% (the overall rate of anti-CCP positivity in the group) and 4% (to achieve higher specificity). An anti-CCP prediction model score at or above the threshold would trigger an anti-CCP test which, if positive, could support referral to secondary care. For those scoring below the threshold, an anti-CCP test is not indicated. A threshold of 3% suggests that failing to identify one participant who is anti-CCP positive is 33 times worse than testing one participant who is anti-CCP negative (24 times worse for the 4% threshold). Twelve-month follow-up data were examined to determine the proportions of participants who received a diagnosis of RA (or undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis/seronegative inflammatory arthritis) within 12 (± 3) months. Analyses were performed using R in R Studio.

Secondary care data and a 'simple score'

Recently, our group published a simple score to predict risk of inflammatory arthritis. The simple score was developed for use in primary care and consisted of four variables: anti-CCP value, RF, ESR and participant-reported EMS. Referral to secondary care for follow-up was recommended if the simple score met a threshold calculated based on net benefit and clinical impact. We applied the anti-CCP prediction model to the data used to derive this simple score to mimic how the patient pathway could look if both were implemented. We assessed how many participants would: be identified as likely to be anti-CCP positive; be identified as high risk of inflammatory arthritis and referred to secondary care; and receive an inflammatory arthritis diagnosis within 1 year. Since not all of the variables included in the simple score were collected in the primary care cohort, we were unable to calculate it for our entire prediction model development cohort.

### Changes in proliferation kinetics of T cells: a new predictive cellular biomarkers for early rheumatoid arthritis? [^1145miCf]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Firm diagnosis of RA obtained prior to the onset of severe disability and irreversible morphological damage to cartilage and bone is of the utmost importance. From onwards 1987 the limitations of the American College of Rheumatology criteria for early RA diagnosis resulted in the establishment of new classification criteria by European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology experts in 2010 with the aim of identifying patients with inflammatory arthritis who are at high risk of developing persistent and erosive RA. These criteria are still classification rather than diagnostic criteria, and therefore diagnostic methods which could be termed as biomarkers for such an early distinction are still missing.

Among the available laboratory markers for RA are the recommendations of the 2010 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology which include, in addition to RF, anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA), mainly represented as anti-CCP antibodies. Many results have been obtained which confirm that anti-CCP antibodies have higher specificity and sensitivity than RF in the diagnosis of RA. On the other hand, a number of reports have shown great disproportion in the sensitivity and specificity calculations of serological markers in terms of providing an accurate prognosis of early RA. In addition, the results in diagnosis and prediction of early RA have been sharply contradictory and differed from those for established RA. According to the published results the sensitivity of anti-CCP antibodies in early RA ranges from 39 to 61%, while the specificity ranges from 93 to 98%. Similarly the RF marker showed a sensitivity of 31 to 54% with a specificity from 86 to 93%. The great disparity between the results for sensitivity and specificity is mainly due to the discrepancies in methodology for the kits that are commercially available and differences in set cut-off values and test generation. Despite the higher specificity of the anti-CCP test compared to RF in the diagnosis of early RA, RF still seems to be useful in diagnosis. Ursum et al. showed that RF may be present in patients with RA, the serological negative of anti-CCP antibodies. However, RF and anti-CCP antibodies are detected even in subjects with non-rheumatic disease. One of the severe limitations of anti-CCP antibodies was demonstrated by Ioan-Facsinay et al. who showed that anti-CCP antibodies as measured by the most frequently performed test using the ELISA second generation set of the test and specific anti-CCP antibodies are largely cross-reactive with many epitopes, which outweighs their heterogeneity. These results hardly make either marker acceptable as an early RA predictor.

### Utility of testing for third-generation anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP3) antibodies in individuals who present with new musculoskeletal symptoms but have a negative second-generation anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP2) antibody test [^111pzSGk]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The current preliminary results showed a low prevalence of anti-CCP3 antibodies in individuals with a new MSK symptom and a negative anti-CCP2 antibody test.

Despite the low number of anti-CCP3+ antibody individuals combined with the low disease progression rate in the randomly selected anti-CCP2− subpopulation, our data indicate that anti-CCP3 antibody levels could improve prediction of disease progression to IA (either IA or RA) in this population. Further studies are warranted to validate the findings, especially the observation that lower cut-off values might provide higher accuracy for predicting disease progression.

If validated, it is possible that testing anti-CCP3 antibodies in CCP2− individuals could be a logical approach for increasing detection of those likely to progress to IA.

### Rheumatologic tests: a primer for family physicians [^117BEZ5q]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with a suspected connective tissue disorder should undergo serologic testing to confirm the diagnosis and, in some cases, to monitor disease activity and predict flares. Patients with suspected systemic lupus erythematosus should be tested for antinuclear antibodies. However, antinuclear antibodies are not specific and may be present in many other connective tissue disorders and nonrheumatologic diseases. Thus, patients with suspected systemic lupus erythematosus should undergo further testing to confirm the diagnosis. Patients with Sjögren syndrome may have a positive antinuclear antibody titer, but often also have positive anti-Sjögren antigen A or B results. Similarly, antinuclear antibodies can be present in patients with scleroderma, mixed connective tissue disease, and dermatomyositis or polymyositis. Additional tests are needed to help confirm the diagnosis. In patients with findings of rheumatoid arthritis, a positive rheumatoid factor titer suggests the diagnosis, but as with antinuclear antibodies, it is not specific and can occur in other conditions. Rheumatoid factor can also be negative in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A positive anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody titer is more specific for rheumatoid arthritis and can help confirm the diagnosis. Physicians should order these serologic tests only when patients have a high pretest probability of a specific connective tissue disorder.

### A multivariable prediction model to identify anti-CCP positive people in those with non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms in primary care [^114yDNjW]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

A phase of RA-related autoimmunity often precedes the onset of clinical RA by several months or years, characterized by the presence of anti-CCP antibodies and RF. Therapeutic intervention with MTX and abatacept in people at-risk of RA has been shown to reduce MRI inflammation, clinical symptoms and rates of RA, with sustained efficacy beyond treatment. Models developed for use in secondary care can predict inflammatory arthritis/RA development in people presenting with musculoskeletal symptoms with positive RF and/or anti-CCP antibodies, and positive imaging outcomes, i.e. US power Doppler signal, but without clinical signs of synovitis. However, people who develop musculoskeletal symptoms often initially present in primary care rather than secondary care.

Those subsequently diagnosed with RA in secondary care visit a general practitioner (GP) on average four times before being referred to a specialist for diagnosis; the median time from symptom onset to diagnosis and first treatment is 9 months. Our research team has developed a simple score to predict risk of inflammatory arthritis in anti-CCP positive individuals, which includes four biomarkers: anti-CCP titre, RF, ESR and early morning stiffness (EMS). However, anti-CCP testing is not routinely requested or always accessible in primary care. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) only recommends measuring anti-CCP antibodies if the patient is negative for RF when RA is suspected clinically and it should not delay a referral for a specialist opinion. Thus, there is an opportunity to identify people earlier in the pre-clinical phase of inflammatory arthritis through targeted anti-CCP testing in primary care, combined with inflammatory arthritis prediction models that include anti-CCP.

The existing evidence demonstrates the need for early diagnosis and intervention for inflammatory arthritis in secondary care populations, with the potential for greater gains if people can be identified earlier in primary care. Primary care studies have shown the importance of determining healthcare usage in the 'presentation stage' prior to the diagnosis of RA, and ensuring patients receive early screening for known concomitant diseases (e.g. cardiovascular). We aimed to develop a prediction model to identify which people, among those presenting to primary care with new-onset non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms, are likely to be anti-CCP positive and should be tested for anti-CCP antibodies. Targeted anti-CCP testing could aid early identification of those in the pre-clinical phase of inflammatory arthritis and reduce time to diagnosis.

### Is it necessary to combine detection of anticitrullinated protein antibodies in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis? [^115Sbxfu]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Antibodies against citrulline-containing epitopes, such as antiperinuclear factor (APF), antikeratin antibodies (AKA), antifilaggrin antibodies, and anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, are specific in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Detection of APF, AKA, and anti-CCP has been widely used in clinical practice. However, studies on combined detection of these anti citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) in the significance of diagnosing RA have been limited. We aimed to detect APF, AKA, and anti-CCP antibodies and to evaluate the significance of combined detection of these ACPA in RA.

Methods

A total of 551 patients with arthritic disorders, 304 with RA and 247 with other rheumatic diseases, were selected at the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology during the past 2 years. AKA and APF were tested by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Anti-CCP was detected using the second-generation ELISA kit.

Results

The sensitivities of anti-CCP, AKA, and APF tests for RA were 76.2%, 43.4%, and 34.5%, respectively, while the specificities were 96.0%, 98.4%, and 99.6%. The combination of anti-CCP, AKA, and APF positivity had the highest specificity (100%), but it yielded a low sensitivity (28.3%). When 2 of the 3 ACPA were positive, the sensitivity and specificity were 48.4% and 99.2%, respectively. When either anti-CCP or AKA or APF was positive, sensitivity increased to 77.3%, but specificity decreased to 94.7%.

Conclusion

Anti-CCP was the most valuable marker in the diagnosis of RA, among the 3 ACPA. Combined detection of anti-CCP, AKA, and APF did not increase the diagnostic capability for RA.

### Utility of testing for third-generation anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP3) antibodies in individuals who present with new musculoskeletal symptoms but have a negative second-generation anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP2) antibody test [^1136DG4F]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

In a recent study, our group demonstrated the additional value of anti-CCP3 antibodies for the prediction of inflammatory arthritis (IA) development in anti-CCP2+ 'at-risk' individuals with new MSK symptoms. A positive anti-CCP3 antibody test increased the risk of developing IA from 38.9% to 48.4% in high-titre anti-CCP2+individuals, while a negative anti-CCP3 test decreased such risk from 38.9% to 9.8% in the same population.

A subsequent study from our research group showed that in CCP2+ 'at-risk' individuals with MSK symptoms, anti-CCP3 antibodies were associated with the development of US subclinical synovitis. This study raised the hypothesis that anti-CCP2+/CCP3+ individuals without subclinical joint disease might be at a critical transition point in the evolution of RA (ie, the transition from autoimmunity to joint inflammation) and could potentially represent the optimal 'window of opportunity' for the introduction of preventative treatments (ie, before the so-called 'second hit' in RA pathogenesis occurs).

On the other hand, the role of anti-CCP3 antibodies in anti-CCP2 negative (anti-CCP2−) individuals who present to primary care with new MSK symptoms has not been explored. Therefore, it remains unclear whether testing for anti-CCP3 antibodies in such a cohort of individuals would improve the prediction of IA development and whether or not these antibodies have a role in primary care screening.

Thus, the aims of the current study were to explore the prevalence of anti-CCP3 positivity in anti-CCP2− individuals who have presented to primary care with new non-specific MSK symptoms. In addition, to determine the additional value of testing for and identifying anti-CCP3 antibody positivity in predicting progression to IA in anti-CCP2− individuals who present with non-specific MSK symptoms.

Performance of the anti-CCP prediction model and 12-month follow-up of primary care participants: sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of the score used to predict anti-CCP status at key decision thresholds

High anti-CCP titres (> 3 times the upper limit of normal) have previously been shown to be particularly predictive of inflammatory arthritis/RA. Using the 3% risk threshold, 1.0% (39/4101) of those below the threshold had high-titre anti-CCP compared with 3.1% (85/2778) above the threshold. Using the 4% risk threshold, the corresponding results were 1.2% (65/5591) vs 4.6% (59/1288).

### Anti-citrullinated protein / peptide antibodies (ACPA) in rheumatoid arthritis: specificity and relation with rheumatoid factor [^1174WXh7]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Anti-citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPA) are highly specific and sensitive markers for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). For instance, for the anti-CCP2 assay, sensitivities ranging from 55% to 80% and specificities ranging from 90% to 98% have been reported. Despite their high specificity, recent reports have suggested that ACPA may be found in some patients with other rheumatic autoimmune diseases, including psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren's syndrome. Also, the differences between the classical rheumatoid factor (RF) and ACPA, as well as the complementarity between both tests have recently been demonstrated more clearly. Indeed, both antibody systems have a different association with specific RA features like extra-articular manifestations, a different association with the HLA shared epitope and, behave differently following anti-TNF therapy.

Demographic and serological features and their associations with disease progression

Based on these findings, multivariable analyses were conducted to understand the individual value of anti-CCP3 antibodies in disease progression. A total of three multivariable analyses models were generated (see table 4). Anti-CCP3 antibodies remained statistically significant for self-reported progression (p = 3.2E−06) as well as for RA diagnosis by a rheumatologist (p = 0.019), but not for IA diagnosis by a rheumatologist (p = 0.154).

### A multivariable prediction model to identify anti-CCP positive people in those with non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms in primary care [^114u3Vf6]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although the aim of this study was to develop a prediction model to aid targeted anti-CCP testing, the addition of 12-month follow-up data is important as it confirms the higher rate of reported inflammatory arthritis/RA in anti-CCP positive participants (18.7% vs < 1% in anti-CCP negative participants), highlighting the need to focus on this group of individuals. All anti-CCP positive participants were invited to be followed-up in secondary care, however only 93 (45.8%) accepted. Along with the participants who were anti-CCP negative, these participants were sent questionnaires 12 months after enrolment asking about their RA status. In addition to the 93 participants followed-up in secondary care, 12-month RA status was available for 2387 participants (36.1% in total). Failure to return the questionnaire (change of address, death, not received) was suspected to be the main reason for limited 12-month follow-up data, and we assumed that these participants had not received a diagnosis of RA in order to avoid the over-inflation of positive RA diagnosis. However, seronegative RA represents an important subset who would not be targeted by our prediction model and our assumption of no RA diagnosis amongst those who were anti-CCP negative and did not return a questionnaire may have underestimated the rate in this group.

External validation of our predication model is required, however there are no comparable existing external cohorts which have collected sufficient data. Following development of an intervention to implement the model in primary care we are proposing an intervention evaluation study, which will support external validation of the prediction score.

### Diagnostic and clinical value of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies compared with rheumatoid factor isotypes in rheumatoid arthritis [^114Lxp8X]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the additional diagnostic and clinical value of the second test generation of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (CCP2) compared with rheumatoid factor isotypes (IgG-RF, IgA-RF, IgM-RF) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Methods

This was a prospective study on 715 patients: rheumatoid arthritis (n = 295), degenerative or other inflammatory joint disease (n = 163), connective tissue disease or vasculitis (n = 103), and healthy controls (n = 154). Sera from each subject were tested for CCP2 and RF isotypes by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Agreement with clinical indices such as disease activity, joint destruction, disease duration, and other laboratory tests was assessed. Sensitivity and specificity of the tests were evaluated taking the clinical diagnosis as the gold standard.

Results

Highest sensitivity was found for IgM-RF (66.4%) and CCP (64.4%). Highest specificity was achieved by CCP (97.1%) and IgG-RF (91.0%). In rheumatoid patients with high disease activity or severe joint damage, CCP was more often present (81.4% and 83.6%) than all RF isotypes. Of special diagnostic value was the detection of positive CCP in 34.5% of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis when all measured RF isotypes (IgG-RF, IgA-RF, and IgM-RF) were negative.

Conclusions

As a screening method for rheumatoid arthritis the IgM-RF and the CCP assays are superior to other RF isotypes. Positivity in the highly specific CCP ELISA supports the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. CCP proved to be a powerful diagnostic tool, especially in ambiguous cases or RF negative patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

### A multivariable prediction model to identify anti-CCP positive people in those with non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms in primary care [^111CedRV]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to develop a prediction model identifying people presenting to primary care with musculoskeletal symptoms likely to be anti-CCP positive and therefore at risk of developing RA.

Methods

Participants aged ≥ 16years, with new-onset non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms and no history of clinical synovitis, completed a symptom questionnaire and had an anti-CCP test. Model development used LASSO-penalized logistic regression, performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and decision curve analysis, model over-fit was estimated using bootstrapping and cross-validation. Participants were followed-up at 12months for RA or seronegative/undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis diagnosis.

Results

Analysis included 6879 participants; 203 (2.95%) of whom were anti-CCP positive. Eleven predictors were retained: male sex, first-degree relative with RA, ever smoked and joint pain in: back, neck, shoulders, wrists, hands/fingers, thumbs, knees, feet/toes. AUROC was 0.65 (95% CI 0.61, 0.69, optimism = 0.03). Using a 4% decision threshold, the model recommended an anti-CCP test in 1288 (18.7%) participants, 78 (6.1%) of whom were anti-CCP positive, compared with 125/5591 (2.2%) below the threshold. Net benefit was 0.0040 (0.0020 corrected). Forty-eight participants were diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis/RA within 12months. Of those who were above the threshold and anti-CCP positive, 32.1% developed inflammatory arthritis/RA compared with 0.4% of those who were anti-CCP negative. Of those below the threshold, 0.3% were diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis/RA.

Conclusions

Targeted anti-CCP testing in primary care may aid earlier identification of people at risk of RA, prompting specialist referral to rheumatology for earlier diagnosis and initiation of disease-modifying therapy.

### Diagnosis, prognosis and classification of early arthritis: results of a systematic review informing the 2016 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis [^111ejpc3]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests

The included studies mainly evaluated RF (21 studies) and ACPAs, in particular anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies (26 studies) (see online supplementary materials S5). The value of RF for the diagnosis of RA in patients presenting with EA was heterogeneous. In almost two-thirds of the studies, sensitivity of RF for a RA diagnosis was moderate, between 40% and 60%. In the last third, sensitivity was higher (60–80%). Half of the studies reported a specificity of RF for a RA diagnosis between 60% and 80%. In the other half, specificity was higher (80–100%). ACPAs' sensitivity for a RA diagnosis was similar to that of RF, with values between 40% and 60% in 10 studies and between 60% and 80% in 6 studies. On the other hand, the specificity of ACPA testing for a RA diagnosis was higher than that of RF testing, with more than three-quarters of the studies reporting values between 80% and 100%. According to seven of the studies, testing (and interpreting) the combined results of RF as well as ACPAs was of minor additional benefit for the specificity, in comparison with testing one of each alone. The value of RF and ACPA titres was investigated in only two studies. In the study by Funovits et al, positivity of RF or ACPAs with high titres (defined by a value higher than three-fold the normal rate) was associated with a diagnosis of RA (OR 3.9 (3.0 to 5.0)), almost twice as frequently than positivity with low titres (OR 2.2 (1.8 to 3.3)).

### A multivariable prediction model to identify anti-CCP positive people in those with non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms in primary care [^114PA9BG]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Performance of anti-CCP prediction model combined with 'simple score' in secondary care data

Our anti-CCP prediction model is designed to facilitate targeted anti-CCP testing, aiding the implementation of the simple score developed by our group in anti-CCP positive participants, demonstrated in Supplementary Fig. S2, available at Rheumatology online. The simple score was developed in secondary care data consisting of 455 anti-CCP positive participants, 70 (14.4%) of whom were from our full primary care cohort [35 (7.7%) included in the current anti-CCP prediction model development]. Demographics of the 455 participants can be found in Duquenne et al. (2023), 70 participants were diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis within 12 months. Four-hundred and one participants had sufficient data to calculate both the anti-CCP prediction model (3% and 4% threshold) and the simple score. The anti-CCP prediction model correctly identified 47.9% (3% threshold) and 25.2% (4% threshold) of the anti-CCP positive participants (Table 4). Approximately half of the participants above each anti-CCP prediction model threshold, were also above the threshold for the simple score and would therefore be recommended for follow-up in secondary care. Of these 37% (3% threshold) and 45.5% (4% threshold) received an inflammatory arthritis diagnosis within 12 months, > 90% of whom met criteria for RA. Of those below each threshold for anti-CCP testing in our model, 12% developed inflammatory arthritis within 1 year.

### A comparison of the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of the first and second anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP1 and CCP2) autoantibody tests for rheumatoid arthritis [^113gbQSN]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the diagnostic performance and prognostic value of the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP1) and anti-CCP2 autoantibody tests in a clinical setting.

Methods

Anti-CCP1 and anti-CCP2 antibody tests were performed on the same serum samples obtained from 467 patients with early arthritis from the Leiden Arthritis Cohort. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for discriminating between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and non-RA at 1 year's follow up were calculated for both tests. Results were graphically presented using receiver operating characteristic curves. Progression of radiological joint damage was assessed over 4 years in patients with RA and used to assess the prognostics values of the CCP tests.

Results

At a similar specificity the CCP2 test had a higher sensitivity than the CCP1 test. Both tests identified a subgroup of patients with RA with an increased rate of joint damage progression. The anti-CCP2 test identified more patients with an increased rate of joint damage progression than the anti-CCP1 test, and in multiple regression analysis CCP2 was the better predictor of joint damage.

Conclusions

The CCP2 test had better diagnostic and prognostic ability than the CCP1 test.

### A new strategy for the early diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis: a combined approach [^112TjqZX]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis [RA] is one of the most common and severe autoimmune rheumatic diseases, diagnosed primarily according to clinical manifestations and radiological reports. For many years, laboratory diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis has relied on the detection of rheumatoid factor [RF], as established by the ACR criteria. A recent test to detect antibodies towards citrullinated peptides, called the anti-CCP assay, showed a similar sensitivity but a more elevated specificity than the RF test. Our intention was the recognition of an optimal diagnostic strategy that exhibits the highest sensitivity and specificity for RA detection. To this purpose, we examine the usefulness of autoantibodies in RA testing, evaluating the diagnostic performance of conventional and innovative assays for RF detection, and ELISA anti-CCP test, for anti-CCP antibodies detection, by a prospective study. Multiplex cytofluorimetric test appeared to be more sensitive and specific than nephelometric assay for RF detection. Hence, a novel combined approach, significantly increasing the diagnostic sensitivity for RA, was planned, employing the multiplex RF test in combination with the anti-CCP test.

### Mixed connective tissue disease: state of the art on clinical practice guidelines [^113jTM4L]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Unmet needs

This is the first review providing an overview of currently available CPGs for MCTD. We did not identify specific CPGs addressing important issues in MCTD. Efficient and effective guidelines improve patient care and help medical practice and decision-making. Therefore, the ERN-ReCONNET MCTD group agrees on the general need for specific recommendations for MCTD. To prioritise what should be done in the matter of MCTD, three major objectives were proposed for CPGs future development:

CPGs on MCTD diagnosis (diagnostic criteria): Although different sets of clinical criteria have been proposed, there is no consensus about the most accurate one.MCTD often resembles several conditions and yet can easily be misdiagnosed by numerous rheumatic conditions including systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or so-called overlap syndromes. Without a standardised and acknowledged set of criteria, an agreement regarding MCTD existence and disease CPGs is not possible. Moreover, such classification criteria would facilitate the establishment of registers to collect a meaningful number of patients with MCTD to evaluate the course and prognosis. The classification criteria would also enable to evaluate the role of biomarkers, specifically the potential diagnostic/prognostic role of antibodies targeting U1 snRNP and/or in combination with the detection of autoantibodies that could earlier characterise more defined CTDs such as anti-SCL70, anti-CCP, anti-Jo1, antiSm, anti-ds-DNA-associated entities for defining early progression.
CPGs on MCTD initial and follow-up evaluations: At present, the initial approach, the type and the frequency of follow-up assessments of patients with MCTD are often handled very differently or performed according to the management of other rheumatic diseases. On one hand, MCTD is described as a potentially mild and often treatable condition. On the other hand, the disease is incurable and can be deleterious or even life-threatening with development of pulmonary, kidney, gastrointestinal and central nervous system involvement. Here, early and targeted intervention will definitively be associated with a better outcome. The worst prognosis and high mortality are associated with the presence of pulmonary disease. To improve management, it would certainly be helpful to develop and validate a (composite) disease activity score for MCTD that takes into account all relevant signs and symptoms. Agreement on the frequency of follow-up assessments during the course of disease on the basis of guidelines would facilitate the management of patients for clinicians.
CPGs on MCTD treatment: There is no agreement about the initial or long-term treatment of MCTD, especially on the usefulness of low-dose glucocorticoids, antimalaria and immunosuppressive therapies in various clinical situations. To date, there has been no randomised controlled trial in MCTD. Usually, patients with MCTD are treated based on similarities with other CTDs or based on organ-based management. Classification criteria would therefore also enable to perform clinical trials on therapeutic interventions. In addition, the management of comorbidities (such as osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, etc) and specific situations (such as pregnancy, family planning, etc) should be addressed. Overall, the ERN-ReCONNET MCTD group agrees on the need for evidence-based CPGs on MCTD treatment. Such guidelines undoubtedly require careful data collection from a larger number of patients and collaboration between experts and registers from different countries.

### Laboratory biomarkers or imaging in the diagnostics of rheumatoid arthritis? [^116hyWmg]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

ACPAs isotype distribution does not expand during disease progression from the undifferentiated arthritis to RA and is relatively stable over time. In RA, the baseline ACPAs isotype profile was a significant predictor of disease severity, with more isotypes indicating a higher risk of radiographic damage. Among ACPAs, anti-CCP has a superior diagnostic and prognostic value. Table 1 summarizes the diagnostic value of various ACPA assays. Anti-CCP and IgA-RF predict the development of RA, with anti-CCP antibody having the highest predictive value. RF (IgM, IgA isotypes) and anti-CCP associated with more severe disease indicated by more erosions and severe functional impairment. The presence of anti-MCV also predicted joint damage, and the strength of this prediction was at least as strong as for anti-CCP. Higher anti-MCV levels add prognostic information compared to their mere presence or absence.

### Value of antibodies to citrulline-containing peptides for diagnosing early rheumatoid arthritis [^112fqw4u]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the diagnostic values of antiperinuclear factor (APF), antikeratin antibody (AKA), and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides (anti-CCP) to discriminate between patients with and without rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to determine the diagnostic value of anti-CCP used alone or with other tests.

Methods

Two hundred and seventy patients with early arthritis underwent standardized investigations in 1995–1997. The clinical utility of APF, AKA, and anti-CCP in first-visit sera was evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic curves. Combinations of anti-CCP with other laboratory tests were assessed by multiple logistic regression.

Results

Anti-CCP, APF, and AKA were not perfectly correlated with one another. Anti-CCP with 53 UI as the cutoff was 47% sensitive and 93% specific, versus 52% and 79%, and 47% and 94%, for APF and AKA, respectively. Multiple logistic regression selected anti-CCP, AKA, IgM-rheumatoid factor (RF) ELISA, and the latex test.

Conclusion

Rheumatologists can routinely use 2 or 3 tests for diagnosing RA (latex and/or IgM RF ELISA, and either AKA or anti-CCP ELISA) and can add a third or fourth test when the diagnosis remains in doubt.

### Ultrasound subclinical synovitis in anti-CCP-positive at-risk individuals with musculoskeletal symptoms: an important and predictable stage in the rheumatoid arthritis continuum [^114CTQNF]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Rheumatology key messages
The majority of anti-CCP2-positive at-risk individuals go through a stage of subclinical synovitis before the development of inflammatory arthritis.
CCP2-positive at-risk individuals can be identified prior to any joint involvement by the presence of anti-CCP3 antibodies.
This may represent the optimal 'window of opportunity' for intervention to prevent joint disease.

Study design

For the current study, a subpopulation of the whole cohort of anti-CCP2− individuals with MSK symptoms (437 of 6587 CCP2− individuals) was selected. These 437 CCP2− individuals were identified as an age-matched and sex-matched control group for CCP2+ individuals in a previous study. Data on this control group were not presented before. Due to the known low prevalence of progression to IA in CCP2− individuals, we also collated data from another subgroup of anti-CCP2− individuals who were known progressors to IA. As previously described, the total number anti-CCP2− individuals who in our cohort progressed to IA was 53. Of these, 43 had an available stored serum sample for CCP3 testing and were included in this study. This latter group of 43 individuals also included 11 patients who were also in the initial randomly selected 437 anti-CCP2− subpopulation and were, therefore, removed to avoid duplication. Thus, a total of 469 anti-CCP2− individuals who presented to their GP with new MSK symptoms were included in this study. Figure 1 provides a schematic description of the study design.

Figure 1
Schematic representation of the study design. *Refers to reference n = 21; refers to reference n = 25. +ve, positive; −ve, negative; Ab, antibodies; CCP, cyclic citrullinated peptide; IA, inflammatory arthritis.

If any of the 469 anti-CCP2− individuals self-reported progression to IA, which was defined as the development of swelling in at least one joint, their GPs were contacted by a member of our study team to confirm or refute the individual's rheumatological disease status. Individuals whose rheumatological diagnosis was confirmed by a rheumatologist were defined as either RA progressors or IA progressors (which included RA progressors, spondyloarthritis, IA in systemic sclerosis, IA in systemic lupus erythematosus, IA in polymyalgia rheumatica), according to corresponding international diagnostic/classification criteria.

Serological assay

For the 469 anti-CCP2− individuals, stored serum samples obtained from 2008 to 2018 were tested for CCP3 IgG (QUANTA Lite CCP3; Inova Diagnostics). CCP2 and CCP3 testing was performed on the same stored serum samples. The threshold for a positive CCP3 antibody test was > 20 units, according to the manufacturer's cut-off. In addition, alternative cut-off values were evaluated derived from optimised F-1 score analysis.

RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

The characteristics of the 469 anti-CCP2− individuals included in the study are reported in table 1. Only 16/469 (3.4%) anti-CCP2− individuals had a positive anti-CCP3 test. Of the anti-CCP2− individuals identified as 'progressors' in a previous study, 4/43 (9.3%) were positive for anti-CCP3 antibodies.

Table 1
Main characteristics of the included population of progressors (self-reported progressors, IA/RA progressors) versus non-progressors

Discrimination between progressors and non-progressors

Among the 469 anti-CCP2− individuals, 61 (13.0%) self-reported or were subsequently confirmed to have disease progression. Of these 61, 43 (70.5%) were confirmed to have progressed to IA by a rheumatologist; of whom 30/43 (69.8%) and 13/43 (30.2%) were given a diagnosis of IA and RA, respectively.

A summary of the disease progression is presented in online supplemental figure 1 and online supplemental table 1.

Anti-CCP3 antibody levels differed significantly between IA progressors and non-progressors (p < 0.001; see figure 2). The ROC analyses showed strong discrimination for anti-CCP3 antibodies between progressors and non-progressors with AUC values of 0.832 (95% CI 0.798 to 0.866) for self-reported progression, 0.887 (95% CI 0.858 to 0.915) for IA and 0.789 (95% CI 0.753 to 0.826) for RA. At the manufacturer's cut-off (≥ 20 units), the sensitivity for progression to overt disease ranged from 8% for RA to 9% for IA, with high specificity of 97% (see table 2). ORs were 2.4 (95% CI 0.5 to 18.6) for RA and 3.5 (95% CI 1.2 to 11.0) for IA. Interestingly, when cut-offs were optimised for F-1 score, lower cut-off values (≥ 5 units) significantly increased the OR for progression in all three categories (ie, self-reported progression, IA and RA) (see table 2 and figure 3).

RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study has some limitations. First, we merged a selected population of known anti-CCP2− progressors to IA with a randomly selected subpopulation of anti-CCP2− individuals (both having non-specific MSK symptoms), therefore, the overall prevalence of progression was very much higher than expected or observed in real life. This meant that rate of progression in this merged population would have created potentially biased results, though analysing rate of progression in the randomly selected anti-CCP2− cohort could be representative of the general population (and our figures support this). Second, our cohort included low numbers of progressors within 12 months of follow-up. Overall, 61 participants reported disease progression, but only 43 were diagnosed as IA or RA by a rheumatologist resulting in limited statistical power to perform extensive statistical analyses. However, based on the high predictive value of ACPA, this represents an inherent limitation of all studies on ACPA-negative RA. Despite the low number of progressors, we observed statistical difference among patients depending on the cut-off used for anti-CCP3 antibodies. Third, the sensitivity of the patients' reported questionnaire for the diagnosis of IA is unknown, and the period of observation was relatively short (12 months). In other words, it remains unknown how many of the individuals who did not report progression eventually developed or will develop IA. In addition, some important information on the study population was not available, such as body mass index, shared epitope status, current treatment, as these were not included in the patients' questionnaires. The main objective of the current study was to assess the additional value of a second CCP assay for clinically feasible predictive testing. Indeed, it may not be feasible in all centres to have access to multiple antimodified protein antibodies. In the current study, the included population of anti-CCP2− individuals was identified as a control group for anti-CCP2+ patients in a previous study of our group. In these CCP2− individuals, stored serum samples were used to test anti-CCP3 antibodies but not anti-CarP antibodies or RF testing.

### Time to include fine specificity anti-citrullinated protein antibodies in the routine diagnosis and management of rheumatoid arthritis? [^116SkZY4]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Antibodies to citrullinated protein antigens (ACPAs) are part of the classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 1. ACPAs can be measured using generic tests, such as the cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) assays, that use artificially generated synthetic peptides with no homology to known proteins, which provide good diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Peptides from real autoantigens (fine specificities) tend to be of lower diagnostic sensitivity and are used primarily for research into disease pathogenesis, rather than clinical management. In a recent study 2, we found 2 groups of ACPA fine specificities associated with different RA risk factors. One, dominated by antibodies to citrullinated α‐enolase peptide 1 (CEP‐1), was linked to smoking and shared epitope as previously described 3. The second group, linked to antibodies to a citrullinated peptide from tenascin‐C (cTNC5), was associated with infection with the periodontal pathogen Prevotella intermedia. The relative distinctions between anti–CEP‐1 and anti‐cTNC5 prompted us to ask whether testing for these 2 fine specificities in combination with anti‐CCP2 would be clinically useful in improving diagnosis or identifying clinical subsets among patients with RA.

### Meta-analysis: diagnostic accuracy of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody and rheumatoid factor for rheumatoid arthritis [^114XnAVw]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Rheumatoid factor (RF) and autoantibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) are markers that might help physicians diagnose rheumatoid arthritis.

Purpose

To determine whether anti-CCP antibody more accurately identifies patients with rheumatoid arthritis and better predicts radiographic progression than does RF.

Data Sources

MEDLINE through September 2006 and reference lists of retrieved studies and review articles.

Study Selection

Studies in any language that enrolled at least 10 participants and that examined the role of anti-CCP antibody and RF in the diagnosis or prognosis of known or suspected rheumatoid arthritis.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently evaluated studies for inclusion, rated methodological quality, and abstracted relevant data.

Data Synthesis

The DerSimonian-Laird random-effects method was used to summarize sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative likelihood ratios from 37 studies of anti-CCP antibody and 50 studies of RF. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios for anti-CCP antibody were 67% (95% CI, 62% to 72%), 95% (CI, 94% to 97%), 12.46 (CI, 9.72 to 15.98), and 0.36 (CI, 0.31 to 0.42), respectively. For IgM RF, the values were 69% (CI, 65% to 73%), 85% (CI, 82% to 88%), 4.86 (CI, 3.95 to 5.97), and 0.38 (CI, 0.33 to 0.44). Likelihood ratios among IgM RF, IgG RF, and IgA RF seemed to be similar. Results from studies of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis were similar to those from all studies. Three of 4 studies found that risk for radiographic progression was greater with anti-CCP antibody positivity than with IgM RF positivity.

Limitations

Many studies had methodological limitations. Studies of RF were heterogeneous and had wide ranges of sensitivity and specificity.

Conclusions

Anti-CCP antibodies are more specific than RF for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis and may better predict erosivedisease.

### Second generation automated anti-CCP test better predicts the clinical diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis [^1149aB72]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common systemic autoimmune diseases. The presence of antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) is better at discriminating RA patients and is also associated with significantly more disease activity compared to serum rheumatoid factor. In this study, we assessed two new automated second generation tests to detect the presence of anti-CCP antibodies in 226 serum samples submitted to the Clinical Immunology Laboratory for anti-CCP antibody testing. We compared CCP antibody results on these samples obtained using the ImmunoCAP 250 (Phadia) and the Architect i2000SR (Abbott Laboratories) instruments to our currently used CCP IgG third generation manual ELISA (Inova Diagnostics). One hundred and fifty-four samples were negative while 52 were positive by all three tests. Eighteen samples were negative by the automated tests but weakly/moderately positive by manual ELISA yielding an overall concordance of 79%. When we compared the discordant test results to patient diagnosis, we observed a better correlation with clinical RA diagnosis for the new automated tests compared to the manual ELISA. These two new anti-CCP antibody tests have the benefit of automation and may have better positive predictive value for the diagnosis of RA than our current manual ELISA.

### Multicentre study to improve clinical interpretation of rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein / peptide antibodies test results [^112Q8E5w]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease that affects approximately 1% of the population. It is characterised by joint inflammation that can lead to cartilage and bone damage if left untreated and can potentially result in disability, reduction of quality of life and increased mortality. Early identification of RA (even in the preclinical phase) is critical as early intervention results in better long-term disease control and can prevent joint damage. Identifying a person with RA can be challenging, even for expert physicians. Clinical signs and symptoms alone are usually insufficient to diagnose RA. The presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPA) in serum supports the diagnosis of RA. However, there is poor agreement among the currently available RF and ACPA assays, which may have an impact on RA diagnosis and classification of a patient. This poor agreement not only relates to heterogeneity in test characteristics (nature of antigen, assay set up, affinity/avidity and antibody detection methodology), but also, and largely, to heterogeneity in the way the cut-off is set. Differences in cut-off values among assays were clearly demonstrated by the fact that the international standard for RF (W1066) scored either negative, equivocal or positive, depending on the assay used. Thus, there is an evident need to harmonise clinical interpretation of autoantibody tests used for RA diagnosis.

The aim of this international multicentre study is to harmonise interpretation of commonly used commercially available RF and ACPA assays. In order to overcome differences in the arbitrary units of the different assays, we applied the concept of likelihood ratio (LR), which is a unit-independent method to express test results. The LR is defined as the fraction of patients with a particular test result divided by the fraction of controls with the same test result. For example, a test result with an LR of 10 indicates that this test result is 10 times more likely to be found in patients with the disease than in (disease) controls, whereas a test result with an LR of 0.1 is 10 times less likely to be found in patients with the disease than in (disease) controls. The LR allows to convey immediately clinically relevant information related to the antibody level. The higher the antibody level, the higher the LR for disease. Based on the LR, the post-test probability of disease can be estimated (post-test odds = pre-test odds×LR).

To further evaluate the role of anti-CCP3 antibodies in anti-CCP2− individuals, we assessed the association of age, gender and family history of RA with IA progression. As shown in table 3, older age was statistically associated with self-reported progression (p < 0.0001) and RA progression (p = 0.0006). Male gender was statistically associated with self-reported progression (p = 0.0010) and IA diagnosis by rheumatologist (p = 0.0113). Interestingly, there was no association between reported family history for RA with any progression group.

RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the role of third-generation anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP3) antibodies in predicting progression to inflammatory arthritis (IA) in individuals with new musculoskeletal (MSK) symptoms and a negative second-generation anti-CCP antibody test (anti-CCP2−).

Methods

469 anti-CCP2− individuals underwent baseline anti-CCP3 testing (QUANTA Lite CCP3; Inova Diagnostics) and received a post enrolment 12-month questionnaire. A rheumatologist confirmed or excluded diagnosis of IA. Univariable/multivariable analyses were performed to assess the value of anti-CCP3 in predicting IA development in these anti-CCP2− individuals.

Results

Only 16/469 (3.4%) anti-CCP2− individuals had a positive anti-CCP3 test. Of these 16 individuals, 4 developed IA. In addition, 61/469 (13.0%) anti-CCP2− individuals self-reported, to have developed, IA. Progression was confirmed in 43/61 of them (70.5%); of whom 30/43 (69.8%) and 13/43 (30.2%) were given a diagnosis of IA and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), respectively. In qualitative univariable analysis, anti-CCP3 positivity was associated with self-reported progression (p < 0.01) and IA (p = 0.03), but not with RA. Anti-CCP3 levels differed significantly between progressors and non-progressors (p < 0.01) for all three categories. At the manufacturer's cut-off, OR for progression ranged from 2.4 (95% CI 0.5 to 18.6; RA) to 7.5 (95% CI 2.3 to 24.0; self-reported progression). Interestingly, when cut-offs for anti-CCP3 were optimised, lower values (≥ 5 units) significantly increased the OR for progression in all three categories. In multivariable analysis, anti-CCP3 positivity at the manufacturer's cut-off did not remain associated with IA progression, while this lower cut-off value (≥ 5 units) was associated with diagnosis of RA (p = 0.02).

Conclusions

Anti-CCP3 testing could improve the prediction of IA development in anti-CCP2− individuals with new MSK symptoms.

### Combining anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide with the American College of Rheumatology 1987 criteria failed to improve early rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis in the community-based very early arthritis cohort [^115Te6Q4]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To test the performances of combining anti-CCP second generation (CCP2) with ACR 1987 classification criteria and to diagnose early RA in a community-based very early arthritis (VErA) patient cohort.

Methods

The VErA cohort comprised 310 patients (median age 52 years; 68.1% women; median symptom duration 4.2 months; glucocorticoid- and DMARD naïve) conservatively treated during the first 2 years. At 6 years of follow-up, a three-expert committee classified the patients into three groups: RA, other classified arthritis (OCA) or unclassified arthritis (UA). We calculated the performances of the different sets, including anti-CCP2 positivity, while retaining or deleting RF and rheumatoid nodule components with ACR 1987 criteria for early RA diagnosis. Models were subjected to receiver operating characteristics curve and logistic regression analyses to try to identify relevant sets able to classify very early RA.

Results

At 6 years, 149 patients were diagnosed as RA and 119 as non-RA (95 OCA and 24 UA). The original ACR 1987 criteria had 77.9% sensitivity and 64.7% specificity for the RA diagnosis at 6 years. The modified set excluding rheumatoid nodules, including anti-CCP2 positivity and retaining RF performed significantly better than ACR 1987 criteria, with 79.9% sensitivity and 64.7% specificity and with a larger area under the curve. However, in the zone of interest, i.e., ≥ 4/7 criteria, the curves for these sets were superimposed.

Conclusions

Adding anti-CCP2 positivity and deleting rheumatoid nodules failed to improve the performances of ACR 1987 classification criteria for the diagnosis of early RA.

### Time to include fine specificity anti-citrullinated protein antibodies in the routine diagnosis and management of rheumatoid arthritis? [^115VK1mH]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

We reanalyzed previous data from 287 patients with RA and 330 osteoarthritis controls, and we retested all of the sera for anti–CEP‐1 using a commercially available anti–CEP‐1 enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (Euroimmun), optimized for clinical use. The diagnostic sensitivity with anti–CEP‐1 was increased from 39% 2 to 48%, with a specificity of 98%. We then examined whether the addition of anti–CEP‐1 and anti‐cTNC5 to CCP2 increased the overall diagnostic sensitivity. We identified 8 patients with RA who were negative for anti‐CCP2 but positive for either or both of the fine specificities (Figure 1 A), increasing the overall diagnostic sensitivity with ACPA from 84.5% obtained with anti‐CCP2 alone to 87% if all 3 assays were combined. We predict that this modest increase in sensitivity could be an underestimate caused by ascertainment bias because anti‐CCP2 positivity may have influenced the recruitment of patients to this cohort. In previous studies, using cohorts in which many of the patients were recruited before the CCP tests became available, anti–CEP‐1 and/or anti‐cTNC5 positivity was higher in the anti‐CCP2–negative RA patients, increasing overall diagnostic sensitivity by ~5% 2, 3, 4. Therefore, the inclusion of these 2 additional fine specificities at the point of diagnosis could increase the sensitivity even further, though clearly this needs to be confirmed in prospective studies.

### Laboratory biomarkers or imaging in the diagnostics of rheumatoid arthritis? [^116Q3BA4]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by persistent inflammation and joint damage with a heterogeneous course and different pathogenic mechanisms leading to common signs and symptoms. In routine clinical practices, early diagnosis and recognition of inflammatory arthritis of short duration that develops to established RA in the future is sometimes difficult. In contrast to a few patients with inflammatory arthritis who may undergo spontaneous remission and some who may have a mild disease course with slow progression, more patients have moderate to high disease activity and some develop aggressive joint damage and systemic complications. Therefore, laboratory biomarkers and/or imaging assessments that would be more effective in the diagnosis of early disease are needed. Although RA is a clinical diagnosis and has no specific pathognomonic test defined so far, serological tests represent the most important parameters for diagnosis and for identification of at risk patients. Anti-citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPAs), especially in high levels, are associated with aggressive disease and together with acute phase reactants were implemented in the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria of RA. Fulfillment of these criteria thus persuades clinicians to initiate appropriate therapy early to avoid irreversible damage. Despite the high diagnostic value of ACPAs and rheumatoid factors (RFs), there is still a need for novel biomarkers to further improve the diagnosis of RA. Several novel autoantigens and antibodies that may improve early diagnosis and predict further development of the disease have been recently identified. Besides clinical signs and serological tests, imaging techniques, particularly ultrasound, may improve early diagnosis of RA, particularly in seronegative patients.

In this commentary, we will attempt to summarize the role of ultrasound and several serological biomarkers, which are currently studied in order to serve as surrogate measures for RA diagnosis.

### Therapeutic implications of autoantibodies in rheumatoid arthritis [^112Fbb67]. RMD Open (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex chronic disease. Historically, RA has been labelled as seropositive or seronegative, according to the presence or absence of detectable rheumatoid factor (RF). RF is an antibody directed against the Fc portion of human IgG. It is well characterised, although its exact origin still remains unclear. Typically, RF is of IgM isotype, but IgG and IgA may also occur. In the past, RF levels were determined by classical agglutination reactions; however, sensitivities and specificities depended on the type of test (eg, latex fixation test, or Waaler-Rose test using sheep erythrocytes). Recently, RF levels are determined by nephelometry.

Other antibodies with specificities for RA include antiperinuclear factor and antikeratin antibodies which were known for a long time, but have never reached widespread use because of difficulties in their detection. Recently, a large portion of patients with RA were shown to produce antibodies recognising certain peptides containing citrullinated arginine residues. The autoantibodies that were detectable in this way were, therefore, summarised as anti citrullinated peptide/protein antibodies (ACPA) and this is their current name. When cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP) were used instead of linear citrulline as antigens in test systems, diagnostic test properties further improved and these test were then commercialised as anti-CCP tests. Suddenly, patients could also be classified as seropositive or seronegative for RFs, as well as for ACPA. Today, second and third generation of anti-CCP assays are available and have expanded the number of antigens to further improve sensitivity. Recent evidence suggests that these two groups of autoantibodies might not be the only ones present in RA. Anticarbamylated protein antibodies are present particularly in patients with RA in a significant amount and are prognostically seem to be similar to ACPAs. Although these do coincide with both ACPA and RF to a large extent, there is a fraction of about 10% of ACPA-negative RA patients who test positive, thus closing the seronegative gap of RA a bit more. Whether this has implications for diagnosis or subsequent treatment decisions remains to be seen.

### Autoantibody profiling as early diagnostic and prognostic tool for rheumatoid arthritis [^1163tkxi]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Early treatment prevents progression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but diagnosis in early disease is impeded by lack of appropriate diagnostic criteria.

Objective

To study the value of rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide autoantibodies (anti-CCP), and anti-RA33 autoantibodies for diagnosis of RA and prediction of outcome in patients with very early arthritis.

Methods

The prospective follow up inception cohort included 200 patients with very early (< 3 months) inflammatory joint disease. Autoantibodies were measured at baseline and analysed in a tree based model which aimed at determining the added diagnostic value of testing for anti-CCP and anti-RA33 as compared with RF alone.

Results

RA was diagnosed in 102 patients, while 98 developed other inflammatory arthropathies. Receiver operator curve analysis showed an optimum cut off level for RF at 50 U/ml, above which anti-CCP and anti-RA33 had no additional diagnostic value. Remarkably, RF ≥ 50 U/ml and anti-CCP showed similar sensitivity and high specificity for RA, but overlapped considerably. Anti-RA33 was less specific and did not correlate with RF or anti-CCP. Among patients with RA, 72% showed at least one of these three autoantibodies, compared with 15% of non-RA patients. RF ≥ 50 U/ml and anti-CCP were predictors of erosive disease, whereas anti-RA33 was associated with mild disease.

Conclusions

Stepwise autoantibody testing in early inflammatory joint disease, starting with RF, followed by anti-CCP (in patients with RF < 50 U/ml), and finally anti-RA33, should be used as a sensitive and effective strategy for distinguishing patients with RA at high risk for poor outcome.

### Autoantibodies in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection: pitfalls for the diagnosis of rheumatic diseases [^111ih5EU]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) is one of the best mimes in medicine. About 40–70% of patients suffering from this disorder develop at least one extra-hepatic disorder that can have a rheumatic nature (arthralgias, arthritis, vasculitis and sicca syndrome) and must be differentiated from the primitive rheumatic diseases. In addition, HCV infection can also alter the laboratory tests. Several alterations of first line laboratory tests can be usually found in both chronic HCV infection and chronic inflammatory rheumatic disorders. In the present review we analyze the interference of HCV in tests more specifically used in rheumatology: rheumatoid factor and other autoantibodies (ANA, anti-ENA, ANCA, anti-DNA, antiphospholipid, anti-CCP). In patients suffering from HCV infection, the diagnosis of connective tissue diseases (CTD) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) should be made only when the detected symptoms or laboratory data are not inducible by HCV, otherwise only a diagnosis of "possible CTD" or "possible RA" should be considered.

### Multicentre study to improve clinical interpretation of rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein / peptide antibodies test results [^114cwVmy]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

In a subsequent study, we show the impact of using specificity-based thresholds on RA classification. In that study, we also show that RA classification can be improved by taking into account the nature of the antibody (RF vs ACPA), the antibody level and single or double positivity (manuscript in preparation).

In conclusion, defining thresholds for antibody levels and assigning test result-specific LRs helps to harmonise interpretation of RF and ACPA immunoassays in routine clinical practice. The LR is dependent on the antibody level, and the antibody type (higher LR for ACPA than for RF). Applying the same criteria on the same cohort of patients and controls is a powerful tool to align interpretation across assays from different companies. It is the shared societal responsibility of laboratory professionals, in vitro diagnostics and clinicians to harmonise interpretation of laboratory test results such that they can be reliably applied in routine diagnostic protocols.

### A core set of risk factors in individuals at risk of rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR points to consider for conducting clinical trials and observational studies in individuals at risk of rheumatoid arthritis [^115ck4rg]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

ACPA and other autoantibodies

Thirteen articles specifically addressed ACPA and other autoantibodies as risk factors for arthritis development; 10/13 had a low RoB and 2/13 had intermediate RoB. One article was a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Presence of RA-related autoantibodies, especially ACPAs, is the best characterised risk factor for arthritis development across the various at-risk populations, from those without symptoms through to those with early synovitis (table 2). Indeed, serum ACPAs were identified prior to the onset of arthritis in multiple seminal studies in this field. Considering asymptomatic populations (ie, without MSK symptoms), ACPA-positive individuals may be identified by screening in the general population or testing individuals with a heightened genetic risk of RA, that is, relatives of RA probands or Indigenous North American (INA) populations. There is good evidence that the latter groups are at higher risk of RA development, whereas there are relatively few published longitudinal data on arthritis development in ACPA-positive individuals screened from the general population. In a large Mexican cohort study, 819 healthy relatives (79% FDRs) of RA probands were followed prospectively for 5 years to investigate for RA development.RA developed in 17 (2.1%) of the relatives, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 64% when both anti-CCP and rheumatoid factor (RF) were present, and 58% when only anti-CCP was positive. In a recent longitudinal study of healthy relatives of INAs with RA, in which autoantibody levels were serially measured, 4.8% developed inflammatory arthritis (IA) during follow-up. All were seropositive at IA onset. Thirty per cent of anti-CCP/RF double positive individuals developed IA. Interestingly, there was a 71% likelihood of an ACPA-positive state reverting to seronegative after 5 years. Furthermore, glycosylation of the IgG ACPA variable domain is present in FDRs of INAs with RA and is strongly associated with the future development of RA (HR 6.1, 95% CI 1.5 to 25.2, p = 0.01). Prior to the availability of ACPA testing, a large longitudinal study of > 2000 INAs monitored bi-annually for 19 years revealed a highly significant association between RF level and RA development (p < 0.01, controlling for age and sex). In a recent study of anti-CCP3-positive individuals identified by population screening at health fairs in the United States, 35 of 250 individuals who tested anti-CCP3 positive were recruited and followed longitudinally for mean of 2.56 years. Forty per cent of these subjects developed IA.

### Autoantibodies in rheumatoid arthritis: historical background and novel findings [^111Wyiwx]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Various Autoantibodies in Patients with RA

Sensitivity and specificity of various autoantibodies identified in RA are displayed in Table 1.

Table 1
Sensitivity and specificity of various autoantibodies in rheumatoid arthritis

RF rheumatoid factor, ACPA anti-citrullinated protein antibodies, CCP cyclic citrullinated peptide, Anti-CarP anti-carbamylated protein antibodies, DUSP11 dual specificity phosphatase 11, PAD peptidyl arginine deiminase, PTX3 pentraxin 3

* Specificity should be regarded with caution, since these antibodies have been identified in other rheumatic conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-vasculitis

ACPA

The concept of ACPA was born when citrullinated epitopes were discovered to be "the common ground" of recognition by both the "perinuclear factor" and anti-keratin antibodies. It was noticed that these antibodies both reacted with fillagrin but not with pro-fillagrin, and it was hypothesized that a posttranslational modification could take place. Schellekens et al. also noticed already at that time that ACPA could be detected very early in the disease course. Since then, extensive research has been conducted on the role and diagnostic importance of ACPA. ACPA display high sensitivity (60–78%) and specificity (86–99%) for RA. Today, various ACPA tests are available (reviewed in detail in). Currently, the most widely used test for the measurement of ACPA is the cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) 2 test, first introduced in 2000. In the CCP3 test, additional citrullinated epitopes are introduced to the same protein structure. Both tests are similar in their performance and the additional advantage of the CCP3 test (which is also more expensive than the standard CCP2) is not completely apparent. However, CCP3.1 showed a slightly higher specificity compared to CCP2 and anti-modified citrullinated vimentin (MCV) tests, and CCP3-positivity was shown to add predictive value to the CCP2 test for the development of RA in individuals-at-risk. The anti-MCV antibody test is also universally used and has comparable sensitivity and specificity profiles to CCP tests.

### Autoimmune markers in screening for orbital inflammatory disease [^111i34Gd]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Positive cANCA may be observed in 90% of active generalised GPA. However, ANCA testing is less sensitive in localised and isolated sino-orbital GPA, and titres can become negative after treatment, as was evident in our study. Patients with new-onset disease may present with negative ANCA, but may seroconvert at follow-up. It has been estimated that only 32–35% of patients with known sino-orbital disease have cANCA-positivity at presentation, with an additional 10% converting 6–24 months after initial presentation. Although biopsy can help confirm the diagnosis, histopathology may reveal granulomatous inflammation without vasculitis, a non-specific finding which may also be indicative of sarcoidosis, NSOI or aspergillosis.

ENAs encompass a range of specific autoantibodies used to help diagnose autoimmune connective tissue diseases. For example, anti-Ro antibodies are found in 50–75% and 15% of patients with primary and secondary SS, respectively. However, positive anti-Ro antibodies may be observed in a range of other autoimmune disorders and in health individuals. Within our study, a patient with positive anti-Ku antibody developed symptoms suggestive of overlap syndrome.

Anti-CCP is typically a specific marker for rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, high anti-CCP levels are also observed in the minority of patients with primary SS. Only 1 patient with SS had a positive anti-CCP, and follow-up revealed early rheumatoid arthritis. Anti-CCP in patients with arthritis may help predict progression to rheumatoid arthritis. Anti-dsDNA antibody is specific for SLE, which remains a cause of orbital inflammation. However, unless there are clinical features supporting a high pre-test probability of SLE, anti-dsDNA antibody is not a recommended investigation in situations of ANA negativity.

The main limitation of this study is the small sample sizes represented for each specific inflammatory condition. Secondly, patients diagnosed with GPA were on maintenance therapy which are known to reduce or cause negative ANCA titres. Finally, although the heterogeneity of autoimmune markers tested at presentation and subsequent follow-up reflect the clinical pre-test probability of a specific diagnosis, various orbital conditions, such as limited GPA-related orbital disease, are known to present with seronegative disease. There is limited literature regarding the characteristics of seroconversion of autoimmune markers in patients with orbital disease. Thus, future studies may involve longitudinal analysis of patients screened with autoimmune markers to investigate the utility of serial testing in initially seronegative disease.

### Is anti-citrullinated protein antibody-positive rheumatoid arthritis still a more severe disease than anti-citrullinated protein antibody-negative rheumatoid arthritis? A longitudinal cohort study in rheumatoid arthritis patients diagnosed from 2000 onward [^115esCqj]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

In current research, there is a tendency to concentrate more on ACPA‐positive than on ACPA‐negative RA. For example, many more whole genome genetic studies were performed on ACPA‐positive RA 29. This focus in etiopathologic studies is possibly explained by the paradigm that ACPA‐negative RA might represent a more heterogeneous subset of patients, and that current research has revealed fewer clues on the possible causes or mediators of ACPA‐negative RA. This could have resulted in ACPA having conquered a more prominent position in the identification of RA within the 2010 criteria. This study, however, does not intend to address the issue on the classification criteria. The data presented clearly demonstrate that, at present, ACPA‐negative RA is equally severe as ACPA‐positive RA when patient‐reported impairments and limitations are studied as outcomes. This has implications for future research, both for etiopathophysiologic and clinical studies. The present data highlight the importance of keeping the scope set on ACPA‐negative RA as well, because it has become an equally severe disease. Moreover, the prevalence of ACPA‐negative RA, as measured in early arthritis cohorts, concerns up to half of the total RA‐population 26, 30.

The risk of misdiagnosis is often estimated higher for ACPA‐negative RA than for ACPA‐positive RA. In this study, patients were diagnosed with RA according to the treating rheumatologist, and this clinical diagnosis was verified after 1 year of disease in the medical files of all patients. Hence, patients who developed other diseases were no longer in the data set. Thereafter, patients were checked as to whether they fulfilled the 2010 criteria (or 1987 criteria for subanalyses). When all these conditions were met, patients were included. Because of this stringent selection, we think that the risk of misdiagnosis of ACPA‐negative RA is low.

Secondary comorbidities like fibromyalgia (FM) could also influence the PROs, like pain and fatigue 31. Data on secondary FM were not collected in our cohort. However, we have no reason to believe that secondary FM would have influenced our comparisons between autoantibody‐positive and autoantibody‐negative patients, as previous studies have demonstrated that RA patients with and without concomitant FM have an equal prevalence of RF positivity 31, 32, 33, 34.

### Anti-CCP antibodies measured at disease onset help identify seronegative rheumatoid arthritis and predict radiological and functional outcome [^112ZtHNt]. Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies have been identified as highly specific for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Studies suggest an association with radiographic outcome. The aims of this study were to assess the diagnostic and prognostic utility of the second-generation anti-CCP(2) test in a large cohort of early RA patients compared with connective tissue disease (CTD) controls.

Methods

One hundred and eighty-two patients with RA and 121 patients with CTD were recruited. All RA patients had less than 24 months of symptoms and had CRP, rheumatoid factor (RF), HLA typing (SE) and anti-CCP(2) antibodies measured at baseline. Function was assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and X-rays performed at 0, 12 and 24 months.

Results

The anti-CCP(2) antibody test demonstrated a specificity of 91% and sensitivity of 81% for RA when compared with controls. In RF-negative patients, specificity was 92% and sensitivity 60%. Baseline demographics of the RA cohort showed mean age 57 yr, mean symptom duration 7 months, 63% RF-positive patients, 72% SE-positive, 81% CCP-positive and 21% erosive. The only predictor of change in Larsen score from 0 to 24 months in the cohort was the presence of the shared epitope (P < 0.05) and in the RF-negative subgroup it was CCP(2) antibody titre > 100 (P < 0.05). Baseline HAQ was the only significant predictor of HAQ at 24 months, but in the RF-negative subgroup CCP(2) antibody titre > 100 predicted a poor functional response at 24 months (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

This study confirms the diagnostic utility of anti-CCP(2) antibodies in early RA, particularly in seronegative patients, in whom anti-CCP(2) positivity also conferred prognostic utility for radiographic and functional outcomes.

### Rheumatoid arthritis: are ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative RA the same disease? [^113Yx3sp]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Seemingly contrasting genetic backgrounds in anti-citrullinated-protein antibody (ACPA)-positive and ACPA-negative rheumatoid arthritis (RA) support the notion that these are in fact two distinct disease subsets, with different underlying pathogenesis, that might need tailored treatment strategies.

### Diagnosis, prognosis and classification of early arthritis: results of a systematic review informing the 2016 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis [^111DeqiF]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

The type of ACPAs most frequently studied was anti-CCP antibodies. Seven studies have also evaluated anticitrullinated vimentin antibodies, and did not report additional benefits in diagnosing RA compared with anti-CCP antibodies. One study has evaluated anticarbamylated (anti-CarP) antibodies and found a sensitivity of 53% and a specificity of 80% for a diagnosis of RA, but combining anti-CarP antibodies with RF and ACPAs was not better than ACPAs and RF alone.

As in the previous SLR, we did not find appropriately designed studies that evaluated C reactive protein (CRP) levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESRs), antinuclear antibodies or any other serological test performed in patients with EA and aiming at defining specific diagnoses other than RA. In particular, no such studies in which the outcome was a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis other than RA was retrieved. Therefore, we were unable to evaluate the usefulness of laboratory tests for the diagnosis of diseases other than RA.

Imaging tests

The included studies evaluated mainly MRI (three studies) (see). Other imaging modalities were US (one study) and bone densitometry (BMD) performed on hand X-rays (one study). Included MRI studies evaluated the likelihood that various MRI features (bone oedema, synovitis and tenosynovitis) found in patients with EA evolved into a diagnosis of RA. Based on these studies, presence of MRI bone oedema on wrist and metatarsophalangeal joints and presence of MRI hand tenosynovitis are reportedly specific (specificities more than 80%) but not sensitive (sensitivities < 35%) markers for a diagnosis of RA. Therefore, the clinical relevance of MRI to establish a diagnosis of RA in patients with EA appears to be limited. According to the included US study, detection of hand flexor or extensor tenosynovitis by US appeared to be associated with RA diagnosis in patients with EA (OR 6.3 (2.2 to 18)) but, as for now, these data were only published in a congress abstract and sensitivity and specificity were not reported. So, our current SLR does not allow us to conclude on the clinical use of US as a diagnostic marker for RA in patients with EA.

### Rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate for the clinical diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis [^113RW2Ru]. Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore the value of rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody, C-reactive protein (CRP), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods

Using rate nephelometry, chemiluminescence microparticle immunoassay (CMIA), and Westergren sedimentation rate testing, we detected RF, anti-CCP antibody, CRP, and ESR in 134 patients with RA and 50 healthy control individuals.

Results

We observed significant differences in RF, anti-CCP antibody, CRP, and ESR concentrations between the RA and control groups (P < .01). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in the diagnosis of RA were 91.0%, 74.4%, and 87.0%, respectively, for RF; 88.0%, 90.4%, and 88.1%, respectively, for anti-CCP antibody; and 90.2%, 83.3%, and 89.5%, respectively, for the detection of RA via the combination of RF and anti-CCP antibody.

Conclusion

Anti-CCP is more specific than the other parameters we reviewed for the diagnosis of RA. Combined detection of the 4 parameters is beneficial when confirming a diagnosis of RA.

### Diagnostic value of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^116TK1My]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore the diagnostic value of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP) detected by ELISA in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods

The synthesized cyclic citrullinated peptide was used as substrate for ELISA. Anti-CCP antibody was detected by ELISA in 191 patients with RA, 132 with rheumatic diseases other than RA, and 98 with nonrheumatic diseases. The antiperinuclear factor (APF), anti-keratin antibody (AKA), rheumatoid factor (RF), and HLA-DR4 gene complex were also tested in each RA patient. The results of these tests were compared with anti-CCP antibody to examine the correlation between them.

Results

Ninety (47.1%) patients with RA, 4 (3.0%) with other rheumatic diseases, and 2 (2.0%) with nonrheumatic diseases were found to be anti-CCP antibody positive by ELISA. The sensitivity of anti-CCP antibody was 47.1%, with a high specificity (97.4%) in RA. Anti-CCP antibody correlated with APF, AKA, RF, and HLA-DR4 gene complex.

Conclusion

A new modified anti-CCP antibody test had a moderate sensitivity (47.1%) but a high specificity (97.4%) in patients with RA and was found as a valuable supplement to diagnosis of RA. Anti-CCP correlated with APF, AKA, RF, and HLA-DR4 gene complex, but did not completely overlap with them. Anti-CCP antibody could be regarded as a new diagnostic marker for RA.

### Diagnostic utility of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies for very early rheumatoid arthritis [^111eTDxM]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the diagnostic utility of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies with other serological markers including rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-agalactosyl immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 in very early rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods

Serum concentrations of anti-CCP antibodies, RF, anti-agalactosyl IgG antibody, and MMP-3 were measured in 262 patients with RA ("total RA") including 55 patients with disease duration of less than 6 months who had not been treated before entry ("very early RA") and 116 patients with rheumatic diseases other than RA.

Results

The diagnostic sensitivity of anti-CCP antibodies was 82.4% in total RA and 67.3% in very early RA and was lower than that of RF (84.0% total RA, 83.6% very early RA) and anti-agalactosyl IgG antibody (90.5%, 90.9%), whereas specificity, positive predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy were the best among markers tested both in total RA and in very early RA. The presence of either anti-CCP antibodies or RF increased the sensitivity, but any combination of serological markers was not significantly better in diagnostic accuracy than anti-CCP antibodies alone. The rates of RF-positive subjects in anti-CCP antibody-negative patients both in total RA (43.5%) and in very early RA (61.1%) were higher than those of anti-CCP antibody-positive subjects in RF-negative patients (38.1% and 22.2%, for total RA and early RA, respectively).

Conclusion

Measurement of anti-CCP antibodies, by itself, is useful for the diagnosis of RA; however, combined use of anti-CCP antibodies with RF may be more useful than either method alone for the diagnosis of very early RA.

### Lack of seroconversion of rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide in patients with early inflammatory arthritis: a systematic literature review [^11248yKx]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Serological markers are thought to be useful in predicting which patients with early inflammatory arthritis (EIA) will progress to RA. The objective of this study is to determine the per cent RF and anti-CCP seroconversion in EIA patients at 1–5 years of follow-up: 80% of established RA is RF or CCP positive.

Methods

We conducted a systematic literature review of all English publications and recent abstracts from ACR and EULAR. Patients ≥ 16 years of age with at least one swollen joint and symptoms < 2 years were included.

Results

Twelve publications met the criteria: 10 studies included data on RF, while only 5 addressed anti-CCP. Sample sizes ranged from 15 to 395 and follow-up was 6–60 months. There was marked heterogeneity between studies; therefore, results could not be pooled for a meta-analysis. Baseline RF and anti-CCP positivity was also highly variable: 8–55 and 4–45%, respectively. Seroconversion rates for EIA were 1.9–5.0% at up to 30 months follow-up for RF and 1.3–8.9% at up to 60 months follow-up for anti-CCP.

Conclusion

There is minimal change in RF or anti-CCP positivity up to 5 years of follow-up. Prevalence data for RF in established RA is significantly higher than the baseline values reported here. The low rates of seroconversion would suggest a lower prevalence in EIA and the reason for this difference remains unknown. It is unclear whether antibody-negative patients are more likely to remit and be lost to follow-up in established RA populations.

### Distinguishing rheumatoid arthritis from psoriatic arthritis [^111awadD]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Serological features of RA and PsA

RA is a seropositive arthropathy, with approximately 80% of patients having a positive test result for RF or CCP antibodies.CCP antibodies are a more specific marker for RA than RF, but both biomarkers are considered to be distinct and complementary predictors of disability and joint erosion.

In contrast, PsA is a seronegative inflammatory arthropathy. RF and CCP are absent in most patients with PsA, and if patients do have positive test findings for RF or CCP, the titres are usually low. In a study comparing patients with RA or PsA and controls, the mean RF and anti-CCP titre values were substantially higher in patients with RA compared with PsA (RF titre: 56 vs 11 U/mL; anti-CCP titre: 14 vs 2 U/mL). Titres in patients with PsA were similar to values in controls. Although the presence of serum RF or CCP antibodies is generally not used to exclude diagnosis of non-rheumatic diseases (eg, fungal infections), data suggest that at anti-CCP titre values ≥ 11.6 U/mL, it is highly probable that patients have RA rather than PsA. In both patients with RA and PsA, the presence of anti-CCP antibodies is associated with bone destruction, suggesting that the osteocatabolic effect of anti-CCP antibodies is not found only in RA as previously thought.

C reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are markers of acute-phase inflammatory responses in patients with RA and PsA, but more so in patients with RA. In a systematic literature review of RA disease activity parameters, ESR and CRP levels were a significant predictor of radiographic progression in most studies. The acute-phase response is correlated with synovial inflammation, radiographic disease progression and erosive joint damage. On average, patients with PsA have significantly lower CRP and ESR levels than patients with RA. However, elevated ESR and CRP levels are significantly correlated with the number of swollen joints and with ultrasound abnormalities in PsA.ESR, in particular, is considered to be one of the best predictors of damage progression in PsA. It has been suggested that a low ESR is protective, while rates > 15 mm/hour are associated with increased risk for mortality. Changes in ESR and CRP correspond with clinical outcomes and can be used to track response to treatment.

Increased ESR and CRP levels are markers of inflammation, but not necessarily just in RA. Other rheumatological diseases associated with elevated ESR and CRP levels include polymyalgia rheumatica, Sjögren's syndrome and ankylosing spondylitis.

### Lung disease with anti-CCP antibodies but not rheumatoid arthritis or connective tissue disease [^114grUMp]. Respiratory Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to characterize a novel cohort of patients with lung disease, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody positivity, without rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or other connective tissue disease (CTD).

Methods

The study sample included 74 subjects with respiratory symptoms, evaluated January 2008-January 2010 and found to have a positive anti-CCP antibody but no evidence for RA or other CTD. Each underwent serologic testing, pulmonary physiology testing, and thoracic high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan as part of routine clinical evaluation.

Results

The majority of subjects were women, and most were former cigarette smokers. Four distinct radiographic phenotypes were identified: isolated airways disease (54%), isolated interstitial lung disease (ILD) (14%), mixed airways disease and ILD (26%), and combined pulmonary fibrosis with emphysema (7%). This cohort had a predominance of airways disease, either in isolation or along with a usual interstitial pneumonia-pattern of ILD. Among subjects with high-titer anti-CCP positivity (n = 33), three developed the articular manifestations of RA during a median follow-up of 449 days.

Conclusion

We have described a unique cohort of patients with anti-CCP antibody positivity and lung disease in the absence of existing RA or other CTD. The lung phenotypic characteristics of this cohort resemble those of established RA and a few of these patients have developed articular RA within a short period of follow-up. The implications of a positive anti-CCP antibody among patients with lung disease but not RA are not yet known, but we believe requires further investigation.

### Autoantibodies in rheumatoid arthritis: historical background and novel findings [^111CZcXN]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Relevance of Autoantibodies in RA

The prevalence of ACPA in the general population is estimated to be around 1% and is increased with older age, in smokers and individuals with joint complaints.

Multiple autoantibodies, including ACPA, anti-PAD- and anti-CarP-antibodies, precede the onset of RA, with ACPA still rendering the highest risk and appearing before clinically apparent synovitis. However, over 30% of ACPA- and RF-positive individuals with arthralgia do not develop RA within 2 years of follow-up, with the level of ACPA seeming to be of importance. In a recent study, 46% of at-risk persons with high ACPA levels developed RA in a 5 year-period, compared to only 21.5% among all ACPA-positive individuals. Similarly, in another study, 32% of ACPA-positive first-degree relatives of RA patients with the values ≥ 2 cutoffs developed RA in a 5-year period, compared to 26% if the value was just above the cutoff.

The positive predictive value (PPV) of ACPA tests, which demonstrates the likelihood of an individual with a positive test to have or develop a condition, varies in different studied populations – from 9% in the general population to 55% when both environmental and genetic risk factors are present, 52% in clinically suspect arthralgia (CSA) and > 80% in undifferentiated arthritis patients. Multivariable analysis in one study showed ACPA-positivity to be an independent risk factor for RA development in individuals with CSA (hazard ratio (HR) = 5.1; 2.0–13.2) and to have a 50–67% PPV (RF-negative/RF-positive) for RA development within 2 years. Anti-CarP-antibodies also showed an increased HR for RA of 3.9 (1.9–7.7) in univariable analysis. PPVs vary between different studies due to the ambiguous criteria for CSA, the length of the observational follow-up period they have been calculated for, and other potential confounding factors. However, it can be concluded that ACPA and other autoantibodies mostly precede the arthritis phase and have quite a high predictive value in individuals with joint complaints.

### Diagnostic accuracy of immunoassays for the detection of antibodies to citrullinated proteins [^112JEN7H]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Anticitrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPA) are highly specific for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). They can be found early in the disease course and are associated with more severe joint destruction and disease activity. In the last 4 years, important progress has been made in the detection and identification of ACPA, improving antigenic composition and epitope recognition. Consequently, many ACPA-ELISA kits have been developed by several manufacturers and are now commercially available. However, albeit their widespread use in clinical laboratories, the use of some kits has not been accompanied by a clinical validation nor by a comparative evaluation of their diagnostic accuracy. In addition, full automation of ACPA assays featuring ease of use, rapid response, and high productivity is just beginning to appear on the market and also deserves clinical and analytical validation. This review will consider the most relevant characteristics of the ACPA-ELISA assays and will describe the results of a comparative study performed with all the currently available second- and third-generation commercial methods.

### Next-generation rheumatoid factor assay provides improved predictive power for the development of arthritis in patients at risk [^112SYgRJ]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the joints and bones and that is hallmarked by the presence of several distinct classes of autoantibodies. These are, in particular, antibodies against citrullinated proteins (anti-CCP) and antibodies against the constant region of immunoglobulin G (IgG), which are called rheumatoid factors (RF). These autoantibodies can already and often do emerge in the preclinical stage and have been found to be present in patients up to 10 years before established disease. Both anti-CCP and RF are part of the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism 2010 classification criteria for RAand are routinely tested on suspected disease. Whereas they share similar sensitivity, testing for anti-CCP is more specific than for RF. This is in part due to the presence of RF not limited to RA, but also because the RF response is highly heterogeneous.

Conventional RF testing is usually performed with agglutination assays or detection of immunoglobulin M (IgM)-RF bound to immobilised IgG molecules. Regardless, RF can occur as any given isotype, even though it is most commonly found and tested as IgM. Next, RFs are known to bind to multiple epitopes on the IgG-Fc and some of these epitopes are associated with specific disorders, a feature that is currently not used in the clinic. With this in mind, detection of RA-specific RFs may improve the specificity of these autoantibodies for predictive purposes.

We have shown previously in an explorative study that an epitope within the CH3 domain of IgG, captured by our IgG-Fc target 'T3–17', was strongly associated with RA. Preliminary results showed that detection of RF specific for this epitope in patients at risk for arthritis was linked with the presence of aCCP and showed a trend towards arthritis development. Here we validate these findings in a larger cohort of patients with seropositive arthralgia and show that detection of RA-specific RFs is feasible and improves the predictive value of RF testing.

### Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide versus anti-Sa antibodies in diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis in an outpatient clinic for connective tissue disease and spondyloarthritis [^116tet4p]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective. To compare the diagnostic value of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) and anti-Sa antibodies in serum for prediction of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in an outpatient clinic for connective tissue diseases and spondyloarthritides.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was carried out to analyze the presence or absence of anti-CCP and anti-Sa antibodies in the sera of 250 randomly selected patients. The disease distribution in the study was as follows: 87 patients had RA (34.8%); 90 (36%) had other connective tissue diseases (CTD); 50 (20%) spondyloarthritis; 19 (7.6%) polymyalgia rheumatica; and 4 (1.6%) juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

Results

Anti-CCP antibodies were detected in 63 patients with RA and in 9 patients with other illnesses [sensitivity 72.4%, specificity 94.4%, positive predictive value (PPV) 87.5%]. Anti-Sa antibodies were detected in 38 patients with RA and in 6 patients with other illnesses (sensitivity 43.6%, specificity 96.3%, PPV 86.3%). Anti-CCP and anti-Sa results were discordant in up to 47 of 87 RA patients. No relation between the presence of anti-Sa and higher or lower titers of anti-CCP antibodies was observed.

Conclusion

The diagnostic value in RA is similar for both antibodies. However, the sensitivity of anti-CCP detection is higher than that of anti-Sa. Our results suggest that presence of anti-Sa antibodies in serum may be useful as a complementary assay when anti-CCP antibodies are negative and RA is suspected.

### An update on polymyalgia rheumatica [^113NBoSM]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Conditions affecting people in the age group 50 years and older and associated with bilateral shoulder pain should be included in the differential diagnoses of PMR. This is especially true as there are no specific diagnostic tests for PMR and a misdiagnosis of any condition as PMR may lead to unnecessary exposure to GCs for extensive periods of time. The differential diagnosis should include both rheumatic and nonrheumatic diseases.

Rheumatoid arthritis

Among the most important rheumatic conditions in the differential diagnoses of PMR is seronegative RA. This is especially true early in the disease onset of RA, which might have a prodromal phase of bilateral shoulder joint arthritis. In addition, both RA and PMR can present with arthritis in wrist joints, and if patients test negative for rheumatoid factor and/or anti‐cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti‐CCP), the differentiation between these two conditions may not be easy. However, the presence of symmetric small joint arthritis should favour the RA diagnosis. Both RA and PMR can be successfully treated with prednisolone, limiting the utility of this medication in the differentiation. Typical extra‐articular manifestations (e.g. rheumatoid nodules, cutaneous vasculitis, serositis, etc.) and positive RF/anti‐CCP favour the diagnosis of RA rather than PMR.

Myositis

Polymyositis (PM) is another disease that may be misdiagnosed as PMR and vice versa. Both conditions affect the proximal muscle groups in the upper and lower extremities. However, the presence of muscle weakness rather than stiffness and pain is an important differential feature of PM. In addition, PM is usually associated with elevated serum levels of muscle enzymes, which is not a feature of PMR. Other features that favour the possibility of PM is the presence of myositis specific autoantibodies and extramuscular manifestations including in the lungs, skin, gastrointestinal tract or the heart. Difficulty in swallowing will favour the diagnosis of PM. Unlike PM, pure muscle weakness is not typical of PMR, where the predominant symptoms are muscle aches and pain and morning stiffness.

Pain syndromes

The differentiation between PMR and pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia should be easier compared to other differential diagnosis. Fibromyalgia usually has its onset in younger age groups than PMR. In addition, there is no elevation of laboratory parameters indicating an inflammatory condition in the former group. It is important to differentiate between these two conditions to avoid unnecessary use of GCs in patients with fibromyalgia and pain syndromes.

### Multifaceted immune dysregulation characterizes individuals at-risk for rheumatoid arthritis [^117UcWHN]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Studies of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) show that markers of autoimmunity, including antibodies to citrullinated protein/peptide antigens (ACPA), rheumatoid factor (RF) and others can be present in blood many years prior to the clinically-apparent onset of inflammatory arthritis (IA) and classified RA [(reviewed in ref.)]. The period of autoantibody elevations before the onset of IA has been called 'pre-RA' and is reasonably viewed as a distinct stage toward development of clinically-apparent IA and classifiable RA. Notably, ACPA(+) individuals, especially those with higher titers of the common clinically used ACPA assay 'anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP), have a significantly elevated risk of developing future classified RA, and thus these individuals can be designated to be in an "At-Risk" state, and defined as such for studies.

Importantly, the identification of a pre-RA period has underpinned the development and execution of several prevention trials in RA testing the ability of a variety of agents to prevent or delay the progression to IA and classified RA –. However, despite the increasing interest in disease prevention, major knowledge gaps exist regarding the causal pathways and pathogenic processes that promote the initial break in tolerance to citrullinated self-antigens in At-Risk populations. Some data suggest that epigenetic changes are present in such individuals, but it is not known whether unique peripheral blood cell sub-populations exhibit distinct epigenetic changes in disease-related pathways. It has also been demonstrated that T cells in subjects with established RA recognize multiple citrullinated autoantigens, and it has also been demonstrated that there may be abnormalities of T cell subsets in pre-RA; however, it is not known how the antigen specificity and phenotypic profile of self-reactive T cells or B cells in pre-RA may differ from ACPA(−) individuals or individuals with classified RA. That is important given that previous studies have demonstrated that ACPA can emerge years prior to IA and increase over time in levels and numbers and types of citrullinated antigens being recognized. strongly suggesting the associated presence of autoreactive T cells that provide help to drive these ACPA responses.

### Benefit of early treatment in inflammatory polyarthritis patients with anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies versus those without antibodies [^112mwnvs]. Arthritis Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

Because our cohort was recruited and followed in the prebiologics era, the comparison of treatment response is for traditional DMARDs, and we cannot comment on the influence of anti-CCP antibody status in response to biologics. It is unclear if treatment (either traditional DMARDs or anti–tumor necrosis factor [anti-TNF] therapy) alters anti-CCP antibody levels. Some studies have shown that DMARDs and anti-TNF therapies reduce anti-CCP antibody titers, whereas others have shown no change in anti-CCP antibody titers but a reduction in RF titers. Other studies have shown that anti-CCP antibody positivity or titer predicts poor response to anti-TNF treatment. Our study confirms this association in functional disability, while adjusting for the disease severity marked by anti-CCP antibodies. In a randomized trial comparing 4 targeted treatment strategies, anti-CCP antibody and RF status only predicted progressive disease in the sequential monotherapy group and not the combination therapy groups, suggesting that anti-CCP antibodies are not a universal predictor of poor treatment response. Taken together with these previous studies, our work shows that anti-CCP antibody–negative patients do benefit from treatment such as steroids and monotherapy, whereas anti-CCP antibody–positive patients require more aggressive therapies. Furthermore, clinical trials in RA and IP should stratify for anti-CCP antibody status.

### Study of rheumatoid arthritis in older patients: a cross-sectional study [^116Non2f]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The clinical course of RA is highly variable, ranging from self-limiting non-erosive state to fulminant destructive disease. The onset of RA can be acute, sub-acute or insidious, with symptoms varying widely between individuals and at different stages of the disease. Morning stiffness is a common symptom in RA patients. In typical RA, symptoms primarily affect the small joints in the hands and feet. In contrast, EORA often presents with symptoms in larger, proximal joints, with a pattern similar to polymyalgia rheumatica.

Systemic complications of RA extend beyond joint issues, contributing to early mortality. RA often presents with a range of systemic symptoms, including fatigue, malaise, weight loss, anemia, and elevated levels of ESR and CRP. These symptoms are often more pronounced in EORA demonstrated by higher SJC, TJC, ESR, CRP and DAS28, indicating possible differences in the disease's causes, cytokine profiles, or treatment approaches. Patients with active RA can have high risk of cardiovascular disease, and are more susceptible to infections likely due to immune system dysfunction.

Chronic medical disorders often complicate RA in older patients with conditions such as hypertension, thyroid disease, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, interstitial lung disease, metabolic syndrome, gallstones, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and depression. The presence of these conditions complicates management, necessitating a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to address the wide-ranging healthcare needs. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is a vital tool that helps to address these challenges by evaluating factors that influence the disease's progression and effectiveness of treatment.

RA is diagnosed clinically and classified according to the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria, which replaced the 1987 ACR criteria. The most commonly used serological test is rheumatoid factor (RF), which lacks specificity despite having good sensitivity. Recent researches have highlighted the diagnostic significance of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), particularly anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides (ACCP). These antibodies are highly specific for RA and are often present early in the disease, even before clinical symptoms appear. Elevated levels of anti-CCP antibodies have been shown to predict the development of erosive disease, emphasizing the importance of these markers in the early diagnosis of RA.

### Does the presence of anti-CCP autoantibodies and their serum levels influence the severity and activity in rheumatoid arthritis patients? [^115NiEaz]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

This study aims to investigate the association of the presence and of the titer of autoantibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptides (aCCP), with clinical manifestations and disease activity in a cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). From January 2000 through December 2005, 135 patients were diagnosed with RA at the Rheumatology Unit of our hospital. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic parameters were evaluated in all patients at study entry and at every follow-up visit. Positivity in aCCP and also their levels were determined for all patients. At the end of the study, we reevaluated the above parameters, dividing patients into aCCP positive and aCCP negative. From 135 patients, 53.3% were aCCP positive. The majority of aCCP-positive patients were males (p < 0.001), positive to rheumatoid factor (p < 0.001) and current smokers (p < 0.05). At diagnosis, aCCP-positive patients presented with higher tender joint counts (p < 0.001) and swollen joint counts (p < 0.001), and exhibited more active disease, expressed by higher disease activity scores for 28 joints (DAS-28) (p < 0.001). At the end of the study, aCCP-positive patients also displayed more active disease, with higher DAS-28 (p < 0.001), and more severe disease, as this was indicated by the higher radiological Larsen score (p < 0.001). The serum levels of aCCP were not found to be associated with disease activity and severity. In early RA, the presence of aCCP is associated with increased disease activity and severity. This was found to be independent of circulating levels of aCCP.

### Diagnosis, prognosis and classification of early arthritis: results of a systematic review informing the 2016 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis [^112Aoywk]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Previous SLR

Laboratory tests

The previous 2007 EULAR recommendations for EA management had identified a high ESR, a high CRP level and the presence of RF and/or anti-CCP antibodies as independent predictors for long-term radiographic progression.

Imaging tests

The previous SLR preceding the 2013 EULAR recommendations for the use of joint imaging tests in the clinical management of RA had identified the presence of synovitis on US or MRI, joint damage on conventional radiography and bone marrow oedema (osteitis) on MRI as predictors of subsequent radiographic progression in early RA. An independent predictor of progression of erosions was reportedly 'early bone loss' in the hand, measured as a decrease in estimated BMD in the first year of disease by digital X-ray radiogrammetry. Inflammatory changes on bone scintigraphy seemed to be associated with radiographic progression.

Current SLR

The aim of the search was to retrieve studies evaluating the prognostic value of laboratory tests and/or imaging tests in terms of radiological and functional outcome and clinical remission. Details of the selected studies are reported as online supplementary material S4.

We found 35 studies for laboratory tests and 12 studies for imaging tests.

Included studies evaluated mainly RF (19 studies) and ACPAs, in particular anti-CCP antibodies (25 studies) (see online supplementary materials S6). Apart from three studieson clinical remission, all included studies used radiographic progression as the primary outcome, although with various definitions.

The value of RF as a prognostic marker in patients with EA was reportedly heterogeneous and extremely dependent on the prevalence of radiographic progression in the cohorts. Depending on the studies, positive predictive values (PPVs) of RF for radiographic progression ranged from 20% to 92%, without a clear trend towards one or the other of these extreme values. Negative predictive values (NPVs) were better, with half of the studies reporting a NPV of RF for radiographic progression between 60% and 80%, and the other half reporting even higher NPVs (80–100%). PPVs of ACPAs for radiographic progression in patients with EA were also heterogeneous, with approximately half of the studies reporting low PPVs with values between 20% and 40%, and the other half reporting high PPVs with values over 80%. On the other hand, NPVs of ACPAs for radiographic progression were high, around 80% in the majority of the included studies.

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with awareness and attention to comorbidities [^116FyHN4]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis clinical identification and testing — physical examination can sometimes help establish inflammatory arthritis and enthesitis if signs of inflammation are present, laboratory tests indicating systemic inflammation are elevated in some patients but are neither sensitive nor specific for PsA, testing for rheumatoid factor or cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies generally will be negative, images such as plain X-rays can provide some information but might also be normal, and signs or symptoms in or around the joints are sufficient to prompt evaluation and/or consultation.

### Antibodies to citrullinated human fibrinogen (ACF) have diagnostic and prognostic value in early arthritis [^114nxfp9]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) test has a high sensitivity and specificity for rheumatoid arthritis, although CCP is not the physiological target of the autoantibodies. Citrullinated fibrin is abundant in inflamed synovium

Objective

To assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of antibodies against citrullinated fibrinogen (ACF), a soluble precursor of fibrin, in comparison with IgM-rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF) and the second generation anti-CCP test.

Methods

In 379 patients with early arthritis (258 rheumatoid and 121 undifferentiated), the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of ACF, anti-CCP, and IgM-RF for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis were calculated. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the diagnostic and prognostic value (radiographic progression after two years) of the tests.

Results

The sensitivities of the ACF, anti-CCP, and IgM-RF tests were 55.8%, 57.8%, and 44.6%, with specificities of 92.6%, 94.2%, and 96.7%, respectively. Approximately 30% of the IgM-RF negative patients were positive for ACF or anti-CCP or both. The ACF and anti-CCP test had a high agreement in early arthritis (kappa = 0.84). Of all baseline characteristics, the ACF test and the anti-CCP test were the best predictors for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis at one year (odds ratio (OR) = 10.3 and 10.6, respectively) and for radiographic progression after two years (OR = 12.1 and 14.8).

Conclusions

ACF is as sensitive as anti-CCP and more sensitive than IgM-RF in diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis in early arthritis. The ACF test is also a good predictor of radiographic progression, with a performance similar to the anti-CCP test. The ACF test and the anti-CCP test are especially valuable in IgM-RF negative arthritis.

### Have radiographic progression rates in early rheumatoid arthritis changed? A systematic review and meta-analysis of long-term cohorts [^11612FkE]. Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate, firstly, all published data on baseline and annual progression rates of radiographic damage from all longitudinal observational cohorts, and secondly, the association of standard clinical and laboratory parameters with long-term radiographic joint damage.

Methods

A comprehensive search of the literature from 1975 to 2014, using PubMed, SCOPUS and Cochrane databases, identified a total of 28 studies that investigated long-term radiographic progression, and 41 studies investigating predictors of long-term radiographic progression. This was submitted and approved by PROSPERO in February 2014 (Registration Number: CRD42014007589).

Results

Meta-analysis indicated an overall baseline rate of 2.02%, and a yearly increase of 1.08% of maximum damage. Stratified analysis found that baseline radiographic scores did not differ significantly between cohorts recruiting patients pre- and post-1990 (2.01% vs 2.03%; P > 0.01); however, the annual rate of progression was significantly reduced in the post-1990 cohorts (0.68% vs 1.50%; P < 0.05). High levels of acute phase markers, baseline radiographic damage, anti-CCP and RF positivity remain consistently predictive of long-term radiographic joint damage.

Conclusion

Critical changes in treatment practices over the last three decades are likely to explain the reduction in the long-term progression of structural joint damage. Acute phase markers and presence of RF/anti-CCP are strongly associated with increased radiographic progression.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^114gueHy]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Inflammatory arthritis (IA) — workup, evaluation, and monitoring include comprehensive assessment and staged testing. For G1, complete rheumatologic history and examination of all peripheral joints for tenderness, swelling, and range of motion with examination of the spine; consider plain X-ray or imaging to exclude metastases and evaluate joint damage; consider autoimmune blood panel including ANA, RF, anti-CCP, and inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP); and if symptoms are suggestive of reactive arthritis or affect the spine, consider HLA B27 testing. For G2, complete history and labs as above; consider ultrasound ± MRI of affected joints if clinically indicated, consider arthrocentesis if septic or crystal-induced arthritis is suspected, and consider early rheumatology referral if there is joint swelling or if symptoms persist > 4 weeks. For G3–4, as for grade 2 with rheumatologist advice; test for viral hepatitis B, C, and latent or active TB before DMARD treatment and repeat screening labs annually in those requiring biologic treatment for > 1 year. Patients with IA should be monitored with serial rheumatologic examinations, including inflammatory markers, every 4–6 weeks after treatment is instituted.
