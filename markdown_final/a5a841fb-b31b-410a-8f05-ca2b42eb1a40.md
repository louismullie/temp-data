## Question

can cosentyx cause tremors

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Cosentyx, or secukinumab, can cause tremors. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA prescribing information and safety labeling say about neurological adverse events like tremor. Then, I should review phase II/III clinical trial safety tables to see if tremor appears among treatment-emergent adverse events. Next, I will examine post-marketing surveillance and real-world cohorts for any tremor signals. After that, I need to consider biological plausibility based on the mechanism of action and any neurologic data with IL-17A blockade. Finally, I should assess indirect or confounding causes of tremor and synthesize a causality judgment while outlining a practical clinical approach if a patient on secukinumab reports tremor [^112baJEk] [^115vLPg9].

> Let me first confirm what the FDA label documents. Hold on, I should verify whether tremor or other movement disorders are listed among adverse reactions or warnings. The core Cosentyx safety sections emphasize infections, hypersensitivity, and potential inflammatory bowel disease exacerbations; the common adverse reactions include upper respiratory infections, diarrhea, headache, oral candidiasis, and similar, but I do not see tremor or movement disorders listed, and the warnings do not raise neurologic safety signals either, which argues against tremor being a recognized adverse effect on-label [^112baJEk] [^112Ka7ff] [^115cZ2R8] [^111Tdo84].

> Next, I should review the randomized trial safety data. Wait, let me verify across multiple programs, including ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, where adverse events are carefully tabulated. In MEASURE trials and the nr-axSpA phase III study, frequent events were nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, headache, and URTI, with no mention of tremor; pooled psoriasis safety over thousands of patient-years similarly did not identify tremor as a treatment-emergent signal, which is consistent across programs and doses [^113SuSay] [^111pPVq4] [^114sAXuD] [^113fbJWP].

> I will now examine real-world pharmacovigilance and post-marketing surveillance. Hmm, wait a minute, could tremor have emerged post-approval even if absent in trials? Large Japanese post-marketing surveillance cohorts and other observational series report expected events such as infections, candidiasis, IBD, hypersensitivity, and cardiovascular events, but do not describe tremor as a signal or as a priority investigation item; similarly, retention/effectiveness cohorts do not list tremor among reported adverse events, which reduces the likelihood of a missed signal in routine practice [^11496Dqk] [^111mwxGh] [^1171ccmt] [^115KqMJr].

> Let me consider biological plausibility. Secukinumab selectively neutralizes IL-17A; I need to ensure there is no clear mechanistic pathway linking IL-17A blockade to basal ganglia or cerebellar circuitry that would plausibly produce tremor. Hold on, I should verify neurologic data with IL-17A inhibition; a proof-of-concept trial in multiple sclerosis did not show neurologic worsening and in fact suggested reduced MRI lesion activity, further arguing against a direct tremor liability from IL-17A inhibition [^115vLPg9] [^112yvhZV].

> But wait, what if tremor appears indirectly. I should double-check whether common secukinumab adverse effects could secondarily precipitate tremor, for example, systemic infections causing fever, metabolic derangements, or drug–drug interactions from concomitant therapies. While infections and hypersensitivity are established risks, these would represent indirect or contextual causes rather than a primary neurotoxic effect of secukinumab, and headache in the label should not be conflated with tremor on neurologic review [^111Tdo84] [^112Ka7ff].

> I need to synthesize the evidence and assign causality. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; applying a causality framework, there is a lack of consistency across datasets, no specific temporal case reports, no dose–response gradient, and minimal biological plausibility. Across labeling, randomized trials, pooled analyses, and post-marketing datasets, tremor is not recognized as an adverse effect of secukinumab, making a causal relationship unlikely based on current evidence [^112baJEk] [^114sAXuD].

> If a patient on secukinumab reports tremor, I should confirm the phenotype and consider common alternatives before attributing causality. Let me think about essential tremor, medication-induced tremor from agents such as beta-agonists, lithium, valproate, SSRI/SNRI stimulants, hyperthyroidism, anxiety, caffeine, or alcohol withdrawal, and pursue standard evaluation and management pathways described for tremor disorders; these etiologies are far more probable than a secukinumab effect based on the available data [^114Vn2eM] [^113r5gfD] [^116CrpPF].

---

No — tremors are **not a known or labeled adverse effect** of Cosentyx (secukinumab) [^112Ka7ff] based on clinical trials [^113SuSay], post-marketing data [^114sAXuD], and FDA labeling [^111iM94j] [^115cZ2R8]. There is **no evidence of a causal link** or a plausible pharmacologic mechanism to support such an association. If tremors occur during treatment, evaluate for other causes and consider reporting the event.

---

## Clinical trial and post-marketing safety data

- **Clinical trials**: Extensive trials in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis [^112AkWUF], and ankylosing spondylitis did not report tremors as adverse events.

- **Post-marketing surveillance**: Large real-world cohorts [^1171ccmt] [^11496Dqk] and pooled analyses [^114sAXuD] have not identified tremors as a safety signal.

- **FDA labeling**: Tremors are not listed among common [^112Ka7ff], uncommon [^111iM94j], or unknown-frequency adverse reactions [^115cZ2R8].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism and neurological effects

Regarding the **mechanism of action**, **secukinumab targets IL-17A** [^115vLPg9], a cytokine central to inflammatory pathways, which has no known role in motor control or tremor pathophysiology. As for **neurological effects**, clinical and post-marketing data [^111pPVq4] do not show increased neurological adverse events, including tremors.

---

## Comparison with other biologic therapies

Within the **biologic class**, IL-17 inhibitors, including secukinumab, have not been associated with tremors in clinical or post-marketing data [^111qnDRX]. Similarly, for **other biologics**, TNF inhibitors and IL-12/23 inhibitors have not been linked to tremors [^112Dtyrj].

---

## Clinical recommendations and patient management

- **Monitoring**: Routine neurological monitoring is not required; if tremors occur, evaluate for other causes.

- **Management**: If tremors persist or worsen, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation based on clinical judgment.

- **Reporting**: Report tremors to pharmacovigilance systems to support ongoing safety monitoring.

## Summary of evidence

| **Evidence source** | **Tremors reported?** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Clinical trials | No | - Extensive trials <br/> - No tremors reported |
| Post-marketing surveillance | No | - Large cohorts <br/> - No tremors identified [^11496Dqk] |
| FDA labeling | No | Tremors not listed among adverse reactions [^112Ka7ff] [^111iM94j] [^115cZ2R8] |

### Essential tremor [^114Vn2eM]. The Lancet Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common neurological diseases, though it is a disease that we are only beginning to understand. Effective treatment options for this disorder are severely limited. The traditional view of ET as a benign, familial, monosymptomatic disorder is being replaced by the perspective of it as a disease, or family of diseases, with etiological, clinical, and pathological heterogeneity.

The recent identification of putative environmental toxins linked to ET provides hope for disease prevention through a reduction in exposure to risk factors. Pathological and genetic studies are expected to yield new insights into disease pathogenesis and mechanisms, which may lead to the development of more effective symptomatic therapies informed by an understanding of the disease biology. These insights also have the potential to form the basis for neuroprotective therapies.

### Cosentyx [^115vLPg9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Secukinumab is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the interleukin-17A (IL-17A) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-17 receptor. IL-17A is a naturally occurring cytokine involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Secukinumab inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Elevated levels of IL-17A are found in psoriatic plaques and HS lesions. Treatment with Cosentyx may reduce epidermal neutrophils and IL-17A levels in psoriatic plaques. Serum levels of total IL-17A (both free and secukinumab-bound IL-17A) measured at Week 4 and Week 12 were increased following secukinumab treatment. These pharmacodynamic activities are based on small exploratory trials. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which secukinumab exerts its clinical effects is unknown. Increased numbers of IL-17A producing lymphocytes and innate immune cells and increased levels of IL-17A have been found in the blood of patients with PsA and AS. Increased numbers of IL-17A producing lymphocytes have also been found in patients with nr-axSpA.

- **Immune response to non-live vaccines during treatment**: Healthy individuals who received a single 150 mg dose of Cosentyx 2 weeks prior to vaccination with a non-U.S.-approved group C meningococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine and a non-U.S.-approved inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine had similar antibody responses compared to individuals who did not receive Cosentyx prior to vaccination.

### Real-world retention rates and effectiveness of secukinumab in psoriasis: Results from a multicenter cohort study (RAILWAY) [^1171ccmt]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease that significantly affects the quality of life. Secukinumab, the first interleukin 17A inhibitor, has been used for the systemic treatment of psoriasis, but its long-term, real-world retention rates in Japan have not been fully investigated. This multicenter, non-interventional, retrospective chart review study evaluated the retention rate of secukinumab and its effectiveness among patients with psoriasis in Japan over five years.

Data of patients who received secukinumab after December 26, 2014, were collected from medical charts obtained from seven sites, all certified for biologics use by the Japanese Dermatological Association. Patient characteristics, secukinumab retention, factors affecting secukinumab retention, reasons for drug discontinuation, and effectiveness data were collected. The primary endpoint was the secukinumab retention rate at week 52. A total of 123 patients were included in the analysis. Of these, 27 patients discontinued secukinumab by week 52, yielding a 78.0% retention rate (95% confidence interval, 69.6–84.4) at week 52.

For patients whose Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score was available, the mean ± standard deviation PASI at baseline and at week 52 were 9.21 ± 7.37 and 1.4 ± 2.6, respectively. During the entire study period, "insufficient response" was the most common reason for discontinuation, and "history of biologics use" was a factor significantly associated with secukinumab discontinuation (hazard ratio, 1.72; p = 0.018). This study demonstrates the real-world retention and effectiveness of secukinumab in a Japanese cohort with psoriasis.

### Secukinumab long-term safety experience: A pooled analysis of 10 phase II and III clinical studies in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis [^114sAXuD]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Secukinumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

- **Objective**: We reviewed safety data from the secukinumab psoriasis phase II/III program.

- **Methods**: Data were pooled from 10 phase II/III secukinumab psoriasis studies.

- **Results**: Analysis included 3993 subjects; 3430 received secukinumab, representing 2725 subject-years (SYs) of exposure. Over 52 weeks, for secukinumab 300 mg, 150 mg, and etanercept, respectively, exposure-adjusted incidence rates (IRs) per 100 SYs were comparable across treatments for total adverse events (AEs; 236.1, 239.9, and 243.4, respectively); infections (91.1, 85.3, and 93.7, respectively); serious AEs (7.4, 6.8, and 7.0, respectively); serious infections (1.4, 1.1, and 1.4, respectively); malignant or unspecified tumors (0.77, 0.97, and 0.68, respectively); and adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (0.42, 0.35, and 0.34, respectively). AEs were not dose-related except for nonserious, mild/moderate, skin/mucosal candidiasis (IRs 3.55, 1.85, and 1.37 for secukinumab 300 mg, 150 mg, and etanercept, respectively).

- **Limitations**: There was a limited number of patients in comparator groups and the exposure to placebo was short.

- **Conclusion**: Secukinumab had a favorable safety profile, had no meaningful difference between the 300- and 150-mg doses and, in terms of safety, was comparable to etanercept over 52 weeks in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

### Improvement of signs and symptoms of nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis in patients treated with secukinumab: Primary results of a randomized, placebo-controlled phase III study [^111pPVq4]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) up to week 20 was 61.2% for the "any secukinumab group" and 54.3% for the placebo group. Most AEs reported up to week 20 were mild or moderate in severity for all treatment groups. The most frequent treatment-emergent AEs up to week 20 were nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, headache, and upper respiratory tract infection in both the secukinumab and placebo groups. Most AEs reported during the entire treatment period were mild or moderate in severity across all treatment groups.

A total of 14 cases of uveitis in 11 patients were reported: 9 in the secukinumab groups (4 de novo cases) and 2 in the placebo group. All uveitis cases were mild to moderate in severity; none were reported as serious adverse events (SAEs), and none led to treatment interruption or discontinuation. A total of 7 patients receiving secukinumab reported inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including 5 with Crohn's disease and 2 with ulcerative colitis. Two patients had a history of IBD, and three of the IBD cases led to treatment interruption or discontinuation. No cases of IBD were reported in the placebo group.

Suicide attempts were reported in 2 patients with a history of depression: 1 in a patient who had switched to a TNFi as standard of care approximately 10 months before the event, and 1 in a patient in the secukinumab 150 mg NL group. Three malignancy cases were reported in patients in the placebo group who switched to open-label secukinumab.

### Secukinumab, an interleukin-17A inhibitor, in ankylosing spondylitis [^113SuSay]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Secukinumab is an anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody that has been shown to control the symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis in a phase 2 trial. We conducted two phase 3 trials of secukinumab in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis.

- **Methods**: In two double-blind trials, we randomly assigned patients to receive secukinumab or placebo. In MEASURE 1, a total of 371 patients received intravenous secukinumab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight) or matched placebo at weeks 0, 2, and 4, followed by subcutaneous secukinumab (150 mg or 75 mg) or matched placebo every 4 weeks starting at week 8. In MEASURE 2, a total of 219 patients received subcutaneous secukinumab (150 mg or 75 mg) or matched placebo at baseline; at weeks 1, 2, and 3; and every 4 weeks starting at week 4. At week 16, patients in the placebo group were randomly reassigned to subcutaneous secukinumab at a dose of 150 mg or 75 mg. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with at least 20% improvement in Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS20) response criteria at week 16.

- **Results**: In MEASURE 1, the ASAS20 response rates at week 16 were 61%, 60%, and 29% for subcutaneous secukinumab at doses of 150 mg and 75 mg and for placebo, respectively (P < 0.001 for both comparisons with placebo); in MEASURE 2, the rates were 61%, 41%, and 28% for subcutaneous secukinumab at doses of 150 mg and 75 mg and for placebo, respectively (P < 0.001 for the 150-mg dose and P = 0.10 for the 75-mg dose). The significant improvements were sustained through 52 weeks.

### Randomized trial replication using observational data for comparative effectiveness of secukinumab and ustekinumab in psoriasis: A study from the British Association of Dermatologists Biologics and Immunomodulators Register [^112ad7f1]. JAMA Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Treatments for psoriasis may be less effective in everyday practice than in clinical trials. Emulating a target trial using data from the British Association of Dermatologists Biologics and Immunomodulators Register (BADBIR) can provide treatment effect estimates that are robust and can inform both clinicians and regulatory bodies.

- **Objectives**: To assess the comparative effectiveness of ustekinumab and secukinumab in patients with psoriasis, and to test whether the relative effectiveness estimate of the CLEAR trial, a randomized clinical trial that compared secukinumab with ustekinumab for psoriasis, can be replicated.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This comparative effectiveness research study used a target trial emulation approach and was performed between November 2007 and August 2019. Data were obtained from BADBIR, a multicenter longitudinal pharmacovigilance register of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. Participants had chronic plaque psoriasis, were 18 years or older, and had at least one record of a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) of 12 or higher before their initiation to secukinumab or ustekinumab. Propensity score (PS) 1:1 matched analysis and inverse probability treatment weighted analysis were performed.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcomes were the risk ratio (RR) and the risk difference (RD) for achieving PASI of 2 or lower after 12 months of therapy for secukinumab compared with ustekinumab. Methods to account for missing outcome data were complete case analysis.

### Activity of secukinumab, an anti-IL-17A antibody, on brain lesions in RRMS: results from a randomized, proof-of-concept study [^112yvhZV]. Journal of Neurology (2016). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of secukinumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin (IL)-17A, on the number of new active brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions in subjects with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Subjects (N = 73) were randomized 1:1 to receive either secukinumab 10 mg/kg or a placebo via intravenous infusion at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20. MRI scans were obtained within 30 days prior to randomization, on a monthly basis during the treatment period, and at study completion.

The primary endpoint was the cumulative number of combined unique active lesions (CUAL) observed on brain MRI scans from week 4 to week 24. Compared with placebo, secukinumab non-significantly reduced the number of CUAL observed on 4-weekly MRI from week 4 to 24 (primary endpoint) by 49% (95% CI -10 to 77%; P = 0.087) and significantly reduced the number of cumulative new gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions by 67% (31–84%, P = 0.003). CUAL reductions were progressively greater from week 4 (1%) to week 16 (49%) and persisted until end-study (50%).

There were no serious adverse events; the adverse event rate was comparable to placebo (53% versus 49%), although mild-to-moderate infection was somewhat more frequent (37% versus 23%). This proof-of-concept study provides the first evidence that blocking IL-17A with an antibody may reduce MRI lesion activity in MS. Further studies are needed to confirm this finding and determine the magnitude of effect.

### Evaluation of the adverse effects of biological agents used in the treatment of psoriasis: A multicenter retrospective cohort study [^112Dtyrj]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

The objective was to reveal and compare the adverse effects of infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, ustekinumab, and secukinumab, and determine possible risk factors. The follow-up files and computer-based records of patients with psoriasis were retrospectively screened between January 2007 and September 2019.

The five biological agents were compared in terms of their adverse effects, and factors that might be related to these effects were explored. While there was no statistically significant difference between the agents in terms of the rate of serious adverse effects, when all the adverse effects were evaluated together, the highest rate was seen in the use of infliximab and the lowest in secukinumab (P = 0.001). The rates of adverse effects and related drug discontinuation were higher in the use of anti-TNF agents compared to interleukin inhibitors (P = 0.004 and P = 0.012, respectively).

The agent with the highest drug discontinuation rate due to adverse effects was infliximab, while the least discontinued agent was ustekinumab (P = 0.036). There were more side effects with anti-TNF agents than interleukin inhibitors, but the serious adverse effect rate was similar in both groups. The incidence of certain adverse effects increases depending on age, number of comorbidities, biological agent and its group, concomitant systemic therapy, and use of multiple agents.

### Secukinumab: a review in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis [^111qnDRX]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2015). High credibility.

Secukinumab (Cosentyx™) is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G1κ antibody targeting human interleukin-17A, an important cytokine in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Secukinumab, as well as being first in its drug class, is the first biologic treatment to be approved in the EU for the first-line systemic treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. This article reviews the pharmacologic properties of secukinumab and its clinical efficacy and tolerability in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

In clinical trials, subcutaneous secukinumab was more effective than placebo, etanercept, and ustekinumab at improving both psoriasis symptoms (with high skin clearance) and health-related quality of life. Moreover, secukinumab was more effective than placebo in the difficult-to-treat palmoplantar and nail psoriasis populations. Secukinumab was generally well tolerated, with low immunogenicity.

Longer-term, efficacy was sustained, and secukinumab remained well tolerated. Subcutaneous secukinumab is an effective and generally well-tolerated first-line treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, and is a useful addition to the treatment options for this disease.

### Guselkumab versus secukinumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis (ECLIPSE): Results from a phase 3, randomised controlled trial [^11189GVG]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Antibodies targeting interleukin (IL)-23 and IL-17A effectively treat moderate-to-severe psoriasis. ECLIPSE is the first comparator study of an IL-23p19 inhibitor, guselkumab, versus an IL-17A inhibitor, secukinumab. The primary objective of this study was to show the superiority of clinical response at week 48 for guselkumab compared to secukinumab.

- **Methods**:
	- In this phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, comparator-controlled trial conducted at 142 outpatient clinical sites across nine countries (Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Spain, and the United States), eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, with moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis, and were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Eligible patients were randomly assigned through permuted block randomisation using an interactive web response system to receive either guselkumab (100 mg at weeks 0 and 4, then every 8 weeks) or secukinumab (300 mg at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then every 4 weeks). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in the intention-to-treat population who achieved a 90% or greater reduction from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90 response) at week 48.

- **Major secondary endpoints**:
	- **PASI responses**: PASI 75 response at both weeks 12 and 48, PASI 90 response at week 12, PASI 75 response at week 12, PASI 100 response at week 48
	- **Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scores**: IGA score of 0 (cleared) at week 48, IGA score of 0 or 1 (minimal) at week 48

### Safety and effectiveness of secukinumab subcutaneous injection in Japanese patients with psoriasis vulgaris and psoriatic arthritis: A post-marketing surveillance [^11496Dqk]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Secukinumab is the first human monoclonal antibody that targets human interleukin‐17A. This open‐label, multicenter, uncontrolled, single‐arm, prospective observational surveillance evaluated the long‐term safety and effectiveness of secukinumab in patients with psoriasis vulgaris and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in Japan. Of 997 patients whose surveillance forms were collected, 976 were included in the safety analysis and 729 in the effectiveness analysis.

Prior to the start of secukinumab treatment, biologics were used in 42.52% of patients for the treatment of conditions including psoriasis. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) duration of secukinumab administration was 288.1 ± 106.51 days, and the median (range) was 344.0 (1–365) days. The most commonly used dose per administration was 300 mg in 96.21% (939 patients), and the mean ± SD total number of administrations was 13.6 ± 3.87. Adverse events (AEs), AEs suspected to be related to secukinumab, AEs that led to secukinumab treatment discontinuation, serious AEs, and deaths were reported in 36.17%, 18.85%, 8.09%, 5.84%, and 1.13%, respectively.

The proportion of patients with an Investigator's Global Assessment score improvement to 0/1 increased over time from the start of secukinumab treatment to week 24 and remained stable thereafter. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 response rates and the proportions of patients with a Dermatology Life Quality Index score of 0/1 increased from baseline and were maintained up to week 52. This surveillance did not show any new safety concerns of secukinumab treatment.

The mean ± standard deviation (SD) duration of secukinumab administration was 288.1 ± 106.51 days and the median (range) was 344.0 (1–365) days. The most commonly used dose per administration was 300 mg in 96.21% (939 patients), and the mean ± SD total number of administrations was 13.6 ± 3.87.

- **Adverse events**: Adverse events (AEs), AEs suspected to be related to secukinumab, AEs that led to secukinumab treatment discontinuation, serious AEs, and deaths were reported in 36.17%, 18.85%, 8.09%, 5.84%, and 1.13%, respectively.

The proportion of patients with an Investigator's Global Assessment score improvement to 0/1 increased over time from the start of secukinumab treatment to week 24 and remained stable thereafter. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 response rates and the proportions of patients with a Dermatology Life Quality Index score of 0/1 increased from baseline and were maintained up to week 52. This surveillance did not show any new safety concerns of secukinumab treatment.

### Safety and effectiveness of secukinumab in psoriasis vulgaris and psoriatic arthritis: Real-world evidence in Japan [^112poxRm]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Secukinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively neutralizes interleukin-17A, has been available for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis since February 2015 in Japan. Because there was a time gap after the previous approval of biologics for psoriatic disease indication, it was suggested that patients treated with secukinumab at its launch might have refractory disease symptoms. To assess the safety and effectiveness of secukinumab in these patients, a 52-week, open-label, multicenter, observational cohort study was conducted. In total, 306 and 250 patients were included in the safety and effectiveness analysis sets, respectively. Over half of the patients had previously received biologics (56.9%). Adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse reactions were reported in 41.2%, 7.2%, and 24.2% of patients, respectively. The most commonly reported adverse reaction was oral candidiasis (2.9%), consistent with those reported in clinical studies. Additionally, none of the patient characteristics assessed for their effect on the safety of secukinumab increased the occurrence of adverse reactions. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (mean ± standard deviation) improved from baseline (14.7 ± 12.3) to week 12 (1.78 ± 3.3), which was maintained up to week 24 (1.59 ± 3.0). The proportion of patients with a Dermatology Life Quality Index score of 0/1 improved from baseline (2.2%) to week 12 (64.7%) and was sustained up to week 24 (71.4%). In addition to skin symptoms, improvement was observed in all psoriatic arthritis disease manifestations.

### Secukinumab is effective and safe in the long-term treatment of plaque psoriasis in a daily practice setting: Multicenter study in 384 Spanish patients [^115KqMJr]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to assess the long-term effectiveness and safety of secukinumab in Spanish patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis in a daily practice setting. This was a nationwide multicenter, observational, retrospective, non-interventional, single-cohort study that included patients who initiated treatment with secukinumab under daily clinical practice conditions. Subjects were followed for a minimum of 3 months and a maximum of 24 months. Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI), Body Surface Area, and Physician's Global Assessments were collected at baseline and months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 during treatment. Adverse events and reasons for secukinumab withdrawal were collected and classified for analyses.

A total of 384 patients were enrolled in the study. The median PASI declined rapidly from 14.3 at baseline to 2.7 at month 3, to 2.1 at month 12, and remained low (2.8) at month 24. Within the group of patients with PASI ≥ 10 at baseline (n = 278), 58.3%, 60.4%, and 56.5% achieved a PASI90 response at months 3, 12, and 24, respectively. Regarding absolute PASI, 86.5%, 69.5%, 42.7%, and 37% achieved PASI < 5, < 3, < 1, and 0, respectively, at month 3. Secukinumab was more effective in biologic-naïve patients and in those with a lower Body Mass Index. Secukinumab presented a good long-term safety profile and was effective and safe in a routine clinical setting for a large cohort of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis over the short, medium, and long term (up to 24 months).

Safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of study medication. Adverse events (AEs) are reported as exposure-adjusted incidence rates (EAIR) per 100 patient-years over the entire treatment period, which refers to the cumulative treatment period. This includes events that started after the first dose of study treatment or events present prior to the first dose of study treatment but increased in severity based on preferred term, occurring on or before the last dose plus 84 days. Patients who switched to standard of care were counted in their previous treatment group until the end of the washout phase.

### Effect of secukinumab on patient-reported outcomes in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis: A phase III randomized trial (MEASURE 1) [^1122NKPo]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Therapeutic strategies targeting various inflammatory pathways, including interleukin‐6 receptor (IL‐6R) blockade, T-cell costimulation inhibition, and IL‐1R antagonism, have largely failed to show significant clinical efficacy in ankylosing spondylitis (AS). IL‐17A has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AS, with elevated levels of IL‐17–producing cells found in the circulation and target tissues of patients with this disease.

Secukinumab (AIN457) is a high-affinity, fully human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to and neutralizes IL‐17A. In a phase II proof-of-concept trial, secukinumab was well tolerated and rapidly reduced clinical and biologic signs of active AS. MEASURE 1 is an ongoing, 2-year, phase III, randomized trial, followed by a 3-year extension period, designed to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of secukinumab in patients with active AS. Secukinumab was shown to improve the signs and symptoms of AS through the first 52 weeks of therapy. Here, we report the effects of secukinumab treatment over 52 weeks on patient-reported outcomes.

### Secukinumab 2-weekly vs. 4-weekly dosing in patients with plaque-type psoriasis: Results from the randomized GAIN study [^117H2BS1]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Secukinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively neutralizes interleukin-17A and shows long-lasting efficacy and safety in plaque psoriasis. More evidence is required to optimize secukinumab dosing according to clinical response.

- **Objectives**: GAIN compared the efficacy and safety of secukinumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) with 300 mg every 4 weeks (q4w) in patients achieving ≥ 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) but not PASI 90 after 16 weeks.

- **Methods**: In total, 772 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis received secukinumab 300 mg subcutaneously at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4, then q4w until week 16. At week 16, patients with PASI ≥ 75 to PASI < 90 were randomized 1:1 to continue q4w dosing (n = 162) or switch to q2w (n = 163) to week 32. The primary endpoint was superiority of q2w to q4w dosing for PASI 90 response at week 32.

- **Results**: PASI 90 response at week 32 was numerically greater with secukinumab 300 mg q2w than with secukinumab 300 mg q4w in suboptimal responders, but this did not reach statistical significance (64.4% vs. 57.4%; odds ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.39–1.07; P = 0.087). Although the primary endpoint was not met, absolute PASI was significantly lower at week 32 in q2w vs. q4w patients (2.11 vs. 2.84, P = 0.024). Significantly more patients with q2w vs. q4w dosing showed minimal disease activity (Investigator's Global Assessment score 0 or 1: 73.0% vs. 64.1%, P < 0.05) and improved quality of life (Dermatology Life Quality Index score 0 or 1: 58.9% vs. 50.6%, P < 0.05).

### Safety and effectiveness of secukinumab subcutaneous injection in Japanese patients with psoriasis vulgaris and psoriatic arthritis: A post-marketing surveillance [^111Um8u1]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events**: Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events were reported in 2.15% (n = 21/976) as adverse events (AEs) and in 0.51% (n = 5/976) as AEs suspected to be related to secukinumab. The severity of these events was severe in one patient (resulting in death), moderate in another patient (cerebral infarction), and mild in all other cases. The median number of days from the start of secukinumab treatment to the first occurrence of AEs suspected to be related to secukinumab was 171.5 days (range: 86–314 days). Of the five patients with AEs suspected to be related to secukinumab, these events resolved in two patients, with a median resolution time of 47.5 days (range: 1–94 days).

- **Effectiveness outcomes**: The effectiveness analysis population (n = 729) was assessed. The Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score was evaluated for patients from this population with an initial IGA score of ≥ 2 at the start of secukinumab treatment. The proportion of patients whose IGA score improved to 0 or 1 increased over time, reaching 44.41% (n = 163/367) at week 4, 71.38% (n = 217/304) at week 16, and 77.36% (n = 270/349) at week 24. The proportion of patients with an IGA 0/1 response remained stable at 76.24% (n = 154/202) by week 52. For the subgroup of 202 patients with a baseline IGA score of ≥ 2, response rates were analyzed based on patient characteristics. The response rate in patients with renal impairment was 52.94% compared to 78.65% in those without renal impairment. Although the effectiveness tended to be lower in patients with renal impairment, further data would be necessary to draw conclusive comparisons.

### Safety and effectiveness of secukinumab in psoriasis vulgaris and psoriatic arthritis: Real-world evidence in Japan [^112Jg2sM]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

We reaffirmed the safety and effectiveness of secukinumab with a broader range of patients in this Japan real‐world study, consistent with those in the clinical studies. No new safety concerns were identified, and overall adverse reactions (AR) and adverse events of special interest (AESI) did not show a noteworthy difference from pre‐approval clinical studies and those listed in the package insert. Clinical benefits of secukinumab were demonstrated in all effectiveness assessments, such as Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI), eruption‐covered body surface area (BSA), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and global impression of skin symptoms. At week 24, the proportion of patients achieving IGA 0/1 and PASI‐75, ‐90, and ‐100 was similar to those observed in the ERASURE study.

This study was conducted to address a significant gap between the last approved biologics in 2011 and the approval of secukinumab in December 2014, as most of the patients prescribed secukinumab soon after its launch were believed to be presenting with severe psoriasis (PsO) and an inadequate response to existing therapies. This notion holds true, as 56.9% of patients were biologic‐experienced compared with approximately 20% in the subanalysis of Japanese patients in the ERASURE study. Additionally, more than 30% of patients had been diagnosed with PsO for over 20 years in this study, suggesting the presence of long‐term inflammation. Approximately 20% of the patients in this real‐world study presented with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or hepatic disease as comorbidities. Several lines of evidence have demonstrated a relationship between disease duration and the severity of psoriasis.

### Secukinumab for the treatment of adult-onset pityriasis rubra pilaris: A single-arm clinical trial with transcriptomic analysis [^112f5PVu]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is not completely understood, but interleukin (IL)-17 has been shown to play a critical role. There are no reliable immunomodulatory agents to treat PRP. We conducted an open-label, single-arm clinical trial of secukinumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits IL-17A, for the treatment of PRP.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of secukinumab and define the transcriptomic landscape of PRP and its response to IL-17A blockade.

- **Methods**: Twelve patients with PRP were recruited for an open-label trial of secukinumab. Patients received a 24-week course of secukinumab. The primary endpoint was a ≥ 75% reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) from baseline to week 28. Secondary endpoints included PASI 90, change in Physician's Global Assessment (PGA), and change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). RNA sequencing was performed on lesional and nonlesional skin biopsies obtained at baseline and week 2. Sample groups were compared to identify differential gene expression and pathway enrichment. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov: 'Cosentyx (secukinumab) for the treatment of adult-onset pityriasis rubra pilaris' - NCT03342573.

- **Results**: At week 28, six of 11 patients (55%) achieved PASI 75, and three patients (27%) achieved PASI 90. PGA (P = 0.008) and DLQI scores (P = 0.010) showed significant improvement with treatment. No serious treatment-related adverse events were encountered. Treatment with secukinumab normalized transcriptional differences between lesional and nonlesional skin.

### Safety and effectiveness of secukinumab subcutaneous injection in Japanese patients with psoriasis vulgaris and psoriatic arthritis: A post-marketing surveillance [^1163q3NG]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of secukinumab was demonstrated through improvements in HAQ-DI scores, DAS28-CRP scores, VAS (physician), VAS (patient), dactylitis count in fingers and toes, tender DIP joint count, swollen DIP joint count, tenderness in entheses, presence/absence of dactylitis in fingers and toes, and BASDAI scores over time from the start of secukinumab treatment. These improvements were generally maintained up to week 52. A mean decrease of 0.31 in HAQ-DI score from the start of secukinumab treatment to week 52 indicated a clinically significant change and was consistent with results from previous studies. These data suggest that the long-term effectiveness of secukinumab in patients with psoriasis vulgaris or PsA not adequately responding to conventional therapies aligns with previous studies.

This surveillance was an observational study without a control group and did not collect information on patients not exposed to secukinumab. This limitation affects the postulation of a causal relationship between secukinumab exposure and the observed results. Results from this surveillance were compared to previous studies for reference, but differences in patient population and study design exist between the studies. Additional limitations included incomplete data and confounding factors that could not be identified due to "unknown" responses.

In conclusion, the surveillance results confirm the long-term effectiveness of secukinumab treatment in patients with psoriasis vulgaris and PsA. No new safety concerns were identified.

### Effectiveness and safety of secukinumab in patients with moderate-severe psoriasis: A multicenter real-life study [^115fsvtp]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

This study assessed the effectiveness and safety of secukinumab in patients with moderate-severe psoriasis vulgaris in a real-world setting. A total of 120 patients (35.8% women; mean age 49.8 years) were enrolled. The mean PASI significantly decreased from 12.0 ± 6.6 at baseline to 4.7 ± 3.2 and 2.3 ± 4.0 at 3 and 12 months, respectively (P < .001). Patients with two or more lines of prior biological therapies had poorer persistence to therapy at 12 months (71%) compared to those who were bio-naïve (93%) or patients with only one prior failure with a biological agent (88%) (log-rank = 9.33; p = 0.009). Multivariate regression analysis showed that patients beyond the second line of treatment had an increased risk of discontinuing secukinumab (HR: 3.6; 95% CI 1.3–10.2), while those without comorbidities had a lower risk (HR: 0.31; 95% CI 0.1–0.8). This study confirms the effectiveness and safety of secukinumab in a real-life setting for psoriatic disease.

### Secukinumab and sustained improvement in signs and symptoms of patients with active ankylosing spondylitis through two years: Results from a phase III study [^1148Q4pd]. Arthritis Care & Research (2017). High credibility.

- **Results**: A total of 219 patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) were randomized at baseline to receive subcutaneous (SC) secukinumab 150 mg (72 patients), 75 mg (73 patients), or placebo (74 patients). At week 16, 66 patients who had been treated with placebo were re-randomized to SC secukinumab 150 mg or 75 mg, as 8 placebo-treated patients discontinued the study before week 16. In total, 200 patients (91.3%) remained in the study after the 16-week placebo-controlled period, and 174 patients (79.5%) completed all 104 weeks. This included 117 of the 145 patients (80.7%) initially randomized to secukinumab, who received 104 weeks of secukinumab treatment, and 57 of the 74 patients (77.0%) originally randomized to placebo, who received 88 weeks of secukinumab treatment at the respective doses.

- **Baseline characteristics**: There were no clinically meaningful differences in demographic and other baseline characteristics across the treatment groups. Of the total 219 randomized patients, the majority were male (153, 69.9%), and the mean age was 43.3 ± 12.89 years. Disease history at baseline was well-balanced across the treatment groups, reflecting a study population with moderate to severe active AS. The mean time since the first diagnosis of AS was 6.2 ± 8.2 years. The total BASDAI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index) score was 6.7 ± 1.3, and the median (range) hsCRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) level was 7.3 (2.4–10.0) mg/liter. Additionally, 168 patients (76.7%) were human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 positive.

### Anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody secukinumab in treatment of ankylosing spondylitis: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1173QzB2]. Lancet (2013). High credibility.

Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterized by spinal inflammation, progressive spinal rigidity, and peripheral arthritis. Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is thought to be a key inflammatory cytokine in the development of ankylosing spondylitis, the prototypical form of spondyloarthritis. We assessed the efficacy and safety of the anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody secukinumab in treating patients with active ankylosing spondylitis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized double-blind proof-of-concept study at eight centers in Europe (four in Germany, two in the Netherlands, and two in the UK). Patients aged 18–65 years were randomly assigned (in a 4:1 ratio) to either intravenous secukinumab (2×10 mg/kg) or placebo, administered 3 weeks apart. Randomization was done with a computer-generated block randomization list without a stratification process. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients with a 20% response according to the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society criteria for improvement (ASAS20) at week 6 (Bayesian analysis). Safety was assessed up to week 28.

- **Findings**: Thirty-seven patients with moderate-to-severe ankylosing spondylitis were screened, and 30 were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous secukinumab (n = 24) or placebo (n = 6). The final efficacy analysis included 23 patients receiving secukinumab and six patients receiving placebo, and the safety analysis included all 30 patients. At week 6, ASAS20 response estimates were 59% on secukinumab compared to placebo.

### Association of previous treatment with anti-tumour necrosis factor inhibitors with the effectiveness of secukinumab in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111oZTb8]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

We sought to systematically investigate the effectiveness of secukinumab in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients who previously received TNF inhibitors (TNFi) treatment and those who were TNFi naïve.

- **Methods**: Databases such as PubMed, EMBase, and Cochrane Library, along with ClinicalTrials.gov, were searched from inception to 22 May 2020 for randomized controlled trials and observational studies of secukinumab, with or without a history of previous anti-TNFi treatment in PsA. Effectiveness data were extracted and combined using a random-effects meta-analysis. The ACR20 and ACR50 (20% and 50% improvement in American College of Rheumatology response criteria) responses were the endpoints.

- **Results**: Six randomized controlled trials that reported the effectiveness of secukinumab by previous anti-TNFi treatment were included. Among patients exposed to a prior anti-TNFi treatment (n = 738), 33.7% (249/738) of patients achieved an ACR20 response. In contrast, in the anti-TNFi-naïve group (n = 1754), 49.8% (873/1754) of patients achieved an ACR20 response. Prior treatment with anti-TNFi was significantly associated with a poorer response to secukinumab compared with the anti-TNFi-naïve group, with an effect size of 2.09 (95% CI: 1.69, 2.58).

Some patients benefit from switching from TNFi to secukinumab, but previous anti-TNFi treatment is associated with poorer effectiveness of secukinumab.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of secukinumab in patients with psoriatic arthritis: 5-year (end-of-study) results from the phase 3 FUTURE 2 study [^115tK27C]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Secukinumab is an interleukin-17A inhibitor used in the treatment of patients with active psoriatic arthritis. In the phase 3 FUTURE 2 trial, secukinumab showed sustained improvement in clinical outcomes over 2 years. Because scarce data exists on the long-term treatment with biological therapies in patients with psoriatic arthritis, the study aimed to assess and describe the 5-year (end-of-study) results on the efficacy and safety of secukinumab 300 mg and 150 mg doses, as well as dose escalation.

- **Methods**: FUTURE 2 is a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted at 76 centers in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, and the United States. Patients with active psoriatic arthritis, aged 18 years or older, were randomly assigned to receive either secukinumab (300 mg, 150 mg, or 75 mg) or placebo weekly from baseline and then every 4 weeks from week 4. Secukinumab dose was escalated from 150 mg to 300 mg and from 75 mg to 150 mg or 300 mg starting at week 128, if active signs of disease were observed in patients, based on the physician's assessment, with the escalated dose maintained thereafter. Key efficacy endpoints at week 260 (5 years) for secukinumab 300 mg and 150 mg were assessed, including American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) responses. The safety analysis included all patients who received one or more doses of secukinumab. Data are reported as observed.

- **Findings**: At randomization, 65% of patients were naive to tumor necrosis factor inhibitor treatment.

### Problems and controversies in tremor classification [^116gShcr]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Low credibility.

The Consensus Statement on the Classification of Tremors from the Task Force of the International Parkinson's and Movement Disorder Society was published in 2018 in response to advances in the understanding of essential tremor (ET) and tremor associated with dystonia, as well as other monosymptomatic and indeterminate tremors. This was a revision of the previous 1998 Consensus Statement. A number of problems arise from this classification, and in this manuscript, we highlight several of these issues. These problems relate to the definition of tremor, the definition of ET, and the proposal of the term 'essential tremor plus'. Additional issues are related to orthostatic tremor (OT), including the proposal of the term 'orthostatic tremor plus', and the absence of a hierarchy of terms used to classify tremor.

Among the proposals we make is that the definition of tremor should acknowledge that tremor is a symptom. ET should be redefined; severity is an important characteristic for classifying and diagnosing tremor. The terms 'essential tremor plus' and 'orthostatic tremor plus' should be abandoned. Classification of tremor requires rules for creating a hierarchy of terminology. This article is part of the special issue "Tremor" edited by Daniel D. Truong, Mark Hallett, and Aasef Shaikh.

### 5-year efficacy and safety of secukinumab in patients with ankylosing spondylitis: end-of-study results from the phase 3 MEASURE 2 trial [^1175TmT4]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Secukinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that directly inhibits interleukin 17A, has shown significant and sustained improvement in the signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis over 3 years in the MEASURE 2 study. We report the 5-year (end-of-study) results of subcutaneous secukinumab 150 mg in the MEASURE 2 study.

- **Methods**: MEASURE 2 was a phase 3, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study conducted in 13 countries and 53 centres. Patients with ankylosing spondylitis who were 18 years of age or older and fulfilled the modified New York criteria were randomly assigned to receive secukinumab (150 mg or 75 mg) or placebo subcutaneously at baseline and weeks 1, 2, and 3, and then every 4 weeks from week 4. At week 16, patients initially given placebo were randomly assigned again (placebo switchers) to receive secukinumab 150 mg or 75 mg. Efficacy results are reported for patients initially randomised to secukinumab 150 mg and those who switched from placebo to secukinumab 150 mg at week 16. An optional dose escalation from secukinumab 75 mg to 150 mg was initiated beginning week 140. We assessed efficacy endpoints at week 260 (5 years), including Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS) 20 and ASAS 40, inactive disease according to ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score with C-reactive protein (ASDAS-CRP), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), BASDAI50, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index, Short Form-36 Physical Component Summary, and ASAS partial.

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with biologics [^114Az2Sn]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for psoriasis, specifically with respect to biologic agents such as secukinumab, the American Academy of Dermatology 2019 guidelines recommend administering secukinumab at a starting dose of 300 mg. This should be self-administered as subcutaneous injections at week 0, week 1, week 2, week 3, and week 4, followed by 300 mg every 4 weeks. A dose of 300 mg is more effective than 150 mg. After the initial 12 weeks, a maintenance dose of 300 mg every 4 weeks is advised.

### Effect of secukinumab on patient-reported outcomes in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis: A phase III randomized trial (MEASURE 1) [^1129XCun]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

The 52-week results from the MEASURE 1 study showed significant and sustained improvements in the signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) with secukinumab. The patient-reported outcomes assessed in MEASURE 1 demonstrated that, in addition to significant and sustained improvement in the signs and symptoms of AS, patients treated with secukinumab experienced statistically and clinically significant improvements in multiple facets of physical functioning and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at week 16 compared to those treated with placebo. These improvements were sustained in the secukinumab regimens over the long term, through week 52.

These results are clinically meaningful, as patients with active AS experience poor HRQoL due to back pain, discomfort, and fatigue, which ultimately restrict their physical function and work productivity. The significant improvements observed with both secukinumab regimens versus placebo at week 16 in BASDAI, SF-36 PCS, and ASQoL were maintained irrespective of the baseline anti-TNF status of the patients. Improvements in BASDAI scores were also better with secukinumab versus placebo at week 16, regardless of baseline hsCRP level, and were sustained up to week 52. All improvements observed at week 16 were sustained through week 52, and the odds ratios (ORs) favored better responses with the two secukinumab regimens versus placebo.

Both secukinumab regimens provided improvements in BASFI scores and all five domains of health status on the EQ-5D compared to placebo, suggesting improvements in the physical function and health status of the patients receiving secukinumab.

### Review of secukinumab-induced adverse events of special interest and its potential pathogenesis [^111vycwH]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

Although secukinumab has demonstrated high efficacy and favorable safety in moderate-to-severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, patients developing adverse events of special interest (AESI) were reported increasingly in real-world practice. A systematic literature search of the PubMed database was conducted to identify clinical studies or case reports on secukinumab-induced AESI. More than 1077 patients (aged 18–74 years) from 55 studies were reported to have 24 AESI 3 days to 96 weeks after secukinumab treatment.

- **Common AESI**: The four most common AESI were inflammatory bowel disease (n > 1000), eczematous drug eruption (n > 30), drug-associated vasculitis (n = 8), and drug-induced lupus erythematosus (n = 4).

Most of these AESI were only mild to moderately severe and resolved after secukinumab discontinuation without or with symptomatic treatment. Secukinumab has the potential to develop a number of AESI by probably dysregulating the different expression of polar T-cell axes (Th1, Th2, Th17, Th22, and/or Treg) and driving various cytokines in some patients. Physicians should be aware of these AESI for timely diagnosis and proper treatment.

### Secukinumab and sustained improvement in signs and symptoms of patients with active ankylosing spondylitis through two years: Results from a phase III study [^112ZjKgD]. Arthritis Care & Research (2017). Low credibility.

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by new bone formation in the axial skeleton, progressive and irreversible structural damage of the spinal, sacroiliac, and/or peripheral joints, as well as possible extraarticular manifestations such as uveitis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and cardiovascular and pulmonary abnormalities. The first-line therapy in AS consists of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), which are often inefficacious in controlling disease symptoms. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents are the biologic therapies currently approved for the treatment of AS and have shown effectiveness in inducing clinical remission for up to 8 years. However, many patients experience an inadequate response, intolerance, relapse of disease upon discontinuation, and unacceptable safety concerns with anti-TNF therapy; thus, there remains an unmet medical need in the treatment of AS.

- **Significance & innovations**: Interleukin (IL)-17A, the predominant proinflammatory cytokine of helper Th17 cells, has recently emerged as one of the key therapeutic targets for the treatment of AS. Secukinumab, a high-affinity fully human monoclonal IgG1κ antibody that selectively binds and neutralizes IL-17A activity, has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and AS, and is approved for the treatment of these conditions in Europe, the US, and numerous other countries.

### A new approach to the development of disease-modifying therapies for PD; fighting another pandemic [^116xXdJb]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Despite not being likely to provide a disease-modifying indication, there are several advantages to this approach. The trial design offers a relatively rapid, inexpensive, and well-established pathway for regulatory approval. Precise, descriptive language can be used to describe the observed clinical effects (including the temporal profile) of the intervention. This information can be included in the clinical trials section of the product label. Additionally, information about an intervention's known mode of action (MOA) can also be incorporated into the science section of the product label, particularly if it is relevant to clinical effects. The inclusion of this language in the label, even without a disease-modifying indication, permits a novel therapeutic agent to be distinguished from currently available therapies.

### Safety and effectiveness of secukinumab in Japanese patients with generalized pustular psoriasis: A post-marketing surveillance [^1114v4Hc]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Secukinumab is one of the human monoclonal antibodies recommended in the Japanese guidelines for patients with psoriasis. However, few case reports and clinical studies on secukinumab for pustular psoriasis are available due to the rarity of the disease. This open-label, multicenter, uncontrolled, single-arm, prospective observational surveillance was conducted in a clinical practice setting to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of secukinumab in Japanese patients with generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP). Patients were monitored for one year after starting secukinumab and followed up for an additional two years. Of 99 patients from 71 sites, 95 were included in safety and 82 in effectiveness analysis. The mean (standard deviation) observation period was 346.2 (64.87) days, and 91.58% of patients were observed over 52 weeks. Adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse reactions were reported in 51.58%, 12.63%, and 35.79% of patients, respectively. Safety evaluations showed no significant difference in the incidence of events based on the history of biologics. The proportion of patients with either "complete response" or "partial response" was approximately 90% from week 2 and remained stable until week 52. The proportion of patients with "remission (no symptom)" in the Japanese Dermatological Association total score increased from week 4 (22.22%) to week 52 (47.83%). The mean Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score decreased from week 1 (17.26) to week 16 (1.18), with the mean percentage change decreasing from -28.07% to -90.18%. The mean Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) total…

### Secukinumab and sustained improvement in signs and symptoms of patients with active ankylosing spondylitis through two years: Results from a phase III study [^113fbJWP]. Arthritis Care & Research (2017). High credibility.

Objective: Secukinumab improved the signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) over 52 weeks in the phase III MEASURE 2 study. Here, we report longer-term (104 weeks) efficacy and safety results.

Methods: Patients with active AS were randomized to receive subcutaneous secukinumab 150 mg, 75 mg, or placebo at baseline; weeks 1, 2, and 3; and every 4 weeks from week 4. The primary endpoint was the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society criteria for 20% improvement (ASAS20) response rate at week 16. Other endpoints included ASAS40, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, ASAS5/6, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index, Short Form 36 health survey physical component summary, ASAS partial remission, EuroQol 5-domain measure, and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy fatigue subscale. Endpoints were assessed through week 104, with multiple imputation for binary variables and a mixed-effects model repeated measures for continuous variables.

Results: Of the 219 randomized patients, 60 of 72 (83.3%) and 57 of 73 (78.1%) patients completed 104 weeks of treatment with secukinumab 150 mg and 75 mg, respectively. ASAS20/ASAS40 response rates at week 104 were 71.5% and 47.5% with both secukinumab doses, respectively. Clinical improvements with secukinumab were sustained through week 104 across all secondary endpoints. Across the entire treatment period (mean secukinumab exposure 735.6 days), exposure-adjusted incidence rates for serious infections and infestations, Crohn's disease, malignant or unspecified tumors, and major adverse cardiac events were monitored.

### Cosentyx [^115XFYrG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Steady-state concentrations of secukinumab were achieved by Week 24 following the every 4-week Cosentyx dosing regimens. The mean (± SD) steady-state trough concentrations ranged from 16.7 ± 8.2 mcg/mL for 150 mg to 34.4 ± 16.6 mcg/mL for 300 mg, which was administered as two injections of 150 mg.

In healthy subjects and subjects with psoriasis (PsO), secukinumab bioavailability ranged from 55% to 77% following a subcutaneous Cosentyx dose of 150 mg or 300 mg, administered as two injections of 150 mg.

Following subcutaneous administrations of 300 mg of Cosentyx at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then every 2 weeks thereafter, steady-state concentrations of secukinumab were achieved by Week 24 in both HS trials. The mean (± SD) steady-state trough concentrations were 55.7 ± 28.9 mcg/mL and 50.5 ± 28.2 mcg/mL in HS Trial 1 and HS Trial 2, respectively.

- **Distribution**: The mean volume of distribution during the terminal phase (Vz) following a single intravenous administration ranged from 7.10 to 8.60 L in PsO subjects. Secukinumab concentrations in interstitial fluid in lesional and non-lesional skin of PsO subjects ranged from 27% to 40% of those in serum at 1 and 2 weeks following a single subcutaneous dose of Cosentyx 300 mg, administered as two injections of 150 mg.

### Secukinumab treatment of Parry-Romberg syndrome [^111y1zAY]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Parry-Romberg syndrome (PRS), or progressive hemifacial atrophy, is a rare disease characterized by the atrophy of hemifacial soft tissue. This atrophy progresses over several years and is often associated with additional manifestations. These include neurologic issues such as facial pain, headache, or seizures; ophthalmologic issues such as enophthalmos or uveitis; and possible rheumatologic, cardiac, or endocrine changes. The etiopathogenesis of PRS is largely unknown, but it is believed to be a variant of localized linear scleroderma.

The aesthetic and functional effects as the disease progresses can significantly impact the patient, making systemic treatment advisable. Numerous systemic and immunosuppressive agents have been utilized with varying degrees of success. However, there is little evidence regarding the next steps in systemic therapy when these medications are unsuccessful or intolerable.

### Effectiveness and safety of secukinumab in 69 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis: A retrospective multicenter study [^113xoTv9]. Dermatologic Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Secukinumab (anti-IL17A) is effective as a treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, but real-life data on its effectiveness and safety are lacking. We aimed to present real-life data of all Danish patients treated with secukinumab (n = 69). At baseline, before the initiation of treatment with either secukinumab 300 mg (47.8%) or off-label treatment with secukinumab 150 mg (52.2%), the median PASI (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) score was 7.1. A total of 66.7% (34/51) and 52.9% (27/51) of patients still on secukinumab at week 12 achieved a PASI-50 and PASI-75, respectively. Additionally, 83.0% (44/53) and 60.4% (32/53) of the patients had a PASI score < 5 and PASI score < 2, respectively, after 12 weeks on treatment. A third of the patients discontinued secukinumab due to limited clinical improvement or adverse events (n = 23) within a median of 92 days (interquartile range 51–212 days). Notably, the majority of the patients may represent a particularly difficult-to-treat group, as 92.8% had been refractory to other biologic treatments. A total of 26.1% (n = 18) experienced adverse events. Secukinumab appears to be an effective treatment option with a favorable side effect profile in patients with plaque psoriasis who are refractory to or have side effects from traditional biologic drugs.

### When IL-17 inhibitors fail: Real-life evidence to switch from secukinumab to adalimumab or ustekinumab [^1125qomg]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disease that, in its moderate to severe forms, may benefit from biologics such as TNF, IL-12/23, and IL-17 inhibitors. A loss of response, lack of response, or discontinuation due to adverse events represents a significant therapeutic challenge for dermatologists, who must switch patients to other treatments. Although some evidence exists regarding the switch from IL-12/23 and TNF inhibitors to IL-17 inhibitors, there is a lack of information on switching from IL-17 inhibitors to IL-12/23 and TNF inhibitors. We conducted a real-life study enrolling 50 patients randomly switched to adalimumab, a TNF inhibitor, or ustekinumab, an IL-12/23 inhibitor. Our observational study suggests that switching from IL-17 inhibitors to TNF inhibitors and IL-12/23 inhibitors is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy.

### New onset inflammatory bowel disease in patient treated with secukinumab: Case report and review of literature [^111HmYRs]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune skin disorder that can vary in severity and extent. While localized disease can be managed with topical medications, widespread disease often requires systemic therapy, including biologics. This class of medication targets different components of the immune system and modulates disease activity. The biologic secukinumab is a human monoclonal antibody against interleukin-17A, used for treating psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been observed in clinical trials to be associated with this medication.

This review aims to provide evidence for the relationships between secukinumab treatment and the development of IBD. We have examined review articles and original research papers, published between 2010 and 2020, using the following keywords: psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, secukinumab, IBD, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, interleukin-17, IL-17, IL-17 inhibitor.

Case reports have noted an association between secukinumab use and IBD, calling for IBD pre-screening in patients who will be prescribed this medication. Clinical trials concluded that secukinumab was associated with IBD, while retrospective studies have had mixed results, with most studies showing no statistical significance between secukinumab and IBD. However, patients with a history of IBD or family histories have experienced new-onset IBD or flare-ups. Given the utilization of secukinumab as a therapy for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, appropriate screening and risk stratification could help limit morbidity.

### Safety and effectiveness of secukinumab subcutaneous injection in Japanese patients with psoriasis vulgaris and psoriatic arthritis: A post-marketing surveillance [^1122HsYq]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Safety analysis**: The safety analysis population consisted of patients who were eligible for this surveillance but excluded those who failed to return after the first dose of secukinumab, did not receive secukinumab, whose first surveillance forms were not locked, were unregistered, whose surveillance forms were invalid, and those with unknown AE status. Safety assessments included the incidence of AEs, AEs that led to secukinumab treatment discontinuation, serious AEs (SAE), AEs suspected by investigators to be related to secukinumab, and events that corresponded to the priority investigation items.

- **Priority investigation items**: Defined as identified risks or potential risks in the secukinumab risk management plan, these include serious infections, tuberculosis, neutropenia, fungal infections, hypersensitivity reactions, malignant tumors, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events. These events, along with the severity and the relatedness of AEs to secukinumab, were assessed at the investigators' discretion.

- **Statistical analysis**: Odds ratios (ORs) of the occurrence of AEs suspected to be related to secukinumab between the categories of characteristics and their two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed for factors where the 95% confidence interval of the odds ratio did not include 1, as well as for factors suspected to have a clinical relationship.

Statistical analyses

A sample size of 250 patients for each treatment arm was deemed appropriate to achieve adequate power for the primary and secondary endpoints. An overall error (two-sided) of 5% was used to control for Type I error. A predefined hierarchical hypothesis-testing procedure was used to assess primary and secondary efficacy endpoints at week 16 (Supplementary Figure 2). Differences between treatment groups were assessed in marginal response proportions using logistic regression for binary variables. Between-treatment differences in change from baseline were assessed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures for continuous variables. The proportion of responders is reported for binary outcomes, and mean (SD) change from baseline is reported for continuous outcomes. Data are reported through week 16 using nonresponder imputation for binary variables and a mixed-effects model for repeated measures for continuous variables, and from week 20 through week 52 as observed.
