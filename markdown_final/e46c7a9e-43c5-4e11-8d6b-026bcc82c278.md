## Question

What's the best treatment for klebsiella UTI?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to optimally treat a Klebsiella urinary tract infection, incorporating resistance patterns and UTI syndromes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the UTI syndrome (uncomplicated cystitis versus pyelonephritis/complicated UTI versus catheter-associated UTI). Then, I should verify resistance risk factors and obtain cultures before empiric therapy. Next, I'll align antibiotic choices with susceptibility profiles: non-ESBL, ESBL-producing, and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella. After that, I need to confirm durations, transition-to-oral criteria, and device management for CA-UTI. Finally, I should ensure de-escalation and special-population considerations, anchoring on IDSA and EAU guidance and FDA labeling to keep this precise and referenceable [^112CsNzk] [^115gXGo1] [^116GR3iW] [^1141TKM5] [^117J5i6v] [^1171fh9J].

> Let me first confirm the syndrome classification because treatment hinges on it. Uncomplicated cystitis is lower-tract infection in nonpregnant, immunocompetent women without systemic features, whereas pyelonephritis/complicated UTI involves systemic symptoms, flank pain, or host/structural risk factors; catheter-associated UTI is defined by infection in the setting of current or recently removed indwelling catheter with specific diagnostic thresholds for colony counts and symptoms, and these cases are more likely to be polymicrobial and resistant, often requiring longer therapy and source control [^117CdBiz] [^1141TKM5]. Wait, I should also remind myself that agents lacking renal parenchymal penetration, like nitrofurantoin, must not be used for pyelonephritis, which is explicit in FDA labeling and aligns with tissue penetration principles for upper-tract disease [^1171fh9J] [^1151Cp6Y].

> Next, I should review resistance risk factors before I jump to empiric therapy. Prior antibiotic exposure, particularly to third-generation cephalosporins, and healthcare association (e.g., nursing home, dialysis) increase risk for ESBL and MDR Klebsiella; these patterns are well described and correlate with 3GCR phenotypes in ED cohorts and ESBL risk in case-control studies, so I need to check the patient's antibiotic history and prior cultures carefully [^111XLY3x] [^111GNyyk]. Hold on, I should verify culture strategy too: obtain urine cultures before starting antibiotics in CA-UTI and, when sepsis is suspected, get urine plus two sets of blood cultures before initial antimicrobials while not delaying time-critical therapy in unstable patients [^1141TKM5] [^114dEX5z]. I will also consider local antibiograms; although a 20% resistance threshold is often cited for selecting first-line empiric agents, I need to be cautious interpreting this outside specific guideline contexts [^113UcpBW].

> I will now examine susceptibility-based scenarios because Klebsiella spans non-ESBL to ESBL and carbapenem-resistant phenotypes. For non-ESBL, standard oral agents may be active; for ESBL-producing Enterobacterales, oral TMP/SMX or a fluoroquinolone can be used if susceptible for pyelonephritis/cUTI, with carbapenems as preferred when oral options are inactive or not tolerated; for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, preferred agents include novel beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations or cefiderocol, with TMP/SMX or fluoroquinolones used if reliably susceptible [^116GR3iW] [^112T6Th6] [^115ivtWb] [^117Nsaet]. Let me verify that I align uncomplicated cystitis differently, since some lower-tract agents remain appropriate even in ESBL/CRE phenotypes if susceptible and if the indication is strictly cystitis, not pyelonephritis [^115gXGo1] [^112CsNzk].

> For uncomplicated cystitis due to susceptible Klebsiella, I should confirm that nitrofurantoin and TMP/SMX remain first-line oral choices if the isolate is susceptible, and fluoroquinolones are generally discouraged for stewardship despite activity; short-course regimens are typical in guidelines and practice, though I will tailor to patient-specific factors and local resistance data [^1153i1uC]. Wait, let me verify fosfomycin here: I initially thought to include it broadly, but I need to correct that — IDSA 2024 positions oral fosfomycin as an option for E. coli only in uncomplicated cystitis, not for Klebsiella cystitis, so I should not recommend fosfomycin for Klebsiella lower-tract infections [^115gXGo1]. I must also reiterate that nitrofurantoin is not appropriate for pyelonephritis because of poor tissue penetration per FDA labeling, even if it seems microbiologically active in vitro for a lower-tract isolate [^1171fh9J] [^1151Cp6Y].

> If uncomplicated cystitis is caused by ESBL-producing Klebsiella, I need to check whether nitrofurantoin or TMP/SMX retain activity; both are preferred options for ESBL-E cystitis if susceptible, and single-dose aminoglycoside is an alternative when oral options are limited; carbapenems can work but should be avoided for simple cystitis if narrower active or single-dose options exist to preserve broader agents [^115gXGo1]. For uncomplicated cystitis due to CRE, I should confirm that IDSA 2024 lists nitrofurantoin, TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin as preferred options if susceptible, with alternatives including a single-dose aminoglycoside, colistin, or newer agents when necessary; however, I need to be careful with colistin given issues with resistance detection and its association with higher mortality in CRKP cohorts, so I would reserve it and favor oral or targeted novel agents when possible [^112CsNzk] [^115Tf8Bm].

> Turning to pyelonephritis or other complicated UTI due to susceptible Klebsiella, let me think about oral options with good renal parenchymal penetration. Fluoroquinolones or TMP/SMX are reasonable if the isolate is susceptible and the patient can tolerate them; otherwise, parenteral options such as third-generation cephalosporins or aminoglycosides can be used, with duration individualized by clinical response and severity, often within a 7–14 day framework for complicated disease as supported in CA-UTI duration guidance for analogous contexts [^116GR3iW] [^116RiYrc] [^116EXLaV]. I should double-check that nitrofurantoin remains off the table for pyelonephritis given its pharmacokinetics, even if susceptibility appears on the report [^1171fh9J].

> For ESBL-producing Klebsiella pyelonephritis or complicated UTI, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions with piperacillin-tazobactam. IDSA 2024 recommends TMP/SMX or fluoroquinolones as preferred if susceptible; if those are inactive or contraindicated, ertapenem, meropenem, or imipenem/cilastatin should be used, with step-down to active orals after clinical improvement and susceptibility confirmation; it also advises against relying on piperacillin-tazobactam in ESBL pyelonephritis/cUTI, particularly for infections outside the urinary tract, even if the lab reports susceptibility, due to risk of clinical failure in non-urinary sites and stewardship concerns [^116GR3iW] [^112qCGNZ] [^112T6Th6]. I should confirm early transition to oral therapy once the patient is stable and absorbable agents are active, to minimize IV days and reduce risks [^112T6Th6].

> For carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pyelonephritis or complicated UTI, I should verify that preferred agents include ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, or imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam, with cefiderocol as an alternative; aminoglycosides may be used if active, though nephrotoxicity necessitates careful monitoring; where applicable, FDA labeling supports cUTI indications for agents such as ceftazidime/avibactam [^115ivtWb] [^117Nsaet] [^111upvk9]. Hmm, wait a minute — should I include tigecycline or eravacycline for CRE UTI? No, I need to correct that impulse, because IDSA 2024 specifically advises against tetracycline derivatives for CRE urinary tract or bloodstream infections; they are reserved only as alternatives when beta-lactams are not active or tolerated, and even then not for UTI/BSI, so I will avoid them in this context [^111cWqF7].

> For catheter-associated UTI, I need to ensure source control and proper diagnostics. Let me first confirm that the catheter should be removed or replaced, and a urine culture should be obtained from the freshly placed catheter before antibiotics; treatment durations are typically 7 days with prompt response and extend to 10–14 days when response is delayed or the patient remains catheterized; in non-severely ill cases treated with levofloxacin, a 5-day course has support; I should also remember that pyuria accompanying catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria is not an indication for antibiotics, and prevention depends on catheter stewardship policies [^116gHYk5] [^116RiYrc] [^116EXLaV] [^111SqEwW] [^1112yxbn] [^115bL5j8]. If there is concern for urosepsis, the EAU recommends administering parenteral broad-spectrum antimicrobials promptly, ideally within the first hour, while adapting therapy to culture results as soon as possible; catheter biofilm biology further reinforces the need for device management to achieve microbiologic clearance [^117J5i6v] [^115EMcVZ] [^115uLR6i].

> I should consider special populations and toxicity risks now. In children with complicated UTI or those at higher resistance risk, empiric aminoglycosides or broad-spectrum cephalosporins are reasonable, with amikacin often retaining activity in prior ESBL-E exposure and early IV-to-oral transitions as clinically appropriate; repeated or prophylaxis-associated infections demand careful resistance assessment and narrowing when culture data allow [^1141U6vd]. I need to check renal function for aminoglycoside dosing and monitor for nephro- and ototoxicity per labeling, and I should be mindful of fluoroquinolone black-box warnings and reserve them for cases where benefits outweigh risks and susceptibility is present [^1128c6o4] [^1153i1uC].

> De-escalation is essential once susceptibilities return. Let me first confirm that by days 2–3 I should review cultures and narrow therapy: step down from a carbapenem to active oral TMP/SMX or a fluoroquinolone for ESBL pyelonephritis/cUTI when possible; for non-ESBL lower-tract infections, narrowing to nitrofurantoin or TMP/SMX is appropriate if the infection is strictly cystitis; in all cases, document reasons for any deviations, including intolerance or drug interactions [^116GR3iW] [^112T6Th6]. Hold on, I should also remember that in severe infections, especially with CRKP, appropriate initial therapy correlates with lower mortality, supporting early use of active agents and then de-escalation when safe [^114tYMvs] [^117Nsaet].

> Pulling the approach together, here is how I would operationalize this at the bedside. First, classify the syndrome and obtain cultures before antibiotics when feasible, replacing catheters when present; then risk-stratify for ESBL/CRE based on prior antibiotics and healthcare exposures; choose empiric therapy that reaches the infected site (avoid nitrofurantoin for pyelonephritis), and tailor as soon as susceptibilities return: for uncomplicated cystitis due to susceptible Klebsiella, use nitrofurantoin or TMP/SMX if active and avoid fosfomycin in Klebsiella; for ESBL pyelonephritis/cUTI, prefer TMP/SMX or fluoroquinolones if active, otherwise a carbapenem with step-down once stable; for CRE pyelonephritis/cUTI, use ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, or imipenem/relebactam, or cefiderocol as alternative, reserving colistin and avoiding tetracycline derivatives for UTI/BSI; for CA-UTI, ensure device management and use 7 days if prompt response and 10–14 days if delayed, aligning with severity and culture data [^115gXGo1] [^116GR3iW] [^112qCGNZ] [^115ivtWb] [^117Nsaet] [^116gHYk5] [^116RiYrc].

---

The best treatment for Klebsiella UTI is **culture-guided therapy** [^1141TKM5], using **carbapenems for ESBL** [^116GR3iW] and **novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors for CRE** [^112CsNzk]. For uncomplicated cystitis, use nitrofurantoin or TMP/SMX if susceptible [^115gXGo1] [^1171fh9J]; **avoid fluoroquinolones unless no alternatives exist** [^1153i1uC]. For complicated infection or pyelonephritis, use carbapenems for ESBL producers and ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam [^115ivtWb], or imipenem/relebactam for CRE [^117Nsaet]; reserve cefiderocol or aminoglycosides when options are limited [^112CsNzk]. Always obtain cultures before starting antibiotics, tailor therapy to susceptibilities, and use the narrowest effective agent to limit resistance [^114dEX5z] [^111xwYMR].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

Always obtain **urine cultures** with susceptibility testing before starting antibiotics [^1141TKM5] to guide targeted therapy and reduce resistance [^116zKYCF]. Obtain **blood cultures** for patients with systemic symptoms or suspected urosepsis [^114dEX5z].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should be guided by **local resistance patterns**, patient-specific factors, and illness severity:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Uncomplicated cystitis | - Nitrofurantoin [^1171fh9J] <br/> - TMP/SMX (if susceptible) [^115gXGo1] <br/> - Fosfomycin (limited data for Klebsiella) [^115gXGo1] |
| Complicated UTI or pyelonephritis | - Carbapenems (ertapenem, meropenem, imipenem/cilastatin) for ESBL-producing Klebsiella [^116GR3iW] |
| Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella (CRE) | - Ceftazidime/avibactam [^111upvk9] <br/> - Meropenem/vaborbactam [^115ivtWb] <br/> - Imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam [^117Nsaet] <br/> - Cefiderocol (alternative) [^112CsNzk] |

---

## Definitive antibiotic therapy

Definitive therapy should be **tailored to culture and susceptibility results**:

- **ESBL-producing Klebsiella**: Carbapenems (ertapenem, meropenem, imipenem/cilastatin) are preferred.

- **Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella (CRE)**: Preferred options include ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, or imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam [^115ivtWb] [^117Nsaet]. Cefiderocol is an alternative option [^112CsNzk].

- **Uncomplicated cystitis**: Nitrofurantoin or TMP/SMX if susceptible [^1171fh9J]. Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) are alternatives but should be used cautiously due to resistance and adverse effects [^115gXGo1] [^1153i1uC].

---

## Duration of therapy

- **Uncomplicated cystitis**: 5–7 days.

- **Complicated UTI or pyelonephritis**: 10–14 days.

- **Catheter-associated UTI**: 7 days if prompt clinical response [^116RiYrc]; 10–14 days if delayed response [^116EXLaV].

---

## Adjunctive measures

Adjunctive measures focus on catheter management, supportive care, and infection control. Remove or replace **indwelling catheters** when possible to reduce biofilm formation and recurrence [^115uLR6i]; ensure adequate hydration and provide analgesia; and implement strict infection control measures to prevent nosocomial transmission [^115bL5j8].

---

## Emerging therapies and novel antibiotics

Several novel antibiotics are under investigation or recently approved for multidrug-resistant Klebsiella infections:

- **Cefiderocol**: A siderophore cephalosporin effective against carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella [^112CsNzk].

- **Imipenem/relebactam**: Effective against carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales [^117Nsaet].

- **Meropenem/vaborbactam**: Effective against KPC-producing Klebsiella [^115ivtWb].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

Appropriate initial antibiotic therapy significantly improves **clinical outcomes** and reduces mortality in Klebsiella UTIs. Recurrence is **common**, particularly in complicated UTIs or those associated with indwelling catheters; biofilm formation on catheters significantly increases recurrence risk [^115uLR6i].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing treatment choice

Treatment choices should reflect patient-specific factors, including **allergies, contraindications, and drug-drug interactions** [^111xwYMR]. Comorbidities such as diabetes, immunosuppression, or structural urinary abnormalities may necessitate broader-spectrum antibiotics and longer treatment durations. In pregnancy, avoid fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines; consider beta-lactams or nitrofurantoin (except near term).

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention strategies emphasize **antibiotic stewardship**, infection control, and patient education. Implement stewardship programs to curb inappropriate antibiotic use and resistance, maintain strict adherence to infection control practices (including hand hygiene and catheter management), and educate patients on hygiene, hydration, and adherence to prescribed antibiotic regimens [^114yGBJH].

---

The optimal treatment for Klebsiella UTI depends on the infection's complexity and resistance profile. For uncomplicated cystitis, nitrofurantoin or TMP/SMX are preferred if susceptible. For complicated or resistant infections, carbapenems or novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors are recommended. Therapy should be **guided by culture results**, patient factors, and **local resistance patterns** [^113UcpBW].

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113UcpBW]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

Our findings detail the global high level resistance to some of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for children's primary care, which could result in several drugs becoming ineffective first line treatments in many countries. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID), recommends that an antibiotic should be selected for first-line empirical treatment of urinary tract infection only if the local prevalence of resistance is less than 20%. According to these guidelines, our review suggests that ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, and trimethoprim are no longer suitable first-line treatment options for urinary tract infections in many OECD countries. As a result, many guidelines, such as those published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), might need updating.

In non-OECD countries, resistance to all first-line antibiotics specified for urinary tract infections was in excess of 20% (appendix 5), suggesting that choices of first-line treatment might need to be re-evaluated in less well-developed countries. Our results also support the need for prescribing guidelines to reflect patterns of local resistance and indicate that, for many areas, nitrofurantoin might be the most appropriate first-line treatment for lower urinary tract infection. Nonetheless, care is needed because ruling out the use of some first-line antibiotics could lead clinicians to prescribe broad spectrum second-line antibiotics, such as co-amoxiclav.

### Review of catheter-associated urinary tract infections and urinary tract models [^115uLR6i]. Journal of Healthcare Engineering (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CA-UTI):

- **Definition**: CA-UTI is a common hospital-acquired infection characterized by various medical complications such as catheter encrustation, bladder stones, septicemia, endotoxic shock, and pyelonephritis.

- **Pathophysiology**: Colonization of the urinary catheter and/or uroepithelial cells, evasion of host defenses, replication, and damage to host cells by uropathogens are involved in the development of CA-UTI. Common microbiological agents include *E. coli, P. mirabilis, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, K. pneumoniae, P. vulgaris, C. freundii, Providentia rettgeri*, and *C. albicans*.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include fever, urethritis, cystitis, acute pyelonephritis, renal scarring, calculus formation, and bacteremia. Disease progression may lead to urosepsis and death.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Several studies report an association between catheter-associated infection, increased mortality, and prolonged length of stay in acute care facilities.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: meta-analysis [^113rJdnX]. BMJ (2013). High credibility.

We followed the PRISMA guidelines for conducting and reporting meta-analyses. Two separate queries were performed:

- **Search strategy and selection criteria**: A systematic review of randomized and non-randomized controlled trials was conducted. Trials compared antibiotic prophylaxis with a placebo or control group at the time of removal of a transurethral urinary catheter, tracking the occurrence of symptomatic urinary tract infections in the subsequent period. The medical literature was searched in PubMed from 1947 to November 2012 using the terms: urinary catheter, removal, prophylaxis, antibiotic prophylaxis, randomized, and trial. Conference abstracts from 2006–2012 from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) annual meeting, Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC), Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) annual meeting, and the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) were evaluated. Additionally, Google was used to search for the same terms.

A medical librarian created a systematic search strategy that included a combination of standardized index terms and straight keywords. This strategy was run in Embase, Scopus, the Cochrane Library (including CENTRAL), and clinicaltrials.gov, in addition to PubMed. Reference lists of all potentially relevant studies were reviewed to identify additional research data. Non-English language and unpublished studies were included.

### Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria in urinary tract infections in Ethiopia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114DnMrZ]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infections worldwide, particularly in developing countries. This infection is observed in all age groups and affects both sexes, impacting more than 150 million people and resulting in over $6 billion in healthcare costs per year globally. The majority of UTIs are caused by bacteria, especially gram-negative bacteria. Among these, Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the most common, followed by Proteus species, Klebsiella species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter species, and Citrobacter species. These bacteria are typically transferred from the gastrointestinal tract to the urethral opening, where they begin to multiply, causing infection in any part of the urinary system, including the urethra, bladder, ureters, and kidneys.

Clinically, UTIs are classified as uncomplicated or complicated. Uncomplicated infections can affect healthy individuals who have no structural or functional abnormalities in the renal system. Conversely, complicated infections occur in patients with such abnormalities. Bacterial UTIs occur in both the community and, more commonly, hospital settings, accounting for 40% of all nosocomial infections. As 15–25% of hospitalized patients use urinary catheters, the most common nosocomial UTI is catheter-associated UTI, which constitutes 75–80% of all nosocomial urinary infections and 30–40% of all hospital-acquired infections.

In developing countries, the empirical management of UTI may contribute to emerging antimicrobial resistance patterns.

Klebsiella pneumoniae causes urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, and septicemia in susceptible individuals. Strains of Klebsiella frequently produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, and infections with these strains can lead to relatively high mortality rates (approximately 15%). Other virulence factors include the production of an antiphagocytic capsule and outer membrane lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which mediates serum resistance, as well as fimbriae on the surface of the bacteria.

Type 1 fimbriae mediate adherence to many types of epithelial cells and may facilitate adherence of the bacteria to the bladder epithelium. Type 3 fimbriae can bind in vitro to the extracellular matrix of urinary and respiratory tissues, suggesting that they mediate binding to damaged epithelial surfaces. In addition, type 3 fimbriae are required for biofilm formation by Klebsiella pneumoniae on plastics and human extracellular matrix; thus, they may facilitate the formation of treatment-resistant biofilm on indwelling plastic devices, such as catheters and endotracheal tubes. The presence of these devices may cause tissue damage, allowing Klebsiella to grow as a biofilm on exposed tissue basement membrane components.

Though in vivo biofilm growth may be an important step in the infection process, little is known about the genetic factors required for biofilm formation by Klebsiella pneumoniae. Thus, we performed signature-tagged mutagenesis to identify factors produced by K. pneumoniae strain 43816 that are required for biofilm formation. We identified mutations in the cps cap.

### Resistance profiles of urinary tract infections in general practice — an observational study [^116gqoyM]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Guideline recommendations on therapy in urinary tract infections are based on antibiotic resistance rates. Due to a lack of surveillance data, little is known about resistance rates in uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in general practice in Germany. In a prospective observational study, urine cultures of all women presenting with urinary tract infections in general practice were analyzed. Resistance rates against antibiotics recommended in German guidelines on UTI are presented.

- **Methods**: In a prospective, multi-center observational study, general practitioners included all female patients aged ≥ 18 years with clinically suspected urinary tract infection. Only patients receiving antibiotic therapy within the last two weeks were excluded.

- **Results**: Forty practices recruited 191 female patients (mean age 52 years; range 18–96) with urinary tract infections. The main causative agent was Escherichia coli (79%), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (14%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.3%). Susceptibility of E. coli as the main causative agent was highest against fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin, with low resistance rates of 4.5% and 2.2%, respectively. In 17.5%, E. coli was resistant to trimethoprim and in 8.5% to ciprofloxacin.

- **Conclusions**: Resistance rates of uropathogens from unselected patients in general practice differ from routinely collected laboratory data. These results can have an impact on antibiotic prescribing and treatment recommendations.

### Pivmecillinam for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection: New efficacy analysis [^112BZxh4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

In April 2024 — over 40 years after its first approval in Europe — pivmecillinam received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection (uUTI) in women aged ≥ 18 years, caused by susceptible isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Herein, we describe the reanalysis from previously published clinical trials, conducted in accordance with FDA efficacy criteria, which formed the basis for this regulatory approval.

- **Methods**: Of 14 studies reviewed, three randomized, controlled trials offered suitable subject-level data from patients with uUTI treated with 185 mg pivmecillinam three times daily for 3–7 days. Efficacy endpoints for reanalysis were rates of overall (composite clinical and microbiological), clinical, and microbiological response in the microbiological intention-to-treat population (urine culture ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units/mL; ≤ 2 microorganism species; no baseline pathogen nonsusceptible to active comparator).

- **Results**: Across the three primary studies, overall success rates with pivmecillinam at the test of cure (Days 7–15) were 62.0%-71.7% (clinical success, 63.5%-82.7%; microbiological success, 74.3%-86.9%). Overall success was higher for pivmecillinam than for placebo (95% confidence interval for the difference, 41.2–62.0) or ibuprofen (31.2–56.5) and similar to cephalexin (-15.6 to 7.4). Response to pivmecillinam was demonstrated in uUTIs caused by Enterobacterales, including E. coli, P. mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, as well as gram-positive bacteria.

### Current antibiotic resistance patterns of rare uropathogens: Survey from Central European Urology Department 2011–2019 [^116ZLneU]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

With approximately 150–250 million cases occurring globally per year, urinary tract infections (UTIs) represent some of the most common infectious diseases in humans. Gram-negative enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Proteus spp. are their most common causative agents. UTIs occur more frequently among women than in men: 50% of females will experience at least one UTI in their lifetime. Recurrences are common, and besides associated morbidity, UTIs put pressure on healthcare systems too. While the cost of treating a single UTI episode is insignificant, their frequent incidence means they consume a non-negligible part of the healthcare budget. In France alone, the expense for adult female UTIs amounted to 58 million euros in 2012. Complicated UTIs are even more costly: one episode of a complicated UTI costs between 4028 and 7740 euros, depending on the healthcare system.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a major concern threatening many advances in medicine in the twenty-first century. Uropathogenic microorganisms are no exception to this: rates of AMR among Enterobacteriaceae are increasing globally, albeit with temporal and spatial differences. Antibiotic consumption is a primary driver for the spread of AMR, as evidenced on local and country levels. For instance, southern European states exhibit higher AMR rates than northern ones. Of note, four top antibiotic prescribers in Europe — Greece, Cyprus, France, and Italy — belong to southern European countries.

International guidelines for UTI treatment are freely available.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^115fihMp]. Journal of clinical microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are opportunistic infections, whereby pathogens ascend from colonizing niches — the gut, perineum, and/or vagina — into the urinary tract. Escherichia coli is the most common agent of UTIs, causing 65%–75% of infections overall. Beyond E. coli, the taxonomic landscape of UTIs is incredibly diverse. For uncomplicated infections, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Klebsiella pneumoniae are also commonly observed.

In the setting of complicated UTIs (cUTIs), when host comorbidities present added opportunities for infection, a broad array of bacteria is observed, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Enterobacterales (Proteus, Serratia, and Enterobacter spp.), and Enterococcus spp. For some microorganisms, the diagnostic significance in urine is not always clear and may be context-dependent, including Staphylococcus aureus and Candida spp. The diagnostic status quo is likewise complicated by several rare but well-established uropathogens with more fastidious growth characteristics, and a growing list of species whose status as commensal-versus-pathogen is not always clear. The diagnostic challenge posed by such emerging uropathogens is detailed further below.

Against this complex background, traditional diagnostic cultures — together with urinalysis — represent staples of care. At the same time, there is a growing desire for UTI diagnostics that leverage new technology for more sensitive, specific, or rapid results. Of particular interest are tools that reduce the latency between initial, empiric UTI management and targeted therapy, based on species identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility.

### Investigating the impact of the definition of previous antibiotic exposure related to isolation of extended spectrum β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae [^111GNyyk]. American Journal of Infection Control (2011). Low credibility.

Previous antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolation, but the optimal definition of previous antibiotic exposure remains unclear.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective, case-control study comparing 88 patients with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (cases) and 88 patients with non-ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (controls). Three previous antibiotic exposure definitions were analyzed, including durations of 30, 60, and 90 days prior to organism isolation.

- **Results**: The mean cohort age was 63.6 ± 16.9 years, 43% were male, and 86% were black. In bivariate analysis, third-generation cephalosporins and cefepime were associated with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolation, and the odds ratios (OR) were significant regardless of previous antibiotic exposure definition. However, for fluoroquinolones and ampicillin/sulbactam, the ORs varied as a function of previous antibiotic exposure definition. In multivariate analysis, third-generation cephalosporin usage was a risk factor for ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolation, whereas ampicillin/sulbactam usage was protective against these organisms, regardless of the time frame analyzed. Other independent predictors of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae included nursing home residence (OR, 9.30 [95% confidence interval: 3.69–23.43]) and hemodialysis (OR, 13.60 [95% confidence interval: 4.29–43.17]).

- **Conclusion**: Prior use of third-generation cephalosporins, nursing home residence, and hemodialysis were independent risk factors for isolation of an ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae.

### Current prescribing practices and guideline concordance for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1153i1uC]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections in the United States. Clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line antibiotic treatments and discourage the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents. The US Food and Drug Administration released several black box warnings about fluoroquinolones over the past decade owing to antibiotic resistance and a high burden of adverse events. Historically, uncomplicated urinary tract infections have high rates of guideline-discordant treatment, with past studies noting substantial use of fluoroquinolones, directly contradicting clinical practice guidelines.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to assess the concordance of physician prescribing practices with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women and identify patient and physician predictors of guideline concordance.

- **Study design**: A retrospective observational secondary analysis was conducted using a series of cross-sectional data extracted from the IQVIA (Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania) National Disease and Therapeutic Index from 2015 to 2019. An estimated 44.9 million women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections, aged 18 to 75 years, were treated as outpatients. This population was selected to lack relevant comorbidities or urological abnormalities so that it matched the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines.

### Hospital-acquired infections in the neonatal intensive care unit — klebsiella pneumoniae [^111UkJpA]. Seminars in Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is medically the most important organism of the Klebsiella species. It is responsible for a significant proportion of hospital-acquired infections including septicemias, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and soft tissue infections, especially in immunocompromised hosts such as neonates. The hands of healthcare workers and the gastrointestinal tracts of hospitalized infants serve as reservoirs for the transmission of the organism and are responsible for multiple hospital outbreaks.

In recent years, there has been an increase in the incidence of outbreaks caused by multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae organisms or the extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing K. pneumoniae. The problems associated with extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms include difficulties in accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing, limited treatment options, and increased morbidity and perhaps mortality. Hence, prevention through the implementation of strict infection control guidelines, effective hand washing, and judicious use of antimicrobials such as third-generation cephalosporins is important to effectively reduce the morbidity associated with this infection.

### Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria in urinary tract infections in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114vQM8j]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

In the systematic review and meta-analysis, the predominant ESBL-producing pathogens were *Klebsiella* spp. and *E. coli*, with pooled prevalence estimates of 43.91% and 31.14%, respectively. Similarly, the predominant carbapenemase producer was *Klebsiella* spp. (17.78%), followed by *E. coli* (11.42%). These findings are consistent with other reported systematic reviews of ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria in Ethiopia. They are also comparable to meta-analyses conducted on pediatric UTIs globally, as well as in Thailand, Nepal, India, Turkey, and Italy, which reported that *K. pneumoniae* and *E. coli* were the predominant ESBL-producing pathogens among Gram-negative bacteria in urine.

*Klebsiella* spp., particularly *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, poses a significant public health threat as a common, severe MDR pathogen in the ESKAPE group, which also includes *Enterococcus*, *S. aureus*, *A. baumannii*, *P. aeruginosa*, and *Enterobacter* species. Currently, these pathogens are common in both developed and developing countries. Cephalosporins and carbapenems, vital for treating Gram-negative bacterial infections, including those from *Klebsiella* spp. and *E. coli*, have lost efficacy due to widespread resistance genes like ESBLs and carbapenemases. The predominance of ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing *Klebsiella* spp. and *E. coli* in this systematic review and meta-analysis, and many other systematic reviews, may be because these pathogens are mostly multidrug resistant due to the production of these enzymes. These pathogens are ubiquitous and considered a "One Health" concern.

### Furadantin [^1151Cp6Y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Furadantin is indicated in adults and pediatric patients 1 month of age and older for the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of *Escherichia coli*, *Enterococcus* species, *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Klebsiella* species, and *Enterobacter* species.

- **Limitations of use**: Furadantin is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscesses [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

- **Usage**: To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Furadantin and other antibacterial drugs, Furadantin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Furadantin is a nitrofuran antibacterial indicated in adults and pediatric patients 1 month of age and older for the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by susceptible bacteria.

- **Limitations of use**: Furadantin is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscesses.

### Nitrofurantoin [^1171fh9J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Nitrofurantoin capsules (macrocrystals) are specifically indicated for the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by susceptible strains of Escherichia coli, Enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and certain strains of Klebsiella and Enterobacter species. However, nitrofurantoin is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscesses.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of nitrofurantoin and other antibacterial drugs, nitrofurantoin should be used only to treat or prevent infections confirmed or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. Culture and susceptibility information should be considered when available to select or modify antibacterial therapy. In their absence, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may guide the empiric selection of therapy.

Nitrofurantoins lack the broader tissue distribution of other agents approved for urinary tract infections. Consequently, many patients treated with nitrofurantoin capsules (macrocrystals) may experience persistence or recurrence of bacteriuria. Urine specimens for culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained before and after completing therapy. If bacteriuria persists or recurs after treatment with nitrofurantoin, other therapeutic agents with broader tissue distribution should be selected.

### International and regional spread of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in Europe [^116qLXRG]. Nature Communications (2024). Low credibility.

The COMBACTE consortium pursues the prevention and treatment of antibiotic-resistant-associated infections through four main projects. Among them, COMBACTE-CARE seeks to support the development of new treatment options, together with the analysis of clinical and epidemiological datasets in all European member states and affiliated countries. As part of this, the European prospective cohort study on Enterobacterales showing resistance to carbapenems (EURECA) aimed to understand how the patients across Europe are infected and currently treated for Enterobacterales-associated infections, but also which subgroups of patients responded well to different antibiotic treatments. Local laboratories submitted carbapenem non-susceptible isolates to EURECA from May 2016 to November 2018 from cohorts of patients with bacterial infections in Southern European countries. Our task was to characterize and identify circulating clones of CRKP by analyzing 687 genomes. In addition, we contextualized the spread of CRKP for a broader population view by comparing our data to the previous EuSCAPE study, which included the carbapenem-susceptible and non-susceptible isolates during the 2013–2014 sample from a wider range of European countries.

### Colistin resistance in carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae: Laboratory detection and impact on mortality [^115Tf8Bm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Polymyxins, including colistin, are an important "last-line" treatment for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKp). The increasing use of colistin has led to resistance to this cationic antimicrobial peptide.

- **Methods**: A cohort nested within the Consortium on Resistance against Carbapenems in Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRACKLE) was constructed of patients with infection or colonization with CRKp isolates tested for colistin susceptibility during the study period of December 2011 to October 2014. Reference colistin resistance determination as performed by broth macrodilution was compared to results from clinical microbiology laboratories (Etest) and to polymyxin resistance testing. Each patient was included once, at the time of their first colistin-tested CRKp-positive culture. Time to 30-day in-hospital all-cause mortality was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard modeling.

- **Results**: In 246 patients with CRKp, 13% possessed ColR CRKp. ColR was underestimated by Etest (very major error rate = 35%, major error rate = 0.4%). A variety of rep-PCR strain types were encountered in both the ColS and the ColR groups. Carbapenem resistance was mediated primarily by blaKPC-2 (46%) and blaKPC-3 (50%). ColR was associated with increased hazard for in-hospital mortality (aHR 3.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.73–6.57; P < .001). The plasmid-associated ColR genes, mcr-1 and mcr-2 were not detected in any of the ColR CRKp.

- **Conclusions**: In this cohort, 13% of patients with CRKp presented with ColR CRKp. The apparent polyclonal nature of the isolates highlights the complexity of colistin resistance.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: A review by the European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases [^1141U6vd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). High credibility.

Common uropathogens in children with significant urologic abnormalities, including post-surgery and instrumentation, are Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp., and Staphylococcus aureus. To cover these, if intravenous antibiotics are needed, an aminoglycoside or broad-spectrum cephalosporin is recommended. A child's individual history guides whether to cover rarer S. aureus or more indolent Enterococcus spp. empirically. Where multiple antibiotics have previously been used, assessment of the likelihood of resistance is part of management (see below).

Multiple recurrent urinary tract infections (reUTIs), defined by two or more UTIs caused by different organisms, are a risk for resistant and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. Although reUTIs might occur without anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, other risk factors include vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), underlying neurological conditions, prolonged hospitalization, and UTI prophylaxis. Girls are at higher risk than boys. If on prophylaxis, a different treatment antibiotic is required due to breakthrough infections. For children at high risk of resistance, including suspected extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E), empiric oral options include nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, quinolones, and fosfomycin. Empirical IV options for children at moderate risk of resistance but who have never cultured ESBL-E include gentamicin and quinolones. If there has been previous ESBL-E or the clinical risk is higher, intravenous amikacin retains high susceptibility to uropathogens, concentrates well in urine, and can avoid the use of broad-spectrum beta-lactam and carbapenem antibiotics. Most gentamicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae exhibit cross-resistance.

### Finding order in the chaos: Outstanding questions in Klebsiella pneumoniae pathogenesis [^1146dN6q]. Infection and Immunity (2021). Low credibility.

Klebsiella spp. are Gram-negative, nonmotile, rod-shaped bacteria that can thrive in a wide range of habitats. In humans, Klebsiella spp. can be found as commensals of the gastrointestinal tract, mouth, and nasopharynx. The Klebsiella genus contains over a dozen species, many of which cause opportunistic infections in humans. The species complex, including K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, and K. aerogenes, causes the highest burden of disease in humans. Other species of Klebsiella, such as K. michiganensis and K. variicola, have historically been found less frequently during human infections; however, this appears to be changing. Infections caused by Klebsiella spp. include pneumonia, liver abscesses, bacteremia, soft tissue infections, urinary tract infections (UTIs), endophthalmitis, and meningitis. The reasons why Klebsiella spp. cause more frequent infections compared to other Gram-negative opportunistic pathogens are unclear. Possibilities include the bacteria's ability to withstand starvation, naturally resist antibiotics, outcompete other bacteria, readily exchange DNA with other members of the human microbiome, and acquire mobile genetic elements encoding a wide range of antibiotic resistance and virulence-enhancing genes.

Despite being one of the world's most common nosocomial pathogens, Klebsiella spp. display a population structure characterized by both abundant genetic diversity and the presence of a relatively small number of highly successful clonal genetic lineages. In contrast to other nosocomial pathogens, the most problematic Klebsiella clones (in terms of disease severity) are clearly divided into two phenotypically distinct groups that are characterized by either hypervirulence or multidrug resistance.

### Lower urinary pathogens: Do more pathogenic bacteria increase the risk of pyelonephritis [^117BssJN]? American Journal of Perinatology (2022). Low credibility.

Outside of pregnancy, urinary pathogens such as Proteus and Klebsiella are considered more pathogenic than E. coli. During pregnancy, the implications of lower urinary tract infection (LUTI) with more pathogenic bacteria are unclear. Thus, we sought to compare the risk of progression from LUTI to pyelonephritis among women infected with these more pathogenic urinary bacteria to those infected with E. coli.

- **Study design**: Retrospective cohort of pregnant women with LUTI at a single tertiary center from July 2013 to May 2019. Pathogenic infections (PI) were defined as asymptomatic bacteriuria or acute cystitis urinary cultures positive for Proteus, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus, or Raoultella species. Demographic, infectious, antepartum, and postpartum data were abstracted. Pregnant women with PI were compared with those with E. coli. The primary outcome was progression to pyelonephritis. Secondary outcomes included pyelonephritis length of stay (LOS) > 6 days, preterm birth (PTB), low birthweight (LBW), and measures of pyelonephritis-related morbidity.

- **Results**: Of 686 pregnant women with LUTIs, 313 had urine cultures growing either PI or E. coli, with 59 (12%) growing PI and 254 (54%) growing E. coli. Women with PI were more likely to be African American, have chronic hypertension, and have a history of preeclampsia. The primary species causing PI were Klebsiella (n = 29) and Proteus (n = 11). PI were not more likely to progress to pyelonephritis than E. coli LUTIs (10.9% vs. 14.5%; p = 0.67). Median LOS for pyelonephritis and other related metrics were similar.

### Optimal antibiotics at hospital discharge for children with urinary tract infection [^115fZRu5]. Hospital Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship at hospital discharge is an area of need. We assessed the rate of optimal antibiotic prescriptions at hospital discharge based on urine culture and susceptibility data for children diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI).

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was conducted on patients ≤ 18 years of age who were admitted to a general pediatrics service at a freestanding children's hospital during 2017 with a UTI diagnosis and received an antibiotic prescription at discharge. Optimal antibiotics at hospital discharge were determined by evaluating if the cultured urinary pathogen was susceptible to the prescribed antibiotic and if the antibiotic was the narrowest-spectrum option available. Secondary objectives included the assessment of antibiotic dosing accuracy and the description of antibiotic treatment duration.

- **Results**: A total of 78 cases were included. Sixty-eight (83%) cases were caused by cefazolin-susceptible Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species. Thirty-one (40%) cases had a discharge antibiotic prescription that was determined to be optimal. Of the 47 (60%) cases that were suboptimal, 44 (94%) were considered to be excessively broad spectrum. In 3 (6%) cases, the causative organism was nonsusceptible to the prescribed antibiotic. Ten (13%) discharge antibiotic prescriptions had inaccurate dosing and/or frequency.

- **Conclusions**: Missed opportunities for narrow-spectrum antibiotic selection at hospital discharge for pediatric UTIs frequently occurred. Higher-generation cephalosporins were often inappropriately chosen over narrower-spectrum options.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: A review by the European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases [^116AYxK5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Low credibility.

In neonates and infants under two months, common pathogens include E. coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp. Enterobacter spp., group B streptococcus, and Enterococcus spp. In preterm infants, hematogenous transmission is more prevalent, with CoNS and Candida spp. being causative pathogens. Empirical intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin are recommended for neonatal urinary tract infections by the World Health Organization. Resistance should be considered when there is a maternal history of antibiotics during pregnancy or when maternal ESBL-E is cultured. Empirical treatment should be based on maternal isolates; however, if these are inaccessible, gentamicin is usually sufficient. For prolonged stays in neonatal intensive care, resistant hospital pathogens, including MRSA, should be considered, with empirical vancomycin if the infant is severely unwell.

Once culture results are available, empiric antibiotics can be targeted and potentially narrowed.

- **Antibiotic duration and timing of IV to oral switch**: For most children with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), there is not enough evidence to support varying from practice and expert opinion, recommending a total of 10–14 days (GRADE D). When IV antibiotics are started, recommended IV durations vary between ≤ 3 days and ≤ 7 days depending on the cUTI subgroup and presence of bacteremia, with an early switch when the child is afebrile and clinically well (GRADES C and D). Longer total durations (up to 21 days) may be needed for renal abscesses or nephronia, and renal ultrasound is recommended after 14 days to determine progress and ultimate antibiotic duration (GRADE B). For frequently relapsing UTIs with the same organism, further investigation and tailored management are recommended.

### Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase, Canada [^112F1LEJ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Carbapenems are used to treat life-threatening infections caused by extremely drug-resistant gram-negative pathogens; these drugs represent the last line of defense in the antimicrobial drug armamentarium against serious or invasive infections. The rapid global spread of Klebsiella pneumoniae that produces K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), especially in the northeastern United States (e.g. New York State), is of major concern. KPC β-lactamases belong to the family of serine carbapenemases and are usually found in K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. KPC hydrolyzes β-lactam agents, thereby reducing their efficacy. KPC activity has been reported, albeit less frequently, in other Enterobacteriaceae (K. oxytoca, Enterobacter spp. Salmonella spp. Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia spp.) as well as in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The bla KPC genes have been identified on conjugative plasmids and pose an infection control problem because plasmids could theoretically be transmitted from one species to another. The few therapeutic options for treating infections caused by organisms containing these β-lactamases are aminoglycosides, glycylcyclines, polymyxins, or combinations. A major concern is that routine susceptibility testing methods based on existing breakpoints can falsely identify KPC producers as susceptible to carbapenems. Such results pose the potential risk for increased illness and death, longer hospital stays, and nosocomial spread of infection.

In 2008, the Public Health Laboratory in Toronto received clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae from urine and other sources, indicating the spread of KPC producers within Canada.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically concerning the management of Enterobacterales infections and ESBL-producing strains, the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend administering meropenem, imipenem/cilastatin, or ertapenem as preferred options for treating infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales. Administer meropenem or imipenem/cilastatin as the preferred carbapenem in critically ill patients and/or patients experiencing hypoalbuminemia. Consider transitioning to oral TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin after an appropriate clinical response is achieved, assuming susceptibility is demonstrated.

### The influence of urinary pH on antibiotic efficacy against bacterial uropathogens [^11388Mjz]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

To determine the effects of pH on the activity of clinically relevant antibiotics against bacterial uropathogens, numerous factors affect antibiotic efficacy within the urinary tract, including pH. Human urine can substantially vary from acidic (pH 4.5) to alkaline (pH 8) conditions and can be easily clinically manipulated. It would be a great advantage to better understand the role of pH in antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infections.

- **Materials and methods**: This in vitro study investigated the activity of 24 widely used antimicrobial agents against bacterial strains comprising six major uropathogenic species (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) over the range of pH 5–8. Standard disk-diffusion and broth-microdilution assays were used. One-way analysis of variance was applied to determine significance (P < .05).

- **Results**: For 18 of the 24 agents, pH was shown to play a significant role in overall inhibitory activity. Although most agents behaved similarly across most or all of the uropathogens tested, several only showed pH-dependent effects against certain organisms. The fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole, aminoglycosides, and macrolides all functioned optimally at alkaline pH. In contrast, the tetracyclines, nitrofurantoin, and many of the β-lactams tested exhibited their highest activity under more acidic conditions. Sulfamethoxazole, oxacillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, vancomycin, imipenem, and clindamycin were largely unaffected by pH.

### Is it time to reconsider initial antibiotic treatment strategies for severe urinary tract infections in Europe [^112WEVzq]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Until recently, most reported cases of bacteraemia caused by multidrug-resistant strains of Enterobacteriacae producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in Europe have been nosocomial in origin. However, increasing numbers of reports of community-acquired bacteraemia and urinary tract infection caused by ESBL-producing microorganisms suggest that the geographical origin of patients should be taken into account as a risk factor for possible ESBL production. Early identification of patients at high risk of infection with ESBL-producing microorganisms, based on their geographical origin and travel history, should help to optimize initial antibiotic treatment strategies for severe urinary tract infections in Europe.

### Infectious diseases society of America 2024 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections [^112qCGNZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, specifically concerning the management of Enterobacterales infections, ESBL-producing, the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend not changing or extending antibiotic therapy if there is clinical improvement with piperacillin/tazobactam initiated as empiric therapy for uncomplicated cystitis caused by an organism later identified as an extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales. Consider administering TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems rather than piperacillin/tazobactam for the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs, recognizing that the risk of clinical failure with piperacillin/tazobactam may be low. Avoid using piperacillin/tazobactam for the treatment of infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales, even if susceptibility to piperacillin/tazobactam is demonstrated.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^111ndMsp]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analyzed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infections and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infections; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infections and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infections as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Engineered reporter phages for detection of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, and Klebsiella in urine [^116zKYCF]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common community-acquired and healthcare-associated bacterial infections across all age groups and represent a major public health problem worldwide. The societal and economic burden of UTIs is substantial, as evidenced by their global prevalence of around 150 million cases per year and an estimated direct healthcare expenditure of over 6 billion dollars. Furthermore, UTIs aggravate the antimicrobial resistance crisis as they constitute a leading cause of antibiotic prescription, second only to respiratory tract infections. While uncomplicated UTIs generally present minimal morbidity, certain predisposing medical conditions (e.g. metabolic disorders, immunosuppression, and obstructive uropathy) can lead to life-threatening complications such as pyelonephritis and urosepsis.

The etiology of UTIs is complex, often polymicrobial, and can involve a plethora of bacterial species and certain fungi. Gram-negative bacteria, predominantly from the Enterobacteriaceae family, including Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., cause the majority of UTI cases, closely followed by Enterococcus faecalis as the major Gram-positive uropathogen. Due to this diverse etiology, rapid and accurate pathogen identification is of paramount importance to guarantee timely and effective therapy and to limit the preventive prescription of broad-range antibiotics.

The gold standard for diagnosing UTIs is the presence of symptoms combined with a positive urine culture. Diagnostic accuracy can be further improved by advanced methods, ensuring a more precise identification of the causative pathogens.

### Third-generation cephalosporin resistance and associated discordant antibiotic treatment in emergency department febrile urinary tract infections [^111XLY3x]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Third-generation cephalosporin-resistant (3GCR) Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis (EKP) are an increasingly common cause of community-onset urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the United States. The 3GCR antimicrobial resistance pattern in these Enterobacterales species is most commonly due to the production of extended-spectrum β-lactamases. This study aims to provide contemporary, emergency department (ED)-focused data on 3GCR-EKP UTI regional prevalence, presentation, antibiotic susceptibility, empiric treatment patterns, and outcomes.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all adults admitted with a febrile UTI at 21 Kaiser Permanente Northern California EDs between January 2017 and June 2019. Inclusion criteria included fever, an admitting diagnosis of UTI, pyelonephritis, or sepsis, and an ED urine culture with greater than 100,000 colony-forming units/mL of an EKP species. 3GCR was defined as in vitro resistance to ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, or both. 3GCR-EKP cases were compared with non-3GCR-EKP controls for demographics, comorbidities, presenting clinical features, urinary isolate antimicrobial susceptibility, treatment, and clinical outcomes. The primary outcome measure was the rate of discordant initial empiric antibiotic treatment (administered within 6 hours of ED arrival) when compared with antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay and 90-day mortality, adjusted for comorbidities and severity of illness.

- **Results**: There were 4,107 patients (median age

### Demeclocycline hydrochloride [^1171goXY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Demeclocycline HCl tablets are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms, when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug:

- **Escherichia coli**

- **Enterobacter aerogenes**

- **Shigella species**

- **Acinetobacter species**

- **Respiratory tract infections**: Caused by *Haemophilus influenzae*.

- **Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections**: Caused by *Klebsiella species*.

- **Upper respiratory infections**: Caused by *Streptococcus pneumoniae*.

- **Skin and skin structure infections**: Caused by *Staphylococcus aureus*. Note: Tetracyclines, including demeclocycline, are not the drugs of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.

When penicillin is contraindicated, tetracyclines, including demeclocycline HCl, serve as alternative drugs in the treatment of the following infections:

- **Uncomplicated urethritis in men**: Due to *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*.

- **Other uncomplicated gonococcal infections**.

- **Infections in women**: Caused by *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*.

- **Syphilis**: Caused by *Treponema pallidum* subspecies *pallidum*.

- **Yaws**: Caused by *Treponema pallidum* subspecies *pertenue*.

- **Listeriosis**: Due to *Listeria monocytogenes*.

- **Anthrax**: Due to *Bacillus anthracis*.

- **Vincent's infection**: Caused by *Fusobacterium fusiforme*.

- **Actinomycosis**: Caused by *Actinomyces israelii*.

- **Clostridial diseases**: Caused by *Clostridium* species.

In acute intestinal amebiasis, demeclocycline HCl may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In cases of severe acne, demeclocycline HCl may serve as helpful adjunctive therapy.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness, it is essential to use demeclocycline HCl as directed.

### Carbapenem resistance, initial antibiotic therapy, and mortality in Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114tYMvs]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2017). Low credibility.

Mortality associated with infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is higher than mortality due to carbapenem-sensitive pathogens. The objective is to examine the association between mortality from bacteremia caused by carbapenem-resistant (CRKP) and carbapenem-sensitive Klebsiella pneumoniae (CSKP) and to assess the impact of appropriate initial antibiotic therapy (IAT) on mortality.

- **Design**: Systematic review and meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Wiley Cochrane databases through August 31, 2016, for observational studies reporting mortality among adult patients with CRKP and CSKP bacteremia. Search terms were related to Klebsiella, carbapenem-resistance, and infection. Studies including fewer than 10 patients per group were excluded. A random-effects model and meta-regression were used to assess the relationship between carbapenem-resistance, appropriateness of IAT, and mortality.

- **Results**: Mortality was higher in patients who had CRKP bacteremia than in patients with CSKP bacteremia (15 studies; 1,019 CRKP and 1,148 CSKP patients; unadjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.8–2.6; I2 = 0). Mortality was lower in patients with appropriate IAT than in those without appropriate IAT (7 studies; 658 patients; unadjusted OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3–0.8; I2 = 36%). CRKP patients (11 studies; 1,326 patients; 8-year period) were consistently less likely to receive appropriate IAT (unadjusted OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3–0.7; I2 = 43%). Our meta-regression analysis identified a significant association between the difference in mortality rates based on appropriate IAT.

### Is piperacillin-tazobactam effective for the treatment of pyelonephritis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing organisms [^112wumTy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Limited data exist regarding the efficacy of piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) for the management of nonbacteremic pyelonephritis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicenter observational study comparing clinical outcomes of adults hospitalized with ESBL-producing pyelonephritis who were receiving TZP versus carbapenems, using an inverse probability of treatment weighted propensity score analysis. Patients were eligible for inclusion if all of the following criteria were met: (1) urine cultures growing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, or Proteus mirabilis at ≥ 50,000 colony-forming units/mL; (2) identification of an ESBL gene; (3) pyuria (≥ 10 white blood cells per high-powered field in the urine); and (4) dysuria and fever plus at least one of the following symptoms: emesis, rigors, hypotension, or flank pain.

- **Results**: There were 186 patients included in the propensity score-weighted cohort; 45 (24%) received TZP and 141 (76%) received a carbapenem. Of these 186 patients, 27% were admitted to the intensive care unit, 48% were immunocompromised, and 45% had underlying urologic abnormalities. There were no differences between the two groups in the proportion of patients (20% vs 25%) with recurrence of cystitis or pyelonephritis with the same ESBL-producing organism within 30 days (odds ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.31–1.81; P = 0.52). There were no differences in the resolution of clinical symptoms by Day 7 or in 30-day mortality. There was 1 (2%) patient in the TZP arm and 11 (8%).

### Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae: Risk factors for infection and impact of resistance on outcomes [^117GHzzE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The prevalence of antibiotic resistance among extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing *Escherichia coli* and *Klebsiella pneumoniae* has increased markedly in recent years. Thirty-three patients with infection due to ESBL-producing *E. coli* or *K. pneumoniae* (case patients) were compared with 66 matched controls. Total prior antibiotic use was the only independent risk factor for ESBL-producing *E. coli* or *K. pneumoniae* infection (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.18; p = 0.006). Case patients were treated with an effective antibiotic a median of 72 hours after infection was suspected, compared with a median of 11.5 hours for controls (p < 0.001).

ESBL-producing *E. coli* or *K. pneumoniae* infection was associated with a significantly longer duration of hospital stay and greater hospital charges (P = 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). Finally, many ESBL-producing *E. coli* and *K. pneumoniae* isolates were closely related. ESBL-producing *E. coli* and *K. pneumoniae* infections have a significant impact on several important clinical outcomes. Efforts to control outbreaks of infection with ESBL-producing *E. coli* and *K. pneumoniae* should emphasize judicious use of all antibiotics as well as barrier precautions to reduce spread.

### Combined comparative genomics and clinical modeling reveals plasmid-encoded genes are independently associated with Klebsiella infection [^112tbt8h]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex (hereby referred to as Klebsiella) is comprised of several species capable of causing severe infections, including bacteremia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). The member species are K. pneumoniae, K. variicola, K. quasipneumoniae, K. quasivariicola sp. nov., and K. africana, which are genetically distinct but often clinically indistinguishable. Klebsiella infections are a serious public health concern because they are a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections, can harbor multiple antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants, and can be hypervirulent.

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Antimicrobial resistant Klebsiella complicate disease treatment, leading to high mortality and healthcare costs, whereas hypervirulent Klebsiella cause unique clinical manifestations such as pyogenic liver abscess and meningitis.
- **Colonization and risk factors**: Klebsiella colonization is the primary risk factor for disease, where the gut acts as a reservoir for disease-causing Klebsiella strains. Patient variables, including comorbidities and baseline laboratory values, partially explain which patients will progress to infection.

Furthermore, the high relative abundance of Klebsiella colonizing the gut is associated with an increased risk of infection in colonized patients. For hypervirulent Klebsiella, the genes associated with their unique presentations have been well-defined by molecular epidemiology and experimental studies; however, little is known about the Klebsiella genes contained by non-hypervirulent strains, including multi-drug resistant ones.
