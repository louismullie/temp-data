## Question

Are there any other inflammatory conditions that can cause elevated ferritin levels?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which inflammatory conditions can cause elevated ferritin levels. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about ferritin's dual role as an iron store and an acute-phase reactant. Then, I should categorize the inflammatory conditions that raise ferritin by mechanism and provide concrete examples. Next, I will review how to distinguish inflammatory hyperferritinemia from iron overload using transferrin saturation and adjunct tests. After that, I should consider special scenarios like extreme hyperferritinemia and the "hyperferritinemic syndrome". Finally, I will synthesize practical thresholds and a diagnostic approach, making sure I verify guideline-based cutoffs and correct any misstatements as I go.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: ferritin reflects both iron stores and inflammation, so an elevated ferritin does not automatically mean iron overload; I need to check for concurrent inflammation and use transferrin saturation to help separate functional iron sequestration from true iron excess [^116kXCsb] [^117MhugH].

> I will now examine the major inflammatory categories that raise ferritin. Chronic systemic inflammatory diseases commonly elevate ferritin via cytokine-driven hepatic synthesis and reticuloendothelial sequestration; examples include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, adult-onset Still's disease, and inflammatory bowel disease, where ferritin often correlates with disease activity and can exceed 1000 ng/mL in active systemic disease [^1176MTXJ] [^113cYQm1] [^114afHPN].

> Wait, let me verify the hematology-oncology interface. Hematologic malignancies and macrophage activation syndromes frequently show marked hyperferritinemia; in particular, ferritin above 10,000 ng/mL is classically associated with HLH/MAS, though I should not jump to conclusions because adults with extreme ferritin often have other causes such as liver disease or transfusion-related iron overload, so I need to integrate cytopenias, triglycerides, fibrinogen, and soluble IL-2 receptor before labeling HLH/MAS [^115uUrMs] [^114FZow6] [^115FwLM4].

> Next, I should review infectious and critical illness contexts. Community-acquired pneumonia, sepsis, and severe COVID-19 frequently manifest hyperferritinemia as part of a cytokine storm phenotype; ferritin tracks with severity and has been used pragmatically to identify candidates for immunomodulation, but I need to ensure I correlate with clinical trajectory and other inflammatory markers before inferring causality or treatment response [^112NPXNc] [^113JLVsq] [^114UGX3d].

> Hold on, I should verify liver-related inflammatory states. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and other chronic liver diseases raise ferritin through combined inflammation and altered iron handling; emerging data suggest the hepcidin/ferritin ratio may help disentangle inflammation from dysregulated iron metabolism in NAFLD, but I need to acknowledge the evidence is still limited and heterogeneous [^112mrZJS] [^113GN9XZ].

> Let me consider metabolic and endocrine contributors. Metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance are linked to elevated ferritin even without frank iron overload; a recent consensus proposes criteria for "metabolic hyperferritinemia", reinforcing that inflammation and metabolic dysfunction can jointly drive ferritin up, so I should screen for diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia when ferritin is high and transferrin saturation is normal or low [^115dbWpq] [^1168XNba].

> I should double-check renal disease nuances. In chronic kidney disease, ferritin is often elevated due to inflammation and uremia-related oxidative stress; guidelines caution that a high ferritin with low transferrin saturation can reflect functional iron deficiency rather than iron overload, so I must interpret ferritin alongside CRP and TSAT when planning iron repletion strategies [^113KEDTR] [^111GW5aS].

> But wait, what if the ferritin is extremely high, say above 10,000 ng/mL? I initially thought this almost always means HLH/MAS; hmm, wait a minute, large adult series show that extreme hyperferritinemia is frequently due to transfusional iron, liver disease, or malignancy, so although ferritin above 10,000 ng/mL is sensitive for HLH/MAS, it is not specific in adults, and I should confirm with HLH-2004 criteria and disease-specific markers before committing to cytotoxic therapy [^114FZow6] [^113FLwbk] [^115FwLM4].

> Next, I should review the so-called hyperferritinemic syndromes. Adult-onset Still's disease, macrophage activation syndrome, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, and septic shock share very high ferritin and multi-organ dysfunction; mechanistic work implicates ferritin as a pathogenic mediator via NETs and innate immune amplification, and emerging evidence places severe COVID-19 within this spectrum, so persistent ferritin elevation in these contexts signals ongoing hyperinflammation and may guide immunomodulatory therapy [^115UdQ6h] [^111FXofC] [^116iBHbG].

> I need to ensure I am using the right diagnostic thresholds. In inflammatory conditions, ferritin below about 30 ng/mL still strongly suggests absolute iron deficiency, whereas ferritin between 30 and 100 ng/mL often reflects combined iron deficiency and anemia of inflammation, and ferritin above 100 ng/mL generally excludes absolute iron deficiency; however, I should confirm with transferrin saturation and, when uncertain, soluble transferrin receptor or bone marrow iron to avoid misclassification [^116X4Aw2] [^115wbRKn] [^114stzej].

> Hold on, I should verify a potential misstatement I almost made. I initially wrote that in inflammation, ferritin thresholds of less than 30 µg/L indicate absolute iron deficiency and 30–100 µg/L indicates functional iron deficiency; wait, let me verify and correct that — most guidance uses ferritin less than 30 µg/L to indicate absolute iron deficiency and ferritin less than 100 µg/L with low TSAT to indicate iron deficiency in the setting of inflammation, recognizing that functional iron deficiency reflects sequestration rather than depleted stores, so I should not conflate the two [^116X4Aw2] [^117MhugH].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. First, I should confirm inflammation with CRP or ESR; if CRP is elevated, I will interpret ferritin cautiously and pair it with transferrin saturation, and if iron deficiency is suspected with ferritin 30–100 ng/mL and TSAT less than 20 percent, I will treat as iron deficiency in the context of inflammation; if ferritin is above 100 ng/mL, I will prioritize evaluating for inflammatory drivers, liver disease, malignancy, or metabolic syndrome rather than assuming iron overload, reserving genetic testing or quantitative iron imaging for cases with elevated TSAT or clinical suspicion of hemochromatosis [^116X4Aw2] [^116kXCsb] [^113GN9XZ].

> Finally, I should confirm that ferritin is not just a passive marker. Accumulating data support ferritin's role as an immunomodulatory protein in hyperinflammation; therefore, trends in ferritin can inform both diagnosis and monitoring of cytokine storm syndromes, but I must integrate ferritin with clinical phenotype and other biomarkers to avoid overcalling HLH/MAS or missing alternative etiologies of hyperferritinemia [^115UdQ6h] [^116iBHbG].

Elevated ferritin is a hallmark of inflammation and is commonly seen in **chronic inflammatory diseases** such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and inflammatory bowel disease [^1176MTXJ] [^114afHPN]. It is also elevated in **acute infections** (e.g. sepsis, COVID-19) [^112NPXNc] and **macrophage activation syndromes** (e.g. HLH, MAS, Still's disease) [^1128JUhk] [^115UdQ6h]. Other causes include liver disease (NAFLD, alcoholic hepatitis), chronic kidney disease, malignancies, and metabolic syndrome [^113GN9XZ] [^113KEDTR] [^116kXCsb] [^115dbWpq]. Ferritin is an **acute-phase reactant** [^1157g8j4]; therefore, levels may rise with inflammation even when iron stores are normal or low, so interpret results alongside CRP/ESR and transferrin saturation [^114G1cVV] [^112knLuE].

---

## Chronic inflammatory diseases

Several **chronic inflammatory conditions** are associated with elevated ferritin levels:

- **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)**: Ferritin levels correlate with disease activity and inflammatory burden [^1176MTXJ].

- **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: Elevated ferritin is common and correlates with disease activity indices [^1176MTXJ].

- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis frequently present with elevated ferritin due to chronic inflammation [^114afHPN].

- **Ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis**: These conditions also show elevated ferritin levels associated with inflammation [^notfound].

---

## Acute inflammatory conditions and infections

Acute infections and systemic inflammatory responses can markedly increase ferritin. In **sepsis**, ferritin rises as part of the acute-phase response and correlates with severity and mortality [^113Wi3y7]. COVID-19 is frequently accompanied by elevated ferritin, reflecting cytokine storm and macrophage activation [^113AmX9Z]. Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) are characterized by extreme hyperferritinemia, often exceeding 10,000 ng/mL [^notfound].

---

## Liver diseases

Liver diseases frequently cause elevated ferritin due to inflammation, hepatocyte injury, and altered iron metabolism:

- **Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)**: Ferritin is often elevated and correlates with inflammation and insulin resistance [^112mrZJS] [^115dbWpq].

- **Alcoholic liver disease**: Chronic alcohol use increases ferritin through inflammation and hepatic injury [^113GN9XZ].

- **Chronic hepatitis B and C**: Persistent inflammation and hepatocyte injury elevate ferritin levels [^113GN9XZ].

---

## Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

In CKD, **elevated ferritin** is common and reflects both inflammation and altered iron metabolism; ferritin is often used to assess iron stores, but inflammation can confound interpretation [^113KEDTR].

---

## Malignancies

Certain **malignancies** are associated with elevated ferritin:

- **Hematologic malignancies**: Leukemias and lymphomas often present with elevated ferritin due to inflammation and altered iron metabolism [^114FZow6].

- **Solid tumors**: Various cancers can elevate ferritin through chronic inflammation and tumor-related cytokine production [^116kXCsb].

---

## Metabolic syndrome and obesity

Metabolic syndrome and obesity are linked to **chronic low-grade inflammation**, which increases ferritin; insulin resistance and adipose tissue cytokine production contribute to this elevation [^115dbWpq].

---

## Diagnostic implications and clinical approach

Given ferritin's role as an acute-phase reactant, **interpret elevated ferritin cautiously**:

- **Confirm inflammation**: Use CRP and ESR to confirm inflammatory activity [^114G1cVV].

- **Assess iron status**: Use transferrin saturation and soluble transferrin receptor to differentiate iron deficiency from anemia of chronic disease [^notfound].

- **Rule out iron overload**: Consider genetic testing for hemochromatosis if transferrin saturation is elevated [^notfound].

- **Evaluate underlying causes**: Investigate for infections, liver disease, malignancy, and metabolic syndrome based on clinical context [^112NPXNc].

---

Elevated ferritin is a **nonspecific marker of inflammation** seen in chronic inflammatory diseases, acute infections, liver disease, CKD, malignancies, and metabolic syndrome. Accurate interpretation requires clinical context and adjunct laboratory tests.

1.8 Diagnosis of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions

Our review of international guidelines available for CHF, CKD and IBD reveals no consensus practical guidance for diagnosing iron deficiency independent of anemia (Table 1). However, only some guidelines recognize iron deficiency as a standalone condition — whether this is through lack of awareness of iron deficiency or an intentional omission is difficult to establish (Table 1). Iron deficiency can be simply diagnosed with routinely available blood tests measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). 86 yet guidelines often lack agreement on test cut‐off values for these parameters. 4 Serum ferritin levels are sensitive to inflammation and some guidelines recommend assessment of chronic inflammation (according to inflammatory markers such as C‐reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate); however, there is little consensus for many conditions on when this should be measured, should it be standard practice for all patients or measured only when serum ferritin is > 30 µg L −1 or if patients are symptomatic 68, 87? Moreover, no standard CRP cut‐off values are provided; although a CRP level of 5 mg L −1 is the most common threshold, 64 this is not recognized in most guidelines 68

### Anemia of inflammation [^117Bn4Sx]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia of inflammation (AI, also called anemia of chronic disease) is a common, typically normocytic, normochromic anemia that is caused by an underlying inflammatory disease. It is diagnosed when serum iron concentrations are low despite adequate iron stores, as evidenced by serum ferritin that is not low. In the setting of inflammation, it may be difficult to differentiate AI from iron deficiency anemia, and the 2 conditions may coexist. Treatment should focus on the underlying disease. Recent advances in molecular understanding of AI are stimulating the development of new pathophysiologically targeted experimental therapies.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^114M6UDR]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### Interpretation of ferritin concentrations in the dermatology clinic [^116Gd8nd]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ferritin measurement is a common laboratory test in dermatology. Ferritin is a marker of iron storage in the human body but can also be -elevated in inflammatory states. Therefore, changes in ferritin are nonspecific, and correlation of specific clinical findings and risk factors with ferritin concentration and other biomarkers, e.g. iron studies or C-reactive protein tests, is recommended. This article discusses iron metabolism and the indications for ferritin measurement in dermatology and how to interpret the laboratory results.

### Ferritin in autoimmune diseases [^11499sjg]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Iron, an essential element for many important cellular functions in all living organisms, can catalyze the formation of potentially toxic free radicals. Excessive iron is sequestered by ferritin in a nontoxic and readily available form in a cell. Ferritin is composed of 24 subunits of different proportions of two functionally distinct subunits: ferritin H and L. The expression of ferritin is under delicate control and is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by iron, cytokines, hormones, and oxidative stress. Mutations in the ferritin gene cause the hereditary hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome and neuroferritinopathy. Hyperferritinemia is associated with inflammation, infections, and malignancies. While elevated levels of ferritin are characteristic of adult-onset Still's disease and hemophagocytic syndrome, both associated with inflammation, it has scantly been evaluated in other autoimmune diseases. In this review, we describe ferritin structure and function, hyperferritinemia in disease states and in autoimmune diseases.

### Investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin [^116kXCsb]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Serum ferritin level is one of the most commonly requested investigations in both primary and secondary care. Whilst low serum ferritin levels invariably indicate reduced iron stores, raised serum ferritin levels can be due to multiple different aetiologies, including iron overload, inflammation, liver or renal disease, malignancy, and the recently described metabolic syndrome. A key test in the further investigation of an unexpected raised serum ferritin is the serum transferrin saturation. This guideline reviews the investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin level. The investigation and management of genetic haemochromatosis is not dealt with however and is the subject of a separate guideline.

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines — ferritin cutoff for diagnosing iron deficiency in anemia states: In patients with anemia, the AGA recommends using a cutoff of 45 ng/mL over 15 ng/mL when using ferritin to diagnose iron deficiency. This is a Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. In patients with inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, other laboratory tests such as C-reactive protein, transferrin saturation, or soluble transferrin receptor may be needed in conjunction with ferritin to diagnose iron deficiency anemia.

### Extreme hyperferritinemia: causes and impact on diagnostic reasoning [^114FZow6]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hyperferritinemia can be a result of inflammation, infection, chronic iron overload, or other uncommon pathologies including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). There is a historical association between extreme hyperferritinemia and HLH, but in reality HLH is associated with a minority of hyperferritinemic states.

Methods

We identified conditions most associated with hyperferritinemia by identifying 65,536 serum ferritin levels at the University of Minnesota Hospital over a five-year period, with 86 values higher than 10,000ng/mL. Pediatric patients comprised 22% of this population, and adults, 78%.

Results

The majority of cases in both populations with hyperferritinemia were due to chronic transfusion (35%), followed by liver disease (27%), and hematologic malignancy (16%). Solid malignancies, infection, macrophage activation syndrome, and primary and secondary HLH comprised the remaining (22%).

Conclusions

Although this supports the relationship between extreme hyperferritinemia and HLH, it maintains that the positive predictive value of hyperferritinemia for HLH is quite low, and one should consider more common explanations before suspecting HLH.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^111BGSMm]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is frequent in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g., chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, cancers, and bowel inflammatory diseases). Indeed, high concentrations of inflammatory cytokines increase hepcidin concentrations that lead to the sequestration of iron in cells of the reticuloendothelial system (functional iron deficiency). Iron parameters are often assessed only in the context of anemia, but iron deficiency, even without anemia, is present in about half of patients with inflammatory conditions. Iron deficiency worsens underlying chronic diseases and is an independent factor of morbidity and mortality. In daily practice, the most effective biomarkers of iron status are serum ferritin, which reflects iron storage, and transferrin saturation, which reflects the transport of iron. Serum ferritin is increased in an inflammatory context, and there is still no consensus on the threshold to be used in chronic inflammatory conditions. Nevertheless, recent recommendations of international guidelines agreed to define iron deficiency by serum ferritin < 100 µg/L and/or transferrin saturation < 20%. Iron parameters remain, however, insufficiently assessed in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. Indeed, clinical symptoms of iron deficiency, such as fatigue, are not specific and often confused with those of the primary disease. Iron repletion, preferably by the intravenous route to bypass tissue sequestration, improves clinical signs and quality of life. Because of the negative impact of iron deficiency on chronic inflammatory diseases and the efficacy of intravenous iron repletion, screening of iron parameters should be part of the routine examination of all patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.

### The serum hepcidin and the hepcidin / ferritin ratio in NAFLD: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112mrZJS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ferritin, an acute-phase reactant, is often elevated in inflammatory states commonly observed in NAFLD, which can confound the interpretation of hepcidin level, as both are influenced by inflammation. Elevated ferritin may indicate not only iron storage but also underlying inflammation, masking the role of dysregulation of iron metabolism in NAFLD. To address this, we employed the hepcidin/ferritin ratio, which normalizes hepcidin levels relative to ferritin, accounting for inflammation. Our finding of lower hepcidin/ferritin ratios in NAFLD suggests disruptions in iron metabolism beyond inflammation. However, the limited number of studies on this ratio reduces the strength of this conclusion. In patients with NASH and Dysmetabolic Iron Overload Syndrome (DIOS), a reduced hepcidin/ferritin ratio reflects significant disruptions in iron metabolism. Studies indicate that IR is more pronounced in NASH compared to SS, and this IR is associated with decreased hepcidin levels. This connection may arise from IR interfering with the normal regulatory mechanisms of hepcidin, leading to reduced hepcidin levels in NASH and subsequently affecting the hepcidin/ferritin ratio.

However, our study did not confirm this result because only two studies categorized NAFLD into SS and NASH. Although the combined effect size of serum hepcidin was − 0.04, the result was not statistically significant. Additionally, increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in NASH may exacerbate iron metabolism, leading to lower hepcidin/ferritin ratios in patients with severe hepatocellular damage. These mechanisms collectively highlight the pivotal role of hepcidin in regulating iron metabolism and its impact on the progression of NAFLD, emphasizing the need to target iron homeostasis and inflammatory pathways in therapeutic strategies.

Our meta-analysis indicated that obese groups exhibited higher levels of serum hepcidin compared to overweight groups. This difference is likely driven by chronic low-grade inflammation associated with obesity, which increases levels of inflammatory cytokines such as leptin, TNF-α, and IL-6. These cytokines promote hepcidin synthesis through various signalling pathways, resulting in decreased iron absorption and increased iron storage. Consequently, this process helps reduce excessive iron release caused by inflammation, serving as a protective mechanism against inflammatory responses. However, inflammation related to obesity may confound the use of hepcidin as a biomarker for NAFLD, as elevated hepcidin levels could reflect both liver disease and inflammatory conditions associated with obesity. Future research should explore strategies to differentiate hepcidin elevations attributable to NAFLD from those caused by obesity-related inflammation.

### Eppur Si muove: ferritin is essential in modulating inflammation [^111GfrgU]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Ferritin, which was only discovered in the last century, has stirred a formidable debate. Ferritin has long been appreciated as a non-specific acute-phase reactant. Several years ago, we hypothesized the contributory role of ferritin as a pathogenic molecule rather than being a product of inflammation. The latest emerging evidence provides support to this notion. Such revelation provides a step forward towards the understanding of disease conditions associated with hyperferritinaemia, and hence provide new targets for treatment modalities.

### Abnormal ferritin levels predict development of poor outcomes in cirrhotic outpatients: a cohort study [^116rfLva]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, since low ferritin level was associated with higher incidence of decompensation, it might seem controversial that mortality was associated with higher ferritin levels in the compensated population. As discussed, elevated ferritin level indicates either iron overload, which is toxic to cells, or increased inflammation, caused by either bacterial translocation or a subclinical starting infection. These last two, in return, can lead to overt infections, while inflammation in general and iron-induced toxicity can trigger the progression of HCC and comorbidities ultimately leading to increased overall mortality. Indeed, as Fig. 6 shows, almost every patient with high ferritin level who developed decompensated clinical stage died, and some deceased even without having an AD episode. In contrast, as Fig. 3 demonstrates, no patient with low ferritin level who did not develop decompensated clinical stage died during follow up. Furthermore, approximately 40% of those with low ferritin levels who did decompensate, also survived. The explanation for this difference is not clear, but the decompensation of non-inflammatory mechanisms, indicated by lower ferritin levels, might represent a less severe/more manageable type of AD.

Abstract

Iron deficiency is frequent in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g. chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, cancers, and bowel inflammatory diseases). Indeed, high concentrations of inflammatory cytokines increase hepcidin concentrations that lead to the sequestration of iron in cells of the reticuloendothelial system (functional iron deficiency).

### Association of hyperferritinemia with distinct host response aberrations in patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^114UGX3d]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

While elevated circulating ferritin levels are used to select patients for immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies, literature on the pathophysiological implications of hyperferritinemia on the host response during acute infection is scarce. Findings of the current investigation, taken together with our group's previous findings in critically ill patients, suggest that hyperferritinemia identifies patients with CAP with a broad deregulation of various key host response mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis, entailing not only systemic inflammation and cytokine release but also endothelial activation and dysfunction and activation of the coagulation system.

### Serum biomarkers in acute respiratory distress syndrome an ailing prognosticator [^115F3DfJ]. Respiratory Research (2005). Low credibility.

Ferritin (Table 6)

Ferritin is a 480-kDa iron-storage protein that sequesters iron in the ferric (Fe 3+) state. It has been speculated that ferritin may serve as a crucial antioxidant mediator because free iron enhances the formation of highly toxic hydroxyl radicals from superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. On the other hand, oxidative stress is a condition commonly seen in disorders at risk for ARDS development such as sepsis. Hence, ferritin-derived iron may aggravate oxidative damage in critically ill patients, contributing to the pathologic abnormalities encountered in ARDS. Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-8, IL-6 and TNFa which are increased and presumably participating in the pathogenetic derangements of ARDS have been suggested to promote ferritin synthesis. Thereby, it can be concluded that elevated ferritin levels could result from oxidative stress, proinflammatory cytokines and the degree of lung injury, all conditions characterizing the pathogenesis of ARDS and subsequently can be used as prognostic and monitoring tool reflecting the likelihood of ARDS development and the disease severity.

The first study attempted to prove such correlation was conducted by Connelly et al. They plotted ROC curves to estimate the utility of ferritin levels as prognostic factors and produced clinically useful cut-off points which could predict the development of ARDS with high sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value, both in male and female predominantly septic subjects. However, the heterogeneity of the etiologic factors resulting to ARDS development in at risk patients renders major uncertainty to the rigidity and reliability of the results.

To ameliorate this hardship, the same group of authors {Sharkey et al. } generalized and extended the latter results in a homogeneous group of at-risk patients with multiple trauma demonstrating a strong correlation of initial ferritin plasma levels with the development of ARDS and multiple organ failure. In addition, an association of serum ferritin levels with the severity of lung injury as well as other markers of endothelial activation was also noted supporting the premise that elevated levels could reflect the inflammatory status encountering in ALI. Nonetheless, authors failed to detect specific predictive cut-off values suggesting that circulating concentrations of this biomarker are unable to predict per se the progression to ARDS. A possible explanation could arise from the hypothesis that elevated levels of this marker must reflect a systemic response to a risk factor, which may prove to reduce its specificity (Table 6).

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^11189XPC]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is frequent in chronic conditions

Until very recently, iron deficiency (ID) was considered only in the context of iron‐deficiency anemia. It is only in the last 10–15 years that ID has been considered as an autonomous pathological entity in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs. Therefore, early ID detection and treatment became important goals, as iron is essential for the functioning of all organs. The fact that the biological definition of ID is debated and inconsistently defined by authors in different studies has probably contributed to preventing the recognition of ID as an independent condition. An international multidisciplinary group of experts recently proposed a more comprehensive definition of ID: "Iron deficiency is a health‐related condition in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs and which can be present with or without anemia". This definition is important because it indicates that ID may have specific symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment, even in the absence of anemia. Furthermore, as detailed in the next section, ID is associated with poor prognosis in many diseases, thus highlighting the importance of its diagnosis.

Depending on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, two types of ID can be distinguished, with identical clinical symptoms: absolute ID, which is the consequence of a quantitative decrease in iron stores, and functional ID, which is due to the sequestration of iron in otherwise quantitatively normal or abundant stores. These two types of ID are not mutually exclusive and are often associated. Understanding their underlying mechanisms is essential for the development of rational diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic approaches.

In daily practice, the most effective biomarkers of iron status are serum ferritin, which reflects stored iron, and transferrin saturation (TSAT), which is indicative of transported iron. TSAT is always present; thus, the decrease of TSAT is an essential diagnostic criterion of absolute or functional ID. Since the reliability of serum ferritin measurement may be compromised in patients with chronic diseases or any inflammatory condition, there is a large consensus in guidelines to determine both serum ferritin and TSAT in the first line. There is still no consensus on the thresholds, but recent recommendations of international guidelines have shown agreement for defining ID by serum ferritin < 100 µg/L and/or TSAT < 20%.

### Association of hyperferritinemia with distinct host response aberrations in patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^112NPXNc]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Ferritin, a protein secreted mainly by hepatocytes, macrophages and Kupffer cells, is a well-known acute-phase reactant of which circulating levels increase in response to infection and other inflammatory conditions. Hyperferritinemia has also been reported in more chronic disorders, such as cancer, liver diseases, metabolic syndrome, and kidney disease. Clinically, serum ferritin is used mainly as an indicator for iron status; low ferritin levels indicate iron deficiency elevated ferritin levels can be caused by multiple blood transfusions, hemochromatosis, or rare diseases such as hereditary hyperferritinemia, and very high levels are suggestive of Still disease and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. In patients with sepsis, ferritin has been proposed as a biomarker for macrophage activation–like syndrome (MALS), a hyperinflammatory condition associated with increased mortality rates.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the world's leading infectious killer and the most common cause of sepsis. Our group previously reported that 83% of critically ill patients with sepsis caused by CAP have elevated plasma ferritin concentrations on admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Ten percent of patients with CAP admitted to the ICU had ferritin concentrations > 4420 ng/mL, the suggested cutoff for the diagnosis of MALS. In patients with CAP caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), circulating ferritin has been used to classify hyperinflammation and is a predictor of a favorable response to treatment with recombinant interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (RA). Therefore, hyperferritinemia is used as an inclusion criterion to select patients with COVID-19 and exaggerated systemic inflammation; many trials use a ferritin level of ≥ 500 ng/mL to identify patients who might benefit from anti-inflammatory therapy (clinicaltrials.gov identifiers NCT04530578, NCT04341675, and NCT04443881).

Knowledge of the incidence of hyperferritinemia in (non-ICU) patients presenting to the hospital with CAP and its association with activation of distinct proinflammatory host response mechanisms is limited. In the current study, we sought to determine the association of hyperferritinemia in patients with CAP admitted to a general hospital ward with their clinical presentation, outcome, and aberrations in key host response pathways implicated in the immunopathology of pneumonia and sepsis.

### Importance of ferritin for optimizing anemia therapy in chronic kidney disease [^113SAR2s]. American Journal of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical significance of serum ferritin in monitoring the iron status of patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) has become suspected. In this review, we reassess the interpretation of high serum ferritin values in such patients, with the goal of treating their anemia in a safe way. From the observations that (1) H-ferritin gene transcription is predominantly active in inflammatory conditions, whereas L-ferritin is induced only after exposure to very high iron concentrations and is preferentially secreted to plasma from hepatocytes; (2) the expression of both types of ferritin proteins are exclusively dependent on intracellular free iron, which is often sequestered by LPS or cytokines in several cell types, and (3) splenic iron is depleted and serum ferritin does not increase in the combined conditions of both inflammation and iron deficiency, it is deduced that elevated serum ferritin levels are caused by the accumulation of intracellular iron, especially reticuloendothelial cells or macrophages, hepatocytes, and other cells, while cytokines or inflammation might modulate the relative ratio of ferritin to body iron storage. Therefore, high levels of serum ferritin in patients on MHD can be used to indicate iron deposition in most cells, including vascular and immunocompetent cells, and is still a reliable indicator of the need to withhold iron administration.

### Expanding the spectrum of the hyperferritinemic syndrome, from pathogenic mechanisms to clinical observations, and therapeutic implications [^116iBHbG]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

From the introduction of hyperferritinemic syndrome concept, a growing body of evidence has suggested the role of ferritin as a pathogenic mediator and a relevant clinical feature in the management of patients with inflammatory diseases. From a pathogenic point of view, ferritin may directly stimulate the aberrant immune response by triggering the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in inducing a vicious pathogenic loop and contributing to the occurrence of cytokine storm syndrome. The latter has been recently defined as a clinical picture characterised by elevated circulating cytokine levels, acute systemic inflammatory symptoms, and secondary organ dysfunction beyond that which could be attributed to a normal response to a pathogen It is noteworthy that the occurrence of hyperferritinemia may be correlated with the development of the cytokine storm syndrome in the context of an inflammatory disease. In addition to adult onset Still's disease, macrophage activation syndrome, catastrophic anti-phospholipids syndrome, and septic shock, recent evidence has suggested this association between ferritin and life-threatening evolution in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, with anti-MDA5 antibodies in the context of poly-dermatomyositis, with severe COVID-19, and with multisystem inflammatory syndrome. The possible underlying common inflammatory mechanisms, associated with hyperferritinemia, may led to the similar clinical picture observed in these patients. Furthermore, similar therapeutic strategies could be suggested inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines and improving long-term outcomes in these disorders. Thus, it could be possible to expand the spectrum of the hyperferritinemic syndrome to those diseases burdened by a dreadful clinical picture correlated with hyperferritinemia and the occurrence of the cytokine storm syndrome. In addition, the assessment of ferritin may provide useful information to the physicians in clinical practice to manage these patients. Therefore, ferritin may be considered a relevant clinical feature to be used as biomarker in dissecting the unmet needs in the management of these disorders. Novel evidence may thus support an expansion of the spectrum of the hyperferritinemic syndrome to these diseases burdened by a life-threatening clinical picture correlated with hyperferritinemia and the occurrence of the cytokine storm syndrome.

### Assessment of the serum ferritin level in patients with different subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and its association with disease activity [^111ZXnqF]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is one of the most common juvenile rheumatic illnesses and is characterized by chronic inflammation of joints in children and adolescents. It is a diverse and complex autoimmune disease. The International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) defines JIA as definite arthritis of undetermined origin that begins before the 16th year of age and persists for at least 6 weeks. The incidence rates vary from 1.6 to 23/100,000, and the prevalence rates range from 3.8 to 400/100,000 in developed countries. In a semiurban area of Bangladesh, the estimated point prevalence of JIA was 60.5 per 100,000 children.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is an intricate autoimmune disorder characterized by a multifactorial immunological etiology, wherein genetic predisposition and environmental factors contribute to a chronic inflammatory response involving the dysregulated activation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Infection acts as a trigger in the development of JIA. The subsequent autoimmune damage largely, but not exclusively, targets the synovial membrane of the joint, resulting in persistent joint inflammation.

Ferritin, an iron storage protein, is an acute-phase reactant involved in inflammation, preventing free iron-mediated oxidative damage and immune dysregulation, making it a potential biomarker for disease activity in JIA. Studies have demonstrated that ferritin levels correlate with systemic inflammation, particularly in systemic JIA (sJIA), where hyperferritinemia is a characteristic feature. Additionally, serum ferritin levels have been found to be significantly elevated in other autoimmune & inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, further supporting its relevance as a disease activity marker. Elevated ferritin in these conditions indicates increased iron storage, but the iron remains sequestered and unavailable for hematopoiesis, contributing to anemia of inflammation. This relative iron deficiency via stimulation of hepcidin production is thought to be a defense mechanism to limit iron availability to pathogens and tumors. Iron is vital for immune cell function and survival, including T cells, B cells, and macrophages. Its homeostasis regulates the immune system, which is crucial in arthritis. Recent research suggests that ferritin can distinguish between active and inactive disease states in JIA, making it a valuable marker for disease monitoring.

### The hyperferritinemic syndrome: macrophage activation syndrome, Still's disease, septic shock and catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome [^1142y8x2]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Summary

● There is increasing evidence that circulating ferritin levels may not only reflect an acute phase response but may play a critical role in inflammation.

● MAS, AOSD, cAPS and septic shock are associated with very high levels of ferritin.

● These disorders share similar clinical and laboratory presentations and respond to similar treatments, suggesting that hyperferritinemia may be involved in a common pathogenic mechanism.

● We hypothesize that the huge levels of ferritin seen in these four clinical conditions are not just a secondary product of the inflammatory process, but rather, they are part of the pathogenic mechanism.

● We propose to include these four disorders under a single nomenclature: "The Hyperferritinemic Syndrome".

### Extreme hyperferritinaemia; clinical causes [^112N6wmB]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

There are many causes of raised serum ferritin concentrations including iron overload, inflammation and liver disease to name but a few examples. Cases of extreme hyperferritinaemia (serum ferritin concentration equal to or greater than 10 000 ug/l) are being reported in laboratories but the causes of this are unclear. We conducted an audit study to explore this further. Extreme hyperferritinaemia was rare with only 0.08% of ferritin requests displaying this. The main causes of extreme hyperferritinaemia included multiple blood transfusions, malignant disease, hepatic disease and suspected Still's disease.

### The hyperferritinemic syndrome: macrophage activation syndrome, Still's disease, septic shock and catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome [^111cyhyM]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

However, not all the patients with these clinical conditions have hyperferritinemia; in fact, in about 10% of the AOSD patients the ferritin levels are normal. Perhaps in this subgroup of patients the disease has a different etiology with a different pathogenesis. On the other hand, there are other diseases characterized by high levels of ferritin, such as hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome that do not have an inflammatory response. Furthermore, the genetic forms of HLH that share clinical similarities with the four diseases discussed also have several important differences in the clinical, laboratory and, mainly, treatment response, which may suggest a distinct pathogenic features. Another clinical condition resembles these four that we have described, induced by the administration of an anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody. It led to a pro-inflammatory cytokine storm with multiorgan failure that responded to treatment with corticosteroids and hemodiafiltration with high dialysate rates and fresh frozen plasma. We may speculate that in this condition ferritin was also elevated, but it was not measured.

Taking this all together, we suggest that the four conditions: MAS, AOSD, cAPS and septic shock, which share common clinical and pathogenic features, should be included under a common syndrome named "Hyperferritinemic Syndrome".

This concept of hyperferritinemia as a major contributor in the pathogenesis of these conditions may be extremely important in considering more targeted therapy. It is to be hoped that busy clinicians may appreciate the value of ferritin measurements when managing critically ill patients and that these assays may be useful in guiding therapy and predicting prognosis.

Further studies are required to understand the possible pathogenic role of ferritin in these conditions. There are many unsolved questions in this issue, such as why and how the serum ferritin is elevated, what is the composition of ferritin in the different diseases, and whether there are more receptors for ferritin and how ferritin interacts with them.

### Serum or plasma ferritin concentration as an index of iron deficiency and overload [^1157g8j4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Reference standard indices of iron deficiency and iron overload are generally invasive, expensive, and can be unpleasant or occasionally risky. Ferritin is an iron storage protein and its concentration in the plasma or serum reflects iron stores; low ferritin indicates iron deficiency, while elevated ferritin reflects risk of iron overload. However, ferritin is also an acute-phase protein and its levels are elevated in inflammation and infection. The use of ferritin as a diagnostic test of iron deficiency and overload is a common clinical practice.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ferritin concentrations (serum or plasma) for detecting iron deficiency and risk of iron overload in primary and secondary iron-loading syndromes.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases (10 June 2020): DARE (Cochrane Library) Issue 2 of 4 2015, HTA (Cochrane Library) Issue 4 of 4 2016, CENTRAL (Cochrane Library) Issue 6 of 12 2020, MEDLINE (OVID) 1946 to 9 June 2020, Embase (OVID) 1947 to week 23 2020, CINAHL (Ebsco) 1982 to June 2020, Web of Science (ISI) SCI, SSCI, CPCI-exp & CPCI-SSH to June 2020, POPLINE 16/8/18, Open Grey (10/6/20), TRoPHI (10/6/20), Bibliomap (10/6/20), IBECS (10/6/20), SCIELO (10/6/20), Global Index Medicus (10/6/20) AIM, IMSEAR, WPRIM, IMEMR, LILACS (10/6/20), PAHO (10/6/20), WHOLIS 10/6/20, IndMED (16/8/18) and Native Health Research Database (10/6/20). We also searched two trials registers and contacted relevant organisations for unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

We included all study designs seeking to evaluate serum or plasma ferritin concentrations measured by any current or previously available quantitative assay as an index of iron status in individuals of any age, sex, clinical and physiological status from any country.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. We designed the data extraction form to record results for ferritin concentration as the index test, and bone marrow iron content for iron deficiency and liver iron content for iron overload as the reference standards. Two other authors further extracted and validated the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative cases, and extracted or derived the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for each threshold presented for iron deficiency and iron overload in included studies. We assessed risk of bias and applicability using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool. We used GRADE assessment to enable the quality of evidence and hence strength of evidence for our conclusions.

Main Results

Our search was conducted initially in 2014 and updated in 2017, 2018 and 2020 (10 June). We identified 21,217 records and screened 14,244 records after duplicates were removed. We assessed 316 records in full text. We excluded 190 studies (193 records) with reasons and included 108 studies (111 records) in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. There were 11 studies (12 records) that we screened from the last search update and appeared eligible for a future analysis. We decided to enter these as awaiting classification. We stratified the analysis first by participant clinical status: apparently healthy and non-healthy populations. We then stratified by age and pregnancy status as: infants and children, adolescents, pregnant women, and adults. Iron deficiency We included 72 studies (75 records) involving 6059 participants. Apparently healthy populations Five studies screened for iron deficiency in people without apparent illness. In the general adult population, three studies reported sensitivities of 63% to 100% at the optimum cutoff for ferritin, with corresponding specificities of 92% to 98%, but the ferritin cutoffs varied between studies. One study in healthy children reported a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 77%. One study in pregnant women reported a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 100%. Overall confidence in these estimates was very low because of potential bias, indirectness, and sparse and heterogenous evidence. No studies screened for iron overload in apparently healthy people. People presenting for medical care There were 63 studies among adults presenting for medical care (5042 participants). For a sample of 1000 subjects with a 35% prevalence of iron deficiency (of the included studies in this category) and supposing a 85% specificity, there would be 315 iron-deficient subjects correctly classified as having iron deficiency and 35 iron-deficient subjects incorrectly classified as not having iron deficiency, leading to a 90% sensitivity. Thresholds proposed by the authors of the included studies ranged between 12 to 200 µg/L. The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 50. Among non-healthy adults using a fixed threshold of 30 μg/L (nine studies, 512 participants, low-certainty evidence), the pooled estimate for sensitivity was 79% with a 95% confidence interval of (58%, 91%) and specificity of 98%, with a 95% confidence interval of (91%, 100%). The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 140, a relatively highly informative test. Iron overload We included 36 studies (36 records) involving 1927 participants. All studies concerned non-healthy populations. There were no studies targeting either infants, children, or pregnant women. Among all populations (one threshold for males and females; 36 studies, 1927 participants, very low-certainty evidence): for a sample of 1000 subjects with a 42% prevalence of iron overload (of the included studies in this category) and supposing a 65% specificity, there would be 332 iron-overloaded subjects correctly classified as having iron overload and 85 iron-overloaded subjects incorrectly classified as not having iron overload, leading to a 80% sensitivity. The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 8.

Authors' Conclusions

At a threshold of 30 micrograms/L, there is low-certainty evidence that blood ferritin concentration is reasonably sensitive and a very specific test for iron deficiency in people presenting for medical care. There is very low certainty that high concentrations of ferritin provide a sensitive test for iron overload in people where this condition is suspected. There is insufficient evidence to know whether ferritin concentration performs similarly when screening asymptomatic people for iron deficiency or overload.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^113KEDTR]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

- A rising ferritin level and a drop in TSAT suggest an inflammatory condition: a source of inflammation may be sought: sepsis, vascular access, surgery, recent hospitalisation: further iron therapy depends on target ferritin level and clinical scenario.

- Ongoing high requirements for IV iron to maintain a given ferritin level also point to ongoing blood loss.

- The finding of a TSAT less than 20% coupled with a ferritin level greater than 500 microgram/L poses a particularly difficult problem for clinicians. This situation may be caused by iron test variability, inflammation, or reticuloendothelial iron blockade. Evidence on the risks and benefits of IV iron therapy in these patients is not well established. The effect of iron therapy in this group of patients was assessed in The Dialysis patients' Response to IV Iron with Elevated ferritin (DRIVE) trial, which evaluated the efficacy of intravenous ferric gluconate in 134 patients with high ferritin (500–1200 microgram/L) and low TSAT levels (≤ 25%) who were anaemic despite a high rHuEPO dose (≥ 225 IU/kg/week or ≥ 22,500 IU/week). After 6 weeks the patients receiving ferric gluconate (125 mg IV at eight consecutive HD sessions) showed a significant increase in Hb in comparison with controls. However, the study has a number of limitations because, given the small sample size and short follow-up, it provides no information about safety and iron overload.

- Finally it is not known whether treatment of patients with CKD and Hb values > 120 g/L in the presence of iron deficiency is beneficial. Ongoing studies such as the Iron and Heart Study (EudraCT number: 2014–004133–16) may provide future data.

### The hyperferritinemic syndrome: macrophage activation syndrome, Still's disease, septic shock and catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome [^1126HdVr]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

For most clinicians dealing with inflammatory diseases, serum ferritin levels are a rather non-specific marker of the acute phase response, which is often ignored or not measured when the patient presents acutely. In some diseases, ferritin levels may be extremely high and, while not specific, these very high levels may be helpful diagnostically. Four uncommon immune mediated conditions may be associated with high ferritin levels: macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), adult onset Still's disease (AOSD), catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (cAPS) and septic shock. These disorders share similar clinical and laboratory presentations and they also respond to similar treatments, suggesting that hyperferritinemia may be involved in a common pathogenic mechanism.

There is increasing evidence that circulating ferritin levels may not only reflect an acute phase response but may play a critical role in inflammation. Its secretion is regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and ferritin has immunosuppressive effects possibly mediated by binding to its receptor. Different mechanisms may inhibit the ferritin-mediated suppression of the immune cells, and in turn, this impaired immunosuppression may favor the loss of tolerance and the development of autoimmune diseases. Moderate levels of hyperferritinemia are associated with autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Although it is generally accepted that circulating ferritin levels may reflect an acute phase response, the explanation for why and how serum ferritin is elevated is unknown.

We hypothesize that the huge levels of ferritin seen in these four clinical conditions are not just a secondary product of the inflammatory process but rather they are part of the pathogenic mechanism. Therefore, we propose to include them under a single nomenclature: "The Hyperferritinemic Syndrome".

### The hyperferritinemic syndrome: macrophage activation syndrome, Still's disease, septic shock and catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome [^1167xGAz]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Over the last few years, accumulating data have implicated a role for ferritin as a signaling molecule and direct mediator of the immune system. Hyperferritinemia is associated with a multitude of clinical conditions and with worse prognosis in critically ill patients.

Discussion

There are four uncommon medical conditions characterized by high levels of ferritin, namely the macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), adult onset Still's disease (AOSD), catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (cAPS) and septic shock, that share a similar clinical and laboratory features, and also respond to similar treatments, suggesting a common pathogenic mechanism. Ferritin is known to be a pro-inflammatory mediator inducing expression of pro-inflammatory molecules, yet it has opposing actions as a pro-inflammatory and as an immunosuppressant. We propose that the exceptionally high ferritin levels observed in these uncommon clinical conditions are not just the product of the inflammation but rather may contribute to the development of a cytokine storm.

Summary

Here we review and compare four clinical conditions and the role of ferritin as an immunomodulator. We would like to propose including these four conditions under a common syndrome entity termed "Hyperferritinemic Syndrome".

### Adjusting plasma ferritin concentrations to remove the effects of subclinical inflammation in the assessment of iron deficiency: a meta-analysis [^1133sWtF]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization recommends serum ferritin concentrations as the best indicator of iron deficiency (ID). Unfortunately, ferritin increases with infections; hence, the prevalence of ID is underestimated.

Objective

The objective was to estimate the increase in ferritin in 32 studies of apparently healthy persons by using 2 acute-phase proteins (APPs), C-reactive protein (CRP) and alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP), individually and in combination, and to calculate factors to remove the influence of inflammation from ferritin concentrations.

Design

We estimated the increase in ferritin associated with inflammation (ie, CRP > 5 mg/L and/or AGP > 1 g/L). The 32 studies comprised infants (5 studies), children (7 studies), men (4 studies), and women (16 studies) (n = 8796 subjects). In 2-group analyses (either CRP or AGP), we compared the ratios of log ferritin with or without inflammation in 30 studies. In addition, in 22 studies, the data allowed a comparison of ratios of log ferritin between 4 subgroups: reference (no elevated APP), incubation (elevated CRP only), early convalescence (both APP and CRP elevated), and late convalescence (elevated AGP only).

Results

In the 2-group analysis, inflammation increased ferritin by 49.6% (CRP) or 38.2% (AGP; both P lt 0.001). Elevated AGP was more common than CRP in young persons than in adults. In the 4-group analysis, ferritin was 30%, 90%, and 36% (all P < 0.001) higher in the incubation, early convalescence, and late convalescence subgroups, respectively, with corresponding correction factors of 0.77, 0.53, and 0.75. Overall, inflammation increased ferritin by ap 30% and was associated with a 14% (CI: 7%, 21%) underestimation of ID.

Conclusions

Measures of both APP and CRP are needed to estimate the full effect of inflammation and can be used to correct ferritin concentrations. Few differences were observed between age and sex subgroups.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^116PBzzy]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — ferritin thresholds and adjunctive testing: Based on a systematic review of 55 studies, a ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL has a sensitivity for iron deficiency of 85% (95% confidence interval, 82%–87%) with a specificity of 92% (95% CI, 91%–94%), whereas a ferritin value of < 15 ng/mL has a sensitivity of 59% (95% CI, 55%–62%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI, 98%–99%). A ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL was believed to maximize sensitivity for the diagnosis of IDA with an acceptable number of false-positive diagnoses, and the tradeoff between higher sensitivity and lower specificity using a threshold of 45 ng/mL instead of 15 ng/mL was believed to provide an acceptable balance of benefits of fewer missed diagnoses compared with potential harms of additional diagnostic evaluations. In some patients, such as those with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, ferritin levels may not accurately reflect body iron stores and other clinical tests, such as the serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, or C-reactive protein, may be useful adjunctive tests to assist in the diagnosis of iron deficiency.

### Best but not perfect: indirect measure of low iron stores [^1145jGej]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The other biomarkers studied by the authors demonstrated inferior diagnostic performance compared to ferritin except for transferrin in females. Multivariate logistic regression models including these biomarkers did not improve the prediction of low or absent bone marrow iron stores over ferritin alone.

The clinical implications of the current study are important. The high specificity of ferritin at the 30 μg/L cutoff suggests that it can be a reliable marker for ruling in low or absent iron stores in patients with a high pretest probability of the condition. However, the low sensitivity indicates that clinicians should be cautious in ruling out low or absent iron stores based solely on ferritin levels, particularly in patients with conditions that can elevate ferritin, such as inflammation or liver disease. In such cases, additional diagnostic tests or clinical judgment may be necessary to accurately diagnose low or absent iron stores. We cannot emphasize too strongly that bone marrow aspirate with iron staining is often necessary, as the finding of absent iron necessitates an evaluation that may uncover a gastrointestinal or genitourinary malignance at an early, curable stage.

The reliability of the bone marrow iron determination depends on the adequacy of the specimen including the presence of spicules in the aspirate, and it would have been good to have specific comments about these factors in this study. In addition, it would have been good to provide their analysis based on the classical definition of iron deficiency, which is absence of stainable iron in an adequate bone marrow aspirate. The retrospective design and single institution character of the study are offset by the very impressive sample size.

In conclusion, this study reinforces the importance of ferritin as the primary biomarker for diagnosing iron deficiency, while also highlighting its limitations in terms of sensitivity. Clinicians should consider these findings when interpreting laboratory measures of iron status, particularly in patients with comorbid conditions. Importantly, the presence of a normal or elevated serum ferritin does not negate the potential need for a bone marrow aspirate to assess potential metabolic or malignant conditions that may present with iron deficiency.

Nonspecific tests of immunologic inflammation — routine laboratory tests such as complete blood cell count with differential, sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and other acute-phase reactants are useful in determining the inflammatory consequences of innate immunity, and functional assays of neutrophils and macrophages may be necessary to pinpoint inflammatory responses (B); functional assays of macrophages and neutrophils may indicate either impaired defense or uncontrolled inflammatory responses (ie, the macrophage activation syndrome), neutrophil and macrophage function tests may only be available in specialized medical centers, and high ferritin levels associated with the macrophage activation syndrome can be used to monitor treatment of this disorder.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^114afHPN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of anemia in IBD patients

In humans, multiple factors, such as age, sex, ethnicity, pregnancy, environment and nutrition, influence Hb levels. In general, the WHO defines anemia as a decline in blood Hb according to the reference levels given in Table 1. These cutoff levels apply equally to IBD patients, as the definitions do not vary according to comorbidities. Considering the high prevalence of anemia in chronic inflammatory diseases, the recently published European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) guideline on anemia recommends regular screening, according to disease severity and activity. More specifically, anemia assessment in outpatients with active inflammation (high elevated inflammatory biomarkers or significant endoscopic proof of disease activity) should be performed at least every three months, whereas screening intervals in outpatients who show few signs of systemic inflammation or are in remission can be extended to every six to twelve months. Special attention should be paid to children and adolescents. Common diagnostic markers for anemia assessment may be applied to patients without clinical, endoscopic or biochemical evidence of active disease. In contrast, in IBD patients who have active disease, are receiving ongoing therapy, or have undergone extensive small bowel resection, important parameters for the assessment of anemia, such as erythrocyte indices, ferritin and transferrin saturation (TfS), do not always afford sufficient accuracy. It should be remembered that ferritin is an acute-phase protein that is increased in the context of ongoing systemic inflammation. Furthermore, differentiation between the two most frequent types of anemia in IBD patients, ID and ACD, remains challenging, especially since both conditions frequently coexist.

### Ferritin triggers neutrophil extracellular trap-mediated cytokine storm through msr1 contributing to adult-onset Still's disease pathogenesis [^115UdQ6h]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Hyperferritinemic syndrome, an overwhelming inflammatory condition, is characterized by high serum ferritin level and sustained by excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to a cytokine storm. It encompasses four clinical conditions, including adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome (CAPS), and septic shock, all of which are burdened by multi-organ failure and high mortality rate. Recently, severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has been recognized as a fifth member of this spectrum due to similar clinical and laboratory features. Understanding the potential mechanisms triggering the development of a pernicious inflammatory loop in cytokine storm is critical to make targeted therapeutics. Ferritin is an iron storage protein and preserved throughout species. It was previously thought to be an acute-phase protein only as a biomarker of systemic inflammation, but there is accumulating evidence that hyperferritinemia is not only a consequence of the inflammatory process but also a critical part of the pathogenic mechanism. Regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, ferritin can further promote expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, providing interesting insights on its association with cytokine storm. To date, the mechanism of how ferritin plays a pathogenic role in facilitating the inflammatory burden in hyperferritinemic syndrome remains to be determined.

AGA iron deficiency anemia diagnosis — In patients with anemia, the AGA recommends using a cutoff of 45 ng/mL over 15 ng/mL when using ferritin to diagnose iron deficiency, and in patients with inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, other laboratory tests such as C-reactive protein, transferrin saturation, or soluble transferrin saturation, may be needed in conjunction with ferritin to diagnose iron deficiency anemia.

### An exploratory analysis of routine ferritin measurement upon admission and the prognostic implications of low-grade ferritinemia during inflammation [^113j4wkN]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Serum ferritin is usually measured in the presence of anemia or in suspected iron overload syndromes. Ferritin is also an acute-phase protein that is elevated during systemic inflammation. However, the prognostic value of routinely measuring ferritin upon admission to a medical facility is not clear. Therefore, we examined the association between ferritin concentrations measured at the time of hospital admission with 30-day and long-term mortality.

Methods

We obtained routine ferritin measurements taken within 24 hours of admission in 2859 patients hospitalized in an internal medicine department. Multiple clinical and laboratory parameters were used to assess the association between ferritin and overall mortality during a median follow-up of 15 months (interquartile range [IQR] 8–22).

Results

Ferritin levels were associated with increased 30-day mortality rates (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–1.06) for each 100 ng/mL increase. Patients with intermediate (78–220 ng/mL) and high (> 221 ng/mL) ferritin concentrations (2nd and 3rd tertiles) had higher 30-day mortality rates even after adjustment for age, sex, and existing comorbidities (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.70–2.5). Long-term overall mortality rates demonstrated a similar pattern across ferritin tertiles (hazard ratio [HR] 1.54, 95% CI 1.39–1.71).

Conclusions

Routine admission ferritin concentrations are linearly and independently correlated with excess mortality risk in hospitalized patients, even those with apparently "normal" ferritin concentrations (< 300 mg/mL). Thus, low-grade ferritinemia might not be an innocent finding in the context of the inflammatory response. Its potential biological and therapeutic implications warrant future research.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^113eMMXn]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Serum ferritin — assessment in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes threshold-based interpretation and important caveats: the WHO and American Academy of Pediatrics definitions note iron deficiency at ferritin levels below 12 and 15 μg/L in otherwise healthy children, while in adult IBD guidance serum ferritin levels below 30 μg/L are highly suggestive of iron deficiency and levels above 100 μg/L are unlikely; values between 30 and 100 μg/L may still indicate iron deficiency with inflammation, and post–intravenous iron ferritin may be misleading for up to 8 weeks. Interpretation requires consideration of inflammatory markers because ferritin is an acute phase reactant and can be altered by non–iron-related conditions.

### Association of serum ferritin levels and methylprednisolone treatment with outcomes in nonintubated patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia [^113JLVsq]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

While several studies have reported that elevated ferritin levels are associated with worse outcomes in COVID-19, there are no data on nonlinear associations with outcomes or interactions with immunomodulatory therapies for outcomes. Our observations suggest that serum ferritin levels may reflect the balance between beneficial host immune responses vs deleterious inflammatory overresponse in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Therefore, although serum levels up to 1300 ng/mL (the upper tertile cutoff in our study) would be outside reference ranges in the context of an elective evaluation, this degree of ferritin elevation may reflect a healthy host response to an acute infection like COVID-19, indicating activation of a beneficial defensive mechanism. As corticosteroids act broadly, inhibiting multiple pathways in the inflammatory process, suppressing this moderate, healthy response may lead to worse outcomes. Conversely, ferritin elevations beyond this level (> 1300 ng/mL) may reflect a dysregulated, harmful inflammatory overresponse where corticosteroids can help. Therefore, the possibility that corticosteroids may have dramatically different effects depending on the degree of host immune response, especially in the context of adjunct immunomodulatory therapies (eg, monoclonal antibodies), needs further investigation.

Limitations

Our study has several limitations. First, despite using a propensity score–based method (inverse probability of treatment weighting) to minimize bias for corticosteroid use, it is likely that there is still residual confounding by indication and other unobserved confounders. Second, ferritin levels were available in 85% of potentially eligible patients during the cohort inception period, and this may have introduced bias. Third, despite the high event rate in this high-risk COVID-19 cohort, the sample size and thus the absolute number of events was relatively small, and this may have led to unstable estimates in subgroups. This is likely the reason for the inconsistent findings regarding the differential association of methylprednisolone with mortality vs the composite of death or mechanical ventilation in the ferritin subgroups. Fourth, we studied the differential outcomes of methylprednisolone treatment in association with ferritin levels on presentation among patients receiving high-flow oxygen; therefore, our results may not apply to milder forms of COVID-19. Fifth, the use and timing of other therapies for COVID-19 has changed substantially over time, as has the case mix of patients admitted to hospitals with COVID-19, compared with the early waves of the pandemic. Therefore, our findings may not be generalizable to patients currently being admitted with COVID-19.

### Could ferritin level be an indicator of COVID-19 disease mortality? [^113mdAPy]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

While the number of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases is increasing day by day, there is limited information known about the hematological and laboratory findings of the disease. We aimed to investigate whether serum ferritin level predicts mortality is a marker for rapid progression for inpatients. Our study included 56 patients who were died due to COVID-19 as the study group, and 245 patients who were hospitalized and recovered as the control group. The laboratory data of the patients were evaluated from the first blood tests (pre) taken from the first moment of admission to the hospital and the blood tests taken from before the patient's discharge or exitus (post) were evaluated retrospectively. The mean age of the nonsurvivor group was 62.0 ± 15.7 and the mean age of the control group was 54.34 ± 13.03. Age and length of stay are significantly higher in the nonsurvivor group. When comparing the pre- and postvalues of ferritin, according to the two groups separately, there was no significant difference in the control group and a high level of significance was observed in the nonsurvivor group (p < .01). COVID-19 disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 causes high mortality with widespread inflammation and cytokine storm. Ferritin is a cheap and widespread available marker, ferritin, which can be used for its predictivity of the mortality and hope it would be a useful marker for clinicians for the management of the disease.

### COVID-19 gone bad: a new character in the spectrum of the hyperferritinemic syndrome? [^111FXofC]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

The severe form of COVID-19 share several clinical and laboratory features with four entities gathered under the term "hyperferritinemic syndromes" and including macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome (CAPS) and septic shock. COVID-19 systemic inflammatory reaction and "hyperferritinemic syndromes" are all characterized by high serum ferritin and a life-threatening hyper-inflammation sustained by a cytokines storm which eventually leads to multi-organ failure. In this review, we analyze the possible epidemiological and molecular mechanisms responsible for hyper-inflammation in patients with severe COVID-19 and we underline the similarities between this condition and "hyperferritinemic syndromes" which would allow considering severe COVID-19 as a fifth member of this spectrum of inflammatory conditions.

### The unique aspects of presentation and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in adults [^111JJk46]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) was initially described as an inflammatory condition affecting young children but is increasingly diagnosed in adults. Presenting features such as fever, cytopenias, phagocytosis, elevated ferritin, and increased levels of soluble IL-2 receptor are common in both age groups, but the prevalence of several clinical and biochemical criteria differ between pediatric and adult patients. Specifically, an elevated ferritin level does not have the same specificity for HLH in adults, and many other inflammatory conditions need to be considered in the differential. In contrast to the high incidence of infectious triggers seen in pediatric HLH, HLH in adults is often precipitated by a hematologic malignancy. Malignancy-associated HLH has unique manifestations and a uniformly very poor prognosis. Given these differences, diagnostic scoring systems unique to adult HLH have been proposed, and additional prognostic clinical and immunologic parameters are being explored. Although a genetic predisposition is increasingly found to underlie cases of adult-onset HLH, the mutations are less likely to be bi-allelic and differ slightly from those seen in pediatric cases of familial HLH. The facilitating genetic and environmental factors governing presentation of HLH in adults remain elusive. Understanding the clinical aspects and pathophysiology specific to adults with HLH is necessary to tailor therapies derived in pediatric disease to this under-recognized population.

### Assessment of the serum ferritin level in patients with different subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and its association with disease activity [^1176MTXJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In adult patients with arthritis, serum ferritin is a well-established inflammatory marker, as reported in several studies. Elevated levels of serum ferritin were found in 89% of patients with adult-onset Still's disease. In another study, the mean serum ferritin level was greater in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with active disease than in those with inactive disease (according to the DAS28 score).

In other autoimmune inflammatory diseases, viz. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and serum ferritin levels are positively correlated with the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) score, with a higher score (≥ 11) correlating with a higher serum ferritin level.

In Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), one of the dreaded complication of sJIA, serum ferritin level had been included in the classification criteria & is associated with the largest change followed by other markers.

There have been very few studies on serum ferritin levels in other forms of JIA (nonsystemic) apart from sJIA in other countries.

In our country, most JIA patients present with severe forms of the disease with a long duration. Patients with JIA may have abnormal serum ferritin levels, which may have diagnostic potential for systemic JIA as well as nonsystemic JIA with high disease activity.

In this study, we aimed to assess the serum ferritin levels in different subtypes of JIA patients and their associations with disease activity.

### Macrophage activation marker soluble CD163 associated with fatal and severe Ebola virus disease in humans [^114hTEhz]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

In healthy persons, the ferritin level is 10–250 ng/mL and used clinically as a marker of iron storage. Ferritin is also known as an acute-phase reactant that is elevated nonspecifically in the context of inflammation. In HLH and MAS, ferritin levels can be markedly high. Hyperferritinemia was observed in patients with EVD, where ferritin levels were as high as 1 × 10 5 ng/mL, which is 3 logs of magnitude over the upper limit of normal. In HLH and MAS, the source of ferritin causing the extremely high blood levels is thought to be the activated macrophage population. In EVD, the liver could also be the source of the ferritin, as has been noted in animal models.

Elevations in serum triglycerides can occur in response to inflammation; this rise in concentration is thought to be mediated by cytokine-dependent increases in hepatic secretion. The elevated triglycerides seen in severe and fatal cases of EVD would be consistent with this finding, considering these same patients have marked increases in proinflammatory cytokines. Therefore, the finding of elevated triglycerides probably represents a response to rather than an initiator of pathology.

### Proceedings of the 32nd European paediatric rheumatology congress [^115d4EiK]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Results: We identified 169 episodes of ferritin > 1000 ng/ml, with a median value of 1785 ng/ml (range: 1007–75313 ng/ml). A total of 149 patients were included with a median age of 9.0 years (IQR, 3.0–14.0), 60% males.

Hyperferritinemia was related to inflammatory conditions in 36% of patients (24% HLH/MAS, 12% rheumatologic diseases), infections (25%), hemoglobinopathies (18%), malignancies (1%) and an heterogenous group of other conditions (30%). Among rheumatic patients, most had SD (67%) and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (24%), followed by systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile dermatomyositis and ANCA-associated vasculitis (5%). Interestingly, within the "other" group hyperferritinemia was observed mainly in hemolytic uremic syndromes (HUS) (29%), chronic renal insufficiency (20%) and hepatological diseases (18%), followed by DRESS and myocarditis/pericarditis (6%)

The median ferritin in the MAS/HLH group was significantly higher (3793 ng/ml, IQR 1655–13513) than in the rheumatic group (1700 ng/ml, IQR 1111–3753) and in the other conditions (1491 ng/ml, IQR 1189–2674).

Most episodes (80%) required hospitalization (with a median length of 13.0 days). Intensive care (ICU) admission was required in 27% of cases. Four patients (2%) died (1 EBV-HLH, 2 severe liver insufficiencies and 1 sepsis in HUS), with a median ferritin of 14119 ng/ml (range 1420–51300 ng/ml).

Conclusion: Marked elevated ferritin is a sensitive critical biomarker for the detection of potentially deadly inflammatory conditions such as MAS/HLH. However, a sizable number of patients presented hyperferritinemia in the context of other pediatric disorders, suggesting the need of implementing a diagnostic rule to assist physicians in the early differential of hyperferritinemic conditions.

Table 7
Laboratory Findings in Patients with HH

Serum ferritin has less biological variability than TS, but it has a significant false positive rate because of elevations related to inflammation. Ferritin can be elevated in the absence of increased iron stores in patients with necroinflammatory liver disease (alcoholic liver disease [ALD], chronic hepatitis B and C, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD]), in lymphomas, and in patients with other nonhepatic chronic inflammatory conditions. In fact, in the general population, iron overload is not the most common cause of an elevated ferritin level. Nonetheless, in the absence of other inflammatory processes, several studies of families with HH have demonstrated that the serum ferritin concentration provides a valuable correlation with the degree of body iron stores. In most circumstances, serum ferritin provides additional confirmation of the significance of an elevated TS in C282Y homozygotes. In a study of individuals < 35 years of age, serum ferritin in the normal range in combination with a TS < 45% had a negative predictive value of 97% for excluding iron overload. In a large study correlating phenotypic and genotypic markers in a primary care population in California, a serum ferritin > 250 μg/L in men and > 200 μg/L in women was positive in 77% and 56%, respectively, of C282Y homozygotes. In the HEIRS (HEmochromatosis and IRon Overload Screening) study that screened 99,711 North American participants, serum ferritin levels were elevated (> 300 μg/L in men, > 200 μg/L in women) in 57% of female and 88% of male C282Y homozygotes. It is recognized that a variety of disease conditions unrelated to iron overload may cause a nonspecific rise in serum ferritin, and in the absence of an elevated TS, this rise may be nonspecific. Conversely, iron overload may be present in a patient with an elevated ferritin and a normal TS, particularly in non– HFE -related iron overload or in a C282Y/H63D compound heterozygote.

### Highly elevated ferritin levels and the diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [^115uUrMs]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a potentially lethal condition characterized by a pathologic inflammation. The diagnostic criteria for HLH include fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, abnormal natural killer cell (NK cell) functional assay, elevated soluble IL-2Ralpha level, and elevated ferritin level (> 500 microg/L). Institution of timely therapy in these critically ill patients may be delayed by difficulties establishing the diagnosis. NK cell functional assay and soluble IL-2Ralpha level may require send-out to a specialized lab. However, ferritin level is available on a same-day basis at most institutions. In this study, we examined the utility of quantitative ferritin levels in diagnosing HLH.

Procedure

All patients with ferritin values > 500 microg/L obtained at Texas Children's Hospital between January 10, 2003 and January 10, 2005 were identified. Patient charts were reviewed for ferritin levels and hospital course.

Results

During the study interval, 330 patients had ferritin levels > 500 microg/L. Ten of the 330 patients were diagnosed with HLH. A ferritin level over 10,000 microg/L was 90% sensitive and 96% specific for HLH. Another diagnostic category with significantly elevated ferritin level was illness of unknown cause (n = 10), and only two of these patients were fully evaluated for HLH.

Conclusions

Ferritin levels above 10,000 microg/L appear to be specific and sensitive for HLH. In patients without a significant medical history and a new onset of febrile illness with highly elevated ferritin levels, the diagnosis of HLH should be evaluated.

### Best but not perfect: indirect measure of low iron stores [^115WFgXM]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Although making the correct diagnosis of iron deficiency is critical for patient care, the use of indirect markers obtained through routine phlebotomy presents a challenge. Low serum iron, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin, and MCV are characteristic of iron deficiency but can also result from inflammation. In addition, hemoglobin and MCV may be low due to genetic causes and, in the case of hemoglobin, to diurnal variation rather than iron deficiency. Transferrin concentrations tend to increase with iron deficiency and decrease with inflammation, whereas transferrin receptor levels rise with both iron deficiency and inflammation. Serum ferritin is an attractive marker because a very low level (< 10 μg/L) is diagnostic of iron deficiency as documented by absent stainable iron in a bone marrow aspirate. However, serum ferritin can be normal or even elevated when iron deficiency is documented by absent bone marrow stainable iron. A recent Cochrane review of 512 adults presenting for medical care at various institutions found that a serum ferritin < 30 μg/L had 98% specificity and 79% sensitivity for diagnosing iron deficiency as documented by absent bone marrow iron.

Lahtiharju et al make a remarkable contribution by evaluating the relationship of indirect measures of iron status to bone marrow iron stain in 6610 patients and providing evidence that ferritin is the most reliable single biomarker for predicting reduced iron stores. This finding is consistent with studies dated decades ago that established ferritin as a key standalone indicator of iron status. This study also underscores the limitations of ferritin, particularly its low sensitivity. Using a ferritin cutoff of 30 μg/L, the specificity rates were impressively high at 97% for females and 99% for males, but the sensitivity rates were only 54% and 35%, respectively. This indicates that while a ferritin of 30 μg/L or lower is highly specific for low or absent bone marrow iron, it is not sensitive enough to detect all cases of low iron stores, especially in patients with comorbid conditions that can increase ferritin levels. It is important to recognize that in this study, there were females with serum ferritin > 1750 μg/L and males with serum ferritin > 4967 μg/L who had low or absent bone marrow iron stores.

Hyperferritinemia Screening

Despite many criteria using ferritin cutoffs from 500–700 ng/ml, to improve specificity a cutoff of 1000 ng/ml was used in this study. Serum ferritin levels measured at the UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh clinical laboratory greater than 1000 ng/ml were compiled into an email alert to study PI (SC) twice per week (Fig. 1). The medical records of patients generating alerts were screened and adjudicated by consensus of study team members (SC, MZ, KK). Patients were categorized into five groups based on real-time chart review: inflammatory hyperferritinemia (IHF), hemoglobinopathy (e.g. sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia, etc.), malignancy undergoing treatment, post-transplant (solid-organ or hematopoietic), and "other". Only patients adjudicated as IHF were eligible for study enrollment and sample collection; patients in the "malignancy" and "post-transplant" groups were excluded due to the complexity of their contributors to hyperferritinemia. Alerts adjudicated as IHF deriving from new (i.e. unenrolled) patients generated a request to the clinical laboratory that remnant sera (kept at 4 0 C) be set moved to a designated area at -20 0 C in the clinical laboratory. Sera were kept at 4 0 C for less than 72 h prior to freezing. Such patients and/or their guardians were then approached for participation in a natural history study. If enrolled, further chart review was performed and patients were further sub-categorized by consensus of the study team into rheumatologic, infection-induced, and immune dysregulation (i.e. IHF not due to rheumatologic or infectious causes) groups (Table S1). Frozen sera from unenrolled patients were discarded after 3 months.

Introduction: Hyperferritinemia is a key biomarker in the diagnosis of a broad spectrum of life-threatening cytokine storms, including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and hyperinflammatory conditions, as Still's disease (SD). However, marked ferritin elevation may also be caused by a wide variety of other complex pediatric conditions, which differential is essential in clinical care.

Objectives: To investigate the underlying etiology of markedly elevated ferritin levels in a tertiary-level pediatric center

Methods: Data of patients evaluated in our center from 2020 to 2024 with at least 1 value greater than 1000 ng/ml were retrospectively reviewed. For each episode of hyperferritinemia, the highest value of serum ferritin available was selected and concomitant other laboratory parameters were collected, together with demographic data, diagnosis and outcomes.

Laboratory Characteristics of Screened Patients

Examining the ferritin distribution, we found that the median ferritin value for IHF patients was significantly higher than both the hemoglobinopathy and transplant groups, and we identified a similar pattern in the distribution of maximum ferritin values (Fig. 3 A-B).

Fig. 3
Distribution of ferritin values and maximum ferritin value per distinct patient by disease group for all alerts (A-B). Of enrolled patients, all and maximum ferritins by subgroup of inflammatory hyperferritinemia (C-D), and maximum values for other HLH-related laboratory criteria by subgroup of inflammatory hyperferritinemia (E-I). ✱ p < 0.05, ✱✱ p < 0.01, ✱✱✱ p < 0.001, ✱✱✱✱ p < 0.0001 Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn's post-test; only comparisons with p < 0.05 shown

Within the IHF group, patients with rheumatologic hyperferritinemia had a significantly higher mean ferritin compared to the infection and immune dysregulation subgroups (p < 0.0001 for both). This general trend continued, but did not reach significance, when only comparing individual patient maximum ferritin values (Fig. 3 C-D). Assessing other markers of hyperinflammation across the subgroups of inflammatory hyperferritinemia, we found all three subgroups mounted varying levels of acute inflammatory or tissue damage responses. Both infection and rheumatologic groups showed significantly higher maximum CRP levels than the immune dysregulation group (P = 0.037, P = 0.047 respectively). There was no significant difference in maximum triglyceride, minimum platelet, or minimum fibrinogen levels between groups. Though not statistically significant, there was a trend toward higher AST elevation in the immune dysregulation group (Fig. 3 E-I).

### Elevated serum levels of interleukin-18 discriminate Still's disease from other autoinflammatory conditions: results from the European immunAID cohort [^113ypYBt]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We measured serum levels of IL-1β, IL-18 and their inhibitors, as well as IFN-γ, in a unique prospective cohort of 273 patients with SAID and showed that Still's disease differs from other SAID with a specific cytokine profile characterised by elevated total and free IL-18 as well as increased concentrations of IFN-γ. Also, we established a strong correlation between serum levels of IL-18 and ferritin, but not with other biological or clinical markers of disease activity. Moreover, we could not identify a particular clinical presentation of Still's disease associated with higher IL-18 levels. Drawing ROC curves, we demonstrated that total IL-18 allowed the diagnosis of Still's disease, among other SAID, with good sensitivity and specificity, ahead of ferritin and free IL-18, and was a much more accurate diagnostic marker than any other measured cytokines and inhibitors. Finally, longitudinal analyses in Still's disease patients untreated at inclusion showed that, among cytokines, free IL-18 was the only measured parameter that significantly decreased after treatment, particularly in patients who achieved complete remission as assessed by treating physicians.

Several publications have indicated that serum levels of IL-18 are elevated in Still's disease patients, in both children, the so-called sJIA, as well as in AOSD, now consensually considered as a unique disease. IL-18 is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine, the biological activity of which is tightly regulated by various mechanisms, including its naturally occurring inhibitor, IL-18BP, that binds to IL-18 as a decoy receptor and prevents its interaction with IL-18 receptors (IL-18R). Importantly, the binding affinity of IL-18BP to its ligand is largely superior to that of IL-18R, thus considerably limiting the biologic activity of IL-18. IL-18BP is present in large excess in the blood, so that most of circulating IL-18 is biologically inactive. The available commercial immunoassays for IL-18 detection do not distinguish IL-18 present in IL-18BP/IL-18 complexes and free bioactive IL-18. We previously developed and validated an immunoassay that allows specific measurement of free IL-18 and demonstrated that free IL-18 was uniquely detectable in Still's disease, in comparison to other rheumatic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing and systemic lupus erythematosus spondylarthritis, or some mSAID, including CAPS or FMF.

### Elevated serum levels of interleukin-18 discriminate Still's disease from other autoinflammatory conditions: results from the European immunAID cohort [^116xt3Vb]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs) represent a set of conditions with exaggerated innate immune responses. IL-1β and IL-18 are key cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of some SAID. We aimed to assess the diagnostic value of serum levels of IL-1β, IL-18, their respective inhibitors IL-1Ra and IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP), and IFN-γ in SAID.

Methods

A cohort of patients with active SAID, including monogenic (mSAID) and genetically undiagnosed SAID (guSAID) from different European countries, with active disease at inclusion, was established. Serum levels of cytokines were measured by immunoassays.

Results

Sera from 53 mSAID, 220 guSAID and 49 controls without inflammatory disease were analysed. Serum levels of total and free IL-18 were significantly increased in Still's disease in comparison to most SAID and non-inflammatory controls. Levels of total IL-18 were also elevated in patients with familial Mediterranean fever to a comparable extent as in Still's disease. In contrast, free IL-18 levels were selectively higher in Still's disease. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that total IL-18 was the most sensitive and specific marker for the diagnosis of Still's disease (area under the curve = 0.91). There was a positive correlation between IL-18 and ferritin. In 10 patients with Still's disease who had a second blood collection, we found a significant decrease in serum levels of free IL-18 after treatment.

Conclusions

Our results show that IL-18 can discriminate Still's disease from other SAID, and free IL-18 levels may be relevant to assess response to therapy in these patients.

Diagnosing HLH

HLH causes a constellation of non-specific findings, including persistent fever, altered mental state, rash, cytopenias affecting all cell lines (often with thrombocytopenia initially), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and transaminitis. Typically patients have hyperferritinaemia (highly elevated ferritin > 10 000 μg/l may be pathognomic of HLH in some contexts) with elevated triglycerides and decreasing fibrinogen. However, often one or more of these abnormalities is not seen.

Key to early detection of HLH before the 'tipping point' into hyperinflammation is interpretation of patterns of results rather than absolute values and recognizing worrying trends (e.g. decreasing ESR in a patient with a known chronic disease).

The absence of haemophagocytosis on bone marrow can be falsely reassuring. The test is not 100% sensitive, and it may not be present in up to 30% of cases or only appear on repeat testing. Furthermore, haemophagocytosis on bone marrow, or in other tissues, is not binary, nor is it sufficient to make the diagnosis of HLH — some degree of haemophagocytosis can be present in the marrow of patients without HLH. Close collaboration with haematologists when managing HLH is therefore essential.

In the paediatric and adult populations, hyperferritinaemia is shown to be both sensitive and specific as a marker for HLH and MAS in 'at-risk' patients and a marker of response to treatment. Diagnostic algorithms have been developed utilizing ferritin, given its wide availability and low cost. Hyperferritinaemia is not specific for HLH in the adult population as a whole, being seen in a number of other conditions including renal failure, liver failure, and iron overload.

pHLH has an established set of diagnostic criteria — the Histiocyte Society's HLH-2004 criteria [see Table 1]. These criteria have been extrapolated to the diagnosis of sHLH; however, there is concern that this leads to underrecognition. For instance, features well recognized in adults [such as elevated LDH and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)] are not included in the diagnostic criteria, and some of the variables measured in the HLH-2004 criteria are not readily available in many hospitals.

Managing ID in IBDs

Characteristics of ID in IBDs

In the majority of cases, both absolute and functional ID are present in patients with IBD, resulting from the combination of different mechanisms — digestive blood loss (mainly chronic), malnutrition, impaired intestinal iron absorption, intestinal resection, inflammatory syndrome, and so on.

Iron biomarker thresholds

The criteria for the biological diagnosis of ID are controversial. The choice and definition of threshold values are complicated by the variable intensity of the inflammatory state that accompanies the relapses and remissions of chronic IBD. The European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation consensus proposes a definition that considers an associated inflammatory syndrome. ID is defined as serum ferritin ≤ 100 µg/L in the presence of concomitant inflammation (CRP ≥ 5 mg/L) or serum ferritin < 30 µg/L in the absence of inflammation (CRP < 5 mg/L); ID is absolute if serum ferritin is < 30 µg/L or TSAT is < 16% whereas ID is functional if serum ferritin is < 100 µg/L and TSAT is < 16%. According to the British Society of Gastroenterology, serum ferritin is the most specific assay for ID in the absence of inflammation — serum ferritin < 30 µg/L is generally indicative of low iron stores, and serum ferritin < 15 µg/L is indicative of absent iron stores. Therefore, serum ferritin < 15 µg/L is considered highly specific for ID; TSAT < 20% indicates iron restriction. In the presence of inflammation (for example, elevated CRP), the threshold for ID is serum ferritin < 100 µg/L.

Clinical evidence for iron therapy

A systematic review of randomized clinical trials comparing oral versus parenteral supplementation in adult patients with IBD included five trials with nearly 700 participants. Meta‐analysis of the data showed that the likelihood of increasing hemoglobin ≥ 2 g/dl was significantly higher with intravenous iron than with oral iron. In contrast, the latter was associated with a substantially higher incidence of treatment discontinuations for adverse events.

Treatment of ID is associated with a significant improvement in physical and mental quality of life, including in patients with ID without anemia.

### Hyperferritinemia screening to aid identification and differentiation of patients with hyperinflammatory disorders [^1146xPwK]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperferritinemia is a critical component in the diagnosis of a spectrum of cytokine storm syndromes (CSS) that includes macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). MAS occurs in rheumatic diseases, most commonly systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis or adult-onset Stills disease (sJIA and AOSD, respectively; hereafter, collectively called Stills Disease), but also complicates systemic lupus erythematosus, Kawasaki disease, juvenile dermatomyositis, and autoinflammatory diseases. HLH most famously arises due to genetic causes (primary HLH), including severe genetic impairment of cytotoxic function (familial HLH, FHL). HLH is more commonly diagnosed in patients with infection or malignancy. In addition to hyperferritinemia, hallmark features of HLH/MAS include cytopenias, liver injury, hepato- and/or splenomegaly, coagulopathy, and histologic hemophagocytosis. HLH/MAS can occur in nearly any inflammatory context, and treatment and prognosis can vary dramatically depending on specific infectious/inflammatory triggers, genetic susceptibilities, and underlying diseases with mortality ranging from 5 to 40%. The underlying immunopathology makes patients at risk of organ failure and death. Therefore, early and appropriate interventions are critical for minimizing morbidity and mortality.

Despite the importance of early identification, we currently lack specific diagnostic biomarkers. Diagnostic and classification criteria for MAS and HLH rely on routine laboratory tests (e.g. ferritin, cell counts, liver transaminases, fibrinogen, triglycerides) that are individually non-specific and on specialized testing (NK function, soluble IL-2R, CD107a mobilization, bone marrow biopsy) that does not perform much better and take a prolonged time to result. In practice, individual test results do not capture dynamic changes in lab values and were not developed for early recognition. Hyperferritinemia can be driven by inflammation and/or immune dysregulation, but is also observed in malignancy, infection, and iron overload states. Nevertheless, hyperferritenemia is associated with mortality across all hospitalized children.

Elevation of IFNγ-induced biomarkers like CXCL9 and IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) are associated with disease activity in both MAS and HLH. In retrospective studies, dramatic elevation of total interleukin-18 (IL-18), with detectable free IL-18, has been associated with MAS. Though promising, these specialized tests are not obtained on a routine clinical basis.

Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism V.10.3.1. Variables were considered non-parametric. Age, disease duration and disease activity were shown as medians with IQR. Levels of cytokines and their inhibitors, CRP and ferritin were represented as individual values (dot plots) and expressed as medians with IQR. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare two groups, and the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare > 2 groups. Correlations were made using the Spearman's rank correlation analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to assess the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for Still's disease of the different tested biomarkers.

### Prognostic and predictive biomarkers in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 treated with tocilizumab in a randomized controlled trial [^113AmX9Z]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Ferritin was the only biomarker in this exploratory analysis that predicted the effects of tocilizumab treatment in COVACTA across multiple clinical outcomes. During infection and inflammation, ferritin, as a marker of myeloid cell activation in blood and inflamed tissue, is released from activated macrophages and hepatocytes to protect cells from oxidative damage and sequester iron from pathogens. Once released, it can further activate macrophages to produce cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1β, driving a positive feedback loop of ferritin-inducing proinflammatory cytokine release. Altered myeloid cell activation, elevated IL-6 levels, and elevated ferritin levels were reported in COVID-19 and correlated with increased severity of COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, elevated ferritin levels decreased significantly after tocilizumab administration in patients with severe COVID-19, suggesting a possible mechanism underlying the predictive value of ferritin for tocilizumab treatment effects in this patient population. Further investigation of downstream mechanisms of IL-6 and ferritin signaling interaction, such as single-cell analysis of pulmonary cells, might elucidate how elevated ferritin levels predict benefit from inhibition of IL-6 activity in patients with severe COVID-19.

Although IL-6 and CRP demonstrated strong prognostic value as disease biomarkers in COVID-19, elevated levels of IL-6 or CRP at baseline were not predictive for tocilizumab treatment effects in the overall COVACTA population. IL-6 only demonstrated a trend for predictive value among the subgroup of patients who required high-flow oxygen and noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation (ordinal scale categories 4 and 5) at baseline. Similarly, baseline CRP using a cutoff of 75 mg/L, the same cutoff used in RECOVERY, was predictive for tocilizumab effect on time to hospital discharge but not for other endpoints. CRP was not predictive in continuous or tertile analyses. This is consistent with the findings of the REMAP-CAP study, in which CRP levels at baseline did not predict tocilizumab efficacy. These results might be counterintuitive given that tocilizumab inhibits IL-6 signaling; however, it is unclear how IL-6 activity in blood is associated with tocilizumab efficacy in complex immunologic diseases. For patients with COVID-19, investigation into how peripheral IL-6 and CRP levels are associated with tocilizumab effects on hyperinflammation and dysregulated immune responses in affected tissue, in particular the lung, is warranted.

### Elevated serum levels of interleukin-18 discriminate Still's disease from other autoinflammatory conditions: results from the European immunAID cohort [^112A6n5H]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs) represent a set of conditions with exaggerated innate immune responses. IL-1β and IL-18 are key cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of some SAID. We aimed to assess the diagnostic value of serum levels of IL-1β, IL-18, their respective inhibitors IL-1Ra and IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP), and IFN-γ in SAID.

Methods

A cohort of patients with active SAID, including monogenic (mSAID) and genetically undiagnosed SAID (guSAID) from different European countries, with active disease at inclusion, was established. Serum levels of cytokines were measured by immunoassays.

Results

Sera from 53 mSAID, 220 guSAID and 49 controls without inflammatory disease were analysed. Serum levels of total and free IL-18 were significantly increased in Still's disease in comparison to most SAID and non-inflammatory controls. Levels of total IL-18 were also elevated in patients with familial Mediterranean fever to a comparable extent as in Still's disease. In contrast, free IL-18 levels were selectively higher in Still's disease. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that total IL-18 was the most sensitive and specific marker for the diagnosis of Still's disease (area under the curve = 0.91). There was a positive correlation between IL-18 and ferritin. In 10 patients with Still's disease who had a second blood collection, we found a significant decrease in serum levels of free IL-18 after treatment.

Conclusions

Our results show that IL-18 can discriminate Still's disease from other SAID, and free IL-18 levels may be relevant to assess response to therapy in these patients.

### Interplay between iron metabolism, inflammation, and EPO-ERFE-hepcidin axis in RDEB-associated chronic anemia [^113kyg1Z]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a genodermatosis characterized by severe cutaneous and mucosal fragility, and frequently complicated by multifactorial chronic anemia that responds poorly to conventional therapies. This cross-sectional study investigates the factors contributing to anemia in RDEB by analyzing a representative cohort, that was stratified by disease severity, anemia, and iron status, to examine their hematological parameters, cytokine profile, and the erythropoietin-erythroferrone-hepcidin (EPO-ERFE-hepcidin) axis. Anemia was present in 50% of the cohort. Hemoglobin levels showed a strong negative correlation with the percentage of body surface area affected and C-reactive protein levels (CRP), identifying these as anemia risk factors in RDEB. Moderate-severe inflammation (CRP ≥ 15 mg/L) was observed in all patients with anemia, but no specific cytokine profile was linked with anemia risk because of variability in interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon-γ levels. The regulation of the EPO-ERFE-hepcidin axis showed discrepancies with the patterns expected based on patients' anemia severity and iron status. According to the reticulocyte production index, an inadequate bone marrow response was observed in 90% of patients with anemia, irrespective of EPO levels. Patients with functional or true iron deficiency had higher ERFE levels, although ERFE showed no consistent correlation with EPO and was elevated in both patients with anemia and those without anemia. Elevated hepcidin was primarily linked to the highest ferritin levels, mostly in patients with a history of iron infusions and/or transfusions. These findings highlight the need for personalized, targeted approaches that address the complex interplay between inflammation and iron dysregulation, to improve anemia management in RDEB and other chronic inflammatory conditions.

### Elevated serum levels of interleukin-18 discriminate Still's disease from other autoinflammatory conditions: results from the European immunAID cohort [^112Q1Ep5]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the specificities of Still's disease in terms of cytokine profile and ferritin levels, and as it represented the largest sample size (61 cases), we decided to analyse this group of patients separately (figure 2B). There was a positive correlation between serum levels of ferritin and IL-18 (r = 0.600 for total IL-18, r = 0.558 for free IL-18) and IL-18BP (r = 0.444). Free IL-18 correlated with AST (r = 0.432). Levels of IFN-γ correlated with total and free IL-18 (r = 0.550 and r = 0.404), as well as with IL-18BP levels (r = 0.565) and ferritin (r = 0.448). Total IL-18, but not free IL-18, correlated with IL-18BP (r = 0.491). IL-1β correlated with IL-1Ra (r = 0.470). None of the clinical scores (Disease activity assessment score as well as dedicated sJADAS, Pouchot's or modified Pouchot's scores) correlated with the levels of cytokines or their inhibitors. We also compared the levels of total and free IL-18 in patients with Still's disease according to the clinical presentation at inclusion (ie, presence or absence of cutaneous rash, type of musculoskeletal involvement — arthralgia vs arthritis, myalgias) but found no significant differences between subgroups (data not shown).

### Marked hyperferritinemia does not predict for HLH in the adult population [^113FLwbk]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare syndrome of uncontrolled immune activation that has gained increasing attention during the last decade. The diagnosis of HLH is based on a constellation of clinical and laboratory abnormalities, including elevated serum ferritin levels. In the pediatric population, marked hyperferritinemia is specific for HLH. To determine what conditions are associated with profoundly elevated ferritin in the adult population, we performed a retrospective analysis in a large academic health care system. We identified 113 patients with serum ferritin levels higher than 50,000 µg/L. The most frequently observed conditions included renal failure, hepatocellular injury, infections, and hematologic malignancies. Our results suggest that marked hyperferritinemia can be seen in a variety of conditions and is not specific for HLH in adults.

|-|-|
|Fever|- Typically spiking with temperature ≥ 39 °C for at least 7 days|
|Rash|- Transient and often coincides with fever spikes, preferentially involving trunk <br/> - Typically erythematous (salmon pink), but other rashes (such as urticarial) may be consistent with the diagnosis|
|Musculoskeletal involvement|- Usually presents with arthralgia/myalgia <br/> - Overt arthritis is supportive but not necessary for diagnosis and may appear later|

### Hyperferritinemia in the critically ill child with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis / sepsis / multiple organ dysfunction syndrome / macrophage activation syndrome: what is the treatment? [^116Lv9rS]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

According to guidelines of the International Histiocyte Society, a diagnosis of HLH requires at least five of the following eight criteria are met: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia or hypofibrinogenemia (or both), hyperferritinemia, elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor alpha (IL-2Rα), decreased natural killer (NK) cell activity, and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of HLH is complicated by its relatively non-specific clinical presentation. Although hypercytokinemia is a hallmark of HLH, it has also been associated with sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Soluble IL-2Rα is sensitive and specific for HLH but is also elevated in sepsis/MODS/MAS. Of the various laboratory variables available for HLH diagnosis, the most widely used is ferritin. Ferritin is a ubiquitous iron-binding protein that regulates iron storage and homeostasis. The ferritin heavy-chain gene also positively regulates pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling through the nuclear factor-kappa-B pathway. Hyperferritinemia is frequently seen in the intensive care unit, is a marker of a final common pathway of systemic inflammatory response, and is associated with the severity of the underlying disease. Bennett and colleagues showed that the hazard ratio of death with peak ferritin of greater than 3,000 ng/mL was 4.32. Hyperferritinemia has also been associated with HLH and many other inflammatory conditions such as sepsis, SIRS, MODS, and MAS.

According to the International Histiocyte Society guidelines, the treatment for HLH involves an initial 8 weeks of chemoimmune therapy. The immediate aim of chemotherapy in HLH is suppression of the increased inflammatory response and control of cell proliferation. Clinical case series and case reports and animal models suggest that implementation of the HLH protocol has resulted in improved survival in primary HLH; however, the beneficial effect of the protocol for patients with secondary HLH or MAS is questioned. In an effort not to delay treatment in patients with primary HLH, the International Histiocyte Society recommends treating hyperferritinemia-associated secondary HLH/sepsis/MODS/MAS with the same protocol used for primary HLH. In contrast, our hypothesis is that hyperferritinemia-associated secondary HLH/sepsis/MODS/MAS can be successfully treated with a less immunosuppressive and cytotoxic approach than is recommended for primary HLH.

### Shared inflammatory pathways and therapeutic strategies in COVID-19 and cancer immunotherapy [^113rnWtM]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Other markers including TNF-α, and IFN-γ, and the soluble IL-2 receptor were comparatively lower in COVID-19 than in CAR-T toxicity. Despite their relatively lower serum levels, a recent study showed a potential benefit in early blockage of TNF-α/IFN-γ axis in COVID-19. In another study, combined TNF-α and IL-6 levels at the moment of hospitalization for COVID-19 were proposed as an early predictive marker of mortality. Ferritin, a marker of macrophage activation, increases substantially in patients with severe CAR-T-related CRS and was also found to be elevated in COVID-19.

In summary, despite the differences in the pathophysiology and in the mean serum levels of some cytokines, COVID-19 shares the elevation of IL-6 with CRS due to CAR-T infusions and, in general, shows an inflammatory profile more similar to IMTX-related CRS than to systemic inflammation of other causes.

### Efficacy and secondary infection risk of tocilizumab, sarilumab and anakinra in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111rKizC]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) is a novel human pathogen, responsible for the largest ever global challenge to public health and humanity. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is associated with a dysregulated immune response and hyperinflammation, which can lead to or exacerbate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure. As the pandemic progresses, the pathophysiology of COVID‐19 is becoming clearer and the potential of immunotherapy has increased. However, clinical efficacy and safety of immunosuppressants (including tocilizumab, sarilumab and anakinra) treatment in COVID‐19 patients are not yet known.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection results in a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic forms (with fever, dry cough, myalgia and malaise) to full‐blown viral pneumonia, which can lead to ARDS, multiorgan failure and death. Infection causes destruction of alveolar epithelial cells, activation of the innate immune system and dysregulation of adaptive immune responses, including the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The serum cytokine profile of some patients with moderate to severe COVID‐19 overlaps with those having macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and secondary hemophagocytic lymphocytosis (sHLH). Macrophage activation syndrome is characterised by excessive inflammation, fever, elevated ferritin levels, lung involvement and a range of symptoms including sHLH. Viruses are known as MAS/sHLH triggers, and ferritin levels are associated with MAS and mortality in COVID‐19 patients. Endogenous interleukin 1 (IL‐1) is a pro‐inflammatory cytokine that induces interleukin 6 (IL‐6) production in monocytes and macrophages and is elevated in COVID‐19 disease, MAS and other conditions such as severe chimerical antigen receptor T cell (CAR‐T)‐mediated cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Moreover, plasma IL‐6 levels are elevated in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID‐19 and appear to be positively correlated with mortality. Since the clinical severity of COVID‐19 appears to be related to a cytokines storms, with an overproduction of soluble inflammatory mediators, several immunosuppressants agents are currently under investigation, but results thus far are inconclusive.

### Haemophagocytic lymphohisticytosis-an underrecognized hyperinflammatory syndrome [^1179HwQa]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Once treatment has been tapered, it is necessary to monitor patients for recurrence of inflammation. The risk of recurrence depends on the cause/trigger — patients with genetic HLH almost always relapse without bone marrow transplant. On the other hand, patients with infections or rheumatologic disease are less at risk once the trigger has been controlled. There is no established protocol in terms of blood monitoring for relapse; however, serum ferritin may be useful.

### The hyperferritinemic syndrome: macrophage activation syndrome, Still's disease, septic shock and catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome [^112m2vk4]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Ferritin may also play a role in autoimmunity through its effects on CXCR4. As previously reported, H-ferritin is a negative regulator of CXCR4. This chemokine receptor is known to be significantly up-regulated in monocytes, neutrophils, B cell subsets and plasma cells in murine models of lupus nephritis. Moreover, the treatment of these mice with an antagonist of CXCR4 ameliorated end organ disease.

As described above, pro-inflammatory cytokines can induce ferritin expression; in turn, ferritin may induce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, ferritin induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) is an important mechanism underlying the immunosuppressive effects of ferritin. There seems, therefore, to be a complex interaction between ferritin and cytokines in the control of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators (Figure 2). So, ferritin can be either an immunosuppressive or a pro-inflammatory molecule. These opposing effects are probably dependent on the activation of different pathways, through different receptors, possibly employing different effectors (that is, L- versus H-ferritin), and maybe different contexts. In fact, this last idea resembles the two-hit hypothesis, for instance, in vivo, for the high levels of ferritin to be pathogenic it may require a second hit, like a pro-inflammatory environment, a specific infection or maybe a particular genetic background. Indeed, this may explain why in the case of hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome there are high levels of ferritin without an inflammatory response.

MAS, AOSD, cAPS and septic shock are characterized by life-threatening hyperinflammation with multi-organ failure. Below we will review each one of these conditions in turn and Table 2 summarizes their clinical and laboratory features.

* There is only our study on cAPS and it is a small cohort, and there are only a few studies on ferritin levels in sepsis, so the values of ferritin in these two conditions may be underestimated.

Cardiac risk biomarkers in β-thalassemia major — serum ferritin trends indicate that long-term elevations predict cardiac mortality, but single measurements may mislead; a ferritin level > 2500 μg/L indicates raised risk, risk is increased even down to 1000 μg/L, and a low ferritin does not guarantee freedom from heart failure (HF); inflammation, infection or vitamin C deficiency can alter ferritin, so individual serum ferritin may not reflect total body iron load or cardiac risk.

### Systemic inflammation modulates the ability of serum ferritin to predict all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in peritoneal dialysis patients [^111GW5aS]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study demonstrates that systemic inflammation has an important effect on the relationship between serum ferritin and the survival of patients undergoing PD. Our results show that a relatively high ferritin level is an independent risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among PD patients only in the presence of elevated hsCRP levels.

Serum ferritin has been widely recognized as an acute phase reactant and marker of acute and chronic inflammation independent of its classic role as an iron delivery protein. It is nonspecifically enhanced in several disorders, including liver disease, coronary artery disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. Additionally, elevated serum ferritin levels have been observed in patients with renal impairment, and these elevated levels are closely related to a higher risk of CKD, a rapid decline in renal function and progression to renal replacement therapy (RRT). Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that hyperferritinemia is significantly associated with poor prognosis, including higher mortality in MHD and PD patients, although the threshold values at which serum ferritin contributes to negative outcomes differ between MHD and PD patients; these ferritin levels are higher than the demand for erythropoiesis.

Although the mechanisms underlying the association of higher ferritin levels with mortality are incompletely understood, some explanations have been proposed. Serum ferritin leaks from damaged cells, losing most of its iron on the way, and this released iron is in an unliganded form that can negatively impact health and stimulate further cell damage. Moreover, human circulating ferritin can induce oxidative stress by releasing iron with aminolevulinate, a uremic toxin. These results are in accord with our observation that increased ferritin levels are associated with higher mortality in PD patients.

Inflammation plays a pivotal pathogenic role in ESKD, which is caused by multiple factors, including uremic toxins, dialysis, and comorbidities. Researchers recently proposed that inflammation may modify the association between some clinical indicators and the long-term prognosis of ESKD patients. Thus, in this study, we questioned whether the correlation of higher serum ferritin with mortality is linked to systemic inflammation and investigated the optimal serum ferritin level for predicting death when considering inflammation in PD patients.

### Elevated serum ferritin as a predictor of complications in cirrhotic patients: a retrospective cohort study [^116JpnvR]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

While these traditional scores provide valuable information on hepatic synthetic function and overall disease severity, they do not account for systemic inflammation or disturbances in iron metabolism, both of which are increasingly recognized as contributors to adverse outcomes in cirrhosis. Integrating additional biomarkers, such as serum ferritin, into existing or future prognostic frameworks could enhance risk stratification and improve the precision of clinical decision-making. Ferritin reflects both inflammatory activity and iron stores and may identify high-risk patients who might otherwise be classified in intermediate categories. For example, in patients with a moderate MELD score, markedly elevated serum ferritin levels could prompt closer monitoring, earlier consideration for liver transplantation listing, or proactive management of potential complications. Similarly, ferritin could be particularly valuable in acute decompensation, where inflammatory burden is a key driver of short-term prognosis.

Serum ferritin may thus serve as a valuable marker of disease severity, as its levels have been shown to correlate with histological liver lesions in patients without hemochromatosis. Furthermore, ferritin is a widely available and inexpensive biochemical parameter. Prospective studies are warranted to validate these approaches and to define optimal ferritin cut-off values for clinical decision-making. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the potential of serum ferritin levels as a predictor of complications in patients with cirrhosis, given that it is a routinely measured parameter in this population. Our findings demonstrated a significant association between elevated serum ferritin levels and an increased risk of complications among cirrhotic patients.

### Ferritin triggers neutrophil extracellular trap-mediated cytokine storm through msr1 contributing to adult-onset Still's disease pathogenesis [^1176qiJu]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Hyperferritinemic syndrome, an overwhelming inflammatory condition, is characterized by high ferritin levels, systemic inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction, but the pathogenic role of ferritin remains largely unknown. Here we show in an animal model that ferritin administration leads to systemic and hepatic inflammation characterized by excessive neutrophil leukocyte infiltration and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation in the liver tissue. Ferritin-induced NET formation depends on the expression of peptidylarginine deiminase 4 and neutrophil elastase and on reactive oxygen species production. Mechanistically, ferritin exposure increases both overall and cell surface expression of Msr1 on neutrophil leukocytes, and also acts as ligand to Msr1 to trigger the NET formation pathway. Depletion of neutrophil leukocytes or ablation of Msr1 protect mice from tissue damage and the hyperinflammatory response, which further confirms the role of Msr1 as ferritin receptor. The relevance of the animal model is underscored by the observation that enhanced NET formation, increased Msr1 expression and signalling on neutrophil leukocytes are also characteristic to adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), a typical hyperferritinemic syndrome. Collectively, our findings demonstrate an essential role of ferritin in NET-mediated cytokine storm, and suggest that targeting NETs or Msr1 may benefit AOSD patients.

### Hyperferritinemia screening to aid identification and differentiation of patients with hyperinflammatory disorders [^113aewwx]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Owing to its complexity, heterogeneity, severity, and rapid evolution, severe systemic inflammation poses both biologic and clinical challenges. This complexity is reflected by the terms used to describe it, including SIRS, sepsis, HLH, MAS, cytokine storm, etc. Like most complex disorders, it results from the interplay of genetic susceptibility, background diseases, and inciting triggers, and these features all affect presentation and severity. Timely identification, proper diagnosis, and prompt context-specific management are integral to preventing immunopathology and clinical deterioration. Ferritin is consistently cited as a critical screening biomarker for HLH and related disorders, potentially improved by dividing by ESR. To aid in identifying and monitoring such patients, we implemented a novel hyperferritinemia alert system and ultimately screened 931 alerts from 180 patients over a two-year period. Overall, the process was feasible with minimal staff, clinically useful in identifying and tracking patients at risk for systemic immunopathology, and it significantly aided efforts to collect early research specimens. These features suggest feasibility and generalizability to other care settings. While this study used ferritin values over 1000 ng/ml as a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity, future studies may consider lowering the threshold to 500–700 ng/ml to reflect different MAS/HLH criteria.

Clinical ferritin testing served as the basis for this study, and we did not advertise the study or attempt to influence ferritin ordering practices. Non-inflammatory hyperferritinemia, largely from hemoglobinopathies like sickle cell anemia and post-transplant patients, made up the majority of both total alerts and individual patients. Inflammation may contribute to hyperferritinemia in these patients, including HLH, but we excluded these groups from further analysis given their frequent ferritin testing as part of iron panels and the major contribution of iron overload to their hyperferritinemia. In general, the distribution of diagnoses associated with IHF and its correlation with HLH vary substantially by cut-off value and institutional testing practices. In our cohort, patients with Stills Disease generated the second most alerts. Ferritin is used routinely for screening and monitoring in Stills, and these diagnoses are far more common than primary HLH. We did not identify ferritin values > 1000 in other rheumatic disease patients during this period, suggesting IHF is far more common in Stills Disease relative to other pediatric rheumatologic diseases, but also likely ferritin ordering practices and local prevalence/severity of other rheumatic diseases (particularly systemic lupus erythematosus).

Figure 1
Ferritin structure and function. Ferritin is a major intracellular iron storage protein in all organisms, and its structural properties are largely conserved through species. Apoferritin refers to the iron-free form of the protein; the iron-containing form is termed holoferritin or simply ferritin. Each apoferritin shell comprises 24 subunits of two kinds: a H-subunit and a L-subunit. Depending on the tissue type and physiologic status of the cell, the ratio of H- to L-subunits in ferritin can vary widely. Ferritin H- and L-subunits are mapped on chromosomes 11q23 and 19q13.3, respectively, and both have multiple pseudogenes. H-ferritin plays a major role in the rapid detoxification of iron, while the L-subunit is involved in nucleation, mineralization and long-term storage of iron.

Figure 2
Control of ferritin expression. The expression of ferritin is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by iron, cytokine release, chemokine production, lipopolysaccharide, prostaglandins, hormones, growth factors, second messengers, hyperoxia and hypoxia, and oxidative stress. Cytokines may also affect ferritin translation indirectly through their ability to induce nitric oxide synthase and, hence, increase nitric oxide (NO) (Figure 2). NO, in turn, causes inhibition of ferritin translation. Complex feedback mechanisms between ferritin and cytokines in the control of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators: cytokines can induce ferritin expression; otherwise, ferritin can induce the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

Hyperferritinemia is associated with several inflammatory conditions, such as sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and MAS. In critically ill patients, hyperferritinemia is associated with the severity of the underlying disease. In one study, very high levels of ferritin (> 3,000 ng/ml) were associated with increased mortality in a dose response fashion.

### Elevated serum levels of interleukin-18 discriminate Still's disease from other autoinflammatory conditions: results from the European immunAID cohort [^1179V5aj]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Identification of diagnostic biomarkers for Still's disease

Figure 3 shows that total IL-18 was the most sensitive and specific biomarker for Still's disease with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9103 (p < 0.0001). Both free IL-18 and ferritin were a bit less powerful than total IL-18 (AUC = 0.8295, p < 0.0001 and 0.8549, p < 0.0001). Other biomarkers, including IL-1Ra, IFN-γ and CRP, were less useful to differentiate Still's disease from other autoinflammatory diseases (figure 3). Combining two biomarkers (including total IL-18) did not allow reaching a better AUC than total IL-18 alone (data not shown). A total IL-18 cut-off value of 1.372 ng/mL was associated with the diagnosis of Still's disease with a sensitivity and specificity of 81.97% and 83.49%, respectively.

### Elevated serum ferritin levels are associated with severity and prognosis of severe acute pancreatitis: a preliminary cohort study [^114ipVBt]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Serum ferritin (SF), as an acute-phase response protein, is used to reflect the degree of oxidative stress and systemic inflammatory responses. This study was designed to assess the effect of elevated SF levels on the severity of acute pancreatitis (AP).

Methods

From January 2013 to December 2020, 200 consecutive patients with AP were retrospectively reviewed to analyze the relationships among the etiologies of pancreatitis, the severity of the disease and SF levels. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and logistic regression analysis were used to assess whether elevated SF levels could predict the onset of organ failure in AP.

Results

92 (46%) had high SF levels (> 275 ng/ml). SF levels were not associated with the etiology of AP disease. Among patients with high SF levels, there was a significant increase in the proportion of patients with severe AP (23.1% vs. 76.9%) and a higher proportion of systemic inflammatory response scores (25.9% vs. 44.6%) in comparison to patients with normal SF levels. The area under the ROC curve for SF in predicting persistent organ failure was 0.812 [95% confidence interval 0.721–0.904].

Conclusions

F concentrations were positively correlated with the severity of AP, and quantitative assessment of SF can predict disease severity and organ failure in patients with AP.

### AGA clinical practice update on diet and nutritional therapies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: expert review [^113vJuQi]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease — iron deficiency anemia screening and treatment: all patients with IBD are at risk for anemia. For laboratory screening, a complete blood count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and C-reactive protein should be used. For patients in remission or mild disease, measurements are suggested every 6–12 months, and in active disease it is suggested to repeat screening every 3 months. In the presence of iron deficiency, iron supplementation is advised; intravenous iron is considered more effective and often better tolerated than oral iron, oral iron repletion is reasonable in mild anemia or clinically inactive disease, and dosing is based on baseline hemoglobin and body weight.

### Elevated serum levels of interleukin-18 discriminate Still's disease from other autoinflammatory conditions: results from the European immunAID cohort [^113TPRrD]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Of note, not all patients with Still's disease had elevated free IL-18. The order of magnitude of free IL-18 levels was relatively low even in patients with Still's disease, as previously reported. Free IL-18 levels up to 15 pg/mL must be considered as normal since healthy controls had values in this range. Importantly, we have observed that low levels of free IL-18 cannot be used to rule out a response to Tadekinig alfa in adults with Still's disease. On the other hand, the highest levels (70 pg/mL and above) of free IL-18 appear to be specific to Still's disease. This relative lack of sensitivity explains that the determination of total IL-18 exhibits a better diagnostic accuracy than free IL-18 as demonstrated by AUC values.

As previously reported, ferritin levels correlated nicely with total and free IL-18 in Still's diseasebut also in the whole cohort, though slightly less strongly. A robust correlation between IL-18 and IFN-γ was present in Still's disease, reflecting the role of IL-18 as an IFN-γ-inducing factor. Similarly, we observed a correlation between IFN-γ and IL-18BP that is consistent with the stimulatory effect of IFN-γ. Of note, there was no correlation between IL-18 and clinical scores of disease activity as well as between IL-18 and the recently published Still's activity score(data not shown). It is plausible that this finding is due to the inclusion of patients with active disease according to predefined recruitment criteria.

IL-1β and IL-1Ra measurements were far less informative to distinguish a specific subset of patients with SAID. Although we used a highly sensitive technique to measure IL-1β, its serum levels remained very low, even in diseases that respond to IL-1 blockers, like CAPS, FMF or Schnitzler's syndrome.

### EULAR / PReS recommendations for the diagnosis and management of Still's disease, comprising systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and adult-onset Still's disease [^114zgXd4]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on adult-onset Still's disease:

- **Definition**: ASD is as a rare, polygenetic, autoinflammatory disorder. According to EULAR/PReS guidelines, systemic JIA and ASD are considered the same condition and designated as Still's disease.
- **Pathophysiology**: The exact pathophysiology of ASD is unknown, but it is characterized by overactive immune responses and excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-18.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of ASD worldwide is estimated at 0.16–0.4 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for developing ASD are not fully understood due to the rarity of the condition, but several HLA associations have been identified, suggesting a genetic predisposition.
- **Disease course**: ASD presents with a variety of symptoms and course, including monocyclic, polycyclic, and chronic patterns. Common symptoms include fever, rash, arthralgia, arthritis, throat pain, lymphadenopathy, and myalgia. Less common presentations include pleuritis, pericarditis, and abdominal pain. The most commonly involved regions are the knees, ankles, and wrists, followed by elbows, shoulders, and fingers. Polyarticular course is more often than oligo- or monoarticular involvement. Elevation of inflammatory markers, including ESR, CRP, and serum ferritin levels, is very common. Systemic complications include macrophage activation syndrome and lung involvement (such as pneumonitis, ILD, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage), which are associated with an unfavorable prognosis.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of ASD is variable and can be influenced by several factors. Elevated ESR and refractoriness to corticosteroids have been associated with poor prognosis.

### The hyperferritinemic syndrome: macrophage activation syndrome, Still's disease, septic shock and catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome [^113LRSer]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The hyperferritinemic syndrome

The four conditions: MAS, AOSD, cAPS and septic shock share similar clinical signs, symptoms and laboratory parameters (summarized in Table 2). Additionally, they respond to similar modes of therapies (Table 3). Clinically, it is difficult to distinguish between these conditions; in fact, it was previously proposed that severe sepsis, SIRS and MAS could be considered intermediate phenotypes of the same inflammatory process, a spectrum of molecular abnormalities affecting target cells killed by cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. Moreover, the overlap between MAS, cAPS and sepsis has been previously reported.

Information is emerging about the biological relevance of ferritin. Ferritin is known to be a pro-inflammatory mediator inducing expression of inflammatory molecules. Yet it has opposing actions as a pro-inflammatory and as an immunosuppressant.

We believe that the very high ferritin levels in these clinical conditions are not just the product of the inflammation but rather may have a pathogenic role. Possibly, in an inflammatory environment, as observed in these diseases, the huge levels of ferritin may be involved in some sort of a loop mechanism where ferritin's inflammatory proprieties are exacerbated, leading to an extreme expression of additional inflammatory mediators that are characteristic in the cytokine storm.

The good response to treatment with methylprednisolone, plasma exchange and IVIG supports a common pathogenic mechanism, and ferritin may be the link between them. It was previously shown that ferritin levels decreased gradually after each plasma exchange session. Furthermore, IVIG may be relevant not only because antibodies against ferritin may be present, but it may also prevent the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It is also very interesting to realize that the inhibition of the cytokines that play a central role in AOSD (IL-1 and IL-6) is an effective treatment, since they are the same cytokines known to induce ferritin expression. Macrophages seem to play a major role in these four conditions. In fact, they are responsible for the production of cytokines and also appear to be of utmost importance in the production and secretion of serum ferritin.

### Overnutrition is a risk factor for iron, but not for zinc or vitamin A deficiency in children and young people: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112YG6TS]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Inflammatory status is particularly relevant as ferritin, the primary blood biomarker of iron status used, was consistently found higher in obese groups compared with children with normal weight, with direct linear association reported in multiple studies. However, as ferritin is an acute phase reactant, inflammation can obscure ID. Therefore when the WHO reviewed their guidance on the use of ferritin to assess iron status in 2020, they made the strong recommendation that in areas of widespread infection or inflammation, serum ferritin should be measured alongside both C-reactive protein (CRP) and α-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP), which reflect different phases of the immune response from acute infection to chronic inflammation. In addition, they recommend that thresholds to define ID in individuals with infection or inflammation should be raised to 30 mg/L for children under 5 and 70 mg/L serum ferritin for all age groups over 5. However, very few studies (n = 4 out of 23 studies that used ferritin with or without other biomarkers to define ID) measured and excluded participants with elevated CRP level. Only one study measured AGPand only two studies from Colombiaand Brazilused the higher thresholds for ferritin to define ID in the context of inflammation. Interestingly, the WHO serum ferritin concentration thresholds were based on expert opinion, and a recent analysis of serial cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data concluded thresholds for ferritin for iron-deficient erythropoiesis should be higher, at least for healthy American children and women. Specifically, from regression models of the distributions of Hb and soluble transferrin receptor with serum ferritin in 2569 and 7498 healthy children under 5 and women (15–49 years old), they derived 20 mg/L for children under 5 and 25 mg/L in women as physiologically based serum ferritin thresholds for ID. These data suggest that the global burden of ID in children and young people may well be underestimated.

### Serum ferritin levels in inflammation: a retrospective comparative analysis between COVID-19 and emergency surgical non-COVID-19 patients [^111q62di]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

When an infection occurs, the inflammation process goes through SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), then SEPSIS, and subsequently SEVERE SEPSIS. The International Sepsis Definitions Conference defined the criteria for SIRS as the presence of two or more of the following parameters: body temperature > 38 °C or < 36 °C, heart rate > 90 beats/min, respiratory rate > 20 breaths/min (or arterial pCO2 < 32 mmHg, indicating hyperventilation), white blood cell count > 12.0 × 109/L or < 4.0 × 109/L (or > 10% immature forms), sepsis = infection + SIRS, and severe sepsis = sepsis + evidence of organ dysfunction.

The parameters commonly used to monitor inflammation process and sepsis evolution are lactate, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and, more recently, TNF, IL-1beta, and IL-6. The mortality rate remains high (30%), revealing that our knowledge of sepsis is not well understood, and there is no specific treatment yet.

Although ferritin is reported as an acute-phase protein, there is literature lacking in reporting the particular modified levels, leading to a misunderstanding regarding its interpretation. Recently, the role of IL-6 has become a key marker in COVID patients, and the classical parameters used for sepsis score do not clarify or answer some of the questions posed by the cytokine storm. The link between IL-6 and iron metabolism is well known, but iron parameters are not yet considered a standard biomarker to monitor septic evolution. Even in most recent guidelines for COVID (COVID-19) or in reports about sepsis, there is no mention of ferritin, transferrin, or other iron parameters. However, in a recent prospective analysis presented by Brandtner, iron parameters such as ferritin and transferrin saturation levels both correlate with SOFA score (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) with a significative value: p = 0.043 and p = 0.034, respectively.

### Serum ferritin levels in inflammation: a retrospective comparative analysis between COVID-19 and emergency surgical non-COVID-19 patients [^1145C4ou]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

SARS-CoV-2 infection has spread worldwide, and the pathogenic mechanism is still under investigation. The presence of a huge inflammatory response, defined as "cytokine storm", is being studied in order to understand what might be the prognostic factors implicated in the progression of the infection, with ferritin being one of such markers. The role of ferritin as a marker of inflammation is already known, and whether it changes differently between COVID and non-COVID patients still remains unclear. The aim of this retrospective analysis is to understand whether the inflammatory process in these two types is different.

Methods

In this retrospective analysis, we compared 17 patients affected by SARS-CoV-2, who had been admitted between February and April 2020 (group A) along with 30 patients admitted for acute surgical disease with SARS-CoV-2 negative swab (group B). A further subgroup of Covid negative patients with leukocytosis was compared to group A.

Results

In group A, the median (interquartile range) serum ferritin was 674 (1284) ng/mL, and it was double the cutoff (300 ng/mL) in 9 out of 17 (52%). The median (IQR) value of ferritin level in the total blood samples of group B was 231, and in the subgroup with leucocytosis, 149 (145). Group A showed a significantly higher ferritin median level compared to the entire group B (two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.0001) as well as to the subgroup with leucocytosis (p < 0.0014).

Conclusions

The role of iron metabolism appears to be directly involved in COVID infection. On the other hand, in the acute inflammation of patients admitted for surgery, and probably in other common phlogistic processes, iron modifications appear to be self-limited. However, our finding suggests the use of ferritin as a marker for COVID infection.

### Serum ferritin and incident cardiometabolic diseases in Scottish adults [^1168XNba]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Excess iron, and specifically free iron, is known to trigger the production of reactive oxygen species. Iron and inflammation are intertwined in a bidirectional relationship. Iron potentiates the inflammatory phenotype and inflammatory cells secrete inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and nitric oxide, implicated in the pathophysiology of T2D and CMD. In the present study, we have reported the associations between iron stores and incidence of several CMDs in a nationally representative population at high cardiovascular risk over a mean follow-up of 14 years. We found a statistically significant association between high ferritin and development of CEVD when we used higher percentiles to define high ferritin concentration. Interestingly, these cut-off points were still within the normal reference values of ferritin. The findings also confirm previous observations of an association between serum ferritin and T2D and no evidence of an association with CHD.

### A population-based and clinical cohort validation of the novel consensus definition of metabolic hyperferritinemia [^115dbWpq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Ferritin, a protein responsible for iron storage, is the primary iron storage mechanism and is essential for iron homeostasis. Ferritin makes iron accessible for essential cellular processes while shielding lipids, DNA, and proteins from iron's potentially deleterious effects. In addition to the iron storage functions, previous studies have linked increased ferritin to the development of cancer and inflammation. However, the leading cause of increased circulating ferritin levels in apparently healthy individuals is the presence of metabolic dysfunction (MD). In the general population, ferritin levels are associated with insulin resistance and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and a faster progression of organ injury (such as hepatic and cardiovascular diseases). In a study of 6497 patients, elevated ferritin was found to be significantly associated with the incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and T2DM. In addition, a comprehensive study revealed that serum ferritin was closely related to the development of metabolic dysfunction–associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), also known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease. In this context, elevated serum ferritin and abnormal metabolism are intimately connected and should be treated as a unit.

Indeed, elevated serum ferritin levels could develop in individuals with MD in the presence of iron accumulation risk factors. Patients with hyperferritinemia combined with MD might be more susceptible to organ injuries. Although many previous studies have explored the connection between serum ferritin and metabolism, systematic studies addressing this issue are needed.

Recently, a multidisciplinary expert panel has proposed specific diagnostic noninvasive criteria for the condition characterized by hyperferritinemia and MD, introducing the definition "metabolic hyperferritinemia" (MHF), and established a provisional grading of MHF severity. This consensus advanced clinical research on the epidemiology, genetics, pathophysiology, clinical relevance, and treatment of MHF by providing information on unmet needs, optimal design, clinically relevant outcomes, and by promoting collaborative studies on these topics, which would promote the clinical management of MHF. However, data on the prevalence of MHF and its impact on clinical outcomes are still lacking, as the new definition still needs real-world data validation.

C reactive protein, ferritin levels and serum amyloid A levels

Serum levels of C reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin were measured by the Infection and Immunity Research Group of Erasmus University (Rotterdam, Netherlands). CRP was measured using a turbidimetric assay (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) on the C502 model of the Cobas 8000 analyser (Roche Diagnostics). Ferritin was measured using an Electro-Chemi-Luminescent-Immuno-Assay (Roche Diagnostics) on the E801 module of the Cobas 8000 analyser (Roche Diagnostics). Plasma levels of serum amyloid A (SAA) were determined in the Laboratory of Rheumatology, University of Liège (Belgium) using a commercially available ELISA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (ThermoFisher Scientific ref KHA0011 for SAA), as described. Plasma samples were diluted in the range (1:100–1:500 000). Calibration ranges were set between 9.4 and 600 ng/mL. Absorbance data were acquired on a SpectraMax 384Plus spectrophotometric ELISA plate reader using SoftMax Pro software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, USA, V.7.0.2).

Clinical scores

Composite scores were used to evaluate disease activity. In the absence of a validated score enabling disease activity assessment of all types of SAID, a disease activity score was created, combining fatigue, patient and physician global assessment, the total score being the sum of fatigue level, patient global assessment and physician global assessment, each from 0 (absent/inactive disease) to 10 (extreme/extremely active disease). Three other scores were calculated for Still's disease, the sJADAS score, validated for sJIAand the Pouchot and modified Pouchot scores, validated for AOSD.

Response to treatment at the second visit was assessed at the discretion of the attending physician, based on clinical and biological outcomes that were not determined in advance. Accordingly, response was considered complete or partial.

Patient and public involvement

Recruited patients were not involved in the project apart from being research subjects.

Murine experiments

In vivo experiments were conducted in mice to explore the potential stabilising effect of IL-18BP on circulating IL-18. Methods are described in detail in online supplemental file 1.

### Inflammatory bowel disease amid the COVID-19 pandemic: impact, management strategies, and lessons learned [^112CMes1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

GI manifestations of COVID-19

The most common symptoms in COVID-19 are fever and respiratory symptoms, followed by GI symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, dysgeusia, and abdominal pain. Based on the SECURE-IBD registry-based study, about 30% of the patients reported an increase in baseline IBD symptoms. Among the IBD patients, diarrhea was the most common symptom (25.5%), followed by abdominal pain (8.4%), nausea (5.7%), and vomiting (3.2%). In contrast, among non-IBD patients, studies have reported diarrhea in 2–10%, nausea or vomiting in 1–10% and abdominal pain in 2.2–5.8%. The diagnosis of IBD flare-up is challenging in the context of COVID-19, as the typical presenting features of IBD, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever, along with elevated inflammatory markers, may also be secondary to COVID-19. However, rectal bleeding is not common in COVID-19. Laboratory tests such as C-reactive protein and ferritin are elevated in both conditions, although occasionally ferritin can be low in UC. Patients with COVID-19 have lymphopenia, whereas in IBD patients, lymphocyte levels are usually normal or elevated. The red blood cell distribution width index has been found to be elevated in nearly half of patients with COVID-19 and has been found to be associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR [aOR] 4.5, 95%CI 1.4–14.3) and septic shock (aOR 4.6, 95%CI 1.4–15.1). In all cases, standard stool tests, such as stool culture and stool Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxin, should also be performed. For patients with severe GI symptoms, abdominal computed tomography or endoscopic evaluation should be considered to assess the bowel inflammation to determine appropriate management.

### Causes of ferritin elevation… [^114fuicn]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

In Reply Dr Lippi raises the important point that an elevated serum ferritin level may also be associated with underlying malignancy; it is true that ferritin may be elevated in a broad variety of other disease processes, as we noted in our JAMA Diagnostic Test Interpretation article. Elevated serum ferritin levels are commonly encountered in general practice and many elevations may be due to non–iron overload conditions. The patient described was a relatively healthy middle-aged man who was unexpectedly noted to have a markedly elevated ferritin level. The cited investigation by Moore et al1 retrospectively studied the underlying etiology of markedly elevated serum ferritin levels in a large group of patients at a tertiary care medical center, including patients with a range of cancers, infections, inflammatory conditions, and renal diseases. 1 This study population is distinctly different from the relatively healthy patient described in our article.

### Updates in the management of iron deficiency anemia… [^113e6AoE]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency results from reduced iron intake, absorption, losses or reduced mobilization of iron from bodily stores. Effects of iron deficiency anemia include reduced cognition in children and older adults, as well as adverse pregnancy outcomes. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is generally based on deficient iron stores and anemia. A serum ferritin level of < 45 mg/dL is indicative of iron deficiency, demonstrating an 85% sensitivity and 92% specificity for diagnosing iron deficiency in patients with anemia. This threshold is recommended by the American Gastroenterological Association. In patients with an elevated serum ferritin due to inflammation, alternative markers of iron status such as transferrin saturation may be considered. In adults, evaluation of iron deficiency anemia involves noninvasive screening for celiac disease and. Helicobacter pylori infection.

The AGA guidelines additionally recommend bidirectional endoscopy in men and postmenopausal women with iron deficiency anemia. Endoscopy may also be considered in premenopausal women; however, a trial of oral iron supplementation is a reasonable initial step in these patients in the absence of concerning symptoms. A hemoglobin increase of greater than 1. 0 g/dL over 1 month is considered a successful response and supports the diagnosis. In children, mild iron deficiency anemia may be treated initially with oral iron supplementation for 1 month without additional testing. As in adults, an increase of greater than 1. 0 g/dL of hemoglobin over 1 month is considered supportive of the diagnosis. In those who do not respond to empiric treatment, further evaluation for gastrointestinal bleeding and referral to a gastroenterologist is recommended.

Intravenous iron replacement is typically recommended by the AGA updated guidelines for patients who cannot tolerate oral iron, exhibit poor absorption, or fail to demonstrate improvement with oral iron supplementation. Compared with oral iron, IV iron does not reduce mortality or the need for blood transfusions in adults with iron deficiency anemia, and it may increase the risk of infection, according to a 2022 FPIN Clinical Inquiry.

### Avoid using hemoglobin to evaluate patients for iron… [^11238wtk]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron depletion is a progressive process with anemia as the final phase. Thus, screening for iron deficiency using hemoglobin will only identify the most severe cases. Moreover, hemoglobin is not specific for iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies worldwide. Prevalence of iron deficiency in U. S. women ages 12 to 49 years rose from 11% in 2003 to 14. 8% in
2010. Pregnant women and young children are also high-risk groups and must be evaluated. Iron deficiency in U. S. toddlers, without anemia, is estimated at 6. 6% to
15. 2%. Serum ferritin is a measure of iron stores and is the most sensitive biomarker to test for early stages of iron deficiency as well as iron deficiency anemia. Sensitivity of ferritin test is 89% for diagnosis of iron depletion compared with hemoglobin, which is only 26%.

Moreover, a ferritin cut off of ≤ 30 ng/mL provides 92% sensitivity and 98% specificity for iron deficiency anemia and is the best screening test for this disorder. Evaluating patients for iron deficiency with ferritin will identify early stage iron deficiency and will potentially result in iron therapy, preventing iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia has been long associated with psychomotor and cognitive abnormalities but even iron deficiency without anemia has been related to negative neurodevelopmental outcomes in children. Ferritin is an acute phase reactant, and occasionally in inflammatory conditions, ferritin levels may be normal or elevated even in the presence of iron deficiency.

Additional laboratory tests accompanying clinical correlation are also helpful to determine iron deficiency.

### Anemia of inflammation | NEJM resident 360… [^117MhugH]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

A: Anemia of inflammation, like iron-deficiency anemia, is characterized by low serum iron levels, but it differs from iron-deficiency anemia in that iron stores are preserved in marrow macrophages, as well as in splenic and hepatic macrophages that recycle senescent erythrocytes. Whereas erythrocytes in iron-deficiency anemia are often small and hemoglobin-deficient, the erythrocytes in anemia of inflammation most often appear normal, although they become small and pale in a subset of patients, particularly those in whom iron deficiency coexists or develops as a complication. Hypoferremia associated with elevated plasma ferritin and hepcidin levels is characteristic of anemia of inflammation, whereas in iron-deficiency anemia, hypoferremia associated with low plasma ferritin and hepcidin levels is characteristic. Q: How does inflammation affect hepcidin synthesis.

A: The main mechanism of iron homeostasis centers on the interaction between the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin, produced by hepatocytes, and ferroportin, which is both the hepcidin receptor and the sole cellular iron exporter through which iron is transferred to blood plasma. Inflammation greatly increases hepcidin synthesis, which is important in the pathogenesis of anemia of inflammation. Hepcidin synthesis increases predominantly but not exclusively because of interleukin-6, which acts through the JAK2–STAT3 pathway to increase the transcription of the hepcidin gene in hepatocytes. High levels of circulating hepcidin inhibit the export of cellular iron into plasma, thereby decreasing both intestinal absorption of iron and the release of iron from erythrocyte-recycling macrophages in the spleen and the liver.

A: Leukocytosis and increased production of leukocytes in the marrow are early inflammatory responses, manifested in the marrow by an increased number of myeloid precursors. Such reprogramming of the marrow is mediated by inflammatory cytokines that activate the transcription factor PU. 1 to promote myelopoiesis and lymphopoiesis at the expense of erythropoiesis.
