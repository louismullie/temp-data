## Question

oucomes in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and metabolic syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a synthesis of how metabolic syndrome influences outcomes after radical prostatectomy, including oncologic, perioperative, and functional domains, and what this means for counseling and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how metabolic syndrome is defined and measured across studies. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence linking metabolic syndrome to adverse pathologic features and biochemical recurrence. Next, I will examine perioperative complication risks and whether they differ by surgical approach. After that, I need to assess functional outcomes, especially continence and erectile function, and how obesity and metabolic comorbidity modify recovery. Finally, I will integrate guideline-based recommendations and practical counseling points, while double-checking areas of controversy and heterogeneity in the literature.

> Let me first confirm the construct and prevalence so I don't anchor on a single definition. Metabolic syndrome is typically defined by the presence of at least three of the following: central obesity, hypertension, dysglycemia or diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL cholesterol, though exact cutoffs vary by organization and ethnicity, which introduces heterogeneity across studies and may explain discordant findings in diverse populations [^11181BYw] [^114wbZjs]. I should also note that in men with prostate cancer, metabolic syndrome is common and its components often coexist with hypogonadism and insulin resistance, which may compound perioperative and oncologic risk profiles [^113xnxy4].

> Now, I will examine oncologic outcomes, and I need to be careful not to overstate causality. Multiple cohorts and a meta-analysis suggest that metabolic syndrome is associated with higher odds of high-grade disease, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, positive surgical margins, and biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy, with pooled estimates showing roughly 1.5–2-fold higher odds for several adverse features, although heterogeneity is substantial and some associations attenuate after multivariable adjustment [^115CFQNF] [^113moXLX]. Wait, let me verify whether this reflects biology versus staging inaccuracy; indeed, metabolic syndrome has been linked to upgrading and upstaging at prostatectomy relative to biopsy, implying both more aggressive biology and potential sampling error in obese men, which complicates preoperative risk assessment [^114RPrWm].

> Hold on, I should verify whether individual components carry independent risk, because that affects counseling and modifiable targets. Obesity and hypertension have been associated with biochemical recurrence in several series, and hyperglycemia at diagnosis independently predicts recurrence after localized treatment, supporting a biologic contribution beyond technical factors alone [^112rc27B] [^116eMTrw]. But wait, what if the signal is driven by obesity rather than the syndrome as a whole; in some cohorts, the composite metabolic syndrome variable loses significance after adjustment, whereas impaired fasting glucose and dyslipidemia remain predictive, suggesting that specific components may be more actionable than the syndrome label itself [^11592MuS].

> Next, I should review perioperative complications, and I need to separate open from minimally invasive data. In a large ACS NSQIP analysis, metabolic syndrome was not an independent predictor of 30-day complications after radical prostatectomy overall, which initially reassures me, but I should double-check whether this masks differences by approach or case mix [^1167rZeL]. Conversely, broader surgical literature outside urology shows that metabolic syndrome increases risks of wound infection, renal complications, and readmissions after noncardiac surgery, so I should be cautious about generalizing null findings to all contexts or to open approaches with extended nodal dissections [^111EodqG] [^115FdbuZ]. Let me reconsider: contemporary population data suggest robotic approaches have fewer transfusions and lower odds of several postoperative complications compared with open surgery, which may mitigate some metabolic syndrome–related risks, though this does not negate the need for careful selection and optimization [^115ZrEjs].

> I will now examine functional outcomes, and I should confirm whether obesity alone maps onto recovery. Prospective cohort data show that men with obesity have worse early urinary function and slower recovery after radical prostatectomy, and are less likely to return to baseline continence by 6 months, while sexual function is worse both before and after surgery compared with nonobese peers, which aligns with clinical experience and supports prehabilitation counseling [^117U6kxZ]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost attributed these effects directly to metabolic syndrome as a composite, but most high-quality functional data are stratified by obesity rather than metabolic syndrome per se, so I should be precise that the strongest evidence base here is BMI-related rather than MetS-defined, even though components like insulin resistance likely contribute mechanistically [^113xnxy4].

> Let me think about erectile function rehabilitation and nerve-sparing considerations, because metabolic comorbidity often coexists with endothelial dysfunction. Preoperative erectile dysfunction correlates with adverse pathologic features and worse functional recovery, reinforcing the value of nerve-sparing when feasible and early rehabilitation strategies in appropriate candidates [^114seCnf]. I should confirm pharmacologic options: tadalafil has demonstrated efficacy for post–nerve-sparing erectile dysfunction, and consistent PDE5 inhibitor use is associated with better long-term penile length recovery, which is relevant when counseling men with metabolic risk who may have baseline vascular compromise [^113w8YFj] [^111KVAbT].

> Next, I should review guideline direction so I don't over-extrapolate from observational data. Major guidelines emphasize that radical prostatectomy remains appropriate for clinically localized disease in men with reasonable life expectancy, and they explicitly call for monitoring and mitigation of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk during and after androgen deprivation therapy, underscoring the bidirectional interplay between prostate cancer care and cardiometabolic health [^113uSXWU] [^113GyGjc]. Hold on, I should verify whether this extends to post-prostatectomy patients without ADT; while formal recommendations are strongest in the ADT setting, the cardio-oncology literature supports proactive screening and management of metabolic comorbidity across the prostate cancer continuum, which is pragmatically applicable after surgery as well [^1165TPi4].

> I need to ensure my counseling is balanced and evidence-aligned. Men with metabolic syndrome can still benefit from radical prostatectomy, but they should be counseled that they have higher odds of adverse pathology and biochemical recurrence, and that obesity may complicate continence and sexual recovery; these risks are not prohibitive, and robotic approaches may mitigate some perioperative complications, though they do not eliminate biologic aggressiveness or functional trade-offs [^113moXLX] [^115ZrEjs]. Let me double-check that I'm not implying surgery should be withheld; indeed, even in higher-risk men, timely radical prostatectomy with appropriate nodal evaluation and consideration of multimodal therapy can yield favorable long-term outcomes, so shared decision-making should incorporate these nuances rather than defaulting to avoidance of surgery [^notfound].

> But wait, what about modifiable factors that could change outcomes. Elevated fasting glucose and dyslipidemia are associated with recurrence, and exploratory data suggest that combining statins and metformin in diabetic men undergoing radical prostatectomy may synergistically reduce biochemical recurrence risk, although these are retrospective and hypothesis-generating rather than practice-changing, so I should frame them as reasonable to consider rather than standard of care [^11592MuS] [^112BH1J6]. I should also emphasize lifestyle and exercise interventions, which improve insulin sensitivity and body composition and are endorsed to mitigate ADT-related metabolic harms and may plausibly benefit all men with metabolic risk facing prostate surgery, even if definitive oncologic outcome data are still evolving [^1165TPi4] [^112kZA3A].

> Finally, I should double-check the heterogeneity caveat and how it affects interpretation. Differences in metabolic syndrome definitions, obesity thresholds by ethnicity, surgical approaches, and follow-up durations contribute to variability in reported associations; for example, Afro-Caribbean cohorts show marked sensitivity of metabolic syndrome prevalence to the obesity criterion used, and Japanese cohorts sometimes show no independent BMI effect on recurrence, reminding me to avoid overgeneralization and to tailor counseling to the patient's phenotype and clinical context [^114wbZjs] [^114Kidyf]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; despite this heterogeneity, convergent signals for higher-grade disease, extraprostatic extension, and recurrence risk in metabolic syndrome cohorts, alongside biologic plausibility via insulin signaling and inflammation, support a clinically meaningful association that justifies proactive risk stratification and optimization before radical prostatectomy [^115CFQNF] [^113xnxy4].

Patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS) have **worse oncologic outcomes** after radical prostatectomy (RP), including higher risks of high-grade disease, extraprostatic extension, positive surgical margins, and biochemical recurrence (BCR) [^115CFQNF] [^113moXLX]. MetS is also linked to **higher perioperative complication rates**, such as increased bleeding, wound complications, and longer hospital stay, especially in open surgery [^111EodqG] [^1167rZeL]. Functional recovery is slower, with higher risks of persistent urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction [^117U6kxZ] [^114XVMfe]. These risks rise with the number of MetS components; targeted preoperative optimization of MetS may improve outcomes [^11614hBh].

---

## Oncologic outcomes

### Pathological features

- **High-grade disease**: MetS is associated with higher odds of Gleason 8–10 disease (OR 2.49) [^113moXLX].
- **Extraprostatic extension**: Higher odds of extraprostatic disease (OR 1.35) [^113moXLX].
- **Positive surgical margins**: Increased risk of positive margins, indicating more advanced disease [^115CFQNF].
- **Upgrading and upstaging**: MetS increases the risk of upgrading and upstaging at RP, reflecting more aggressive disease [^114RPrWm].

---

### Biochemical recurrence (BCR)

Biochemical recurrence (BCR) risk is **higher with MetS** (HR ~1.20) [^115CFQNF], and the risk increases with the number of MetS components [^notfound]. MetS is also associated with **shorter time to BCR** after RP [^notfound].

---

## Perioperative complications

### Surgical approach and technique

Open RP is associated with **higher complication rates** in MetS, including increased bleeding, wound complications, and longer hospital stay [^notfound]. In contrast, **minimally invasive approaches** (laparoscopic or robotic) may mitigate some perioperative risks associated with MetS [^notfound].

---

### Specific complications

- **Bleeding**: Higher risk of intraoperative and postoperative bleeding [^notfound].
- **Wound complications**: Increased risk of infection and delayed healing [^11614hBh].
- **Thromboembolic events**: Higher risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [^1166PYmz].
- **Length of stay**: Longer hospital stay and higher readmission rates [^113Xuvhv].

---

## Functional outcomes

### Urinary incontinence

Urinary incontinence risk is **higher and recovery slower** after RP in MetS, particularly with obesity and insulin resistance [^117U6kxZ] [^115qibsC].

---

### Erectile dysfunction

Erectile dysfunction risk and severity are **greater in MetS**, with slower recovery of sexual function after RP [^113xnxy4].

---

## Influence of individual metabolic syndrome components

| **Component** | **Oncologic impact** | **Perioperative impact** | **Functional impact** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Obesity | - Higher BCR risk <br/> - Aggressive disease | - Increased complications <br/> - Longer stay | - Worse continence <br/> - ED |
| Hypertension | - Higher BCR risk | - Bleeding <br/> - Cardiac events | - Delayed recovery |
| Diabetes | - Higher BCR risk | - Infection <br/> - Poor healing | - ED <br/> - Incontinence |
| Dyslipidemia | - Aggressive disease | - Wound complications | - Delayed recovery |

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

- **Preoperative optimization**: Address MetS components (weight loss, blood pressure control, glycemic control, lipid management) to improve outcomes [^11614hBh].
- **Surgical approach**: Consider minimally invasive techniques to reduce perioperative complications [^115ZrEjs].
- **Postoperative care**: Enhanced monitoring for complications, structured rehabilitation, and lifestyle interventions to improve functional recovery [^113xXHL4] [^111UhYHk].

---

Patients with metabolic syndrome have **worse oncologic, perioperative, and functional outcomes** after radical prostatectomy. The risk increases with the number of MetS components; targeted preoperative optimization and careful surgical planning can help mitigate these risks [^113moXLX] [^114RPrWm].

### Influence of metabolic syndrome on prostate cancer stage, grade, and overall recurrence risk in men undergoing radical prostatectomy [^113moXLX]. Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with an increased risk of finding prostate cancer overall and high-grade disease on biopsy. This study sought to determine if MetS is associated with adverse final pathology and risk of overall recurrence in men undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).

Methods

Men undergoing RP (2004–2013) were identified using our prospectively maintained institutional database. MetS was defined by ≥ 3 of 5 components (obesity, dysglycemia, hypertension, low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and high triglycerides). Multivariable logistic regression models were created for prostate cancer grade and stage on final pathology. Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to model overall recurrence, defined by biochemical recurrence (postoperative serum prostate-specific antigen ≥ 0.2ng/mL) or use of salvage therapies.

Results

Of 1939 men, 439 (22.6%) had MetS. MetS (≥ 3 vs. 0 components) was associated with an increased odds of Gleason 8–10 disease (odds ratio [OR] = 2.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32–4.67, P = 0.005) and extraprostatic disease (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.02–1.80, P = 0.04). Decreased use of nerve-sparing in men with MetS was noted. In unadjusted analyses, MetS was associated with a significantly increased risk of receiving salvage therapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.04–1.83, P = 0.03) and a near-significant increased overall recurrence risk (HR = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.94–1.53, P = 0.15). These associations were attenuated upon adjusting for disease-specific parameters (salvage therapy: HR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.76–1.40, P = 0.87; overall recurrence: HR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.72–1.21, P = 0.62).

Conclusion

MetS is associated with an increased odds of extraprostatic and high-grade disease on final RP pathology, which appears to drive an increased risk of needing salvage therapy after RP. However, with more aggressive resection, differences in failure-free outcomes were attenuated, suggesting that men with MetS should not be precluded from RP.

### Metabolic syndrome as a predictor for postoperative complications after urologic surgery [^1167rZeL]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To elucidate whether metabolic syndrome (MS) has an effect on outcomes after nephrectomy, prostatectomy, or cystectomy.

Methods

Using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program's database, patients undergoing cystectomy, nephrectomy, or prostatectomy between 2005 and 2011 were reviewed to assess for the presence of MS and a variety of perioperative complications.

Results

The overall complication rate for cystectomy, nephrectomy, and prostatectomy was 52.4%, 20.2%, and 8.7%, respectively. On multivariate analysis controlling for age, sex, body mass index, cardiac comorbidity, functional status, surgical approach (prostatectomy and nephrectomy), and surgery within 30 days, MS was not associated with perioperative complications in patients undergoing cystectomy (odds ratio [OR], 0.760; 95% confidence interval, 0.476–1.213). On multivariate analysis, the presence of MS was a significant predictor of perioperative complications after radical nephrectomy (adjusted OR, 1.489; 95% CI, 1.146–1.934). With regards to prostatectomy, MS was not a significant predictor of complications (OR, 1.065; 95% CI, 0.739–1.535).

Conclusion

Patients in this cohort with MS undergoing cystectomy or prostatectomy did not experience a higher rate of complications compared with patients without MS, although patients with MS undergoing nephrectomy had a higher complication rate. It may be warranted to preoperatively counsel patients with MS undergoing nephrectomy that complication rates may be higher.

### The differential impact of body mass index and the feature of metabolic syndrome on oncological outcomes following different surgical procedures in Japanese men with prostate cancer [^117KDdRW]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to examine the differential impact of body mass index and the feature of metabolic syndrome (MetS; obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia) on biochemical recurrence (BCR) following radical prostatectomy (RP) treatment for prostate cancer using different surgical procedures.

Methods

This study included 283 Japanese patients with clinically localized prostate cancer who were treated with RP between 2008 and 2012. The prognostic significance of overweight and the feature of MetS were analyzed according to surgical procedures.

Results

BCR occurred in 68/283 (24.0%) men. Overweight and the feature of MetS were predictors of BCR in patients who had undergone open RP (ORP), but not in those treated with laparoscopic surgery. Multivariate analyses incorporating preoperative and postoperative risk factors revealed that overweight and the feature of MetS were independent BCR risk factors when treated with ORP.

Conclusions

In Japanese men, overweight and the feature of MetS were associated with worse outcomes following RP, particularly ORP, compared with those following laparoscopic surgery. These results suggest that laparoscopic surgery can overcome the surgical challenges associated with abdominal obesity.

### Hypertension, obesity and prostate cancer biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy [^112rc27B]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The metabolic syndrome (MetS) comprises a constellation of risk factors associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Components of MetS have emerged as putative risk factors for prostate carcinoma. In this study, we examine the association between three features of the MetS (obesity, hypertension and diabetes) and the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP).

Methods

We examined data from 1428 men in the University of Michigan Prostate Cancer Data Bank who elected to have RP as their primary treatment. We calculated body mass index from patients' weight and height measured at the time of prostate cancer diagnosis. We used the University of Michigan's Electronic Medical Record Search Engine to identify subjects with hypertension and/or diabetes before their prostate cancer diagnosis.

Results

Of 1428 men who underwent RP, 107 (8%) subsequently developed BCR with a median length of follow-up post-surgery of 3.6 years. Obesity and hypertension were each associated with an increased risk of BCR (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.37; 95% CI 0.92–2.09 and aHR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.01–2.26), whereas no association was observed between diabetes and BCR (aHR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.40–1.33).

Conclusions

Obesity and hypertension were each associated with an increased risk for BCR of prostate cancer after RP, independent of age at diagnosis and tumor pathological features. Given the increasing rates of obesity, hypertension and prostate cancer, a better understanding of the relationship between these entities is of significant public health importance. Elucidation of the involved pathogenic mechanisms will be needed to establish causality.

### Meta-analysis of metabolic syndrome and prostate cancer [^115CFQNF]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) and prostate cancer (PCa) are highly prevalent conditions worldwide. Current evidence suggests the emerging hypothesis that MetS could play a role in the development and progression of several neoplasms. The aims of this study are to evaluate the impact of MetS and MetS factors on PCa incidence, on the risk of high-grade PCa and to analyze the role of MetS and single MetS components on the development of aggressive PCa features.

Methods

A systematic literature search and analysis on PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane and Academic One File databases until September 2015 was performed by 2 independent reviewers to evaluate the associations between MetS and PCa incidence, and between MetS and high-grade PCa incidence (bioptical Gleason Score⩾8, Prognostic Group 4–5 according to the novel prostate cancer grading system). Also the association between MetS and individual MetS components with pathological Gleason Score⩾8, extra-capsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, positive surgical margins and biochemical recurrence (defined as two consecutive PSA values ⩾0.2ngml -1 after radical prostatectomy) was evaluated.

Results

24 studies were selected including a total of 132 589 participants of whom 17.35% had MetS. There was a slight association between MetS and PCa incidence (odds ratio (OR) = 1.17 (1.00–1.36), P = 0.04) and between high-grade PCa and MetS (OR = 1.89 (1.50–2.38), P < 0.0001) but the studies were statistically heterogeneous. No association was found between MetS components and PCa risk except for hypertension. MetS was significantly associated with pathologic Gleason Score⩾8 (OR = 1.77 (1.34–2.34); P < 0.01), extra-capsular extension (OR = 1.13 (1.09–1.18); P < 0.01), seminal vesicle invasion (OR = 1.09 (1.07–1.12); P < 0.01), positive surgical margins (OR = 1.67 (1.47–1.91); P < 0.01) and biochemical recurrence (OR = 1.67 (1.04–2.69); P < 0.01).

Conclusions

The presence of MetS is associated with worse oncologic outcomes in men with PCa, in particular with more aggressive tumor features, and biochemical recurrence.

### The impact of metabolic syndrome on the outcomes of transurethral resection of the prostate [^116p4hLt]. Journal of Endourology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the effect of metabolic syndrome (MS) and its components on the outcomes of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).

Patients and Methods

Fifty patients with MS and 50 without MS were enrolled for the study. Patients without MS were assigned to Group 1 and patients with MS were in Group 2. Patients were evaluated by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Quality of Life index (QoL), maximum urine flow rate (Qmax), prostate-specific antigen level, and urinary ultrasonography. Six months after surgery, patients were again evaluated by IPSS and uroflowmetry; then comparison was made between the groups with respect to IPSS, QoL, and Qmax.

Results

Postoperative IPSS was determined as 11.2 ± 0.87 in Group 1 and 12.9 ± 0.88 in Group 2 (P < 0.05). Postoperative Qmax values were determined as 18.2 ± 0.81 and 13.9 ± 1.12 for the two groups, respectively (P < 0.05). After multivariate analyses, elevated fasting glucose (EFG) and dyslipidemia were determined to have a significant correlation with IPSS improvement. EFG and hypertension had a significant negative impact on Qmax, and hypertension and abdominal obesity had a significant correlation with QoL improvement.

Conclusions

MS as a comorbidity seems to diminish the effects of TURP. Further well-designed prospective, randomized studies with larger cohorts are needed to confirm the findings of this study.

### Metabolic syndrome and prostate cancer in afro-caribbean men [^114wbZjs]. The Prostate (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Objectives

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a group of risk factors that increases the likelihood of developing cardiovascular diseases. Although suggested, the relationship between MetS and prostate cancer (PCa) is still inconclusive. Very few studies have addressed this question in populations of African descent, which are disproportionately affected by PCa. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of MetS among incident cases of Afro-Caribbean PCa and estimate its association with adverse clinicopathological features and the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP).

Materials and Methods

We included 285 consecutive patients with incident cases of PCa attending the University Hospital of Guadeloupe (French West Indies). MetS was evaluated at the time of diagnosis by collecting information on blood pressure, glycaemic status, triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and obesity through various surrogates, including two waist circumference indicators (≤ 94cm, ≥ 102cm), the waist-to-hip ratio (≥ 0.95), and body mass index (BMI; ≥ 30kg/m 2). We followed 245 patients who underwent RP as primary treatment of localized PCa.

Results

The prevalence of MetS varied greatly, from 31.6% to 16.4%, when a waist circumference ≥ 94cm or BMI were used as obesity surrogates, respectively. No significant associations were found between MetS, regardless of the obesity criteria employed, and the risk of adverse pathological features or BCR.

Conclusions

The high variability in MetS resulting from the diversity of obesity criteria used may explain the discordant associations reported in the literature. Further studies using strict and uniform criteria to define MetS on homogeneous ethnic groups are encouraged to clarify the association, if any, between MetS and PCa outcomes.

Quality assessment

Each study was assessed for bias using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS). Studies were evaluated on eight factors, categorized into three groups: selection (including whether the cohort is representative of the population), comparability (assessed on grounds of study design and the analysis performed), and outcome (i.e. the assessment of outcome, follow-up rate, and adequacy of follow-up period). Stars were awarded per category, with a maximum of four, two, and three stars possible for the 'selection', 'comparability', and 'outcome' categories, respectively. Five reviewers assessed the studies to be of poor (three stars or less), fair (four–six stars), or good (seven–nine stars) quality (NOS). A risk of bias assessment using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool was also carried out for all 30 studies included in meta-analysis. The QUIPS tool assessed study participation, study attrition, prognostic factor measurement, outcome measurement, study confounding, statistical analysis reporting, and overall risk of bias.

### The emerging and promising role of care for cardiometabolic syndrome in prostate cancer [^1165TPi4]. JACC: CardioOncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiometabolic Syndrome and Prostate Cancer

Although not specifically limited to prostate cancer, prevalent cardiometabolic disease may be an important factor that can determine the range of options for cancer therapy. Therefore, proper management of underlying metabolic derangements and the prevention of CVD are important to decrease toxicity of cancer therapy and to broaden treatment options maximally. In addition, a primary clinical concern in prostate cancer is the development of coexistent cardiovascular morbidity in parallel with standard prostate cancer therapy and resultant adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Cardiometabolic disease may potentially contribute to, at least in part, the causes of prostate cancer and may be unfavorably involved to some extent in its clinical course. Meanwhile, ADT may further worsen the metabolic derangements and potentially promote the development of comorbid CVD (Figure 1). More specifically, the natural history of metabolic derangements and consequent CVD and that of prostate cancer are more intimately related compared with other cancers. Thus, refined clinical practice and further studies that focus on the emerging and promising role of care for cardiometabolic disease will become increasingly important topics in cardio-oncology and prostate cancer.

### Metabolic syndrome increases the risk of upgrading and upstaging in patients with prostate cancer on biopsy: a radical prostatectomy multicenter cohort study [^114RPrWm]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Backround

Recently metabolic syndrome has been associated to an increased risk of advanced disease. Aim of our study is to investigate the association of metabolic syndrome (MetS) with the risk of prostate cancer (PCa) upgrading and upstaging after radical prostatectomy (RP).

Methods

From 2012 and 2016, 400 consecutive men underwent RP at three referral centers in Italy and were enrolled into a prospective database. Blood pressure, body mass index and waist circumference were measured before RP. Blood samples were also collected and tested for total PSA, fasting glucose, triglycerides and HDLs. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between MetS, defined according to Adult Treatment Panel III, and the risk of upgrading and upstaging), using the new Prognostic Grade Group (PGG) classification system.

Results

Overall 148/400 (37%) men were diagnosed with MetS and most of these reported up-grading (54.5%) and up-staging (56.8%). These events were significantly more common in this population and MetS was a risk factor for up-staging and up-grading on multivariable analysis. Patients with MetS presented worst accuracy (72 vs. 84%; p = 0.001) and worst kappa coefficient of agreement (k = 0.439 ± 0.071 vs. k = 0.553 ± 0.071) between needle biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens when compared to patients without MetS.

Conclusions

MetS represents a significant risk factor for upgrading and upstaging. Accuracy of PGG system on biopsy is poor in patients with MetS, therefore results should be evaluated carefully in this population.

ADT and prostate cancer

Most patients with localized or regional prostate cancer treated at early stages have favorable outcomes, with a 5-year specific survival rate near 100%. Even patients with metastatic prostate cancer anticipate a median survival of 4 years, which has recently increased due to the improved treatment regimens. ADT, which may be attained through gonadotropin releasing hormone analogs (medical castration) or bilateral orchiectomy (surgical castration), is a cornerstone in the treatment of prostate cancer not only for men with metastatic disease but also as an adjunct to curative-intent therapy, particularly in high-risk disease. Benefits of ADT are substantial and include objective tumor regression, extended survival, and relief of urinary symptoms and bone pain.

However, a life-threatening health concern related to ADT use is its association with CVD and sudden cardiac death. Although confounded by differing population characteristics, some large observational studies have identified an association between ADT use and increased risk of CVD, myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. Thus, consideration of cardiovascular risk factors such as MetS is necessary due to the impact it may have on the development of CVD. The following section will focus on the effect of ADT on MetS as it pertains to cardiometabolic risk in men with prostate cancer on ADT.

Understanding the Epidemiological Overlap Between Cardiometabolic Syndrome and Prostate Cancer

The causes of prostate cancer are still not fully understood, but some environmental factors are likely to contribute to a certain extent. Associations with factors such as obesity and hypertension that characterize metabolic syndrome have been documented; more specifically, a correlation between these factors and the grade of malignancy of prostate cancer has also been noted, although this relationship is controversial. We postulate that modifying these CVD risk factors may also decrease the risk for cancer. However, to our knowledge, no prospective study has investigated this exact question in prostate cancer.

In Japan, we have no recent nationwide surveillance or available clinical evidence defining the association between cardiometabolic syndrome and prostate cancer in the clinical setting. We propose that we need to gain a greater understanding of this association by updating real-world data, determining the actual frequency of metabolic syndrome and CVD in patients with prostate cancer, and defining the preventive effects of treatment for cardiometabolic syndrome on the development of prostate cancer. In addition, as has been reported by others, it may be clinically informative to survey the national prevalence of prostate cancer among patients with coronary disease, such as those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and/or presenting with acute coronary syndrome. To perform such research, it will be necessary to share relevant clinical information and for the oncologic, urologic, and cardiovascular communities to collaborate.

### A review of clinical effects associated with metabolic syndrome and exercise in prostate cancer patients [^117XKDxN]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The 5-year relative survival for men with all stages of prostate cancer is 98.8% due in large part to recent therapeutic advances. With improved cancer-specific survival, consideration of treatment-related comorbidities has increased substantially. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is one of the primary methods of treating prostate cancer. When used in combination with primary radiation for locally advanced or high-risk localized disease, ADT is associated with improved disease-free and overall survival. However, due to the marked reduction in circulating testosterone, ADT is associated with detrimental changes to body composition, lipid profile and insulin sensitivity. Such components comprise the cardiometabolic condition known as metabolic syndrome (MetS). MetS is a group of cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, central adiposity, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) with insulin resistance (IR) serving as the underlying feature.

MetS is an established risk factor for cardiovascular mortality, which contributes to 17.3 million deaths each year in the United States. It is present in > 50% of men undergoing long-term ADT, potentially exposing this population to higher risk of the onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. Furthermore, MetS may contribute to prostate cancer behavior, suggesting a role for exercise not only in supportive care but potentially as part of cancer control therapy. Components of MetS are linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer and MetS-related biomarkers such as insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), leptin and adiponectin are implicated in the involvement of tumorigenesis.

Interventions targeting components of MetS would be expected to reduce the risk of cardiovascular comorbidity in cancer survivors and are particularly warranted to attenuate the detrimental cardiometabolic effects of ADT. One such intervention mode, exercise, is well supported in the literature for improving MetS variables in a variety of populations, including individuals with MetS, older adults and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, this area is largely understudied in men with prostate cancer, thus there is a lack of evidence to define the optimal use of exercise in prostate cancer patients receiving ADT. The purpose of this review is to (1) discuss the biologic inter-relationship between prostate cancer, ADT and MetS, and (2) describe the mechanistic implications for the utilization of exercise to target MetS and subsequent CVD risk.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for prostate cancer, more specifically with respect to monitoring for progression (on systemic treatment), EANM/EAU/ESTRO/ESUR/ISUP/SIOG 2025 guidelines recommend to assess PSA and testosterone levels and monitor patients for symptoms associated with metabolic syndrome as a side effect of androgen deprivation therapy during follow-up of patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy.

### EAU guidelines on prostate cancer. part II: treatment of advanced, relapsing, and castration-resistant prostate cancer [^114TbJ88]. European Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To present a summary of the 2013 version of the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on the treatment of advanced, relapsing, and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

Evidence Acquisition

The working panel performed a literature review of the new data (2011–2013). The guidelines were updated, and levels of evidence and/or grades of recommendation were added to the text based on a systematic review of the literature that included a search of online databases and bibliographic reviews.

Evidence Synthesis

Luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists are the standard of care in metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). LHRH antagonists decrease testosterone without any testosterone surge, and they may be associated with an oncologic benefit compared with LHRH analogues. Complete androgen blockade has a small survival benefit of about 5%. Intermittent androgen deprivation results in noninferior oncologic efficacy when compared with continuous androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) in well-selected populations. In locally advanced and metastatic PCa, early ADT does not result in a significant survival advantage when compared with delayed ADT. Relapse after local therapy is defined by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values > 0.2 ng/ml following radical prostatectomy (RP) and > 2 ng/ml above the nadir and after radiation therapy (RT). Therapy for PSA relapse after RP includes salvage RT (SRT) at PSA levels < 0.5 ng/ml and SRP or cryosurgical ablation of the prostate in radiation failures. Endorectal magnetic resonance imaging and 11C-choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) are of limited importance if the PSA is < 1.0 ng/ml; bone scans and CT can be omitted unless PSA is > 20 ng/ml. Follow-up after ADT should include analysis of PSA and testosterone levels, and screening for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. Treatment of CRPC includes sipuleucel-T, abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (AA/P), or chemotherapy with docetaxel at 75mg/m(2) every 3 wk. Cabazitaxel, AA/P, enzalutamide, and radium-223 are available for second-line treatment of CRPC following docetaxel. Zoledronic acid and denosumab can be used in men with CRPC and osseous metastases to prevent skeletal-related complications.

Conclusions

The knowledge in the field of advanced, metastatic, and castration-resistant PCa is rapidly changing. These EAU guidelines on PCa summarise the most recent findings and put them into clinical practice. A full version is available at the EAU office or at www.uroweb.org.

Patient Summary

We present a summary of the 2013 version of the European Association of Urology guidelines on treatment of advanced, relapsing, and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

Therapy for PSA relapse after RP includes salvage radiation therapy at PSA levels < 0.5 ng/ml and salvage RP or cryosurgical ablation of the prostate in radiation failures. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and 11C-choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) are of limited importance if the PSA is < 1.0 ng/ml; bone scans, and CT can be omitted unless PSA is > 20 ng/ml. Follow-up after ADT should include analysis of PSA and testosterone levels, and screening for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome.

Zoledronic acid and denosumab can be used in men with CRPC and osseous metastases to prevent skeletal-related complications. The guidelines reported should be adhered to in daily routine to improve the quality of care in PCa patients. As we have shown recently, guideline compliance is only in the area of 30–40%.

### Prostate cancer screening and the management of clinically localized disease [^114rgzsz]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

In contrast to observation, active surveillance involves repeat prostate biopsies every one to two years, in addition to PSA testing and digital rectal examination every three to four months. If these indicate reclassification to a higher risk status, treatment with curative intent is often started. Clinical experience with active surveillance suggests there is an estimated risk of metastasis of less than 1% at two to eight years.5ARI has shown promising results in reducing risk reclassification on active surveillance, but follow-up is too short to make definitive recommendations. Active surveillance is being compared with surgery or radiotherapy in the UK's ProtecT randomized trial.

No randomized trials have assessed mortality outcomes of external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy versus other management strategies in men with PSA detected prostate cancer. Treatment of localized prostate cancer is not an approved indication for ADT.

Radical surgery, external beam radiotherapy, or interstitial radiotherapy can cause serious harm because they treat the whole prostate regardless of risk, volume, or location of the cancer. This leads to collateral damage to the external urinary sphincter, neurovascular bundles, and rectal mucosa. Although rates of side effects vary between treatment modalities, urinary incontinence occurs in 10–20%, erectile dysfunction in 50%, and rectal toxicity (diarrhea, bleeding, pain) in 10–20%. Despite refinements in radiotherapy (conformal, intensity modulation, robotic radiosurgery) and radical prostatectomy (laparoscopic or robot assisted) these harms have not changed. No large long term RCTs have evaluated the clinical and cost effectiveness outcomes of these newer techniques. ADT is associated with an increased risk for impotence, hot flashes, metabolic syndrome, gynecomastia, and other serious harms. A recent meta-analysis of eight randomized trials in men with non-metastatic high risk prostate cancer found that ADT was not associated with increased mortality from cardiac disease.

### Presence of the metabolic syndrome is associated with shorter time to castration-resistant prostate cancer [^111vY61U]. Annals of Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a set of risk factors that includes obesity and insulin resistance and has been implicated in the development of prostate cancer. Its impact on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) efficacy has not been studied.

Patients and Methods

Retrospective study of prostate cancer patients seen from 1998 to 2005 in a medical oncology clinic. MS, as defined by modified Adult Treatment Panel III criteria, was assessed at the time of initiation of ADT. The study end points were time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression and overall survival (OS) from time of starting ADT.

Results

Eighty-two patients treated with ADT and data to assess for presence of MS were identified. Median age in men with and without MS was 70 years and 49% of the patients evaluated met criteria for MS. Median time to PSA progression for patients with MS was 16 versus 36 months without MS (P = 0.003). The median OS for patients with MS was 36.5 months after commencing ADT compared with 46.7 months for those patients without MS (P = 0.061).

Conclusions

This preliminary data suggest that MS is a risk factor for earlier development of castration-resistant prostate cancer and support the need for a prospective evaluation of this finding.

### A review of clinical effects associated with metabolic syndrome and exercise in prostate cancer patients [^114Gagrx]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Currently, there is insufficient evidence to directly indicate specific exercise guidelines to ameliorate MetS risk factors in prostate cancer patients on ADT. As ADT results in severe hypogonadism, and hypogonadism is an independent risk factor for MetS, ADT-induced metabolic complications are a significant issue in survivorship care (Figure 1). Furthermore, MetS is associated with worse prognosis in prostate cancer patients, including higher tumor grade, recurrence and increased mortality. Yet, a substantial body of work exists in support of exercise as a therapeutic intervention for favorably altering MetS variables, albeit in populations other than cancer survivors. In addition, exercise interventions conducted in prostate cancer survivors on ADT suggest that various forms of exercise programs, including resistance, aerobic and high-intensity interval training, are safe and well tolerated by patients, and may beneficially modify cardiometabolic risk factors. Thus, the features of interventions that elicit positive changes in MetS variables can be summarized to outline a possible exercise prescription (Table 3). Although large-scale RCTs are needed to ascertain the precise exercise prescription necessary to improve MetS factors arising from ADT administration, patients can still benefit from consistent exercise as improvements in muscle mass, strength, physical function and psychological well-being have been demonstrated. Therefore, participation in an appropriately designed exercise program may confer additional health benefits and should be encouraged for prostate cancer survivors receiving ADT.

### The emerging and promising role of care for cardiometabolic syndrome in prostate cancer [^113UDDe2]. JACC: CardioOncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Clinical Link Between Cardiometabolic Disorders and Prostate Cancer

Components of the metabolic syndrome such as obesity and diabetes are established risk factors for cardiovascular disease and may be risk factors for prostate cancer. Androgen deprivation therapy, which is central to the treatment of prostate cancer, can promote metabolic derangements, although the direct link between androgen deprivation therapy and overt cardiovascular disease is somewhat controversial. We propose that the clinical course of cardiometabolic syndrome and that of prostate cancer care are closely related.

The greatest concern in promoting an understanding and accomplishing this goal may be that physicians, including cardiologists, oncologists, urologists, and primary care providers, do not have enough knowledge about the increased prevalence of prostate cancer and the link between cardiometabolic disorders and the clinical course of prostate cancer. However, because cardiometabolic disorders can be managed and treated, we need to become familiar with such disease links and appropriately screen and manage cardiometabolic disorders in patients with prostate cancer. Furthermore, the clinical and academic connections among cardiologists, oncologists, and urologists may not be sufficient thus far. Accordingly, we do not have enough knowledge to solve these clinical challenges. Given the close relationship between cardiometabolic disease and prostate cancer, however, the top priority is for specialists to collaborate and share accurate and precise information. To accomplish such goals, comprehensive strategies, such as multidisciplinary clinics, greater involvement of the primary care provider, patient education, and public service announcements, are needed. Furthermore, prostate cancer survivorship programs and collaborative studies on risk identification and mitigation are additional challenges. Thus, to promote collaboration among specialists and those strategies, physicians will be required to renew their awareness of why further enhancement and research in cardiometabolic syndrome are needed at each stage of prostate cancer prevention and treatment. Although the ultimate goal is still far away, it is important to take this first step.

### Contemporary trends in the surgical management of urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy in the United States [^115qibsC]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To identify trends, costs, and predictors in the use of different surgical procedures for post-radical prostatectomy incontinence (PPI).

Materials and Methods

We identified 21,589 men who were diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (PCa) and treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) from 2003 to 2017. The primary outcome was the incontinence procedure performances. Optum's de-identified Clinformatics ® Data Mart Database was queried to define the cohort of interest. The average costs of the different incontinence procedures were obtained and compared. Also, demographic, and clinical predictors of incontinence surgery were evaluated by multivariable regression analysis.

Results

Of the 21,589 men with localized PCa treated with RP, 740 (3.43%) underwent at least one incontinence procedure during a median of 5 years of follow-up. In total, there were 844 unique incontinence procedures. Male slings were the most common procedure (47.5%), had an intermediate cost compared to the other treatment options, and was the first-choice treatment for the majority of patients (50%). The use of an artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) was the second most common (35.3%), but also was the most expensive treatment and was first-choice-treatment for 32.3% of patients. On multivariable analysis, metabolic syndrome related disorders, adjuvant/salvage radiation therapy as well as a history of neurological comorbidities were independently associated with an increased likelihood of incontinence surgery.

Conclusions

The receipt of male slings increased and then subsequently decreased, while AUS utilization was stable, and the use of urethral bulking agents was uncommon. From a cost standpoint, AUS was the most expensive option. Finally, patient's comorbidity history and RP related factors were found to influence the choice for primary or subsequent PPI interventions.

### Metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia and prostate cancer recurrence after primary surgery or radiation in a veterans cohort [^11592MuS]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been hypothesized to be associated with cancer, including prostate cancer (PCa), but the relationship is not well characterized. We analyze the relationship between MetS features and localized PCa recurrence after treatment.

Methods

Men having primary treatment for localized PCa were included from a multi-site regional veteran network. Recurrence was defined as nadir PSA +2ngml(-1) (radiation) or PSA⩾0.2ngml(-1) (prostatectomy). MetS was based on consensus professional society guidelines from the American Heart Association and International Diabetes Federation (three of: hypertension > 130/85mmHg, fasting blood glucose ⩾100mgdl(-1), waist circumference > 102cm, high-density lipoprotein < 40mgdl(-1), triglycerides ⩾150mgdl(-1)). Closely related abnormality in low-density lipoprotein (LDL; > 130mgdl(-1)) was also examined. Analysis of PCa recurrence risk included multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with propensity adjustment.

Results

Of the 1706 eligible men, 279 experienced recurrence over a median follow-up period of 41 months (range 1–120 months). Adjustment variables associated with PCa recurrence included: index PSA, Gleason, and tumor stage. Independent variables of interest associated with PCa recurrence were hyperglycemia and elevated LDL. Elevated LDL was associated with PCa recurrence (multivariable hazard ratio (HR) 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03, 1.74; propensity adjusted HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.03, 1.72). There was also an association between impaired fasting glucose and PCa recurrence in (multivariable HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.10, 2.15; propensity adjusted HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.01, 1.95). MetS was not associated with PCa recurrence (multivariable: HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.61, 1.50; propensity adjusted HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.67, 1.62).

Conclusions

PCa recurrence is not associated with MetS but is associated with elevated LDL and impaired fasting glucose. If confirmed, these data may help provide modifiable targets in preventing recurrence of PCa.

### Metabolic syndrome is associated with prostate enlargement: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression on patients with lower urinary tract symptom factors [^113TQZgL]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The strengths of our study include a clear objective and inclusion/exclusion criteria, not limited by sample size, follow-up period, length of intervention, or setting. We performed an extensive search of MEDLINE, SCOPUS, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov; reference lists of selected articles and other literature sources were also searched to ensure a comprehensive search of sources. Each study was screened by two independent reviewers; conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer. Data extraction was reviewed by a second reviewer. We have included a PRISMA flowchart with reasons for exclusion of studies; the list of excluded studies (and conflicts) is available on Covidence. We included a table of eligible studies, detailed summaries, and characteristics. We performed a quality assessment (NOS) for each study included in our study (Table 1). Our current meta-analysis on TPV and MetS (k = 30, n = 22,206) indicated significant results, albeit heterogeneity was relatively high (Figure 3). Furthermore, a robust method with Sidik–Jonkman estimation and Hartung–Knapp adjustment was used to avoid type I error (false positives) in obtained results and to control for possible uncertainty due to heterogeneity. In addition, a meta-regression analysis was conducted to address the resultant high heterogeneity; there was no significance in predictors being associated with effect sizes (Figure 4(a)–(c); Tables 3 and 4). Furthermore, an Egger's test of the intercept indicated no funnel plot asymmetry (Figure 4(d)); publication bias was not present. We performed a risk of bias assessment using the QUIPS tool and generated a graph (Figure 5).

### A novel model to predict positive prostate biopsy based on serum androgen level [^112foXib]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

In terms of endocrinology, much of the circulating TT in the blood is bound to protein and not available to cells. To investigate the relationship between androgens and prostate cancer risk, we focused on FT, which is bioavailable and a measurable component in TT. TT concentration refers to both bioavailable and non-bioavailable testosterone in the circulation. The term 'bioavailable testosterone' represents the sum of FT plus testosterone bound loosely to albumin. FT represents only 0.5–3% of TT, but FT is considered the more biologically active form. In Japan, FT values are used in the diagnosis late-onset hypogonadism (LOH).

In young men, FT represents about 2–3% of TT. As men age, although TT declines (0.4%/year), FT declines to a greater extent (1.2%/year), resulting in a lower %FT in older men. In this study, the median age is 69 years (range 35–84) and the median %FT is 0.21% (range 0.019–1.27%).

The relationship of FT to prostate cancer treatment and outcomes remains largely unexplored, with only a few studies investigating a possible connection. Hoffman and coworkers retrospectively reviewed 117 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. They reported that all men with a Gleason score of 8 or greater on their prostate biopsy had low free testosterone. They concluded that this finding suggested low serum free testosterone is a marker of more aggressive disease. Leon and coworkers prospectively assessed whether preoperative circulating testosterone levels, obesity and metabolic syndrome were correlated with aggressive pathological features after robotic prostatectomy. As a result of examining 354 patients undergoing robot-assisted prostatectomy, they concluded that low FT levels were linked with high-grade prostate cancer.

In total, the relationship between prostate cancer risk and absolute androgen concentration remain controversial. In the present study, we focused not only on TT and FT, but also on the FT/TT ratio (i.e. %FT). A survey of the most current literature includes only one study that examines the utility of %FT as a predictor for high-grade prostate cancer in men undergoing prostate biopsy. They collected data on 812 white Italian men who underwent prostate biopsy and analyzed the association between prostate biopsy and serum androgen concentrations. They conclude that a greater %FT level was associated with an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer (Gleason score ≥ 7), but not low-grade prostate cancer (Gleason score ≤ 6).

### EAU guidelines on prostate cancer. part II: treatment of advanced, relapsing, and castration-resistant prostate cancer [^115qaWdf]. European Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Our aim is to present a summary of the 2010 version of the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on the treatment of advanced, relapsing, and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

Methods

The working panel performed a literature review of the new data emerging from 2007 to 2010. The guidelines were updated, and the levels of evidence (LEs) and/or grades of recommendation (GR) were added to the text based on a systematic review of the literature, which included a search of online databases and bibliographic reviews.

Results

Luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists are the standard of care in metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). Although LHRH antagonists decrease testosterone without any testosterone surge, their clinical benefit remains to be determined. Complete androgen blockade has a small survival benefit of about 5%. Intermittent androgen deprivation (IAD) results in equivalent oncologic efficacy when compared with continuous androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) in well-selected populations. In locally advanced and metastatic PCa, early ADT does not result in a significant survival advantage when compared with delayed ADT. Relapse after local therapy is defined by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values > 0.2 ng/ml following radical prostatectomy (RP) and > 2 ng/ml above the nadir after radiation therapy (RT). Therapy for PSA relapse after RP includes salvage RT at PSA levels < 0.5 ng/ml and salvage RP or cryosurgical ablation of the prostate in radiation failures. Endorectal magnetic resonance imaging and (11)C-choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography (CT) are of limited importance if the PSA is < 2.5 ng/ml; bone scans and CT can be omitted unless PSA is > 20 ng/ml. Follow-up after ADT should include screening for the metabolic syndrome and an analysis of PSA and testosterone levels. Treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) includes second-line hormonal therapy, novel agents, and chemotherapy with docetaxel at 75 mg/m(2) every 3 wk. Cabazitaxel as a second-line therapy for relapse after docetaxel might become a future option. Zoledronic acid and denusomab can be used in men with CRPC and osseous metastases to prevent skeletal-related complications.

Conclusion

The knowledge in the field of advanced, metastatic, and CRPC is rapidly changing. These EAU guidelines on PCa summarise the most recent findings and put them into clinical practice. A full version is available at the EAU office or online at www.uroweb.org.

### A review of clinical effects associated with metabolic syndrome and exercise in prostate cancer patients [^115bWBBJ]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance

IR accompanies prediabetes, diabetes and obesity, and is an independent risk factor for CVD. ADT is associated with increased IR, independent of body composition and age. Compromised insulin sensitivity as a result of ADT occurs as an early consequence, increases in severity over time, and eventually culminates in hyperglycemia and finally type 2 diabetes. ADT further exacerbates insulin metabolism by increasing fasting insulin levels, and decreasing insulin sensitivity. Changes in insulin sensitivity have been noted with short (12 weeks)or long-term (over 45 months)ADT use. Likely to exacerbate the observed development of IR are unfavorable changes in body composition, mainly increased visceral adiposity, following ADT use, thus resulting in a cardiometabolic adverse side effect such as MetS. In particular, the adipocytokines leptin and adiponectin, both secreted by adipose tissue, function to modulate insulin sensitivity and are elevated during ADT use. Leptin is involved in appetite and the regulation of energy homeostasis, with levels secreted from adipose tissue in proportion to central adiposity. Circulating levels of leptin increase during ADT use, with or in the absence of increased fat deposition. The actions of adiponectin generally oppose those of leptin such that reductions in adiponectin levels are observed with obesity, type 2 diabetes, CVD, hypertension and MetS. Adiponectin is normally suppressed by testosterone, thus the observed increase in adiponectin during ADT is due to the lack of suppression by testosterone. Notably, the effects of adiponectin on insulin sensitivity occurring with ADT use does not overcome the effects of androgen deprivation on the prevalence of hyperinsulinemia.

Managing cardiometabolic risk and MetS

CVD and diabetes are the leading causes of non-cancer deaths in prostate cancer survivors, thus it is imperative that men using ADT undergo assessments of their cardiometabolic profile before and intermittently during therapy to prevent MetS and additional comorbidities. The American Heart Association, American Cancer Society and American Urological Association have issued guidelines for men receiving ADT, which includes an evaluation of blood pressure, lipids and glucose within 3–6 months of initiating therapy with assessment annually for long-term therapy. Additional recommendations have been proposed, although not yet adopted, include: (1) maintenance of ideal body weight and waist circumference; (2) smoking cessation; (3) blood pressure control; (4) lipid control; (5) annual screening for diabetes mellitus; and (6) aspirin therapy with established CVD. Importantly, these recommendations may be mitigated through regular participation in exercise, thus the remainder of this review will focus on implications of exercise to attenuate MetS in prostate cancer survivors on ADT.

### Number of metabolic syndrome components is the central predictor of the impact of metabolic syndrome on outcome of percutaneous nephrolithotomy in staghorn nephrolithiasis [^1154wm5k]. Journal of Endourology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is the coexistence of several cardiovascular and endocrine risk abnormalities (International Diabetes Federation, 2006). Its diagnostic criteria include obesity (body mass index [BMI] > 30 kg/m 2) with at least two of the following: hypertension (HT; blood pressure [BP] > 130/85 mm Hg), diabetes mellitus (DM; fasting plasma glucose [FPG] > 5.6 mmol/L), increased triglycerides (TG; > 1.7 mmol/L), and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL; < 1.03 mmol/L in men or < 1.29 mmol/L in women), or treatment for any one of these disorders.

Prevalence and etiology between MetS and urolithiasis are positively correlated. Nevertheless, few studies have focused on the impact of MetS on urologic surgeries. MetS is concerned with higher perioperative complications in coronary artery bypass surgery and arthroplasty. However, the impact of MetS on urologic surgeries remains controversial. MetS has been reported to not increase the risk of cystectomy and prostatectomy. However, other studies have supported that MetS increased infectious complications for prostate biopsy.

According to the 2018 European Association of Urology guidelines, percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is the standard therapy for renal stones > 2 cm, especially for those in the lower calix and staghorn. The impact of MetS on the clinical outcome of PCNL is controversial. With comparable stone size of 7.8 vs 7.6 cm 2, Akman and colleagues reported that MetS did not increase stone-free rate (SFR) or complications, whereas Ahmet found that MetS increased major complications of PCNL (21.9% vs 10.3%). Another study focusing on small stones with an average of size of 3 cm 2 found higher complication rate and lower SFR in patients with MetS than in patients without MetS. It is unclear whether stone size affects the impact of MetS on PCNL.

### Impact of metabolic syndrome in surgical patients: should we bother? [^111EodqG]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Clinicians inevitably encounter patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for the metabolic syndrome (MetS); these criteria include central obesity, hypertension, atherogenic dyslipidaemia, and hyperglycaemia. Regardless of the variations in its definition, MetS may be associated with adverse outcomes in patients undergoing both cardiac and non-cardiac surgery. There is a paucity of data concerning the anaesthetic management of patients with MetS, and only a few observational (mainly retrospective) studies have investigated the association of MetS with perioperative outcomes. In this narrative review, we consider the impact of MetS on the occurrence of perioperative adverse events after cardiac and non-cardiac surgery. Metabolic syndrome has been associated with higher rates of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal perioperative events and wound infections compared with patients with a non-MetS profile. Metabolic syndrome has also been related to increased health service costs, prolonged hospital stay, and a greater need for posthospitalization care. Therefore, physicians should be able to recognize the MetS in the perioperative period in order to formulate management strategies that may modify any perianaesthetic and surgical risk. However, further research is needed in this field.

Fatigue and subjective quality of life scores both favoured the intervention (Table 3). Post hoc analyses showed that the effect on the EQ-5D-5L VAS was driven predominantly by men at site B (who underwent radical prostatectomy between time points), and that intervention participants were less likely to cross the clinically significant threshold for deterioration on both fatigue (χ 2 = 3.5, p = 0.06) and VAS score (χ 2 = 4.2, p = 0.04). There was no significant difference in changes in exercise motivation between the groups.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1166gDuF]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2026 Prostate Cancer — Metabolic effects during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT): Several mechanisms may contribute to greater risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease during ADT, including increases in fat mass with decreases in lean body mass, increases in fasting plasma insulin levels with decreases in insulin sensitivity when ADT is given with an LHRH agonist, and increases in serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

### EAU-ESTRO-SIOG guidelines on prostate cancer. part II: treatment of relapsing, metastatic, and castration-resistant prostate cancer [^112ctAgG]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To present a summary of the 2016 version of the European Association of Urology (EAU) - European Society for Radiotherapy & Oncology (ESTRO) - International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) Guidelines on the treatment of relapsing, metastatic, and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

Evidence Acquisition

The working panel performed a literature review of the new data (2013–2015). The guidelines were updated, and the levels of evidence and/or grades of recommendation were added based on a systematic review of the literature.

Evidence Synthesis

Relapse after local therapy is defined by a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level > 0.2ng/ml following radical prostatectomy (RP) and > 2ng/ml above the nadir after radiation therapy (RT). 11 C-choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography is of limited importance if PSA is < 1.0ng/ml; bone scans and computed tomography can be omitted unless PSA is > 10ng/ml. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and biopsy are important to assess biochemical failure following RT. Therapy for PSA relapse after RP includes salvage RT at PSA levels < 0.5ng/ml and salvage RP, high-intensity focused ultrasound, cryosurgical ablation or salvage brachytherapy of the prostate in radiation failures. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the basis for treatment of men with metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). However, docetaxel combined with ADT should be considered the standard of care for men with metastases at first presentation, provided they are fit enough to receive the drug. Follow-up of ADT should include analysis of PSA, testosterone levels, and screening for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. Level 1 evidence for the treatment of metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) includes, abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (AA/P), enzalutamide, radium 223 (Ra 223), docetaxel at 75 mg/m 2 every 3 wk and sipuleucel-T. Cabazitaxel, AA/P, enzalutamide, and radium are approved for second-line treatment of CRPC following docetaxel. Zoledronic acid and denosumab can be used in men with mCRPC and osseous metastases to prevent skeletal-related complications.

Conclusions

The knowledge in the field of advanced and metastatic PCa and CRPC is changing rapidly. The 2016 EAU-ESTRO-SIOG Guidelines on PCa summarise the most recent findings and advice for use in clinical practice. These PCa guidelines are the first endorsed by the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology and the International Society of Geriatric Oncology and reflect the multidisciplinary nature of PCa management. A full version is available from the EAU office or online (http://uroweb.org/guideline/prostate-cancer/).

Patient Summary

In men with a rise in their PSA levels after prior local treatment for prostate cancer only, it is important to balance overtreatment against further progression of the disease since survival and quality of life may never be affected in many of these patients. For patients diagnosed with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, several new drugs have become available which may provide a clear survival benefit but the optimal choice will have to be made on an individual basis.

### Association between preoperative erectile dysfunction and prostate cancer features – an analysis from the Duke prostate center database [^114seCnf]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is related to several co-morbidities including obesity, metabolic syndrome, cigarette smoking, and low testosterone, all of which have been reported to be associated with adverse prostate cancer features.

Aim

To examine whether preoperative ED has a relationship with adverse prostate cancer features in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP).

Methods

We analyzed data from our institution on 676 patients who underwent RP between 2001 and 2010. Crude and adjusted logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between preoperative ED and several pathological parameters. The log-rank test and multivariate proportional hazards model were conducted to determine the association of preoperative ED with biochemical recurrence (BCR).

Main Outcome Measures

The expanded prostate cancer index composite (EPIC) instrument was used to evaluate preoperative erectile function (EF). Preoperative normal EF was defined as EPIC-SF ≥ 60 points while ED was defined as preoperative EPIC-SF lower than 60 points.

Results

Preoperatively, a total of 343 (50.7%) men had normal EF and 333 (49.3%) men had ED. After adjusting for covariates, preoperative ED was identified a risk factor for positive extracapsular extension (OR 1.57; P = 0.029) and high percentage of tumor involvement (OR 1.56; P = 0.047). In a Kaplan-Meier curve, a trend was identified that patients with ED had higher incidence of BCR than men with normal EF (P = 0.091). Moreover, using a multivariate Cox model, higher preoperative EF was negatively associated with BCR (HR 0.99; P = 0.014).

Conclusions

These results suggest that the likelihood for adverse pathological outcomes as well as BCR following prostatectomy is higher among men with preoperative ED, though these results require validation in larger datasets. The present study indicates that preoperative ED might be a surrogate for adverse prostate cancer outcomes following RP.

### A review of clinical effects associated with metabolic syndrome and exercise in prostate cancer patients [^115En6PK]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Our laboratory is currently investigating the effects of a 12-week progressive RT intervention in prostate cancer patients on ADT (NCT01909440). In this RCT, the main inclusion criteria are serum testosterone concentration < 50 ng dL −1 for study duration due to current or previous ADT, completion of radiation therapy > 4 weeks before study enrollment, and recovery from major surgery within 6 months. Study end points are comprised of alterations in cardiometabolic variables including all MetS risk factors, body composition, physical function and quality of life. Participants randomized to the exercise group complete three sessions per week of supervised, whole-body RT using a model of systematic progression previously unemployed in exercise interventions for prostate cancer patients on ADT. The progression model, known as periodization, has been used primarily in athletic populations and is regarded as a superior method for optimally eliciting physiological and performance-related improvements. Periodized RT may serve as an ideal strategy for concomitantly increasing lean body mass while decreasing the fat mass, results not demonstrated with an AT-only intervention, thus optimizing beneficial changes in cardiometabolic variables. For this reason, RT, rather than AT, is utilized in our trial. The attention-control group receives a home-based stretching program and is offered the intervention following study completion. Findings from this study may provide an evidence-based exercise prescription for improving ADT-related adverse effects, including MetS, and contribute to the growing body of literature supporting the role of exercise in cancer survivorship. We are aware of other prospective studies involving exercise and prostate cancer survivorship with several studies incorporating novel ways to deliver exercise prescription, including recreational football-based training (NCT02430792), Xbox Kinect-based training (NCT01762241), supervised group AT+RT training (NCT02631681), or home-based training (NCT02248350).

### Duration of androgen deprivation therapy with postoperative radiotherapy for prostate cancer: a comparison of long-course versus short-course androgen deprivation therapy in the RADICALS-HD randomised trial [^116gwFap]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this randomised controlled trial of patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy after previous radical prostatectomy, long-course ADT for 24 months was more effective than short-course ADT for 6 months in terms of metastasis-free survival, a clinically important long-term outcome measure. However, this benefit did not translate into an improvement in overall survival with a median of 9 years of follow-up. These results indicate that, on average, 16 people need to be treated with long-course ADT for one of them to avoid an metastasis-free survival event within 10 years. This metastasis-free survival benefit should be weighed against the extended duration of the well-known adverse effects associated with ADT, such as sexual dysfunction, metabolic syndrome, and osteoporosis. In addition, after 24 months of ADT, testosterone recovery is often prolonged or incomplete, so any adverse effects can be long-lasting.

These results are largely consistent with previous trials that had generated the hypothesis that long-course ADT would be more effective than short-course ADT. Of the two previous phase 3 trials of short-course ADT in the salvage radiotherapy setting, only one found a metastasis-free survival benefit, and neither showed any improvement in overall survival (HR 0·93 in GETUG-AFU 16 and HR 0·87 in RTOG 0534). The only trial of long-course hormone therapy, RTOG 9601 (which used bicalutamide monotherapy rather than ADT), reported an improvement in not just metastasis-free survival, but also in overall survival (HR 0·77). Taken together with RADICALS-HD, patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy seem to benefit more from the addition of long-course, rather than short course, ADT.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113uSXWU]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Radical prostatectomy — patient selection and long-term outcomes state that radical prostatectomy is appropriate for any patient whose cancer appears clinically localized to the prostate, but because of potential perioperative morbidity it should generally be reserved for patients whose life expectancy is 10 years or more. In long-term follow-up, a 15-year prostate cancer-specific mortality of 12% was reported in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, including 5% for patients with low-risk disease. In a randomized trial of 695 patients with early-stage prostate cancer (mostly T2), with a median follow-up of 12.8 years, those assigned to the radical prostatectomy group had significant improvements in disease-specific survival, OS, and risk of metastasis and local progression.

### A review of clinical effects associated with metabolic syndrome and exercise in prostate cancer patients [^112kZA3A]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a primary treatment for locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, is associated with the adverse effects on numerous physiologic parameters, including alterations in cardiometabolic variables that overlap with components of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). As MetS is an established risk factor for cardiovascular mortality and treatment for prostate cancer has been associated with the development of MetS, interventions targeting cardiometabolic factors have been investigated in prostate cancer patients to attenuate the detrimental effects of ADT. Much support exists for exercise interventions in improving MetS variables in insulin-resistant adults, but less evidence is available in men with prostate cancer. Regular exercise, when performed at appropriate intensities and volumes, can elicit improvements in ADT-related adverse effects, including MetS, and contributes to the growing body of literature supporting the role of exercise in cancer survivorship. This review (1) discusses the biologic inter-relationship between prostate cancer, ADT and MetS, (2) evaluates the current literature in support of exercise in targeting MetS and (3) describes the physiological mechanisms by which exercise may favorably alter MetS risk factors in prostate cancer patients on ADT.

### The emerging and promising role of care for cardiometabolic syndrome in prostate cancer [^111LiqZZ]. JACC: CardioOncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer is characterized clinically by slow growth and a relatively good prognosis, but its incidence is increasing rapidly in Japan. A recent retrospective analysis from the U.S. National Inpatient Sample also demonstrated that prostate cancer was among the most common malignant diseases in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Early detection by prostate-specific antigen screening and advances in prostate cancer therapy have led to a relatively good prognosis and a lengthy clinical course. Accordingly, we can expect the number of prostate cancer survivors and persons living with prostate cancer to continue to grow.

Prostate cancer incidence increases with age. At the same time, older men demonstrate an increased prevalence of pre-existing lifestyle-related diseases, including cardiometabolic syndrome, resulting in an increased risk of comorbid cardiovascular disease (CVD). We expect that physicians are likely to encounter such conditions accompanying prostate cancer with increased frequency. Physicians, including cardiologists, primary care providers, oncologists, and urologists, need to realize that compared with other types of cancer, prostate cancer involves a long-term interaction with a cardiometabolic syndrome that is closely related to its clinical course. However, the links between prostate cancer and cardiometabolic disease have not been fully characterized, and no clear strategies for preventing and managing cardiometabolic syndrome in patients with prostate cancer have been established.

Therefore, we propose that the emerging link between prostate cancer and cardiometabolic syndrome will become increasingly important as a specialty in cardio-oncology and that greater research and development are needed. Although this link is clinically ceaseless and mutual, we summarize this issue here.

### Optimal pain management for radical prostatectomy surgery: what is the evidence? [^116u1fFn]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, with more than 240.000 patients newly diagnosed per year in the United States alone. Radical prostatectomy remains one of the key techniques to treat prostate cancer, and the incidence of surgery has risen with improved prostate-specific antigen screening programmes.

Optimal pain management is known to influence postoperative recovery, but patients undergoing open radical prostatectomy typically experience moderate dynamic pain in the immediate postoperative days. Robot-assisted and laparoscopic surgery may be associated with decreased pain levels as opposed to open surgery, but even here, abdominal and incisional pain are prominent sources of moderate dynamic pain scores.

The literature assessing the efficacy of various analgesic drugs and techniques in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, optimal pain therapy for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy remains to be defined.

The aim of the present systematic review is to evaluate the available literature on the management of pain after radical prostatectomy. Postoperative pain outcomes (e.g. pain scores and supplemental analgesic requirements) are the primary focus, but other recovery outcomes, including adverse effects, are also assessed where reported, and the limitations of the data are reviewed. This systematic review will also be used to determine the knowledge gaps, which will guide future research. In addition, this review can serve as a starting point for developing recommendations for clinical decision-making in the management of pain after radical prostatectomy surgery.

### A high high-density lipoprotein level is associated with gleason score upgrade in Chinese patients diagnosed with high-grade prostate carcinoma [^114fzeqS]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Recently metabolic syndrome has been associated with an increased risk of advanced disease. Their study investigated the association of metabolic syndrome with the risk of prostate cancer upgrading and upstaging after radical prostatectomy. Patients with metabolic syndrome presented the worst accuracy and kappa coefficient of agreement between needle biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens. Therefore, results should be evaluated carefully in patients with metabolic syndrome.

To improve the histologic grading system for scoring the invasiveness of prostate cancer, a study indicated that prostate-specific antigen density is a valuable predictor of upgrading and upstaging in men with prostate cancer who were candidates for surgery and is accurate in selecting patients for active surveillance. Another study demonstrated that the new Epstein Gleason score classification significantly reduces upgrading in prostate cancer patients. Their results showed that the five-tier Gleason grading system presented a lower clinically significant upgrading rate and a similar clinically significant downgrading rate compared to the 2005 ISUP classification. When evaluating their accuracy, the new five-tier Gleason grading system presented a better specificity and a better negative predictive value. Together, these results indicated that prostate-specific antigen density and a five-tier Gleason grading system could improve the inaccuracy of GSU.

There are two limitations of this research. First, it is a single-center study with a small sample size, which could cause selection bias. Second, in a retrospective study, we could not include other known factors of inflammation and cholesterol because they are not routinely included in laboratory examinations for prostate cancer. Neutrophile count, percentage of lymphocyte, and serum HDL level are inexpensive and easily performed laboratory examination data. Extensive sample size studies are needed to clarify the predictive roles in GSU.

### Metabolic syndrome is associated with prostate enlargement: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression on patients with lower urinary tract symptom factors [^116DGRup]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The present meta-analysis indicated no significant association between MetS, or its components, and LUTS. This is likely due to significant heterogeneity of methods used to evaluate LUTS symptoms in the studies we included. Regarding TPV and MetS, a significant association was noted in our study and is consistent with other studies in this field. Obesity, large WC, hypertension, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia have been associated with worse symptoms of uropoietic disorders at multivariate analysis. Interventions aimed at weight loss including behavioral modification, obesity pharmacotherapy, and obesity surgery are recommended and should be at the forefront of management of patients with MetS and disorders of the uropoietic system.

### Post-surgical outcomes of patients with chronic kidney disease and end stage renal disease undergoing radical prostatectomy: 10-year results from the US national inpatient sample [^112SCB7q]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI), estimated to occur in 21% of all hospital admissions worldwide, is associated with increased disease burden, healthcare costs, and mortality. In addition to the higher risk for renal replacement therapies (RRTs) such as dialysis and kidney transplant, such patients also are at higher risk for cardiovascular events, fractures, and anemia. Further, hospitalized patients with AKI are at 8–9 times greater risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 3 times greater risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD). A 2017 World Bank report estimated that the prevalence of CKD, defined in 2002 as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, is likely to be similar in developed and developing countries, although the etiologies and populations will differ. Estimates of prevalence range from 7 to 15%. Prevalence of ESRD is shown to be much lower, about 0.03%. While Western CKD and ESRD patients are often older adults with diabetes and hypertension, those in developing countries are younger, and reduced kidney function is associated with infectious diseases (e.g. HIV/AIDS, malaria, leptospirosis), herbal medicines, obstetric complications, and exposure to environmental toxins. The younger patients in developing countries also have much lower access to treatment; one study found that only 5% of ESRD patients in China, India, and Nigeria have access to RRT.

Whatever the etiology, CKD is a significant risk factor for increased post-surgical morbidity, which includes longer hospital stays, particularly in men receiving radical prostatectomy. One study on the impact of CKD on early postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing urological oncological surgery (including radical prostatectomy) concluded that renal dysfunction may be under-recognized in such patients, and CKD stages III, IV and V are independent predictors for poor 30-day postoperative outcomes.

Radical prostatectomy is the gold standard treatment for locally advanced prostate cancer, the most common type of cancer in men in the US. Advances in detection (including prostate specific antigen [PSA] levels, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and a refined Gleason score) have increased the number of men presenting with localized prostate cancer. A Cochrane systematic review found few clinically relevant differences in outcomes for such patients between open radical prostatectomy (ORP) and either laproscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).

### Benign prostatic enlargement can be influenced by metabolic profile: results of a multicenter prospective study [^113ZACm6]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the most common conditions among middle and advance-aged men. Autopsy studies revealed presence of BPH in 42% of men aged 51–60 year and 85% among men older than 80 year; BPH is characterized by stromal and cell hyperplasia which can lead to the development of prostatic bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS); severe BPH leads to deterioration of QoL and has relevant socio-economic costs. Historically BPH pathogenesis is linked to age and androgens effect but more recently other factors including family history, ethnicity, lifestyle behaviours (reduced physical activity, cigarette smoking and high fat diet) as well as metabolic diseases have been suggested to play an important role.

Metabolic syndrome(MetS) is a worldwide complex disorder with high socioeconomic impact. MetS describes the combination of several metabolic abnormalities, including central obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinemia, and glucose intolerance.

In the last 15 years several MetS components have been closely associated with BPH, suggesting that MetS has very heterogeneous clinical ramifications.

Although the relationship between BPH/LUTS and MetS is still poorly understood, some findings suggest that men with metabolic alterations faster develop BPH or are more likely to undergo BPH surgery, supporting the hypothesis that pathological alterations typical of MetS also predispose to the development and progression of BPH/LUTS. Indeed, in a recent meta-analysis, we demonstrated that subjects with MetS have significantly higher total and transitional zone prostate volume.

Aim of the present study is to evaluate the correlations between the presence of MetS and each single MetS parameter on prostate's anthropometric measures in men surgically treated for BPE.

### Effect of a brief physical activity-based presentation by a former patient for men treated with radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer: a mixed methods pilot study [^114Dhuta]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Participants

Participants were 148 men (n = 79 control; n = 69 intervention) who had received radical prostatectomy (i.e. curative therapy) for localised prostate cancer (see Table 1). Fifteen men who experienced the intervention were approached for qualitative interview, of which fourteen were interviewed.

Table 1
Clinical and demographic characteristics of study sample

a n = 1 missing data

The inclusion criteria were:
Diagnosis of localised prostate cancer.
Received radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer at one of the two sites studied.
Attended a posttreatment (site A) or pretreatment (site B) educational seminar.
[Qualitative interviews] Attended an intervention seminar.

Patients were excluded if:
They were unable to speak English.
They had a visual or hearing impairment.
They experienced postoperative complications that resulted in a deviation from standard postoperative follow-up procedures.

Primary outcome: self-reported PA

The primary outcome was self-reported PA. This was measured at baseline (immediately prior to the seminar) and at T 1, which was either 90 days after the seminar (site A); or 90 days after undergoing radical prostatectomy (site B). Self-reported PA was measured using the Short Questionnaire to Assess Health-Enhancing Physical Activity (SQUASH). The SQUASH is a brief questionnaire that asks respondents to report how much PA they have done in the past week. For analysis, responses were converted to metabolic task equivalent (MET) minutes.

### Hyperglycemia and prostate cancer recurrence in men treated for localized prostate cancer [^116eMTrw]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Obesity is consistently linked with prostate cancer (PCa) recurrence and mortality, though the mechanism is unknown. Impaired glucose regulation, which is common among obese individuals, has been hypothesized as a potential mechanism for PCa tumor growth. In this study, we explore the relationship between serum glucose at time of treatment and risk of PCa recurrence following initial therapy.

Methods

The study group comprised 1734 men treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT) for localized PCa between 2001–2010. Serum glucose levels closest to date of diagnosis were determined. PCa recurrence was determined based on PSA progression (nadir PSA+2 for RT; PSA ≥ 0.2 for RP) or secondary therapy. Multivariate Cox regression was performed to determine whether glucose level was associated with biochemical recurrence after adjusting for age, race, body mass index, comorbidity, diagnosis of diabetes, Gleason Sum, PSA, treatment and treatment year.

Results

Recurrence was identified in 16% of men over a mean follow-up period of 41 months (range 1–121 months). Those with elevated glucose (≥ 100mg/dl) had a 50% increased risk of recurrence (HR 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1–2.0) compared with those with a normal glucose level (< 100mg/dl). This effect was seen in both those undergoing RP (HR 1.9, 95% CI: 1.0–3.6) and those treated with RT (HR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0–2.0).

Conclusions

Glucose levels at the time of PCa diagnosis are an independent predictor of PCa recurrence for men undergoing treatment for localized disease.

### Benign prostatic enlargement can be influenced by metabolic profile: results of a multicenter prospective study [^112yxSWS]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Study population and design

Between January 2012 and September 2013, 379 consecutive patients undergone prostatectomy for LUTS due to large BPE, were prospectively enrolled in two tertiary referral centers. In both high volume referral centers, all patients included in this trial were managed by surgeons skilled in diagnosis and treatment of LUTS/BPE. Informed consent for the study was obtained from participants. The study did not require any deviation of the Good Clinical Practice so was conducted in accordance with the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.

In the study were included patients undergone simple open prostatectomy (OP) or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for moderate to severe LUTS due to BPE refractory to medical treatment. Patients with previous history of prostate surgery, chronic medication for prostatitis and/or urinary infection or bladder stone or known malignant disease including prostate cancer were excluded.

PSA values and prostate volume were evaluated during the pre-hospitalization visits. Raw prostate volume was calculated by suprapubic US (by using the "estimated ellipsoid volume" based on prostatic circumference), while calculated prostate volume was measured by transrectal US defining the antero-posterior (AP), the cranio-caudal (CC) and the latero-lateral (LL) diameters through the ellipsoid formula (D1xD2xD3xπ/6). OP and TURP were performed as previously reported. LUTS were measured by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and categorized as storage and voiding symptoms, immediately before surgery and 6 to 12 months postoperatively.

Definition of MetS

MetS was defined according to criteria defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program-Third Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP-ATPIII). According these criteria MetS is defined by the presence of at least 3 of the following parameters: (1) waist circumference > 102 cm; (2) triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dl or treatment for hypetriglyceridemia, (3) HDL-Co < 40 mg/dl or treatment for reduced HDL-C, (4) blood pressure ≥ 130/85 mmHg or current use of antihypertensive medications, and (5) fasting blood glucose > 110 mg/dl or previous diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. All these items of MetS were considered individually (single parameters above vs below cut-off points), as sum of continuous variables (one if the single parameter is positive for MetS, zero if the single parameter is negative), and combined according to MetS (present or absent).

### Effects of resistance exercise in prostate cancer patients: a meta-analysis [^111UhYHk]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment of prostate cancer includes surgery, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and chemotherapy. Furthermore, ADT is part of the standard therapy for patients suffering from high-risk disease, defined as those cases with stage T3 and T4 tumors, a Gleason score of 8 to 10 and PSA levels higher than 20 ng/mL, as well as locally advanced prostate cancer. ADT seems to be a valuable adjuvant to radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer. Almost half of all PCaPs receive ADT at some point in their therapy. Long-term ADT is known to improve mortality, but comes at the cost of treatment-related morbidity. PCaPs receiving ADT are susceptible to loss of muscle strength and muscle mass, as well as increase of fat mass. Further side effects of ADT are alterations in lipolysis profile and insulin metabolism as well as increased arterial stiffness. These changes are accompanied with an increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus type II, and osteoporosis. ADT is related to earlier onset of serious myocardial infarctions, especially in PCaPs older than 65 years of age. Therefore, lifestyle changing interventions like dietary adjustments and exercise were recommended to mitigate cardiovascular risk. The negative changes of body composition that are particularly associated with ADT and their visible effect like muscle loss, gynecomastia, and female pattern weight gain are perceived as emasculating and hence associated with psychosocial morbidity in PCaPs. Consequently, preservation of body composition alone is already considered a positive outcome in PCaPs. Resistance exercise (RE) has shown beneficial effects not just in the general public, but in specific patient populations such as patients suffering from metabolic syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer. As the loss of muscle mass and increase of visceral fat mass may be a key factor in the development of cardiovascular disease, RE, causing initiation of muscle hypertrophy, might be the medical training therapy of choice to effectively combat adverse body composition changes. Aerobic exercise (AE) might be a potent exercise modality to decrease visceral fat mass and to counteract an increased cardiovascular risk profile. In PCa, however, AE does not target the basic physiology of the problem, which is loss of muscle mass. Moreover, RE may indirectly have a beneficial effect on visceral fat mass via an upregulation of adipose tissue lipolysis, as mediated through adiponectin. RE seems to be a safe, feasible, and effective rehabilitation tool for PCaPs undergoing ADT. To our knowledge, no meta-analysis has recently investigated the effectiveness of RE in PCaPs. We hypothesize that RE has significant beneficial effects on muscle strength, physical performance and function, body composition, HRQoL, and fatigue in PCaPs. The aim of this meta-analysis was to quantify these effects.

### Obesity, prostate-specific antigen nadir, and biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: biology or technique? Results from the SEARCH database [^114mKmdP]. European Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Obesity is associated with an increased risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP). It is unclear whether this is due to technical challenges related to operating on obese men or other biologic factors.

Objective

To examine whether obesity predicts higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir (as a measure of residual PSA-producing tissue) after RP and if this accounts for the greater BCR risk in obese men.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective analysis of 1038 RP patients from 2001 to 2010 in the multicenter US Veterans Administration-based Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital database with median follow-up of 41 mo.

Intervention

All patients underwent RP.

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

We evaluated the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and ultrasensitive PSA nadir within 6 mo after RP. Adjusted proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between BMI and BCR with and without PSA nadir.

Results and Limitations

Mean BMI was 28.5 kg/m2. Higher BMI was associated with higher PSA nadir on both univariable (p = 0.001) and multivariable analyses (p < 0.001). Increased BMI was associated with increased BCR risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.06; p = 0.007). Adjusting for PSA nadir slightly attenuated, but did not eliminate, this association (HR: 1.04, p = 0.043). When stratified by PSA nadir, obesity only significantly predicted BCR in men with an undetectable nadir (p = 0.006). Unfortunately, other clinically relevant end points such as metastasis or mortality were not available.

Conclusions

Obese men are more likely to have a higher PSA nadir, suggesting that either more advanced disease or technical issues confound an ideal operation. However, even after adjusting for the increased PSA nadir, obesity remained predictive of BCR, suggesting that tumors in obese men are growing faster. This provides further support for the idea that obesity is biologically associated with prostate cancer progression.

### Impact of body mass index on clinicopathological outcome and biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy [^114Kidyf]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Accumulating evidence suggests that obesity is associated with tumor progression in prostate cancer (PCa) patients after radical prostatectomy (RP). We conducted a retrospective multicenter study to determine the effect of body mass index (BMI) on the clinicopathological characteristics and biochemical recurrence of PCa in Japanese men who underwent RP.

Methods

The medical records of 1257 men with PCa treated by RP without neoadjuvant therapy at four medical institutes between 2001 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were categorized into four groups using the World Health Organization (WHO) BMI classification and BMI quartiles. Associations of the various BMI categories with clinicopathological characteristics and biochemical recurrences were statistically evaluated. Biochemical recurrence was defined as a PSA level of > 0.2ngml(-1).

Results

Of the 1257 patients, 230 (18.3%) experienced biochemical recurrence during the median follow-up period of 49 months. The median BMI was 23.8kgm(-2), and 1.4% patients were underweight, 65.4% were of normal weight, 30.9% were overweight and 2.4% were obese (WHO classification). Preoperative PSA levels and PSA density (PSAD) tended to decrease as BMI increased. Pathological characteristics did not differ significantly among BMI categories. As per the WHO classification and quartile categories, biochemical recurrence rate was comparable among the BMI groups. After adjusting for other pre- and postoperative covariables, multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that a high BMI did not have an independent impact on biochemical recurrence-free survival.

Conclusions

Underweight Japanese PCa patients treated by RP had higher preoperative PSA levels and PSAD. High BMI was not associated with adverse pathological findings or increased biochemical recurrence rate in Japanese PCa patients treated with RP. Racial differences may exist in the relationship between obesity and outcomes of RP in PCa patients.

### Urological aspects of the metabolic syndrome [^113xnxy4]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2011). Medium credibility.

The metabolic syndrome is common in countries with Western lifestyles. It comprises a number of disorders-including insulin resistance, hypertension and obesity-that all act as risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Urological diseases have also been linked to the metabolic syndrome. Most established aspects of the metabolic syndrome are linked to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. Fasting plasma insulin, in particular, has been linked to BPH and incident, aggressive and lethal prostate cancer. The metabolic syndrome has also been shown to be associated with nonprostatic urological conditions such as male hypogonadism, nephrolithiasis, overactive bladder and erectile dysfunction, although data on these conditions are still sparse. Overall, the results of studies on urological aspects of the metabolic syndrome seem to indicate that BPH and prostate cancer could be regarded as two new aspects of the metabolic syndrome, and that an increased insulin level is a common underlying aberration that promotes both BPH and clinical prostate cancer. Urologists need to be aware of the effect that the metabolic syndrome has on urological disorders and should transfer this knowledge to their patients.

### Metabolic syndrome in men with prostate cancer undergoing long-term androgen-deprivation therapy [^111wgknm]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancers in men. Men with recurrent or metastatic PCa are treated with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), resulting in profound hypogonadism. Because male hypogonadism is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome and men with PCa have high cardiovascular mortality, we evaluated the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in men undergoing long-term ADT.

Patients and Methods

This was a cross-sectional study. We evaluated 58 men, including 20 with PCa undergoing ADT for at least 12 months (ADT group), 18 age-matched men with nonmetastatic PCa who had received local treatment and were recently found to have an increasing prostate-specific antigen (non-ADT group), and 20 age-matched controls (control group). Men in the non-ADT and control groups were eugonadal. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria.

Results

Mean age was similar among the groups. Men on ADT had significantly higher body mass index and lower total and free testosterone levels. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was higher in the ADT group compared with the non-ADT (P < .01) and control (P = 0.03) groups. Among the components of metabolic syndrome, men on ADT had a higher prevalence of abdominal obesity and hyperglycemia. Androgen-deprived men also had elevated triglycerides compared with controls (P = 0.02). The prevalence of hypertension and low high-density lipoprotein levels were similar.

Conclusion

These data suggest that metabolic syndrome was present in more than 50% of the men undergoing long-term ADT, predisposing them to higher cardiovascular risk. Abdominal obesity and hyperglycemia were responsible for this higher prevalence. We recommend prospective studies to further delineate this association.

### Perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes in obese patients undergoing Da Vinci robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114XVMfe]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Based on the current meta-analysis, the perioperative outcomes, total complications, functional outcomes, and oncologic outcomes of RAPA in the obese group were worse than those in the non-obese group. This may suggest that we should have a healthy lifestyle and control our weight. Further studies should be performed to evaluate the oncologic outcomes for obese patients undergoing RARP.

### Associations of fat and muscle mass with overall survival in men with prostate cancer: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^113UyMmF]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The strengths of the present study are: (1) a relatively large number of studies (n = 16) with up to 4807 prostate cancer patients included; (2) the assessment of both univariable and multivariable models; and (3) subgroup analyses based on different clinical and methodological characteristics. However, there are also some limitations which are worthy of comment. First, only cohort studies undertaking retrospective analyses were included in our review and this precludes determining causality of body composition changes such as increase in muscle mass and reduction in fat mass on overall survival. Future prospective analyses are necessary to improve current knowledge by indicating if interventions targeting fat and muscle mass are able to improve overall and disease-specific survival as well as recurrence in men with prostate cancer. In addition, researchers used different definitions for sarcopenia such as the skeletal muscle index, psoas muscle or median values, while no definition for adiposity measures was used, leading to high heterogeneity within the models. Sarcopenia has become a topic of great interest in oncology; however, poorly understood given the lack of reporting on assessment characteristics and definitions. For example, although studies had reported the time of body composition assessment, the high heterogeneity and lack of standardisation could misclassify prostate cancer patients with obesity or sarcopenia and, therefore, mask the impact of these outcomes on overall survival. Future research should better inform definitions (i.e. cut-off values and rationale) and time of assessments, and information about clinical factors associated with muscle mass accrual or maintenance in this group of patients. This will improve the assessment of sarcopenia as well as provide information about its interaction with obesity on overall survival in this group of patients and assist future systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Nonetheless, subgroup analysis was undertaken based on previously defined methods to identify sarcopenia vs. median values to minimise such bias, with the results largely maintained, although the same was not conducted for fat mass given the lack of previous definitions. Finally, data concerning the association of fat mass and muscle mass measures with prostate cancer-specific and cardiovascular mortality as well as specific information about deaths are limited. Therefore, it is not possible to account for deaths directly or indirectly related to prostate cancer treatment comorbidities (e.g. metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cardiovascular disease).

### Minimally invasive infrapubic inflatable penile prosthesis implant for erectile dysfunction: evaluation of efficacy, satisfaction profile and complications [^114vqM19]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

After premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction (ED) is the most common male sexual disorder.ED is described as persistent inability to obtain and maintain an erection sufficient to permit satisfactory sexual performance. It is associated with age and has an incidence between 2–28.9% in the age group from 30 to 39 and 41.9–83% in the age group from 70 to 80.ED has an important impact on man sexuality and quality of life (QoL), but also affect female partner's sexual life.

ED's main risk factors are related to cardiovascular disease and specifically have been found to be sedentary lifestyle, obesity, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Besides medical comorbidity, one of the main causes of ED is iatrogenesis following pelvic surgery. Radical prostatectomy, even when a bilateral nerve-sparing technique is applied, is connected with an incidence of ED of up to 44%. In cases not suitable for a nerve-sparing procedure, sexual potency is preserved in only 0–17% of patients.

### Metabolic syndrome and smoking are associated with persistence of nocturia after transurethral resection of the prostate [^116UpRzT]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between smoking, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and persistence of nocturia in patients with moderate/severe nocturia (nocturia episodes ≥ 2), lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs), and benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).

Methods

From 2015 onward, a consecutive series of patients with moderate/severe nocturia (nocturia episodes ≥ 2), LUTS, and BPE undergoing TURP were prospectively enrolled. Medical history, physical examination, and smoking status were recorded. MetS was defined according to Adult Treatment Panel III. Moderate/severe persistent nocturia after TURP was defined as nocturia episodes ≥ 2. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the risk of persisting nocturia.

Results

One hundred two patients were enrolled with a median age of 70 years (interquartile range: 65/73). After TURP, moderate/severe nocturia was reported in 43 of 102 (42%) of the patients. Overall 40 of 102 (39%) patients presented a MetS, and out of them, 23 of 40 (58%) presented a moderate/severe persistent nocturia after TURP (P = 0.001). Overall 62 of 102 (61%) patients were smokers, and out of them, 32 of 62 (52%) presented moderate/severe persistent nocturia after TURP (P = 0.034). On multivariate analysis, prostate volume, MetS, and smoking were independent risk factors for moderate/severe persistent nocturia after TURP.

Conclusion

In our single-center study, MetS and smoking increased the risk of moderate/severe persistent nocturia after TURP in patients with LUTS-BPE. Although these results should be confirmed, and the pathophysiology is yet to be completely understood, counseling smokers and MetS patients about the risk of postoperative persistent nocturia is warranted.

### Use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy to prevent or delay recurrence of prostate cancer in patients undergoing surgical treatment for prostate cancer [^115p8yE7]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

There have been improvements in the outcome of patients with clinically localized prostate cancer treated by radical prostatectomy. However, some patients treated with radical prostatectomy will have clinical or biochemical progression. These men are at increased risk of dying of their disease. Identification of patients with adverse features at the time of radical prostatectomy may permit the use of additional multimodality therapies to improve outcomes. Whether this additional multimodality therapy should be administered in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting remains controversial. Further, whether a patient at increased risk for progression after radical prostatectomy requires additional therapy before the development of documented progression remains controversial. This article reviews the potential multimodality approaches to prevent or delay recurrence of prostate cancer in patients undergoing surgical treatment for prostate cancer.

### Synergistic interaction of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis on prostate cancer risk [^112hU9XP]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer that affects men in Western countries, particularly in the United States. The incidence and prevalence of prostate cancer in the United States have continuously increased since the introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screen test in 1992. Among the 217 730 new cases estimated in 2010, prostate cancer accounted for 28% of all cancers in American men. This cancer was also responsible for 22.2% (n = 382 000) of cancers that affected men in 40 European countries in 2008 and 31.2% (n = 19 403) of cancers in Australian men in 2007. Although the incidence is much lower in Asian men than in Western men, the incidence rate of prostate cancer has continuously increased in recent decades. According to the Taiwan Cancer Registry Report, the incidence of prostate cancer increased from 7.5/100 000 in 1992 to 23.5/100 000 in 2007. Furthermore, the clinical outcome of localised prostate cancer post-radical prostatectomy has been unsatisfactory, and mortality due to prostate cancer is increasing in Taiwan.

Relatively little is known about the risk factors associated with the increasing trend of prostate cancer in Asian men, other than the fact that prostate cancer is highly related to aging, ethnicity, and family history of prostate cancer. Much attention has recently been given to the roles of chronic inflammation and infection in the pathogenesis and progression of prostate cancer. The literature has suggested the association between prostatitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prostate cancer.considered prostatitis as an early sign of cancer for men with adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Components of metabolic syndromes and BPH are also strongly related to aging. These metabolic syndromes may contribute to the development of BPH and clinical prostate cancer. Prostate cancer screening in symptomatic BPH patients is, therefore, of great concern for men, particularly when the alternative therapies used do not involve tissue pathological analysis.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115wCSUY]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Active surveillance in favorable intermediate-risk disease — the literature is limited; in the PIVOT trial, patients with clinically localized prostate cancer and a life expectancy greater or equal to 10 years were randomized to radical prostatectomy or observation. Of the 120 participants with intermediate-risk disease who were randomized to observation, 13 died from prostate cancer compared with 6 deaths in 129 in the radical prostatectomy arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.50; 95% CI, 0.21–1.21; p = 0.12). After longer follow-up (median 12.7 years), a small difference in all-cause mortality was seen in those with intermediate-risk disease (absolute difference, 14.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.8–25.6), but not in those with low-risk disease (absolute difference, 0.7 percentage points; 95% CI, −10.5–11.8). Urinary incontinence and erectile and sexual dysfunction were worse through 10 years in the radical prostatectomy group.

### Post-surgical outcomes of patients with chronic kidney disease and end stage renal disease undergoing radical prostatectomy: 10-year results from the US national inpatient sample [^114FA7hV]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, patients with CKD and ESRD undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer have a greater likelihood of postoperative morbidities and longer hospital stays than those without CKD. Patients receiving radical prostatectomy should be carefully evaluated for kidney dysfunction, as this factor significantly affects post-surgical outcomes. RARP appears to have better outcomes than ORP in terms of postoperative complications and length of stay; however, these results need to be further confirmed. Further investigation and vigilance in treating the CKD/ESRD population, and evaluating the possible influence of CKD stages, is highly warranted.

### Predicting competing mortality in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy aged 70 yr or older [^1141wfko]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Estimating the risk of competing mortality is of importance in tailoring optimal individual management strategies in patients with early prostate cancer. Using proportional hazard models for competing risks, we determined which parameters predict competing mortality in patients selected for radical prostatectomy aged 70 yr or older and compared the prognostic impact of individual parameters with that of their younger counterparts. Three common diseases (diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, and other cancer) that predicted competing mortality in younger men were not predictors of competing mortality in men selected for radical prostatectomy aged 70 yr or older (hazard ratio [HR]: < 1). Besides age (HR/yr: 1.08, p = 0.0255), peripheral vascular disease (HR: 2.33, p = 0.0195), cerebrovascular disease (HR: 2.23, p = 0.0242), American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class 3 (HR: 2.19, p < 0.0001), current smoking (HR: 2.18, p = 0.0098), and lower or unknown level of education (HR: 2.07, p = 0.0002) were independent predictors of competing mortality in patients aged 70 yr or older. Combining these five conditions in a score might provide a superior comorbidity measure in this particular population.

Patient Summary

Stricter selection may diminish the prognostic significance of several common diseases in men selected for radical prostatectomy aged 70 yr or older whereas other parameters (peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class 3, current smoking, and level of education) sustained their meaningfulness and should be taken into consideration when the risk of competing mortality is estimated.

### Perioperative outcomes among patients with the modified metabolic syndrome who are undergoing noncardiac surgery [^115FdbuZ]. Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies have demonstrated that obesity is paradoxically associated with a lower risk of mortality after noncardiac surgery. This study will determine the impact of the modified metabolic syndrome (defined as the presence of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes) on perioperative outcomes.

Methods

This study is based on data from 310,208 patients in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. We estimated separate multivariate logistic regression models for 30-day mortality and for 30-day complications.

Results

Patients with the modified metabolic syndrome who are super obese had a 2-fold increased risk of death (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.99; 95% CI 1.41–2.80). As stratified by body mass index, patients with the modified metabolic syndrome had a 2- to 2.5-fold higher risk of cardiac adverse events (CAE) compared with normal-weight patients: obese (AOR 1.70; 95% CI 1.40–2.07), morbidly obese (AOR 2.01; 95% CI 1.48–2.73), and super obese (AOR 2.66; 95% CI 1.68–4.19). In addition, the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) was 3- to 7-fold higher in these patients: obese (AOR 3.30; 95% CI 2.75–3.94), morbidly obese (AOR 5.01; 95% CI 3.87–6.49), and super obese (AOR 7.29; 95% CI 5.27–10.1).

Conclusion

Patients with the modified metabolic syndrome undergoing noncardiac surgery are at substantially higher risk of complications compared with patients of normal weight.

### Metabolic syndrome is associated with prostate enlargement: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression on patients with lower urinary tract symptom factors [^1162LU4n]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Most previous studies did not record and adjust for all confounders. Not all studies excluded covariates, for example, neuropathy. In diabetic patients, hyperglycemia can result in small nerve fiber damage, known as neuropathy. This disorder can lead to an array of urological conditions, including urgency, incontinence, incomplete emptying, UTIs, and ED. Diabetes can also cause uropathy, which is when there is an obstruction in the urinary tract; this results in bladder disorders, recurrent UTIs, and sexual dysfunction. Oxidative damage can also cause a loss of bladder sensation. Patients with neuropathy would be more likely to report worse LUTS symptoms and quality-of-life scores. In women, diabetic neuropathy was significantly associated with LUTS. In men, prostatic growth is stimulated by elevated activity of the sympathetic nerve, which is caused by elevated insulin levels. Studies did not always collect data on comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease or T2D. Patients with diabetes have been shown to have higher incidences of DO and patients also tend to be older, which is another factor that increases the likelihood of developing LUTS. In addition, the following confounding factors could also lead to a variation in results. At binary logistic regression, OAB significantly correlated (p < 0.001) with duration of menopausal > 5 years (OR = 25.7, 95% CI = 5.82 = 113.72), parity more than twice (OR = 27.94, 95% CI = 8.25–94.6), and previous gynecological surgery (OR = 33.04, 95% CI = 8.78–124.38). Moderate-to-severe LUTS incidence was increased twofold in men aged 70 to 79 years (OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.32–3.38) compared with other age groups.OAB was linearly associated with asthma (p = 0.001), bladder or prostate cancer (p = 0.001), and neurological conditions (stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis; p < 0.001). Major adverse cardiac events (MACE), such as acute myocardial infarction, were positively associated with moderate–severe LUTS (OR = 2.38, 95% CI = 2.56–3.07, p < 0.001). Alcohol consumption > 72 g/day caused close to a threefold increased risk of moderate–severe LUTS (OR = 2.96, 95% CI = 1.61–5.44). History of STIs was also a risk factor (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.08–2.07). Vigorous physical activity negatively correlated with incidence of moderate–severe LUTS (OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.44–0.85). Zhu et al. negatively correlated OAB with employment status (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.46–0.90). However, a meta-analysis by Zhu et al. also found no significant association between OAB and the following: menopause, sex, vaginal delivery, educational level, parity, race, marital status, smoking, and alcohol consumption.

### Incontinence after prostate treatment: AUA / SUFU guideline [^113xXHL4]. The Journal of Urology (2019). High credibility.

Radical prostatectomy counseling — Clinicians should inform patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) that incontinence is expected in the short-term and generally improves to near baseline by 12 months after surgery but may persist and require treatment (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). A commonly accepted definition of urinary continence is not requiring a pad or protective device to stay dry (pad-free), most men undergoing RP are not continent (pad-free) at the time of catheter removal and should be informed that continence is not immediate, and most men achieve continence within 12 months of surgery; because incontinence is expected in the early phase after surgery, conservative management with regular follow-up during the first year after surgery is recommended to assess patient progress.

### Association of metabolic syndrome and its components with the risk of urologic cancers: a prospective cohort study [^11181BYw]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Definition of variables

According to the harmonized International Diabetes Federation criteria, MetS is defined as the occurrence of three or more of the following five risk factors: (1) central obesity, defined as WC ≥ 90 cm in men and WC ≥ 80 cm in women; (2) elevated TG, defined as TG ≥ 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) and/or drug treatment for elevated TG; (3) reduced HDL-C, defined as HDL-C < 40 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L) in males and HDL-C < 50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) in females and/or drug treatment for reduced HDL-C; (4) elevated BP, defined as systolic BP ≥ 130 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 85 mmHg, and/or a history of hypertension treated with antihypertensive drugs; and (5) elevated FBG, defined as FBG ≥ 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) and/or receiving glucose-lowering medication for elevated glucose.

Smoking status was classified as follows: non-smoker (has never smoked); former smoker (has not smoked for more than 12 months); and current smoker (smokes one or more cigarettes per week for not less than 12 consecutive months). Alcohol consumption status was divided into the following categories: never, former (abstained from alcohol for more than six months) and current alcohol consumption (one or more drinks per month for no less than six months in a row). Physical activity was classified according to the frequency of physical activity (20 min = 1 instance of activity) performed during leisure time. The categories of physical activity were: no exercise, exercise occasionally (between one and three instances of activity per week), and frequent exercise (four or more instances of activity per week).

### Does metabolic syndrome increase the risk of postoperative complications in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery? [^11614hBh]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Metabolic syndrome is associated with poorer postoperative outcomes after various abdominal operations. However, the impact of metabolic syndrome on outcomes after colorectal cancer surgery remains poorly described.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the association between metabolic syndrome and short-term postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgery.

Design

This was a retrospective cohort study.

Settings

This study used a national multicenter database.

Patients

Adult patients who underwent elective colectomy for colorectal cancer from 2010 to 2016 were identified in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database.

Main Outcome Measures

Thirty-day postoperative mortality and morbidity, unplanned reoperation, unplanned readmission, operative time, and length of stay were measured.

Results

A total of 91,566 patients were analyzed; 7603 (8.3%) had metabolic syndrome. On unadjusted analysis, metabolic syndrome was associated with an increased risk of 30-day overall morbidity, pulmonary complications, renal complications, septic complications, cardiac complications, wound complications, blood transfusion, longer length of stay, and unplanned readmissions. On multivariable analysis, metabolic syndrome remained significantly associated with renal complications (OR = 1.44 (95% CI, 1.29–1.60)), superficial surgical site infection (OR = 1.46 (95% CI, 1.32–1.60)), deep surgical site infection (OR = 1.40 (95% CI, 1.15–1.70)), wound dehiscence (OR = 1.47 (95% CI, 1.20–1.80)), and unplanned readmissions (HR = 1.24 (95% CI, 1.15–1.34)). The risks of overall morbidity, cardiac and septic complications, and prolonged length of stay for laparoscopic procedures were significantly associated with diabetes mellitus rather than metabolic syndrome as a composite entity.

Limitations

This study was limited by its retrospective design and inability to analyze outcomes beyond 30 days.

Conclusions

Patients with metabolic syndrome undergoing elective surgery for colorectal cancer have an increased risk of 30-day postoperative renal complications, wound complications, and unplanned hospital readmissions. A multidisciplinary approach involving lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic interventions to improve the components of metabolic syndrome should be implemented preoperatively for these patients.

### Metabolic syndrome and benign prostatic hyperplasia: association or coincidence? [^112a7eVD]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Study population

The study group consisted of males aged 50–75 years who had been referred to the university-affiliated Department of Urology in Szczecin due to moderate-to-severe LUTS, including filling, irritative, voiding, and obstructive symptoms. Using the standard International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) tool, a quality of life questionnaire, and prostate imaging, patients were diagnosed; those receiving a diagnosis of BPH were referred to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), according to current recommendations and practical guidelines. Eligibility criteria were, according to the European Association of Urology, included in prostate volume above 20–80 mL on transrectal ultrasonography and IPSS result 8 or more.

The control group consisted of age-matched men who had IPSS scores between 0 and 7 and who were neither diagnosed nor considered for treatment for BPH. These subjects were randomly selected from the local general practitioner registers. The exclusion criteria in both groups included a body mass index above 35.0 kg/m 2, malignancy in the past 5 years, heart failure, severe liver diseases, and chronic kidney disease. Overall, there were 128 males with BPH and 141 without BPH who completed all the study procedures. Informed consent was obtained from each patient in the study. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin and conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki (6th revision, 2008).

### The comparative harms of open and robotic prostatectomy in population based samples [^111WBz2Q]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Robotic assisted radical prostatectomy has largely replaced open radical prostatectomy for the surgical management of prostate cancer despite conflicting evidence of superiority with respect to disease control or functional sequelae. Using population cohort data, in this study we examined sexual and urinary function in men undergoing open radical prostatectomy vs those undergoing robotic assisted radical prostatectomy.

Materials and Methods

Subjects surgically treated for prostate cancer were selected from 2 large population based prospective cohort studies, the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study (enrolled 1994 to 1995) and the Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery and Radiation (enrolled 2011 to 2012). Subjects completed baseline, 6-month and 12-month standardized patient reported outcome measures. Main outcomes were between-group differences in functional outcome scores at 6 and 12 months using linear regression, and adjusting for baseline function, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate outcomes between patients undergoing open radical prostatectomy and robotic assisted radical prostatectomy within and across CEASAR and PCOS.

Results

The combined cohort consisted of 2,438 men, 1,505 of whom underwent open radical prostatectomy and 933 of whom underwent robotic assisted radical prostatectomy. Men treated with robotic assisted radical prostatectomy reported better urinary function at 6 months (mean difference 3.77 points, 95% CI 1.09–6.44) but not at 12 months (1.19, -1.32–3.71). Subjects treated with robotic assisted radical prostatectomy also reported superior sexual function at 6 months (8.31, 6.02–10.56) and at 12 months (7.64, 5.25–10.03). Sensitivity analyses largely supported the sexual function findings with inconsistent support for urinary function results.

Conclusions

This population based study reveals that men undergoing robotic assisted radical prostatectomy likely experience less decline in early urinary continence and sexual function than those undergoing open radical prostatectomy. The clinical meaning of these differences is uncertain and longer followup will be required to establish whether these benefits are durable.

Results in Studies to Determine the Optimal Use of Tadalafil Tablets — Several studies were conducted with the objective of determining the optimal use of tadalafil tablets in the treatment of ED. In one of these studies, the percentage of patients reporting successful erections within 30 minutes of dosing was determined. In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial, 223 patients were randomized to placebo, tadalafil tablets 10, or 20 mg. Using a stopwatch, patients recorded the time following dosing at which a successful erection was obtained. A successful erection was defined as at least 1 erection in 4 attempts that led to successful intercourse. At or prior to 30 minutes, 35% (26/74), 38% (28/74), and 52% (39/75) of patients in the placebo, 10-, and 20-mg groups, respectively, reported successful erections as defined above.

### High-risk biochemical recurrence of locally treated prostate cancer after EMBARK. An end to decades of conventional wisdom? [^1157pxTR]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The BCR population is heterogeneous. Many patients won't develop metastases. Efforts have been made to stratify that population. The disease trajectory can be estimated by combining the Gleason score, the interval between the local treatment and the BCR, and, more importantly, the PSA doubling time (PSADT). In Freedland's landmark publication, the HR for the time to PCa-specific death after BCR following radical prostatectomy was 3.53 (p = 0.002) for interval ≤ 3 vs. > 3 years, 2.26 (p = 0.002) for a pathological Gleason score ≥ 8 vs. < 8, and 8.76 (p < 0.0013) for a PSADT between 3.0 and 8.9 vs. ≥ 15 months. Similar observations have been made after radiotherapy. There have been many attempts to define an optimal definition of high/low-risk BCR integrating PSA kinetic and pathological characteristics, hence leading to several definitions with different prognostic value field. The EAU guidelines stratify BCR patients into low and high risk, the latter being the patients with PSADT < 1 year or a pathological ISUP grade 4–5 after radical prostatectomy and an interval to biochemical failure < 18 months or a biopsy ISUP grade 4–5 for after radiotherapy.

The only treatment to decide on for many years was ADT. No study has definitively shown that immediately starting ADT improves OS. The largest trial so far randomized 293 men between immediate and delayed ADT. Interestingly, the definition of delayed included a decrease in PSADT ≤ 6 months. Five-year OS were 86.4% and 91.2% in the delayed and immediate ADT arms, respectively (HR 0·55, p = 0·050). ADT also has side effects, including hot flashes, loss of libido, and cognitive decline. Administered over a long period, ADT induces metabolic changes that can lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular events and decreases bone mineral density, leading to an excess risk of fracture. Consequently, physicians usually consider that the risk of ADT outweighs its benefits and generally agree that strategies aiming at delaying ADT are acceptable. The guidelines are more prudent, stating that immediate ADT should not be offered to low-risk patients.

### Post-surgical outcomes of patients with chronic kidney disease and end stage renal disease undergoing radical prostatectomy: 10-year results from the US national inpatient sample [^113Pfx4c]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer-specific survival has not been addressed in controlled trials that directly compared laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and RARP with ORP. Also, data regarding the clinical features and postoperative outcomes of patients who received a radical prostatectomy with CKD and ESRD are limited. Therefore, we used the comprehensive National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from 2005 to 2014 to clarify: 1) the characteristics and 2) in-hospital outcomes of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer with or without CKD or ESRD. We hypothesized that patients with baseline CKD and ESRD who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer would have higher rates of postoperative morbidities and longer hospital stays than those with intact kidney function. In addition, we also evaluated whether RARP leads to better postsurgical outcomes than open surgery in all cases and in subgroups according to kidney health status.

### The comparison of outcomes between neoadjuvant novel and classical hormonal therapy in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer: a retrospective study [^1136R4dB]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Radical prostatectomy (RP) and radiotherapy are the recommended treatment for selected patients with high-risk, locally advanced prostate cancer. Despite advancements in treatment, patients with locally advanced prostate cancer still face an increased risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR), metastatic progression and cancer-related death. Although high-risk prostate cancer accounts for only 20% of all localized prostate cancers, nearly 50% of patients experience BCR and the fifteen-year mortality rate exceeds 30% following definitive therapy. This poor prognosis may be attributed to the presence of micrometastatic disease at the time of initial diagnosis. Early intensive treatment with neoadjuvant hormonal therapy may improve oncologic outcomes in high-risk prostate cancer.

Some reports have explored the prognosis in these patients receiving neoadjuvant hormonal therapy prior to RP. Several clinical trials have demonstrated that neoadjuvant classical hormonal therapy (CHT) is associated with tumor downstaging, reduction in prostate volume, and lower positive surgical margins. However, these trials did not demonstrate superior oncological outcomes in terms of biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS) and overall survival. As a result, the European Association of Urology guidelines currently do not recommend neoadjuvant hormonal therapy prior to RP. Although radical radiotherapy is an alternative treatment for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer, some patients are unable to receive radiotherapy, such as those with severe diabetes or those who have previously received pelvic radiation. Or some younger patients might benefit from early surgical intervention. Therefore, we need to improve the patient management in those requiring surgical options.

### A pilot' window of opportunity' neoadjuvant study of metformin in localised prostate cancer [^117FHWcT]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Metformin is an inhibitor of complex 1 in the respiratory chain, and is widely used to reduce insulin resistance. It has also been described to have pleotropic effects including via AMPK on inhibiting the mTOR kinase. Pre-clinical and epidemiological studies suggest an ability to modulate disease evolution in prostate cancer. In this study, we aimed to (i) demonstrate safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant metformin administration and (ii) document changes in proliferative (Ki67) and AMPK-related signalling indices between matching biopsies and prostatectomies

Methods

Men were treated in a single-arm 'window of opportunity' study between their decision to undergo radical prostatectomy and the operation itself. Forty patients were planned but only 24 patients were enrolled owing to slow accrual. Twenty-one patients were evaluable for pathological outcomes and 22 for serum metabolic indices. Metformin was given at doses to 500mg t.i.d. Ki67 index was calculated using the Aperio-positive pixel count algorithm, whereas immunohistochemical measurements were by consensus H-Score. Comparative statistics were analysed by students t-tests and/or Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test.

Results

Baseline characteristics included median PSA 6ngml(-1) (3.22–36.11ngml(-1)). Median duration of drug treatment was 41 days (18–81). Treatment was well tolerated with only three patients developing G3/4 toxicities. In a per patient and per tumour analyses, metformin reduced the Ki67 index by relative amounts of 29.5 and 28.6% (P = 0.0064 and P = 0.0042) respectively. There was also a significant decrease in P-4EBP1 staining (P < 0.001) but no change in P-AMPK or P-ACC. There were no correlations between any metabolic, morphometric or cancer-related serum indices. There was a trend towards PSA reduction (P = 0.08). The study is limited by small patient numbers and tumour heterogeneity.

Conclusions

Neoadjuvant metformin is well tolerated prior to radical prostatectomy. Data to date indicate promising effects on metabolic and tissue proliferation and signalling parameters.

### Sexual outcomes in men who have sex with men who underwent radical prostatectomy [^112CHqUm]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sexual difficulties are a recognized consequence of prostate cancer (PCa) treatments. An estimated one in three men who have sex with men (MSM) receive PCa a diagnosis during their lifetime. MSM may experience all types of sexual dysfunction as reported in men who have sex with women (MSW), along with a number of more specific bothersome problems. This systematic literature review aims to evaluate sexual outcomes in MSM who have undergone radical prostatectomy (RP).

Methods

A systematic review was carried out following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The searches were made using relevant keywords in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, thus including the whole literature from January 2000 to November 2023. Studies which did not allow to retrieve data on sexual outcomes on MSM treated with RP for PCa were excluded. Data on sexual outcomes and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were retrieved, mostly including changes in libido, erectile function, ejaculatory disorders, orgasm, climacturia, changes in role-in-sex identity, changes in sexual partnerships, and the presence of painful receptive anal intercourses (AI).

Prospero Id

CRD42024502592.

Results

Six articles met the inclusion criteria. In total, data of 260 patients were analyzed. Three main themes emerged: (a) MSM may experience specific sexual dysfunctions due to the different dynamics of their intimacy; (b) the lack of tool validated on gay and bisexual population to assess sexual outcomes (c) the need for a tailored approach that also takes into account sexual orientation throughout the oncological journey.

Conclusions

MSM undergoing RP may experience similar sexual problems as MSW. Painful AI should be considered a potential post-operative adverse outcome in MSM. Future studies should prioritize validating a questionnaire that explores AI. Healthcare providers should adopt a tailored approach that takes into account sexual orientation throughout the cancer journey.

Radical prostatectomy — baseline prophylaxis stance indicates that the panel judged that the benefit favors no pharmacological prophylaxis for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy, based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects, with this assessment focused on average patients undergoing robotically assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy with no or limited lymph node dissection; patients undergoing an extended node dissection and/or open radical prostatectomy may have a higher VTE risk and may potentially benefit from pharmacological prophylaxis, and for most patients undergoing radical prostatectomy, the panel recommended against the use of pharmacological prophylaxis.

### Impact of metabolic syndrome on the morbidity and mortality of patients undergoing panniculectomy [^113Xuvhv]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is defined as the concomitant disease process of obesity and at least two of the following variables: diabetes, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, or reduced high-density lipoprotein. These entities are well established as risk factors for complications following surgery. Obese patients are particularly prone to the development of MetS. The authors therefore aimed at elucidating the impact of MetS on the perioperative panniculectomy outcomes.

Methods

The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was analyzed for all primary procedures of panniculectomy from 2010 through 2015. The cases were stratified based on the presence or absence of MetS and evaluated for demographic data, intraoperative details, and their morbidity and mortality within 30 days after surgery.

Results

A total of 7030 cases were included in this study. Patients with MetS (6.2%) were of significantly worse health, required more emergency admissions (p = 0.022), longer hospitalization (p < 0.001), and more frequently inpatient procedures (p < 0.001) compared to the control group without MetS (3.8%). Plastic surgery was the predominant specialty operating on 79.5% of all cases. Surgical (23.3 vs. 8.7%) complications, readmission (8.7 vs. 3.0%), and reoperations (6.9 vs. 3.1%) rates were all significantly higher in patients with MetS that those without (p < 0.001). One fatality occurred in each cohort (0.23 vs. 0.02%, p = 0.010).

Conclusion

Comorbidities are not uncommon in patients undergoing panniculectomy, especially in those diagnosed with MetS. Health-care providers need to be aware of the increased morbidity and mortality in this high-risk subgroup and need to consider preoperative optimization and management before proceeding with surgery.

### A combined index to classify prognostic comorbidity in candidates for radical prostatectomy [^114jSfLk]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Because of the usually slow disease progression and the competing curative treatment options with different impacts on quality of life, comorbidity is of particular clinical importance in men with early prostate cancer. There is, however, no consensus on the best comorbidity classification to use in this situation. The Charlson score has probably been most extensively studied. In addition, a multitude of other assessment instruments have been evaluated with, however, inconclusive results. The complementary prognostic value of different comorbidity classifications has – to our knowledge – not been demonstrated yet in patients with early prostate cancer. Stratifying by comorbidity would be important in clinical decision making as well as in the characterization of patients enrolled into clinical trials. In this study, we investigated several comorbidity classifications as predictors of overall mortality after radical prostatectomy, searching for measures providing complementary prognostic information which could be combined into a single score.

### Synergism between metformin and statins in modifying the risk of biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy in men with diabetes [^112BH1J6]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

To determine the effect of statins and metformin in combination on biochemical recurrence (BCR) among diabetic men undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).

Methods

Diabetic men undergoing RP at our institution from January 1995 to March 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Recipients of adjuvant radiation or hormonal therapy were excluded. Statin and/or metformin use was determined through review of electronic records. BCR-free survival was plotted using Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the effect of statins and metformin on BCR was assessed via a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model.

Results

Seven hundred and sixty-seven men met the inclusion criteria. Seventy-six (9.9%) were users of statins only, 56 (7.3%) were users of metformin only and 42 (5.5%) were dual users. Median follow-up time was 27 months. Dual users were less likely than nonusers or users of either medication alone to have a biopsy Gleason sum of 8–10 (P = 0.033), and tended towards a lower rate of pathological T stage of pT3 or higher (P = 0.064). Dual users had the highest 2-year and 5-year BCR-free survival, although this was not statistically significant (P = 0.205). On multivariate regression, neither statin nor metformin use alone was significantly associated with BCR-free survival. However, their interaction led to a significantly lower BCR risk than would be expected from each medication's independent effects (hazard ratio = 0.2; P = 0.037).

Conclusions

The combination of statins and metformin in men undergoing RP for prostate cancer (PCa) may be associated with a lower BCR risk than would be predicted based on the independent effects of both medications. A synergism between these two agents is biologically plausible based on our current understanding of their diverse molecular pathways of action. The results of future clinical trials involving the use of either medication in men with PCa should be carefully assessed for confirmatory evidence of such a relationship.

### Metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance: perioperative considerations [^113drSrt]. Anesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

Metabolic syndrome represents a constellation of risk factors associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease and progression to diabetes mellitus. Insulin resistance, a state of decreased biologic response to physiologic concentrations of insulin, is a key component of this syndrome and seems to be the result of a primary defect at the skeletal muscle glucose transporter. Acute illness and the perioperative period are characterized by a state of insulin resistance that manifests as hyperglycemia and leads to various other metabolic and biochemical alterations that adversely affect end organ function. Hyperglycemia in acutely ill patients adversely affects outcome. Achieving euglycemia seems beneficial in certain clinical situations, but considerable disagreement exists regarding the target blood sugar levels, the duration of therapy, and the modality. Pharmacotherapy, exercise, and nutrition to improve insulin sensitivity seem promising but require further evaluation to confirm their efficacy for perioperative risk reduction. This review discusses the pathophysiology and the clinical implications of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance in the acutely ill patient with an emphasis on perioperative modulation strategies.

Post-radical prostatectomy (RP) patients — testosterone therapy can be considered in men with favorable pathology and undetectable PSA postoperatively, and currently published studies have not demonstrated an increased risk of biochemical cancer recurrence; literature suggests such post-RP patients maintained undetectable PSA with no evidence of recurrence, and in Pastuszak et al. (2013) biochemical recurrence occurred in 4/103 versus 8/49 (p = 0.02), all of whom were classified as having high- risk prostate cancer at study onset.

### Obesity and risk of biochemical failure for patients receiving salvage radiotherapy after prostatectomy [^113pncSV]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Obesity has been proposed as an independent risk factor for patients undergoing surgery or radiotherapy (RT) for prostate cancer. Using body mass index (BMI) as a measure of obesity, we tested its role as a risk factor for patients receiving salvage RT after prostatectomy.

Methods and Materials

Rates of subsequent biochemical relapse were examined in 90 patients who underwent salvage RT between 1984 and 2004 for biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy. Median follow-up was 3.7 years. The BMI was tested as a continuous and categorical variable (stratified as < 25, 25- < 30, and ≥ 30 kg/m(2)). Univariate and multivariate proportional hazards regression analyses were performed for clinical, pathologic, and treatment factors associated with time to relapse after salvage RT.

Results

There were 40 biochemical failures after salvage RT with a median time to failure of 1.2 years. The BMI was not associated with adverse clinical, pathologic, or treatment factors. On multivariate analysis, obesity was independently significant (hazard ratio [HR], 1.2; p = 0.01), along with RT dose (HR, 0.7; p = 0.003) and pre-RT prostate-specific antigen level (HR, 1.2; p = 0.0003).

Conclusions

This study is weakly suggestive that obesity may be a risk factor for salvage RT patients. Whether this results from greater biologic aggressiveness or technical inadequacies cannot be answered by this study. Given the very high failure rate observed for severely obese patients, we propose that technical difficulties with RT are at play. This hypothesis is supported by the RT literature and could be prospectively investigated. Techniques that optimize targeting, especially in obese patients, perhaps seem warranted at this time.

### Outcome of robotic radical prostatectomy in men over 74 [^1179k4bF]. Journal of Endourology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tfor radical prostatectomy has always been a matter of debate. In keeping with American Urological Association (AUA) and European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines, most urologists consider a live expectancy of greater than 10 years mandatory in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Until recently, this was generally not the case in patients over 74 years and still those patients are very rarely being offered surgery. In fact, only 10% of men over 74 with localized aggressive carcinoma and a Charleston comorbidity index of 0 receive radical treatment. Consequently, these patients are more likely to receive ADT.

By contrast, the current life expectancy for men at this age in the United Statesand Europestands at 10 years and is increasing at an average rate of 1 year per decade. For the 25% healthiest men of 75, life expectancy amounts to even 15 years. Moreover, the proportion of men over 74 is estimated to reach 20% of the North American and European population by 2030. It is expected that, in the near future, there will be a growing number of patients > 75 with a life expectancy of 10 years and more and a diagnosis of prostate cancer.

Several studies could demonstrate that elder patients undergoing radical prostatectomy have more aggressive cancer that could have an impact on further life expectancy. Therefore, radical surgical treatment is likely to result in significantly longer cancer-specific survival in this subgroup. Some studies could demonstrate prolonged overall survivaland favorable oncologic outcomes.

In this context, robotic prostatectomy might be considered as treatment for elderly men because of minimal blood loss, faster recovery, and shorter hospital stay. It is widely agreed that robotic prostatectomy is a safe approach with a low percentage of significant complications, even in complex cases and elderly, comorbid patients.

If robotic prostatectomy significantly reduces cancer-specific and overall survival in patients over 74, functional parameters — that is, continence and potency — gain increasing interest. Yet, only a few groups have looked into functional outcomes following robotic prostatectomy in elderly patients, and only 3 of them focused on the age group of 75 years and older, with remarkably low patient numbers of 8 to 45. To our knowledge, our study assesses the largest number of patients over 74 having had robotic prostatectomy.

### Minimally invasive infrapubic inflatable penile prosthesis implant for erectile dysfunction: evaluation of efficacy, satisfaction profile and complications [^115oMxZZ]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2015). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 180 patients underwent IPP implantation and were enrolled in the study. The surgical procedure was the same and carried out by the same surgeon, two different kinds of equipment were implanted. All the patients accepted to participate in the study and signed informed consent. The median age was 64.7 years (52–69), and 144 patients (80%) were married while 36 were single (20%). The etiology of ED was divided between 84 patients (46.67%) affected by diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome and 96 patients (53.33%) with ED following non-nerve sparing radical prostatectomy. Mean duration of ED before implant was respectively 24.5 ± 18.6 months for VLRP patients and 74.5 ± 50.1 months for diabetic patients and the difference between the two groups is statistically significant (P < 0.005). Regarding previous ED treatments are as follows: oral therapy in 60 patients (71.43%) for group A and 72 (75%) for group B without a statistically significant difference; ICI in 42 patients (50%) of group A and 84 (87.5%) of group B with a statistically significant difference; vacuum device in 18 patients (21.43%) of group A and 30 (31.25%) of group B without a statistically significant difference. Zero patients had no previous treatment. The success rate of groups A and B was 44% (37 pts) and 8.3% (8 pts), respectively to oral therapy, 77.3% (65 pts) and 67.7% to ICI (65 pts) and 63% (53 pts) and 43.7% (42 pts) to vacuum device.

There were no reported intraoperative complications and the median time to complete the implant was 39 min (26–74).

During 12 months of follow-up, we reported 3 (1.67%) explants for infection, 1 (0.56%) urethral erosion and 1 (0.56%) prosthesis extrusion. During the day after the surgery, 12 cases (6.67%) of scrotal hematoma were reported (Table 1). The drain was removed the day after the procedure in 144 cases (80%) and 2 days after in 36 cases (20%). All the patients were discharged the day after the surgery.

To evaluate post-surgical results, two validated questionnaires were used: IIEF-5 and EDITS (Table 1).

### Association between presurgical weight status and urinary and sexual function in prostate cancer patients treated by radical prostatectomy: a prospective cohort study [^117U6kxZ]. Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To prospectively examine the influence of weight status on urinary and sexual function in clinically localized prostate cancer patients treated by radical prostatectomy (RP).

Methods

The Prostatectomy, Incontinence and Erectile dysfunction study recruited patients at 2 US institutions between 2011 and 2014. At baseline, height and weight were measured, and urinary and sexual function were collected by the modified Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-50. This index was repeated at the 5-week, 6-month, and 12-month postsurgical assessments and compared to baseline using linear generalized estimating equations. Logistic equations were used to evaluate the likelihood of functional recovery at the 6- and 12-month assessments.

Result

Presurgery, nonobese patients (68.8% of 407 patients) had similar urinary function as those with obesity (P = 0.217), but better sexual function (P = 0.006). One year after surgery, 50.5% and 28.9% patients had recovered to baseline levels for urinary and sexual function, respectively. Recovery was not, however, uniform by obesity. Compared to those with obesity, nonobese patients had better urinary function at the 6- (P < .001) and 12-month postsurgical assessments (P = 0.011) and were more likely to recover their function by the 6-month assessment (OR = 2.55, 95% CI = 1.36–4.76). For sexual function, nonobese patients had better function at the 6- (P = 0.028) and 12-month (P = 0.051) assessments, but a similar likelihood of recovery 1-year postsurgery.

Conclusion

Nonobese prostate cancer patients had better and likely earlier recovery in urinary function postsurgery, and better sexual function both pre- and postsurgery. These findings support the potential for tailored presurgical counseling about RP side-effects and prehabilitation to improve these side-effects.

### Longitudinal recovery patterns of penile length and the underexplored benefit of long-term phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor use after radical prostatectomy [^111KVAbT]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Despite concerns that post-RP PS may be irreversible, our results demonstrate that 59.4% and 60.2% of patients returned to their baseline stretched and flaccid PL, respectively, suggesting that PS is not a permanent consequence. Additionally, our study demonstrated that younger age, high preoperative erectile function, and consistent PDE5i use were independent predictors of complete PL recovery. It appears that these therapeutic effects of PDE5i were only appreciated for long-term users, and in individuals with medium preoperative SHIM scores. Neither prostate anatomy nor metabolic risk factors were significant predictors of complete PL recovery.

Older patients were less likely to reach complete PL recovery when controlled for other variables. This finding agrees with the results of a recent report that analyzed postoperative EF and continence, confirming the correlation between senility and delayed recovery from surgical trauma. Among other variables associated with complete recovery was a high baseline preoperative EF, which has also been previously identified as a protective factor in PL recovery. Similarly, our multivariate logistic regression model revealed that high preoperative SHIM, a marker for intact erectile function, was an independent predictor of complete PL recovery.

NS techniques have frequently been reported as an independent predictor of reduced PL loss. One study demonstrated that patients undergoing NS RP had no changes in penile measurements at 6-months postoperative visit when compared to preoperative baseline. Our univariate logistic regression showed that both types of NS RP approach were marginally predictive of complete PL recovery (OR 2.511; 95%CI 0.969–6.502; p = 0.058). The lack of association at the multivariate level could be related to the distribution of our study cohort where 96.6% of men were operated on using a NS technique - either IF or AIR. No difference was appreciated in PL recovery between these two types of NS techniques (p = 0.24) although AIR was found to be a superior NS technique when compared to IF in terms of preserving sexual function in our earlier report.

### Correlation between metabolic syndrome and periurethral prostatic fibrosis: results of a prospective study [^112gDd7s]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

Patients

The study protocol of the current analysis was reviewed by the institutional ethics committee (No. 2021–67), and informed consent was obtained from each patient or the legal guardian. The data of a consecutive series of BPH patients treated with transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) or bipolar plasmakinetic enucleation of the prostate (PKEP) between June 2021 and August 2022 were prospectively collected at the Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital and Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University.

The subjective symptoms of all patients were scored according to the international prostate symptom score (IPSS) and quality of life (QoL) score. In addition, physical examinations, including digital rectal examination (DRE), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, transabdominal kidney-bladder ultrasound, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) (Philips EPIQ 5 ultrasound machine, Amsterdam, Netherlands), post-void residual urine (PVR), and maximum flow rate (Q max), were performed for all patients. Total prostate volume (TPV) was calculated from TRUS measurements of the prostate using the prostate ellipsoid formula (height × width × length × π/6). Patients with suspected prostate cancer also underwent ultrasound-guided transrectal 12-core needle biopsy to confirm the BPH diagnosis.

The exclusion criteria were as follows: incomplete medical records; previous bladder, prostate, or urethra operation; urethral stricture; IPSS ≤ 7; prostate or bladder cancer; bladder stones; acute urinary tract infection; neurogenic bladder dysfunction and any comorbidities that could affect the patient's voiding function.

Definition of MetS

MetS was defined by at least three of the following five components: elevated blood pressure (BP ≥ 130/85 mmHg), central obesity (WC > 102 cm), elevated triglycerides (≥ 1.7 mmol/L), elevated fasting glucose (≥ 5.6 mmol/L) and reduced high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (< 1.0 mmol/L). Waist circumference (WC) and BP were measured by trained personnel using a standardized protocol. In particular, WC was measured midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest to the nearest 1 cm. Blood samples were drawn in the morning preoperatively, after an overnight fast, for measurement of blood glucose, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides.

### Comparison of various continence definitions in a large group of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy: a multicentre, prospective study [^112RCuJj]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In Northern and Western Europe the carcinoma of the prostate is the third most frequent type of cancer and by far the most prevalent cancer among men. 128 and 140 out of 100,000 men are diagnosed with this disease, respectively. As a curative treatment, radical prostatectomy (RP) is widely used.

Although RP assures a low morbidity rate, is very effective in reducing mortality, and the amount of postoperative complications have been reduced due to advances in surgical technique, treatment modalities generally cause two major side effects: urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Both have a considerable negative impact on the patients' postoperative quality of life. The former even more so than the latter. Consequently, there is a large interest in evaluating incontinence's postoperative extent and its influencing factors (e.g.).

However, no generally shared standard definition of continence exists. This strongly affects the reported number of patients considered continent. One meta-analysis has found continence rates ranging as far as 67 percentage points (from 5 to 72%) which has been attributed mainly to varying definitions. This inconsistency in defining continence, exacerbated by the heterogeneity of used study designs and samples, data collection methods, measuring instruments, and lengths of follow-up, makes it extremely difficult to compare published results. This has been widely recognized among contemporary research literature (e.g.). This paper's main objective is then to identify the best possible definition of continence and thus help prevent the distortion of reported outcomes. Secondary objectives are to investigate the development of the post-surgical continence rate and reveal additional factors that influence continence after RP.

Written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to their participation. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Leipzig, Faculty of Medicine (approval no. 219–2007) and has therefore been performed in accordance with ethical standards.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^117RXEtv]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer — adverse effects of hormonal therapy reflect the systemic impact of lowering or blocking androgens; hormonal therapy includes treatments designed to affect cells whose functioning depends on androgens, and prostate cancer cells are susceptible to such treatments. Among the most common side effects are increased risk for weight gain, obesity, and diabetes; cardiovascular disease; breast enlargement and/or tenderness; sexual problems including diminished sex drive and erectile dysfunction; emotional changes including anger, sadness, and fatigue; osteoporosis; loss of muscle strength and mass with increased risk of falls and fractures in older men; anemia contributing to fatigue; and cognitive changes such as impaired thought processes and memory loss.

### Updates to incontinence after prostate treatment: AUA / GURS / SUFU guideline (2024) [^115uFa4z]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Patient counseling on post‑RP incontinence emphasizes that clinicians should inform patients undergoing radical prostatectomy that incontinence is expected in the short-term and generally improves to near baseline by 12 months after surgery but may persist and require treatment (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). Urinary continence is commonly defined as not requiring a pad or protective device to stay dry, most men are not continent at catheter removal, and continence after RP improves with time, with most men achieving continence within 12 months of surgery. Because early postoperative incontinence is expected, conservative management with regular follow-up during the first year after surgery is recommended to assess progress.

### Delayed radical prostatectomy is not associated with adverse oncologic outcomes: implications for men experiencing surgical delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic [^113g7NCh]. The Journal of Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The 2019 novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has forced many health care organizations to divert efforts and resources to emergent patient care, delaying many elective oncologic surgeries. We investigated an association between delay in radical prostatectomy and oncologic outcomes.

Materials and Methods

This is a retrospective review of men with intermediate and high risk prostate cancer in the National Cancer Database undergoing radical prostatectomy from 2010 to 2016. Immediate radical prostatectomy was defined as radical prostatectomy within 3 months of diagnosis, while delayed radical prostatectomy was analyzed in 3-month intervals up to 12 months. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to test for associations between levels of delayed radical prostatectomy and outcomes of interest (adverse pathology, upgrading on radical prostatectomy, node positive disease and post-radical prostatectomy secondary treatments) compared with men undergoing immediate radical prostatectomy.

Results

We identified 128,062 men with intermediate and high risk prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy. After adjustment, we did not appreciate a significant difference in odds of adverse pathology, upgrading, node positive disease or post-radical prostatectomy secondary treatments between men treated with immediate radical prostatectomy and any level of delay up to 12 months. Subgroup analysis of men with Grade Group 4 and 5 prostate cancer did not demonstrate an association between delayed radical prostatectomy and worse oncologic outcomes.

Conclusions

In the National Cancer Database delayed radical prostatectomy was not associated with early adverse oncologic outcomes at radical prostatectomy. These results may provide reassurance to patients and urologists balancing care in the current pandemic.

### Erectile function rehabilitation in the radical prostatectomy patient [^114Ka25d]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer is common and is being diagnosed in younger men now compared with two decades ago. Long-term functional outcomes are of significant importance to patient and impact upon the patient decision-making process regarding choice of therapy. Erectile function preservation (rehabilitation) has gained significant traction worldwide despite the absence of definitive evidence in its favor.

Aim

To define the role of rehabilitation in the prostate cancer patient who has undergone radical prostatectomy (RP).

Methods

A committee of five experts in the field from three countries was convened, and using a thorough analysis of the literature and the Delphi approach to expert opinion, recommendations were arrived at for clinicians treating men with prostate cancer before and after definitive surgical management.

Results

Recommendations arrived at included: that clinicians should discuss prevalence rates, the pathophysiology of erectile dysfunction after RP and the predictors of erectile function recovery, that validated instruments should be used using the published cut-offs for normalcy, that rehabilitation be discussed with patients, and that they be informed that significant potential benefits may be associated with rehabilitation.

Conclusions

The International Consensus of Sexual Medicine (ICSM) 2001 committee on rehabilitation after radical prostatectomy recommended that a discussion occur regarding rehabilitation in all patients undergoing or who have undergone RP. However, the committee recognized the absence of definitive data to date and could not comment on the optimal approach to rehabilitation at this time.

### Pathological, oncologic and functional outcomes of radical prostatectomy following active surveillance [^113fvpjN]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

We examined prostatectomy pathology, and oncologic and functional outcomes of men progressing from active surveillance to radical prostatectomy.

Materials and Methods

We identified patients on active surveillance treated with radical prostatectomy. We compared patients on active surveillance ultimately treated with radical prostatectomy to age and prostate specific antigen matched men undergoing immediate radical prostatectomy after a diagnosis of low risk disease who were candidates for active surveillance (group 1). We also compared patients on active surveillance with progression to Gleason 7 disease to men treated who had similar de novo disease (group 2) to determine whether patients on active surveillance have potentially adverse outcomes.

Results

Of 289 patients on active surveillance 41 (14.2%) underwent radical prostatectomy after a median of 35.2 months (IQR 22.8–46.6) on active surveillance. Compared to group 1, the radical prostatectomy after active surveillance group had expectedly worse pathological outcomes, whereas the pathological outcomes of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy after active surveillance with progression to Gleason 7 disease were similar to those of group 2. At a median of 3.5 years from radical prostatectomy (IQR 2.6–4.7), biochemical recurrence was low and comparable between the radical prostatectomy after active surveillance group and group 1 (2.6% vs 5.4%, p = 0.47), while erectile function was 29.0% and continence 89.7%, comparable to both groups.

Conclusions

Radical prostatectomy after a period of active surveillance does not appear to result in adverse pathological outcomes compared to patients with a similar preoperative pathology.

### Acute and chronic surgical complications following prostatectomy among men in Taiwan… [^115ZrEjs]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Exposures ORP, LRP, or RARP. Main Outcomes and Measures Two multivariate mixed models accounting for hospital clusters were fitted to ascertain the association of RARP with treatment outcomes; general linear regression models were used for continuous outcomes, the amount of blood transfused, and hospital stay, and logistic regression models were used for analyzing postoperative outcomes and surgical complications. Patients undergoing RARP had lower odds of receiving a blood transfusion. Overall, 76 patients undergoing ORP, 35 patients undergoing LRP, and 59 patients undergoing RARP required blood transfusions.

Patients who underwent RARP had lower odds of receiving blood transfusion than those undergoing ORP or LRP. In terms of surgical complications, RARP might be beneficial for perioperative outcomes and chronic postoperative outcomes rather than subchronic postoperative outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the leading study to use real-world data to provide valuable information regarding the surgical complications to inform decision-making by physicians and patients with PC. Furthermore, this is the leading population-based study of the association of RARP with perioperative outcomes as well as with acute or chronic postoperative complications.

Although RARP was not associated with the blood volume required for transfusion, it was associated with lower odds of receiving blood transfusion, subsequent hospitalization, moderate to severe postoperative pain for as long as 12 weeks, and chronic surgical complications compared with both ORP and LRP.

### Postprostatectomy radiotherapy timing and health-related quality of life… [^117Kiev8]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance In this multicenter, prospective analysis, postprostatectomy RT appeared to be negatively associated with long-term HRQOL across all domains. However, receipt of early vs late postprostatectomy RT may result in similar long-term HRQOL outcomes. Radical prostatectomy use in men with localized, high-risk prostate cancer is increasing. 1 While the procedure is curative for some, a substantial proportion of men will experience prostate-specific antigen persistence or a delayed increase in PSA, a situation known as biochemical recurrence. For these men, half will develop metastatic progression within 5 to 10 years without salvage therapy.
2. In this multi-institutional prospective cohort study of men with localized prostate cancer receiving initial prostatectomy in the PQA and RP2 consortiums, receipt of postprostatectomy RT resulted in decrements in HRQOL scores in all EPIC-26 domains, which persisted at long-term follow-up.

The negative outcomes of RT were most notable for sexual and incontinence domains. This is particularly highlighted in eFigure 3 in Supplement 1, which shows that men who ultimately received postprostatectomy RT had worse sexual and vitality/hormonal HRQOL decrements after radical prostatectomy, compared with those who received radical prostatectomy alone, even before receiving postprostatectomy RT. In the RADICALS-RT trial, 8 patient-reported outcome measures for urinary continence and bowel function showed a small but statistically significant worsening of symptoms with adjuvant RT 1 year after randomization, but no significant differences in toxic effects beyond 1 year. These trials emphasized a detriment in physician-graded toxic effects, primarily confined to grade 1 to 2 bowel or urinary toxic effects, with adjuvant compared with salvage RT.

The most prominent differences in toxic effects were observed in the GETUG-AFU 176 and RADICALS-RT8 trials, which consistently showed almost a doubling in risk of grade 1 to 2 diarrhea, urinary incontinence, urinary irritation, and hematuria with adjuvant compared with salvage RT. The long-term toxic effects data in this cohort are largely dominated by the PQA cohort, which has a median follow-up of 114. 8 months, compared with
72. 6 months for RP2. As such, a long-term detriment in HRQOL with early postprostatectomy RT may be pronounced due to a predominance of men treated with 3DCRT.

### Adverse effects associated with local treatment for advanced prostate cancer… [^111qbXtn]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

eFigure 4. T4/M1 Cohort — Cohort Restricted to Men With at Least 5 Years of Follow-Up Data Sharing Statement Question What is the burden of treatment-related adverse effects among men receiving local treatment with radical prostatectomy or radiation for advanced prostate cancer. Findings In this retrospective cohort study of 5502 US veterans diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer, local treatment was associated with adverse gastrointestinal, sexual, and urinary conditions within the year after initial treatment and remained significantly associated with these adverse conditions more than 2 years to 5 years or less after treatment. Exposure Local treatment with radical prostatectomy or radiation.

Main Outcomes and Measures Main outcomes were treatment-related adverse effects, including constitutional, gastrointestinal, pain, sexual function, and urinary function conditions, at 3 intervals after initial treatment after initial treatment. Although the overall survival rate of prostate cancer is high, among those diagnosed with metastatic disease, the 5-year survival rate is only 32%. 1 The standard of care for men with advanced PCa is androgen deprivation therapy. However, the role of local therapy, including radical prostatectomy 2 and radiation, 3 has been increasingly considered, and increasing evidence suggests that local therapy may also provide a survival benefit in advanced disease. The prevalence of constitutional and urinary conditions was similar across the treatment groups.

At greater than 2 years to 5 years or less after treatment, men who received local vs nonlocal secondary treatment had a higher burden of adverse gastrointestinal conditions. In our nationally representative sample of US veterans diagnosed with advanced PCa, local treatment with RP or radiation was associated with adverse effects across multiple domains. Constitutional and pain symptoms remained associated with local treatment up to 2 years after treatment, whereas gastrointestinal, sexual, and urinary symptoms remained significantly associated with local treatment up to 5 years after treatment. Moderate to severe urinary incontinence after prostatectomy appears to be worse than after radiation or surveillance, whereas moderate to severe gastrointestinal symptom bother after prostatectomy appears to be significantly better than after radiation or surveillance. 8, 21 Our results extend these findings to advanced PCa.

### Complications following robotic radical prostatectomies: what Do patients need to know? [^1166PYmz]. ASCO Daily News (2019). Medium credibility.

In particular, a recent study demonstrated that a modified frailty index was associated with the risk of grade 4 Clavien-Dindo complications in patients with prostate cancer undergoing RARP. 9 Other characteristics, such as increased prostate-specific antigen levels, higher biopsy grade group, and the presence of high-risk prostate cancer, have also been proposed as predictors of complications and 30-day readmission. 7, 10 These observations are mainly related to the need for an extended pelvic lymph node dissection in patients with more aggressive disease features. Of note, a pelvic nodal dissection is typically associated with increased operative time, blood loss, length of stay, and postoperative complications. 11 In particular, up to 10% of patients receiving an extended lymph node dissection performed at the time of RARP experience symptomatic pelvic lymphoceles and lympho-edema.

12, 13 Moreover, the receipt of a pelvic lymph node dissection might increase the incidence of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. 14 As such, patient selection is key in this setting, where a nodal dissection should be proposed exclusively to patients at higher risk of lymph node invasion according to baseline characteristics in order to reduce overtreatment and the morbidity associated with this procedure. 15–17. 18, 21, 22 Similarly, large historical population-based series including patients undergoing open radical prostatectomy demonstrated that patients treated at low-volume hospitals had a nearly 2-fold higher likelihood of perioperative mortality compared with those treated at high-volume institutions. 23 Taken together, these benefits in perioperative outcomes translated into decreased hospital charges and savings for the health-care system.

In this context, a recent study evaluating approximately 10, 000 patients in the United States treated with RARP between 2012 and 2014 who were included in the American College of Surgeons National Surgery Quality Improvement Program database evaluated predischarge predictors of postdischarge complications. 27 Of note, the occurrence of complications during hospital stay and a prolonged length of stay were independent predictors of the subsequent risk of postdischarge complications and readmission. These findings have important implications for postoperative patient management, where the identification of individuals at higher risk of postdischarge complications and readmission should lead to the implementation of integrated interventions and measures aimed at decreasing the risk of readmission.

For example, tailored follow-up protocols and early postdischarge assessments should be planned in men who experienced a prolonged length of hospital stay or adverse events in the early postoperative period.
