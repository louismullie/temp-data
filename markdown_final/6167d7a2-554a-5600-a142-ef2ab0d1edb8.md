## Question

Nowst

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "nowst" in the context of clinical practice and evidence-based medicine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "nowst" is a typographical error and what the intended term might be. Then, I should verify if the intended term maps to a clinical concept with supporting references. Next, I will extract and appraise the relevant evidence, and finally, I will synthesize a clinically useful answer with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "nowst" does not correspond to a standard medical term in the provided corpus. Wait, let me verify the closest matches: "nowcasting" appears in the COVID-19 literature and refers to real-time assessment of epidemic dynamics, which is a plausible intended term given its clinical relevance to situational awareness and decision-making during outbreaks [^a6cdad28].

> I will now examine the concept of nowcasting in infectious disease contexts to ensure I'm aligning with the evidence. Nowcasting aims to estimate the current state of an outbreak by integrating epidemiologic, clinical, and behavioral data, enabling timely public health and clinical decisions; this has been explicitly described in the COVID-19 literature and is distinct from forecasting, which projects future states rather than characterizing the present [^a6cdad28].

> Next, I should review how nowcasting informs clinical and policy decisions, and whether the cited guidance reflects its use. Hold on, I should verify examples: COVID-19 guidelines emphasize rapid, risk-stratified decision-making and early use of therapies in defined ambulatory populations, which operationalize real-time situational awareness akin to nowcasting principles, even if the term itself is not always used in guideline prose [^4dd6952a] [^6881edd1] [^3930fb65].

> Let me consider the methodological and evidentiary implications, because I need to ensure the synthesis is clinically grounded. Nowcasting relies on iterative data integration and model updates; in COVID-19, this included evolving testing strategies, variant dynamics, and treatment eligibility, illustrating how real-time evidence synthesis shapes bedside decisions and public health policies during fast-moving outbreaks [^a6cdad28].

> But wait, what if the user truly meant a different term, such as "newly diagnosed" or "new-onset"? I should double-check that possibility. The corpus repeatedly addresses management of newly diagnosed conditions (e.g., type 2 diabetes, multiple myeloma, glioblastoma), yet none of these are labeled as "nowst", and the linguistic mismatch remains, so the most defensible inference remains that "nowst" reflects a typographical error for "nowcasting" given its explicit presence and clinical salience in the provided references [^cdca37fd] [^5bbf23dc] [^58a797cf].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Given the absence of "nowst" as a standard term and the presence of "nowcasting" with direct clinical relevance, the intended concept is most likely epidemic nowcasting — real-time assessment of outbreak dynamics to inform immediate decisions — with practical applications reflected in COVID-19 guidance emphasizing early, risk-based interventions and continuous re-evaluation of evolving evidence [^a6cdad28] [^4dd6952a] [^6881edd1].

The term "nowst" is not found in the provided medical literature. Please clarify what you meant — did you intend one of the following?

- **Nowcasting** (real-time epidemic assessment) [^a6cdad28]?
- **Newly diagnosed** (e.g. newly diagnosed diabetes, cancer, or other conditions) [^cdca37fd] [^5bbf23dc]?
- **New-onset** (e.g. new-onset atrial fibrillation, seizures, or symptoms)?
- **Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)**?
- **Something else entirely**?

Once you confirm the intended term, I can provide a precise, evidence-based answer with appropriate citations.

### The science of clinical practice: disease diagnosis or patient prognosis? Evidence about "what is likely to happen" should shape clinical practice [^645f5f33]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The traditional model of clinical practice incorporates diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Diagnosis classifies the sick patient as having or not having a particular disease. Historically, diagnosis was regarded as the primary guide to treatment and prognosis ("what is likely to happen in the future"), and is still considered the core component of clinical practice.

This traditional model now has to meet the demand for health care to deliver demonstrable quality. Changes in clinical practice must be justified by better outcomes, as valued by patients, or more efficient and safer delivery of health care. The usefulness of diagnostic and treatment decisions, and the value of new tests and interventions, are judged by whether patients classified with diagnosed disease do better and those classified without disease come to no harm.

This requires information about patient prognosis – the likelihood of future outcomes in patients with a given disease or health condition. Prognosis research aims to understand the likelihood of different outcomes, which factors predict these likelihoods, how best to estimate an individual's likelihood of different outcomes, and how this information can be used to target interventions and improve outcomes.

### Current and new treatment options for adults recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes [^cdca37fd]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

No treatment is appropriate for all patients, nor is any one treatment optimal. The challenge is to find that treatment that best fits with what a patient is able and willing to do and embrace at this point in their diabetes journey, with an emphasis on shared-decision making and revisiting at future office visits. Prescribing a medication or making lifestyle recommendations that a patient is not willing or able to follow for any reason is not likely to lead to improvements in diabetes outcomes. The best treatment is one that is easy to implement and sustainable for the patient. Primary care often sees patients over the course of their lifetime and can revisit treatment options. Regardless of management decisions, frequent monitoring of glycaemia is crucial to assure therapeutic inertia is addressed.

### Evolving treatment landscape: 18 years of managing melanoma in a single patient [^456fd57e]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Melanoma is a public health concern, with incidence increasing faster than any other type of cancer, affecting both men and women of all ages. Melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer however, the overall 5-year survival rate has increased dramatically from 52% to 90% since the 1970s, while 10-year survival has also almost doubled over the same time period. The vast majority of people diagnosed with melanoma present with a pigmented lesion and much of the survival gains have been due to earlier diagnosis and intervention with surgical resection. Improving outcomes for patients with advanced melanoma has proved far more challenging, with life expectancy remaining under 1 year for most people well into the 21st century.

The melanoma treatment landscape has undergone constant and dynamic evolution over the last 20 years, as historic approaches were learnt from and replaced, while new knowledge and interventions have emerged. Translation of basic and clinical research into changing practice requires significant collaboration from multiple stakeholders involved in healthcare, including pharma, regulators, commissioners, doctors and not least the patients themselves. The most noteworthy gain has been the rapid introduction of several new systemic therapies shown for the first time to improve survival of metastatic melanoma patients into routine clinical practice, which has tripled life expectancy in the last decade, now offering potential for cure in some cases.

We report a patient originally diagnosed with primary melanoma 18 years ago, whose treatment history is a reflection of how rapidly the treatment landscape has changed in both surgery and drug therapy. The case further demonstrates the innovation and collaboration between the patient and healthcare professionals needed to manage multiple challenges that arise along the patient journey.

### When is measuring sensitivity and specificity sufficient to evaluate a diagnostic test, and when do we need randomized trials? [^369b7465]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The clinical value of using a new diagnostic test depends on whether it improves patient outcomes beyond the outcomes achieved using an old diagnostic test. When can studies of diagnostic test accuracy provide sufficient information to infer clinical value, and when do clinicians need to wait for results from randomized trials? The authors argue that accuracy studies suffice if a new diagnostic test is safer or more specific than, but of similar sensitivity to, an old test. However, if a new test is more sensitive than an old test, it leads to the detection of extra cases of disease. Results from treatment trials that enrolled only patients detected by the old test may not apply to these extra cases. Clinicians need to wait for results from randomized trials assessing treatment efficacy in cases detected by the new diagnostic test, unless they can be satisfied that the new test detects the same spectrum and subtype of disease as the old test or that treatment response is similar across the spectrum of disease.

### New diagnosis in psychiatry: beyond heuristics [^cc1b4201]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Although the boundary between normality and mental ill-health is difficult to define, a decision to offer treatment or not must be made. Who decides? And on what basis? Is a diagnosis necessary or helpful? In addition to 'objective', yet arbitrary criteria, the person experiencing mental distress should have their say in when help can be expected and the diagnostic process. Clinicians and funders should acknowledge this. The assignment of a diagnosis is often equated with a 'need for care', though this is not necessarily the case (Lea & Hofmann). Because diagnoses may influence identity and human rights, the process should be explicitly discussed and negotiated with the patient (Lea & Hofmann). Need for care, as reflected in distress, risk, and/or functional impairment, typically precedes a traditional DSM or ICD diagnosis or 'macrophenotype'. Clinicians should explain the syndromal basis and meaning of a diagnosis, and that early in the illness neither fixed or clear-cut diagnoses nor prognoses cannot necessarily be provided. Working or provisional diagnoses may be more useful and flexible, and suffice as guides to treatment options, including the decision that no diagnosis and no treatment are necessary.

Not being assigned a diagnosis may be confusing, frustrating, and stressful, but equally, a lack of diagnosis may be reassuring as long as it does not deny care. During the early weeks of treatment, a 'working diagnosis', complemented by a personalized formulation, which includes unique personal and contextual features, can become a focus around which to build a therapeutic alliance. If the clinical presentation is initially subtle or complex but then evolves, both clinician and patient should see that it would have been problematic to prematurely offer a hard or fixed diagnosis. This approach also reduces confusion caused by abrupt changes in diagnostic terms used, and may reduce the need for later 'dediagnosis' (Lea & Hofmann). The evolution of clinical presentation is consistent with the known natural history of mental illness and is not 'failure' by the original clinical team. What these changes mean is presently unclear. Do they have a single illness with an evolving clinical picture or are they attracting additional layers of complexity or comorbid syndromes? Such changes indicate a need to rethink and recalibrate the pattern of care required.

### Evolving treatment landscape: 18 years of managing melanoma in a single patient [^c909efae]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Our case demonstrates how an individual patient diagnosed with melanoma was able to gain benefit from a series of new interventions that became available during the course of her 18-year illness. Alongside her treatment, she was able to maintain a good quality of life, her own expressed wish was to become a grandmother and she achieved and enjoyed this to the full. Her disease was managed through a multidisciplinary team (MDT) of specialists working to good effect. The MDT was able to take advantage of effective international research and clinical trials, as well as guidance from national regulators and commissioners who took bold decisions at the time to provide patients with significant unmet need access to high cost drugs, based on sound health economic assessments confirming their cost-effectiveness.

Patient's perspective

During my long and varied 'assault' on my disease, I always felt that every day of my survival, was 1 day closer to the eventual discovery through constant research of a cure. I felt many times that I was living with a chronic disease when receiving a new drug or therapy, and enjoyed a useful and good quality of life for much of the time. A minor but important point to my own well-being is that I have never worried about what tomorrow may or may not bring, and only put my energies into what challenges today presents.

Learning points

The melanoma treatment landscape of melanoma has been radically transformed this century and particularly over the last decade.
The impact of both new non-surgical therapies and surgical interventions has extended life expectancy with improved quality of life at all stages of disease.
Long-term benefits of adjuvant systemic therapy suggest recurrence rates can be halved, while some metastatic melanoma patients are likely being cured.
Optimal care requires a well-informed, multidisciplinary team to co-ordinate individual patient management.

### The coming era of precision medicine for intensive care [^cd5b9402]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Challenges for the coming era

We are thus moving rapidly into an era where we will be able to "personalize" treatments for individual patients. But the next step, to "precision" molecular-based targeting of treatments, is much further away. Indeed, critical illness is very different to the areas in which precision medicine has made a large impact, notably oncology in which therapies are now increasingly guided by the molecular and genomic features of a tumor in a specific patient. Most oncology patients will have one tumor that can be identified and clearly characterized, enabling the most appropriate treatment to be started. Most critically ill patients have more complex, heterogeneous disease with multiple comorbidities and conditions that can impact on outcomes and response to treatment, making it difficult to identify a single target. Moreover, although tumors progress and evolve over time and treatments may need to be adapted accordingly, in general such alterations are relatively slow compared to the very rapid changes that can occur in critically ill patients. Any tests to characterize or phenotype patients therefore need to be rapidly available and repeatable. This is just one of the many challenges as we move toward personalized, and perhaps later "precision", medicine. Here I list just a few more that I see as of key importance — there are many others.

### The science of clinical practice: disease diagnosis or patient prognosis? Evidence about "what is likely to happen" should shape clinical practice [^e9f68865]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

It can be argued that diagnosis does incorporate variability under the concept of disease severity. The continuous distribution of blood pressure, for example, aligns with severity of the 'disease' (or unhealthy state). The diagnostic paradigm, however, focuses on classification and misclassification of 'hypertension'. The prognostic approach more naturally accommodates the idea of severity by relating increasing levels of blood pressure to contrasting outcomes.

A potential downside of the prognostic approach is whether clinical models in the real world can incorporate the continuous nature and variability of risk of future avoidable outcomes into decision making. Calculation of prognostic likelihoods and treatment responsiveness can combine all relevant information, but validation and translation of prognostic models into practice often relies still on categorisation (high-medium-low risk of a particular outcome) to drive stratified care. Evidence about the clinical usefulness of such new categorisations is essential – prognostic classification for its own sake should not replace diagnosis for its own sake. Nor should individual patient prognosis be a static classification in time – it needs to be updated with recent predictor values, or a profile of values over time, to reflect how clinical practice works in the real world by using new information and repeat consultations to modify treatment.

There are practical challenges to introducing an information-rich prognosis framework for a real-world clinical practice already struggling with volumes of guidelines, decision-aids, and protocols of care. Technological and statistical advances to make calculation and presentation of prognostic information more accessible and research into ways in which health care professionals and patients can better assimilate, use, and share prognostic information could help to meet these challenges.

### Ongoing care of patients after primary treatment for their cancer [^38c270de]. CA (2003). Low credibility.

Nearly nine million people living in the United States have had a diagnosis of cancer. As the population ages, this number will increase. Most of these people will need follow-up care to deal with problems related to their cancer. Depending on the cancer, they may or may not benefit from surveillance to detect recurrence. Most will be more likely than average to develop a second primary cancer. Some will be genetically susceptible to another type of cancer. Many will have complications from their treatment that need attention. Also, their treatment may have altered certain physiologic functions. Finally, many will have suffered psychosocial difficulties either as a result of their cancer or its treatment. This article deals with these issues for the most commonly encountered cancers. Its major goal is to alert physicians to be aware of and help them to deal with these issues. Clearly, such an ambitious goal can only be partly achieved in a single journal article. Hopefully, the references included will allow physicians to proceed further if they wish.

### Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans [^331ccbf6]. AAOS (2023). High credibility.

Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans — opinion-based recommendation process and voting checklist emphasize considering current practice, transparent cost rationale, and defined voting steps. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) notes clinicians "justifiably fear that not doing something that is done on a widespread basis will lead to litigation," and "The consequences of not providing a service that is neither widely available nor widely used are less serious than the consequences of not providing a treatment accepted by the medical profession and thus expected by patients." The page highlights that discussions rely on mutual communication and that the patient's "expectation of treatment" must be tempered by physician guidance, and directs to "Justify, why a more costly device, drug, or procedure is being recommended over a less costly one whenever such an opinion-based recommendation is made." Process-wise, "Work group members write the rationales for opinion based recommendations on the first day of the final work group meeting" and vote on the second day; "If the work group cannot adopt a rationale after three votes, the rationale and the opinion-based recommendation will be withdrawn," with a statement that the group "can neither recommend for or against" included in the guideline. Members may reconsider during discussion, and "any member of the work group can make a motion to withdraw that recommendation." The "CHECKLIST FOR VOTING ON OPINION-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS" asks, "Does the recommendation affect a substantial number of patients or address treatment (or diagnosis) of a condition that causes death and/or considerable suffering?" and whether serious harms are addressed and "why the potential benefits outweigh the potential harms."

### Approach to the treatment-experienced patient [^75d95971]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

The management of treatment-experienced patients is complex and challenging. Fortunately, new agents continue to be developed that offer hope to those who have developed resistance to currently available agents. Knowing when, how, and in whom to use new agents is never easy and highlights the importance of expert care for HIV-infected patients. The management of treatment-experienced patients requires considerable expertise, especially now that patients with highly resistant virus can hope to achieve full virologic suppression.

### Identifying patients with depression who require a change in treatment and implementing that change [^7ee00736]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Creating an effective treatment regimen for patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) can be a challenge for clinicians. With each treatment trial, only 20% to 30% of patients achieve remission, and many of those who do reach remission experience residual symptoms. Patients with treatment-resistant depression or with residual symptoms are candidates for a change in treatment. Other patients requiring treatment changes are those who experience intolerable adverse effects and those who experience an illness recurrence. Because early detection can lead to improved outcomes, clinicians must be vigilant about assessing patients to identify when one or more of these situations occur. Clinicians must also communicate effectively with their patients to ensure that they understand the treatment strategies, goals, and potential adverse effects; have realistic expectations of treatment; and express their treatment preferences. Timely and appropriate treatment adjustment is necessary to help patients with MDD achieve recovery.

### Harder-to-treat patients: recognizing them and adapting treatment strategies [^0791e886]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Despite significant progress in pharmacologic treatment aimed at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, a number of patient groups that often prove difficult to treat remain. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia may go undiagnosed and untreated or, despite treatment, have persistently elevated lipid levels that confer a high cardiovascular disease risk. Although the true prevalence is unknown, statin intolerance is a common clinical presentation that is difficult to assess and frequently leads to suboptimal lipid treatment. Additionally, some patients may not achieve the expected response to guideline-based therapy. For all 3 groups, a standardized approach offers the best chance for effective diagnosis and optimal treatment.

### How should we treat newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients? [^5bbf23dc]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most frequent hematological disease. Two-thirds of newly diagnosed MM patients are more than 65 years of age. Elsewhere in this issue, McCarthy et al discuss the treatment of transplantation candidates; this chapter focuses on the data available concerning therapy for non-transplantation-eligible MM patients. Treatment goals for these non-transplantation-eligible patients should be to prolong survival by achieving the best possible response while ensuring quality of life. Until recently, treatment options were limited to alkylators, but new up-front treatment combinations based on novel agents (proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs) plus alkylating agents have significantly improved outcomes. Other nonalkylator induction regimens are also available and provide a novel backbone that may be combined with novel second- and third-generation drugs. Phase 3 data indicate that maintenance therapy or prolonged treatment in elderly patients also improves the quality and duration of clinical responses, extending time to progression and progression-free survival; however, the optimal scheme, appropriate doses, and duration of long-term therapy have not yet been fully determined. The potential for novel treatment regimens to improve the adverse prognosis associated with high-risk cytogenetic profiles also requires further research. In summary, although we have probably doubled the survival of elderly patients, this group requires close monitoring and individualized, dose-modified regimens to improve tolerability and treatment efficacy while maintaining their quality of life.

### Decision making for diagnosis and management: a consensus comes to life [^26681f84]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of head and neck cancer is extremely complex. As a result, multiple medical providers are involved in a patient's care, and the multidisciplinary tumor boards provide a forum whereby they can share and discuss the intricacies of each individual patient's case. When recommendations are presented to the patient and decisions are to be finalized, the patient should benefit from the collective wisdom of a team of providers to achieve and implement a patient-centric and clinically sound consensus.

### Unmet needs in systemic sclerosis understanding and treatment: the knowledge gaps from a scientist' s, clinician' s, and patient's perspective [^7b85c278]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

A Patient's View

Disease criteria are important to diagnose, preferably at an early stage, or even predict the course of the disease if not intervened. I think that it's always hard for a physician to decide to let a disease take its course whilst there is great uncertainty about its outcome. For instance, almost every time I saw a new rheumatologist (people move houses, retire, change jobs, etc.), they wanted me to get off my medication. At first, I was cooperative and reduced medication, which always ended up in a flare of the disease and me being a year crippled, not really fit for work and a household that couldn't fully count on me, because I couldn't walk or do something else. Because of my family and my personal inconvenience, I decided not to be so cooperative anymore in these experiments. But what other ways are there for a doctor in 'knowing the patient', experience the effects of interventions and so? Every patient is different. Disease criteria are a very important answer to this I think, as it can help even the more unexperienced doctor to know what to do at what time in the patient's journey.

On the other hand, such criteria shouldn't be followed as a rule, they should be fit for each patient such as true personalized medicine is truly meant.

### Advances in the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma [^58a797cf]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Glioblastoma is a refractory malignancy with limited treatment options at tumor recurrence. The standard of care for GB, including maximal resection, radiotherapy, and adjuvant temozolomide is currently recommended for all patients but only a small proportion of patients survive 2 years or longer. IDH1 mutation, MGMT promoter methylation, and gene expression profiling can segregate newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients into groups with different prognoses. While all newly diagnosed GB patients currently receive the same standard treatment, these biomarkers are being incorporated into a new generation of personalized clinical trials. The rapid translation of immune checkpoint inhibitors into the newly diagnosed setting is evidence of a paradigm shift in GB clinical trial design. Checkpoint inhibitors and other immunotherapies are a promising new treatment modality for newly diagnosed GB patients, although carefully designed clinical trials built on the platforms developed for the recently completed large-scale, multi-faceted randomized GB clinical trials will facilitate these efforts. In the case of immunotherapies, special consideration of autoimmune and CNS toxicities will be required to properly evaluate these treatments.

### Identifying patients who need a change in depression treatment and implementing that change [^6da72b65]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

For patients whose depression is difficult to treat or treatment-resistant, physicians must make an educated choice to switch, augment, or combine therapies to help patients adequately respond after initial treatment selections fail. Uncover some of the complexities of this challenging diagnosis by following the case of Robert, a 55-year-old accountant whose inadequate response to treatment by his primary care doctor has prompted a referral to a specialist.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^f0ce2fa4]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Low back pain guideline — terminology clarifies that what has traditionally been referred to as "nonoperative," "nonsurgical," or "conservative" care is now referred to as "medical/interventional care," which is meant to encompass pharmacological treatment, physical therapy, exercise therapy, manipulative therapy, modalities, various types of external stimulators and injections.

### The need for a personalized approach for prostate cancer management [^b243e115]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In current urology practice, most men diagnosed with prostate cancer will present with local or locally advanced disease. They will be candidates for curative treatment with either radical surgery or radiation therapy. Despite this shift towards diagnosis at a more favorable clinical stage of prostate cancer, between 20% and 30% of these patients will have a biochemical relapse and need additional therapy. At that point, most patients will first receive some form of salvage therapy, although a considerable number of patients will eventually need androgen deprivation therapy to treat metastasized prostate cancer. Androgen deprivation therapy is not a curative option in the treatment of prostate cancer, leading to castration-resistant prostate cancer and eventually death from prostate cancer in most cases.

The description of this clinical history is not uncommon, and underlines the limitations we encounter in determining the prognosis of individuals with prostate cancer. There is a clear, unmet need for reliable and reproducible prognostic biomarkers that can stratify patients on prognosis and identify who could benefit from early adjuvant treatment instead of salvage treatment.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of aspergillosis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^443056a1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America aspergillosis guideline — scope of clinical questions: The panel answered a series of broad questions for managing syndromes of aspergillosis, covering how the most susceptible patients can be protected and which patients are most susceptible; how a diagnosis of IA can be established; what antifungal agents are available for the treatment and prophylaxis of IA, including pharmacologic considerations and the role for susceptibility testing; what the recommended treatment regimens and adjunctive treatment measures are for the various clinical presentations of IA; what the recommended prophylactic regimens are, who should receive them, and how breakthrough infection should be managed; when patients should be treated empirically; and how chronic aspergillosis, allergic syndromes, or noninvasive syndromes should be managed.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^f3aeb697]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Bacterial co-infections and antibiotic use in COVID-19 — Studies reported to date mainly describe antibiotic use during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and consistently report high percentages of antibiotic use worldwide (58–95%), and one registry of 150 Spanish hospitals found that over 75% of patients received antibiotics. Diagnosis in the early months of the pandemic was a predictor of inappropriate antibiotic use, and antibiotic use was associated with adverse drug reactions. Data reporting co-infection in patients presenting with COVID-19 for care has mostly focused on patients receiving care in hospitals, and as more studies have become available, they can be grouped into those describing co-infection at the diagnosis of COVID-19, those describing the treatment of superinfections during the course of COVID-19 infection, those that report both, and those that do not distinguish between these types of infections. The latter are not discussed here. Differential diagnoses may include bacterial pneumonia, for which antibiotics are prescribed.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^ca81ebe9]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The Rationale for Functional Restoration

CRPS can be a very difficult condition to treat successfully. Not only is the syndrome bio-medically multifaceted, comprising both central and peripheral pathophysiology, but it also frequently contains psychosocial components that are additional pivotal diagnostic features (and thus, critical treatment targets). The array of possible patient presentations and the fact that the presentation often changes over time also complicate successful identification and treatment. To further add to the clinical challenges of managing CRPS, the epidemiology and natural history of CRPS are only superficially known; evidence concerning CRPS treatment has developed slowly due in large part to the early vagaries of diagnosis (see above); and, moreover, research data — when they are available — are sometimes challenging to interpret. Given these obstacles to diagnosis, treatment, and research, how is a specialist to embark on a path toward the successful treatment of such a complicated and partially understood condition? The only treatment methodology that can possibly successfully span these gaps in medical science is a systematic and orderly interdisciplinary approach. Interdisciplinary treatment is defined (here) as a dedicated, coherent, coordinated, specially trained group of relevant professionals that meet regularly to plan, coordinate care, and adapt to treatment eventualities. Less desirable (but more accessible) is multidisciplinary treatment (a single practitioner coordinates all the various specialties).

### Recognizing and managing sepsis: what needs to be done? [^8ba40c90]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Sepsis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognized and treated. Since the development of early goal-directed therapy, mortality rates have decreased, but sepsis remains a major cause of death in patients arriving at the emergency department or staying in hospital. In this forum article, we asked clinicians and researchers with expertise in sepsis care to discuss the importance of rapid detection and treatment of the condition, as well as special considerations in different patient groups.

### Therapy insight: therapeutic challenges in the treatment of elderly cancer patients [^c8a01bf0]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2006). Medium credibility.

People over the age of 65 years constitute the fastest-growing segment of the US population. Within the next 30 years, this group will comprise over 20% of the total population. Importantly, 50% of all cancers and 70% of cancer mortality occur in this age group. Choosing the correct chemotherapy regimen and dose for the older patient can be extremely difficult because of physiological changes that occur with aging, as well as other comorbidities associated with this age group. Treatment decisions need to be based on a patient's individual performance, functional status and life expectancy. Although there are no accepted algorithms to guide management decisions in elderly cancer patients, data are becoming available that will help guide the use of chemotherapy in the older patient population.

### Multiple myeloma: patient outcomes in real-world practice [^006a3c90]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

The cross‐sectional component of the current research showed that almost all patients diagnosed with symptomatic MM who were treated by haematologists received at least one line of active treatment (95%) whereas only 15% received a fourth or further line (Raab et al, 2016). Given the availability of agents that are effective in relapsed and refractory MM (Singhal et al, 1999; Richardson et al, 2005; Dimopoulos et al, 2007; Weber et al, 2007; Offidani et al, 2013; San Miguel et al, 2013; San‐Miguel et al, 2014; Stewart et al, 2015), it is perhaps surprising that relatively few patients receive multiple lines of therapy. About a quarter of patients completed fourth‐line treatment as planned, and 38% of patients ended fourth‐line treatment in remission, suggesting that patients do benefit from receiving treatment at this later stage; however, very few reach fifth‐line treatment (1%). A better understanding of the reasons for the increasingly small proportion of patients reaching later lines of treatment is needed, given the numerous new agents recently approved for the treatment of MM. One contributing factor may be the old age of many of these patients, who will accumulate comorbidities unrelated to MM. Thus, patients who are younger at diagnosis (i.e. those who were eligible for SCT) may be more likely to reach later lines and thus derive the greatest benefit from increasing treatment options at repeated relapses. This is borne out by the fact that, despite a longer time since diagnosis, the age distribution of patients at third‐line therapy was similar to that at first‐line treatment. It should also be noted that over half of patients treated at third line had been diagnosed with MM more than 5 years ago and may thus have received less than optimal regimens and supportive care than patients who are diagnosed with MM today.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — ambulatory patients and neutralizing antibody–containing products — note that the product used contains high titers of neutralizing antibodies and is used early in clinical presentation or in subpopulations of patients who do not have an adequate humoral immune response even at later stages of disease. The existing evidence in this specific population of patients remains sparse, and future studies in ambulatory patients should continue to target these populations.

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^36ea4765]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Role of the endocrinologist and diabetes care specialist — In patients aged 65 years and older with newly diagnosed diabetes, we advise that an endocrinologist or diabetes care specialist should work with the primary care provider, a multidisciplinary team, and the patient in the development of individualized diabetes treatment goals (Ungraded Good Practice Statement). In patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes, an endocrinologist or diabetes care specialist should be primarily responsible for diabetes care if the patient has T1D, or requires complex hyperglycemia treatment to achieve treatment goals, or has recurrent severe hypoglycemia, or has multiple diabetes complications (Ungraded Good Practice Statement). Possible roles include no role, consultant-only collaborative care, and overall diabetes management; under no role, care is by the primary care team when goals are achieved with lifestyle or simple oral agent therapy (one or two medications). Consultant-only collaborative care includes assistance with assessment and goal setting, with consultation at diagnosis or when there is a change in diabetes status such as treatment goals no longer being achieved, recurrent hypoglycemia, or development of one or more diabetes complications. For overall management, specific indications to assume control include complex hyperglycemia treatment (use of three or more glucose-lowering agents; the addition of insulin, especially multiple types or injections), recurrent severe hypoglycemia, multiple diabetes complications, and a long history of diabetes.

### Seek and Ye shall find: COVID-19 and bacterial superinfection [^ef27bee0]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In summary, the NU COVID Investigators, through an enormous effort in the midst of the pandemic, demonstrate that diagnostic thoroughness delivers actionable information. The high rates of early and late superinfections in this study mandate vigilance and a systematic response. Among the many complications that can develop in critically ill patients with COVID-19, secondary pneumonias can be etiologically diagnosed and treated in a timely fashion. Most patients can be treated with appropriately de-escalated narrow-spectrum antibiotics, whereas antibiotics can be limited or avoided in those patients in whom LRT studies are negative. Given the group's findings that bronchoscopy can be safely performed in patients with COVID-19, hospitals with such capacity should not be dissuaded from performing BAL when clinically indicated. The study by Pickens and colleagues reminds us that diagnostic inertia and therapeutic empiricism for secondary pneumonias can be overcome in the care of critically ill patients with COVID-19 because if we seek for pathogens, we shall find them.

### Try, try again: success rates after continued treatment attempts in refractory status epilepticus [^11246c98]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

Commentary

"Look before you leap." Clinicians want to understand the chance of success before embarking upon new treatments. We are most familiar with Glasgow data — What is the chance of becoming seizure-free after trying an increasing number of ASMs? Among 1795 attempting a first anti-seizure medication (ASM), 820 (46%) attained a period of seizure-freedom, whereas among those trying a second ASM, 28% achieved seizure-freedom (only 12% of the total cohort), and among those trying a third ASM, 24% achieved seizure-freedom (4% of the total) with diminishing returns from there.

While newly diagnosed incident epilepsy is an important context, there are many others in which the probability of treatment response with successive attempts is not well clarified. This particularly applies to status epilepticus (SE), in which the consequences of under- or over-treatment are potentially serious. Seizures continue despite benzodiazepines in up to a third of patients, convulsive SE still does not abate in almost half of benzodiazepine-refractory patients, and many treatments are available for refractory SE oftentimes with limited comparative effectiveness data. Current guidelines recommend a staged approach, with benzodiazepines followed by intravenous (IV) ASMs as first- and second-line treatments, followed by sedatives if refractory. However, real-world data are lacking documenting the probability of becoming seizure-free and functional outcomes after successive treatment steps to inform how far to go.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^526daeaa]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Considerations for treatment implementation — importance of informed consent emphasizes that the panel "encourages all clinicians to provide informed consent to patients," and that "psychologists should obtain an informed consent from the patient prior to implementing psychological services." Informed consent requires clinicians to "inform clients/patients as early as is feasible in the therapeutic relationship about the nature and anticipated course of therapy, fees, involvement of third parties, and limits of confidentiality and provide sufficient opportunity for the client/patient to ask questions and receive answers," and the Code of Ethics notes it "should include information about any known diagnosis; why particular interventions are recommended and what is involved in these interventions; and benefits, harms, and burdens of possible interventions including those for choosing to receive no treatment," thereby allowing patients "to make an informed decision of whether to initiate or continue treatment," and satisfying "the General Principles of Beneficence and Nonmaleficence." For minors, "the provider should convey the same information to the parent/guardian who must provide consent for treatment" and also to "adolescents who must assent to treatment," and "for children, it also would be helpful to convey some of the information… in an age-appropriate manner."

Other considerations for patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk for progression to severe disease include that the panel agreed that the overall certainty of evidence was low due to concerns about imprecision, as less than half of the original projected sample size was enrolled; compared to prior trials, giving remdesivir early in the course of the viral infection appears to have a robust effect within the limitation of a limited sample size; the panel agreed that benefits are likely to outweigh any potential harms in patients at high risk for severe disease; and the evidence confirms that using remdesivir early in the disease process when viral loads are high confers maximum benefit.

### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on delays to breast cancer surgery: ripples or waves? [^c96bad2c]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Adherence to current recommendations for optimal time from diagnosis to treatment for patients with breast cancer may have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on time to surgery or systemic treatment with chemotherapy or immunotherapy for patients diagnosed with breast cancer.

Methods

Using the National Cancer Database, patients diagnosed with breast cancer in 2020 were compared to those diagnosed from 2018–2019 (Pre-COVID). Sub-analyses were performed for patients who were tested for COVID-19 and those who had a positive result in 2020. Multivariate logistic regression was used assess odds ratios for delayed time to surgery (DTS, defined as > 90 days) or systemic therapy (defined as > 120 days).

Results

In total, 230,997 patients were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2018 and 2019 compared to 102,065 in 2020. Of the 2020 cohort, 47,659 (46.7%) received COVID-19 testing; of which, 3,158 (6.6%) resulted positive. A larger proportion of COVID-tested or COVID-positive patients had higher stage at diagnosis. DTS was more likely for patients who were diagnosed in 2020, uninsured or underinsured, non-white, Hispanic, less educated, or age < 70 years. Similar factors were predictive of delay to systemic therapy (less age < 70 years); however, diagnosis in 2020 was not.

Conclusion

The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with significant DTS for breast cancer but spared time to systemic therapy. Delays disproportionately impacted vulnerable and underserved patient populations. The true clinical effects of these delays may yet be realized for breast cancer patients.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^4c05a6ab]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Treatment of depression — research and funding needs emphasizes developing innovative ways to match patients with treatments and states that studies should examine the efficacy of a step-wise approach like switching patients from medication to types of psychotherapies (or vice versa) in cases of treatment failure, with the goal to better understand how to make the treatment more effective for all persons or to better understand for which individuals the treatment is not recommended. The page notes that, given the complexity and large resource needs of randomized clinical trials, available high-quality research is limited, that funding is highly competitive and thus available to a relatively small number of investigators, and that addressing the many questions raised will require more investment in complex and expensive research across many investigative teams, including much larger sample sizes for key questions about moderators and mediators of treatment response than are typical of current psychotherapy research studies.

### Nowcasting epidemics of novel pathogens: lessons from COVID-19 [^a6cdad28]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Epidemic nowcasting broadly refers to assessing the current state by understanding key pathogenic, epidemiologic, clinical and socio-behavioral characteristics of an ongoing outbreak. Its primary objective is to provide situational awareness and inform decisions on control responses. In the event of large-scale sustained emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists need to constantly update their aims and analytics with respect to the rapidly evolving emergence of new questions, data and findings in order to synthesize real-time evidence for policy decisions. In this Perspective, we share our views on the functional aims, rationale, data requirements and challenges of nowcasting at different stages of an epidemic, drawing on the ongoing COVID-19 experience. We highlight how recent advances in the computational and laboratory sciences could be harnessed to complement traditional approaches to enhance the scope, timeliness, reliability and utility of epidemic nowcasting.

### Selecting appropriate treatment for patients who are nonresponsive to initial therapy [^12b6785d]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Depression can be a chronic illness, and several treatment steps are often needed to achieve sustained symptom remission and return patients to premorbid levels of functioning. Patients with chronic depressive illness, early onset, concurrent psychiatric or medical conditions, difficult psychosocial problems, or comorbid melancholic and anxious features may require additional treatment steps. Next-step strategies, after optimizing the dose and extending the treatment trial of the initial antidepressant, include switching antidepressants, adding another antidepressant, and augmenting with a nonantidepressant agent.

### About the complexity of adult onset Still's disease… and advances still required for its management [^e2560497]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Adult onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a rare inflammatory disorder that remains poorly understood. Its pathophysiology is yet to be completely elucidated, but is known to consist mainly on a cytokine cascade, responsible for the systemic manifestations. AOSD diagnosis is usually difficult and delayed, with physicians having to rule out several other conditions, including cancer or infectious diseases. Prognosis is heterogeneous and difficult to establish, ranging from benign outcome to chronic destructive polyarthritis and/or life-threatening events. In addition, treatment remains to be codified, especially considering the development of new drugs. In this commentary, we attempt to elucidate the complexity of AOSD and to highlight the need of working on prognostic tools for this disorder. We also discuss the numerous advances that would be useful for patients in the daily management of this disease.

### Patient experiences of receiving a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease [^039c92e0]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Information on how satisfied patients were with the diagnostic consultation and the factors with the greatest influence on this provides an opportunity to improve the experience of being diagnosed with PD. Whilst health care professionals in diagnostic consultations necessarily need to focus on making the correct diagnosis, ordering appropriate tests and starting medication, subjective patient experience of receiving a diagnosis of PD is primarily determined by how the diagnosis is communicated, the quantity and helpfulness of information is provided and whether they have the opportunity to ask questions. Training in communicating a diagnosis of PD in a sensitive way, on how to provide information verbally and in written form, and giving time to ask questions in the consultation or shortly afterwards are important factors that can shape this experience. Guidelines for the management of PD, e.g. the NICE or EFNS guidelines, already incorporate some of these recommendations such as tailored provision of communication, but do not specifically address how to communicate the diagnosis or provide sufficient time for questions on the diagnosis, e.g. in a follow-up or nurse specialist appointment.

Delivering bad or difficult news is an important aspect of how clinicians have influence on the impact of disease on the individual. Surveys in other disorders showed that patients wanted their doctors to be truthful, caring, and compassionate in communication of difficult news. It has also been shown across medical conditions that bad news communicated badly can cause confusion, long-lasting distress, and resentment; if done well, it can assist in understanding, acceptance, and adjustment. Guidelines emphasise the importance of preparation, assessing the patient's understanding, giving information, follow-up and discussion of treatment options, and assessing patients' emotions. Most of these guidelines are focussed on cancer or terminal illness, but an increasing emphasis on delivering bad news is also being placed in neurology and chronic, non-fatal diseases. In PD, there is still a need to improve how the diagnosis is communicated to patients, in particular the sensitivity of communication in the context of a patient's understanding, emotions, and expectations. The opportunity to ask questions soon after diagnosis is valued by patients, and the amount, timing and quality of life information provided need to be adjusted to individual patients but improves satisfaction with the diagnostic process. This information, as well as specialist knowledge, is often more easily available to specialists, and the diagnosis is, therefore, best made and communicated by them, followed by a second appointment with a health care professional to allow questions to be asked about a new diagnosis of PD.

Glioblastoma guideline methodology — study selection and grading used pre-specified eligibility criteria set by the writing group and documented in individual guideline sections. At least two authors evaluated titles and abstracts using the inclusion and exclusion criteria with broad interpretation initially, and a third author resolved disagreements about pertinence. Full-text articles of selected abstracts were collected and the same eligibility process was reapplied, with reasons for exclusion documented. For eligible studies, one writer extracted data and one or more other reviewers checked it. Evidence tables reporting extracted study information and evidence classification were generated for all included studies, created with the most recent data first in retrograde chronological order, and headings included first author name and year, brief study description, chosen data class, and conclusion. Additional methodological details are available at the provided URL, and internal drafts were developed by sharing electronically, by telephone, and in person meetings.

### Osteoarthritis: an update with relevance for clinical practice [^0eeb508b]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Osteoarthritis is thought to be the most prevalent chronic joint disease. The incidence of osteoarthritis is rising because of the ageing population and the epidemic of obesity. Pain and loss of function are the main clinical features that lead to treatment, including non-pharmacological, pharmacological, and surgical approaches. Clinicians recognise that the diagnosis of osteoarthritis is established late in the disease process, maybe too late to expect much help from disease-modifying drugs. Despite efforts over the past decades to develop markers of disease, still-imaging procedures and biochemical marker analyses need to be improved and possibly extended with more specific and sensitive methods to reliably describe disease processes, to diagnose the disease at an early stage, to classify patients according to their prognosis, and to follow the course of disease and treatment effectiveness. In the coming years, a better definition of osteoarthritis is expected by delineating different phenotypes of the disease. Treatment targeted more specifically at these phenotypes might lead to improved outcomes.

COVID-19 convalescent plasma — ambulatory persons: The panel states the overall certainty is low and notes uncertainty about early use, and the guideline panel suggests use only in a narrow outpatient population. Specifically, the panel agreed that the overall certainty of evidence is low due to concerns with imprecision and recognized the inability to exclude a meaningful beneficial or detrimental effect when convalescent plasma is given early in the course of COVID-19 disease. For outpatients, the guideline panel suggests FDA-qualified high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma in the ambulatory setting for persons with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk for progression to severe disease, who have no other treatment options.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^ff7f16db]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — antiviral timing and hospital admission management — Greatest clinical benefit was reported when antiviral treatment was started within 2 days of illness onset, but benefit was noted even when started in most patients 4–5 days and up to 7 days after illness onset, including when NAI treatment was started > 48 hours after illness onset; a meta-analysis in hospitalized A(H1N1)pdm09 cases suggested that antiviral treatment within 48 hours of illness onset was associated with lower mortality compared to later or no treatment. Early antiviral treatment of influenza in outpatients reduces the likelihood of antibiotic use or physician-diagnosed complications and may reduce secondary bacterial coinfection. For patients being admitted with suspected influenza, we recommend starting empiric antiviral treatment as soon as possible without waiting for influenza testing results.

Appendix A. Protocol for NASS literature searches — A preliminary search of the evidence is conducted using clearly defined search parameters, and the following parameters are provided to research staff: time frames for search; foreign and/or English language; order of results (chronological, by journal, etc.); key search terms and connectors, with or without MeSH terms to be employed; and age range. This preliminary search should encompass a search of the Cochrane database when access is available. Search results with abstracts will be compiled by the medical librarian in both Endnote software and a PubMed account, whenever possible, and the medical librarian typically responds to requests and completes the searches within 2–5 business days. NASS staff shares the search results with an appropriate content expert to assess relevance of articles and identify appropriate articles to review and on which to run a "related articles" search, and based on content expert's review, NASS Research staff will then coordinate with the medical librarian the second level searching to identify relevant "related articles." NASS staff shares related articles search results with an appropriate content expert to assess relevance of these second set of articles and identify appropriate articles to review and on which to run a second "related articles" search, and NASS Research staff will work with the medical librarian to obtain the 2nd related articles search results and any necessary full-text articles for review. The preliminary search must answer the following questions: "Should duplicates be eliminated between searches?", "Should searches be separated by term or as one large package?", and "Should human studies, animal studies or cadaver studies be included?". For additional retrieval, NASS members reviewing full-text articles should also review the references at the end of each article to identify additional articles which should be reviewed, but may have been missed in the search.

Establishing a therapeutic alliance in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) states that establishing and maintaining a strong therapeutic alliance is important so that treatment may be jointly, and therefore more effectively, planned and implemented [I]. Steps toward this end include tailoring one's communication style to the patient's needs and capacities, explaining symptoms in understandable terms, and being both encouraging and comforting [I]. The excessive doubting that is characteristic of OCD may require special approaches to building the alliance, including allowing the patient extra time to consider treatment decisions and repeating explanations (a limited number of times) [I]. In building the therapeutic alliance, the psychiatrist should also consider how the patient feels and acts toward him or her as well as what the patient wants and expects from treatment [I].

### Complex regional pain syndrome: a comprehensive qualitative research study on unmet needs in the "Patient journey" [^20b89682]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This qualitative research study aimed to characterize the "patient journey" for patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and identify the unmet needs related to the management and treatment of the condition for healthcare providers (HCPs), patients, and their caregivers.

Materials and Methods

Multifaceted, dynamic methodology, iteratively gathering cognitive, emotional and social insights, was used to support and conduct in-depth, immersion interviews across the USA with 59 HCPs in-office and in roundtable discussions, and 20 patient-support partner dyads in-home.

Results

Patients were aged > 18 years, primarily female, and all were diagnosed with CRPS (limited to type 1 in this patient cohort). Results show that the current state of CRPS treatment may fall short in multiple key areas. In some cases, poor awareness of CRPS causes delayed diagnoses impacting the opportunity for early treatment, resulting in long-term poor health outcomes. Consequently, the CRPS "patient journey" may be characterized by clinical frustration of physicians and disappointment for some patients. The poor treatment experiences and outcomes for some patients and HCPs may build the perception of a non-collaborative relationship. HCPs and patients agree that an effective treatment would be one that addresses CRPS rather than its symptoms, and the availability of such an option would transform the treatment experience.

Conclusion

CRPS leads to cognitive, social and emotional burdens for patients and their caregivers. There is an unmet need for improved CRPS disease awareness and successful therapeutic options to aid in earlier diagnoses, effective treatment and better outcomes for HCPs, patients, and their caregivers.

We are entering an era in which the cost of clinical whole-genome and targeted sequencing tests is no longer prohibitive to their application. However, currently the infrastructure is not in place to support both the patient and the physicians that encounter the resultant data. Here, we ask five experts to give their opinions on whether clinical data should be treated differently from other medical data, given the potential use of these tests, and on the areas that must be developed to improve patient outcome.

### Departments of radiation oncology must prepare for COVID-19 outbreak [^7ad97054]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

At a university hospital in Daegu, radiation therapy patients were also diagnosed with COVID-19. The department was closed for quarantine for 2 days and health care professionals were screened for COVID-19. Patients who receive radiation often visit the department daily for standardized treatment times. In addition, radiation therapists have no choice but to interact with the same patients for every fraction during the patient setup process. Therefore, when an infected person is diagnosed, patients treated during the same time or the radiotherapist in the treatment room are isolated as well and the department is quarantined for 2 to 3 days.

Strict scheduled treatment should be provided for outpatients. Approximately 30 patients are treated per machine per day; hence, the number of patients who are waiting for treatment generally increases. The strict slot system with longer treatment intervals aims to reduce the waiting time for radiation therapy to minimize the chance of patient–patient contact.

If a health care professional becomes infected, the situation becomes even more dangerous. In Korea, patients receiving radiation therapy are in close contact with the therapist. Owing to the development of image guided radiation therapy, doctors often visit the treatment room directly. If the control room is not independent, infection between therapists can also be a concern. Therefore, if a health care professional is diagnosed, the radiation therapist and doctor close to the patient in the treatment room may also require isolation, and the department may shut down for 14 days.

Furthermore, treatment duration increases as radiation therapy is discontinued. Increasing the treatment duration adversely affects radiation therapy results. At a time when the intervals between globally affecting epidemics, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2012, and COVID-19 in 2019, are shortening, we believe that strategies to minimize damage in the future will be needed.

Conclusions and research needs — corticosteroids versus anti-D immunoglobulin: the guideline panel determined there is low certainty evidence for a net health benefit from treatment with corticosteroids rather than anti-D immunoglobulin, noting that corticosteroids are substantially less expensive and that anti-D immunoglobulin availability is limited and requires a patient be Rh D+ with an intact spleen; the panel also stated that anti-D immunoglobulin may not be acceptable to some populations such as Jehovah's Witnesses who will not receive blood products. The panel identified research needs including comparative effectiveness trials of first-line agents addressing efficacy, cost, side effects, and patient-reported outcomes; determination of upfront treatment selection on long-term outcomes; biologic studies to predict treatment response; and assessment of other treatments (eg, TPO-RAs) in newly diagnosed patients to minimize side effects and potentially modify disease.

### Nystagmus in clinical practice: from diagnosis to treatment – A comprehensive review [^54bbe500]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment

The main goal of treatment is to alleviate the visual symptoms by reducing the speed of the nystagmus slow phase. In addition to this, the other aim is to negate the visual consequences of the nystagmus. In addition to visual disturbances, psychological, social, and cosmetic concerns are other reasons why patients with nystagmus seek treatment. Various medical, surgical, and optical options are available for treatment. Generally, those that abolish abnormal ocular oscillations while preserving physiological eye movements (saccades, vergence, and vestibulo-ocular reflex) are preferred. The cause of nystagmus, presence of visual complaints, and the type of nystagmus play a major role in determining the treatment modality.

Medical Treatment

Medical therapy is the mainstay of treatment for the acquired forms of nystagmus. However, long-term therapy is limited by drug-related side effects. Several trials have been conducted to determine the optimal treatment approach for specific types of nystagmus. Table 1 summarizes drug treatments for different forms of nystagmus.

### Pathogen lists Do not tell Us what we need to Do [^23a7dc02]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract.

Brett-Major and others remind us that pathogen lists for emerging infectious diseases aid in the development of tools that target specific pathogens (e.g. vaccines) and help attract financial support. These lists tell us what we need to have, not what we need to do. The authors call for more research on ways to prevent these diseases (e.g. platform technologies for vaccines) and mitigate disease impact. Vaccines and new treatments that target individual pathogens have many limitations. However, we might save lives by treating patients with inexpensive generic drugs that target common features of the host response to infection. Undertaking research on this approach to treatment is what we need to do.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of aspergillosis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^db033505]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Refractory or progressive aspergillosis (salvage therapy) — we recommend an individualized approach that takes into consideration the rapidity, severity, and extent of infection, patient comorbidities, and to exclude the emergence of a new pathogen (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). General strategies for salvage therapy typically include changing the class of antifungal, tapering or reversal of underlying immunosuppression when feasible, and surgical resection of necrotic lesions in selected cases. In the context of salvage therapy, an additional antifungal agent may be added to current therapy, or combination antifungal drugs from different classes other than those in the initial regimen may be used (weak recommendation; moderate- quality evidence). In patients receiving an antifungal and exhibiting an adverse event attributable to this agent, we recommend changing to an alternative class of antifungal, or using an alternative agent with a nonoverlapping side-effect profile (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).

Appendix D: Protocol for NASS literature searches — when a literature search is needed, NASS research staff will work with the requesting parties and a contracted medical librarian to run a comprehensive search that begins with a preliminary search using clearly defined parameters (time frames for search, foreign and/or English language, order of results, key search terms and connectors with or without MeSH terms, and age range), addresses whether to eliminate duplicates, separate searches by term or as one package, and include human, animal, or cadaver studies, and includes a search of the Cochrane database when access is available. Search results with abstracts will be compiled in Endnote and a PubMed account, and the medical librarian typically responds to requests and completes the searches within 2–5 business days. NASS staff shares the search results with an appropriate content expert to assess relevance and identify appropriate articles to review and on which to run a "related articles" search, after which NASS Research staff will coordinate with the medical librarian to conduct the second level searching to identify relevant "related articles" and obtain any necessary full‑text articles for review. NASS members reviewing full‑text articles should also review the references at the end of each article to identify additional articles which should be reviewed, but may have been missed in the search. For expedited searches, following #3, depending on the time frame allowed, deeper searching may be conducted as described by the full protocol or request of full‑text articles may occur; if full‑text articles are requested, #8 should also be included, and use of the expedited protocol or any deviation from the full protocol should be documented with explanation. Following these protocols will help ensure that NASS recommendations are (1) based on a thorough review of relevant literature; (2) are truly based on a uniform, comprehensive search strategy; and (3) represent the current best research evidence available, and research staff will maintain a search history in Endnote for future use or reference.

### Linkage to care, retention in care and treatment uptake among patients diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B in Norway, 2008–2022 [^b890e26b]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

We find that 79% of patients diagnosed with CHB in Norway from 2008 to 2022 were ever LTC (i.e. specialist consultation or treatment for hepatitis B after diagnosis). The proportion increased over time from 73% in 2008–2009 to 88% in 2018–2019. Thus, over 10% of diagnosed PLWHB each year in Norway are not being seen by a specialist, contrary to the national CHB guidelines and as specified in a national electronic handbook that is the preferred source for advice among general practitioners. Published data on LTC are sparse on a national level. In Europe, monitoring reports from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control do not currently provide data on this indicator. A registry‐linkage study in Denmark found that a third of PLWHB diagnosed by the end of 2016 had attended specialist care. Another study in England reported that a quarter of HBsAg positive patients diagnosed from 2008 to 2019 at general practices had been referred to a specialist. Globally, 95% CI from pooled estimates of LTC (defined as assessment of eligibility for treatment following a diagnosis of hepatitis B) ranged from 47% to 67% for primary or co‐managed care, 63% to 80% for specialist care and 54% to 93% for community‐based testing.

Following LTC, over a quarter of all diagnosed PLWHB in Norway were not RIC in the first 2 years after CHB diagnosis. In the last 12 months of the study period, 50% of resident PLWHB were still RIC. There are again sparse national data to compare with. Just three EU/EEA countries reported on the number of diagnosed PLWHB still RIC in 2022. A WHO systematic review and meta‐analysis found a similar global trend to our results, with RIC declining to 66% (95% CI: 40–85) at 48 months after diagnosis among PLWHB who had received treatment, and 42% (95% CI: 27–58) after 24 months for untreated patients.

Treatment uptake in our study was 23%, with 17% of resident PLWHB still on treatment at the end of the study period. Treatment uptake among diagnosed PLWHB is around 20% globally and 12% in Europe. In 2022, four EU/EEA countries were able to provide data on treatment uptake among diagnosed PLWHB, ranging from 7% to 36%. The reasonable treatment uptake we find may suggest that those lost to follow‐up are mainly patients with an inactive carrier state.

### Radical cancer treatment is safe during COVID-19: the real-world experience of a large london-based comprehensive cancer centre during the first wave [^e2063c2b]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

During the period March–September 2020, 1552 cancer patients underwent radical surgery, 814 patients underwent radical RT and 1091 patients received a form of radical SACT (Table 1). In the same period in 2019, 2336 cancer patients underwent radical surgery, 1072 patients underwent radical RT and 819 patients received a form of radical SACT (March–May only). This equates to a reduction of 34% for surgery and 24% for radiotherapy compared to the same timeframe in 2019. There was a 18% reduction in radical SACT in 2020 (n = 668) compared to the same 3-month period in 2019 (n = 819). Using first-line cancer treatments as a proxy for newly diagnosed cancers, across all treatment types we estimate there to be a 23% decrease in the number of newly diagnosed patients undergoing treatment in 2020 compared to those diagnosed in 2019.

Table 1
Patient characteristics of those cancer patients receiving radical cancer treatment in 2019 and 2020.

In 2020, there were more males than females in the surgical cohort (58% vs. 42%), whereas there were more females in both the SACT and RT cohorts (24% vs. 76% and 42% vs. 58%, respectively) (Table 1). In 2019, more females than males received all three treatment modalities. Whilst the age distribution was similar between treatment types, the mean age of the SACT patients was slightly younger compared to that of the surgical and RT patients in both years of study (2020: 58 vs. 61 and 62 years; 2019: 59 vs. 63 and 65 years respectively). The distribution of ethnicities was similar across the three treatment arms with the highest proportion of patients being White British.

COVID-19 antigen (Ag) testing in symptomatic patients — benefits and harms indicate that within 5 days of symptom onset the false-negative rate ranged from 5 (range: 3 to 8) per 1000 at 5% prevalence to 55 (range: 35 to 85) per 1000 at 50% prevalence, while specificity remained close to 100% regardless of time from symptom onset. After 5 days of symptoms, sensitivity was 54% (95% CI: 44% to 64%), and because of potential harms a negative result in someone with continued suspicion for COVID-19 should be confirmed promptly with a standard NAAT. As currently available therapies are recommended to be started within 5 days of symptoms, Ag testing during this period yielded almost no false-positive results even when prevalence was as low as 5% (range: 0 to 9 false-positive results per 1000 patients tested).

### 2021 American Thyroid Association guidelines for management of patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer [^f9843e34]. Thyroid (2021). High credibility.

Anaplastic thyroid cancer — capacity concerns, ethics, and surrogate decision-making are addressed with specific supports and norms. If you have concerns that your patient does not have decision-making capacity, request a formal capacity assessment with a mental health provider, or request a clinical ethics consultation; if the patient requires a surrogate decision maker and does not have an advance directive or a court-appointed guardian, consult your state surrogacy laws or your institution's legal office. U-ARE criteria and input from psychiatry and neuropsychology services can offer a formal opinion about decision-making capacity. For incompetent patients diagnosed with ATC who have been declared incompetent by the courts, the Principle of Respect for Persons obligates practitioners to ensure such patients have an authentic surrogate decision maker, patients should participate in decision-making to the extent that they can, and in the United States, incompetent patients lack decision-making authority, which means that guardians have the legal authority to make decisions against the patient's wishes. Treatment teams should request an Ethics Consultation under such circumstances, while an institution's Office of Legal Counsel can also assist, and in the ATC context, forced treatment cannot be ethically justified. Good Practice Statement 3 states that patients must have understanding and decision-making capacity to consent to treatment.

### Best practice update: incorporating psychogastroenterology into management of digestive disorders [^fbd4bc19]. Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Assessment and screening for psychosocial factors in gastrointestinal (GI) care can be conducted with brief, open-ended prompts and targeted questions. Assessment of health-related quality of life (QOL) can be informal and brief, using 1–2 open-ended questions that invite the patient to provide the most relevant information about the life impact of the physical symptoms, with examples including "How do your bowel symptoms interfere with your ability to do what you want to do in your daily life?" and "What areas of your life are most affected?." Benefits include that without an open-ended option, the physician may remain unaware of key areas where targeted medical intervention can be of greatest help, that these questions build rapport, and that responses provide useful comparison data points for rechecking later to assess the effectiveness of interventions and yield a more complete picture of true progress. Asking about early life adversity — such as a personal history of physical, emotional, or sexual abuse; witnessing domestic violence in the household growing up; being raised by a caregiver with a substance abuse problem or mental illness; or having a family member who was incarcerated — could identify critical factors and point out which patients would benefit from psychological intervention earlier in care, and one commonly used screening questionnaire for early life adversity is the Adverse Childhood Experience Questionnaire. Symptom-specific anxiety can also amplify disease burden and lead to higher health care utilization, and in a survey of 1242 IBS patients a substantial minority thought that their disorders could develop into colitis (43%) or cancer (21%); these concerns or fears can be uncovered by asking a simple and direct open-ended question, "What worries or concerns do you have about your symptoms?," and discussion can help identify instances where referral to a behavioral health care provider is needed.

### Nystagmus in clinical practice: from diagnosis to treatment – A comprehensive review [^b5921ab3]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nystagmus is a disorder characterised by uncontrolled, repetitive to-and-fro movements of the eyes in a rhythmic pattern that may be physiological or pathological. It can occur as an isolated disorder but is most commonly part of an underlying ophthalmic or systemic disorder and is the most obvious or first presenting feature. It is common and affects both paediatric and adult age groups. The movements can be horizontal, vertical, torsional, or a combination of both. It usually starts as a slow movement of the eye away from the target, followed by a second movement to re-fixate back onto the target. If the second movement is fast, it is called jerk nystagmus, whereas a slow second movement is characterised by pendular nystagmus. However, with that said, the classification and waveforms of nystagmus remain highly intricate, and are based on aetiology, electronystagmography, and pathogenesis. The mechanisms underlying nystagmus remain unclear, and several hypotheses and models have been proposed to explain its pathogenesis. As nystagmus remains a multifaceted condition, the clinical and laboratory assessments of nystagmus in patients with neurological disorders can provide crucial information for differential diagnosis. This can provide insight into various systemic disorders and aid in their diagnosis. Moreover, these involuntary eye movements can negatively affect visual function and quality of life, making nystagmus an important complex ocular condition. Visual acuity may be limited, and patients may experience vertigo, oscillopsia, or adjusted head posture. This makes it imperative to understand the various types, underlying mechanisms, causes, assessment, and treatment of nystagmus. A diagnosis should be established using clinical assessment and confirmed by various investigations, including electrophysiological tests, optical coherence tomography, neuroimaging, and genetic workup. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the underlying treatment is tailored to the diagnosis and aims to alleviate the visual symptoms and address the underlying aetiology. This review provides a comprehensive and structured description of the epidemiology, classification, clinical features, diagnostic workup, treatment, and recent advances in nystagmus. Moreover, this review uniquely integrates a comprehensive neuroanatomical and pathophysiological correlation for each subtype of nystagmus, offering readers a clearer clinical framework for differentiating among complex presentations. Unlike previous reviews, we have clubbed traditional classifications with newer diagnostic paradigms, incorporating nystagmoid movements, waveform analysis, and triggered nystagmus variants — areas which were either underrepresented or not structurally detailed in earlier works. Additionally, we have included updated neuro-ophthalmic diagnostic algorithms, realigned classifications by modern etiological groups (eg, vestibular, cerebellar, paraneoplastic), and introduced emerging diagnostic tools such as eye-tracking-based waveform analysis and AI-assisted vestibular testing, which reflect recent clinical advances. Importantly, we have also included a dedicated section outlining recent advances in treatment modalities and the evolving role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the diagnosis and monitoring of nystagmus, which further strengthens the clinical relevance of this work.

### Nystagmus in clinical practice: from diagnosis to treatment – A comprehensive review [^93e2cb3c]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Assessment and Diagnostic Workflow

Efforts to classify nystagmus may fall short in clinical practice as one condition can result in various types of nystagmus. Comprehensive and targeted evaluation is essential for accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause. The single best and most important step in diagnosis is the clinical examination

A patient with nystagmus must first be examined in the primary gaze, followed by the observation of eye movements in cardinal gazes. The following characteristics should be assessed:
Binocularity: can be monocular or binocular
Conjugacy: Can be conjugate (both eyes rotate simultaneously in the same direction by the same amount) or disconjugate (they do not rotate in the same direction). Disconjugate may be further dissociated if the velocity or amplitude of the movements is different in the two eyes, or disjunctive if the two eyes simultaneously rotate in different directions.
Direction of movement: horizontal, vertical, torsional or mixed.
Velocity: Quantitative measurement of the slow-phase movement in degrees per second.
Waveform: oscillatory appearance of nystagmus on an oculographic trace. Jerky (constant, decreasing, or increasing velocity waveform) or pendular (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, elliptical, circular, convergent, divergent, or seesaw).
Frequency: Measuring beats per second or Hz (hertz)
Amplitude: Magnitude in degrees of each beat, that is, the amount of excursion of the globe with each phase.
Intensity: Qualitative measurement of the product of amplitude and frequency
Temporal profile: Continuous, intermittent or changing
Presence of null point: The direction of gaze or distance of fixation at which nystagmus is minimal or nil
Age at presentation: congenital or infantile if present from birth until six months or acquired if it develops after six months or later.
Gaze positions: Contributes to nystagmus, including trajectory
Vergence: may have convergence – divergence component.
Effect of provocative manoeuvres: changes in position, sound, Valsalva, headshaking, vibration, and hyperventilation.

The following approaches are used to categorise nystagmus into various types and streamline the diagnostic process based on clinical findings and patient history:

Neurologic Causes (Neurologic Group):

Assess the patient's birth and family history as well as their growth and development. If no relevant family history or signs of neurological issues were present, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the initial test.

Methods: Patients with moderately to severely active RA receiving treatment with methotrexate were randomised 1:1 to FK-ada or reference adalimumab (originator) in the double-blind, multicentre, phase III AURIEL-RA study. Safety, efficacy and immunogenicity endpoints were assessed at scheduled visits up to week 52, safety being the study primary objective. Patients were categorized by time since RA diagnosis at baseline: diagnosed early (< 5 years since diagnosis) and late (≥ 5 years). Efficacy, safety and QoL were summarized for these subgroups.

Results: 288 patients were randomized to FK-ada (143) and originator (145) with 133 early diagnosed patients (68 and 65, respectively). Gender, race, ethnicity, age and disease characteristics were all well balanced at baseline. No clinically meaningful differences in efficacy and QoL were seen between treatment arms in both subgroups up to week 52. For patients diagnosed early, higher ACR20 response rates were observed starting from W12 in both treatment groups (early diagnosed: 88.1% and 84.4% for FK-ada and originator vs diagnosed later: 72.0% and 77.9%). This trend continued through W52. A similar pattern was observed for ACR50 and ACR70 response rates. By W52, more early-diagnosed patients achieved remission per DAS28-ESR Categorical (50.9% and 41.5% vs 31.3% and 32.3%) and showed greater QoL improvement (median change from baseline of HAQ-DI score: −0.8750 and −0.6250 vs −0.5625 and −0.5000). No notable differences in adverse event incidence were observed between treatment arms or subgroups through the follow-up period (51.5% and 75.4% vs 64.0% and 55.0%).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of concussion-mild traumatic brain injury [^5dc7a5c7]. VA/DoD (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for concussion, more specifically with respect to terminology, DoD/VA 2016 guidelines recommend to consider using the terms "history of mTBI" or "concussion" and refraining from using the terms "brain damage" or "patients with mTBI" in communication with patients and the public.
