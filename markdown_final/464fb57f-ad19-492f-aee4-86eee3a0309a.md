## Question

Well demarcated itchy circular rashes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate well-demarcated, itchy, circular rashes and prioritize the differential and diagnostic steps accordingly. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the morphology and distribution to anchor likely etiologies. Then, I should verify the most probable diagnosis and its confirmatory test. Next, I will consider key differentials that mimic this pattern and how to exclude them. After that, I need to outline the initial diagnostic workup, including bedside tests and when to escalate to biopsy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical management and follow-up plan with red flags and special populations in mind.

> Let me first confirm the morphologic pattern and its implications. Well-demarcated, pruritic, circular or annular lesions with centrifugal expansion and central clearing strongly suggest tinea corporis, a superficial dermatophyte infection, particularly when there is peripheral scaling at the active border and no clear exposure to a topical allergen or irritant [^112AmniE] [^114zr5wX].

> Wait, let me verify the most likely diagnosis and the confirmatory test. Tinea corporis is the leading consideration, and the diagnosis is best confirmed at the bedside by performing a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation of scale from the active border, which demonstrates thin, branching hyphae; this is the highest-yield point-of-care test for superficial fungal infections and should be prioritized before empiric steroids that can mask or worsen disease [^112AmniE] [^114zr5wX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should review key mimics and their distinguishing features. Allergic contact dermatitis can be pruritic and well demarcated but typically corresponds to a contact site and may show vesiculation. Irritant contact dermatitis more often burns than itches and lacks the classic annular centrifugal growth. Psoriasis vulgaris produces sharply demarcated plaques with thick silvery scale and favors extensors. Nummular eczema presents as coin-shaped eczematous plaques without central clearing. Erythema migrans expands slowly and is usually nonpruritic. Annular urticaria is evanescent and resolves within 24–48 hours. Granuloma annulare is often asymptomatic and nonscaly. And secondary syphilis can mimic annular plaques but is usually accompanied by systemic signs and palmoplantar involvement, so I need to check for those discriminators before anchoring on tinea [^111L8kB2] [^112AmniE] [^1167S1me] [^115f7eS8] [^112Sd4J3].

> I should double-check the initial diagnostic approach. For a patient with persistent pruritic annular lesions, obtain focused history on exposures, pets, travel, sports, and immunosuppression; perform a full-body skin exam including nails, groin, and feet; and perform KOH scraping from the active border. If KOH is negative but suspicion remains high, consider fungal culture or repeat scraping; if the diagnosis remains uncertain or the rash is refractory, proceed to punch biopsy for histology and special stains, and consider RPR to exclude secondary syphilis when risk factors or atypical features are present [^112qkqxD] [^112AmniE] [^112Sd4J3].

> Let me think about management if tinea is confirmed. Topical antifungals such as terbinafine, naftifine, or azoles are first-line for localized disease; for extensive, inflammatory, or refractory cases, systemic therapy with oral terbinafine, itraconazole, or fluconazole is appropriate. I need to ensure we avoid topical corticosteroids monotherapy because they can induce tinea incognito; if inflammation is severe, a short course of a low-potency steroid combined with antifungal may be used cautiously, but monotherapy risks worsening and masking the infection [^112EzWtv] [^114zr5wX].

> But wait, what if the patient has already been using topical steroids and the rash has concentric scaly rings or atypical morphology. In that scenario, I should suspect tinea incognito or pseudoimbricata, where prolonged steroid use alters the classic appearance. KOH may still reveal hyphae, and histology can show fungal elements in the stratum corneum, so I should explicitly ask about prior steroid use and adjust management accordingly [^112EzWtv].

> I need to ensure I address red flags and special populations. Immunocompromised patients may have atypical or more extensive disease and may require systemic therapy earlier. Patients with diabetes, obesity, or intertriginous involvement may have mixed infections or higher recurrence risk. And in children, tinea corporis is common and should be distinguished from eczema and psoriasis using morphology and KOH. If there is a history of malignancy or paraneoplastic concern, I should keep figurate erythemas in mind, but the initial workup still hinges on bedside mycology and targeted labs before pursuing extensive oncologic evaluation [^115Ko85Q] [^112EzWtv].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic sequence to ensure nothing is missed. Start with morphology and distribution to anchor tinea corporis as most likely, confirm with KOH scraping from the active border, and if negative or atypical, broaden to culture, biopsy, and serologies such as RPR as indicated. Throughout, avoid empiric topical steroids without antifungal coverage, and tailor therapy to extent, inflammation, and host factors, escalating to systemic antifungals when topical therapy fails or disease is extensive [^112AmniE] [^112qkqxD].

> In summary, well-demarcated, pruritic, circular rashes with centrifugal expansion and central clearing are most often tinea corporis, best confirmed by KOH preparation. Key mimics include contact dermatitis, psoriasis, nummular eczema, erythema migrans, urticaria, granuloma annulare, and secondary syphilis, which are distinguished by history, distribution, evolution, and targeted tests. Management is antifungal therapy with avoidance of steroid monotherapy, and escalation to systemic agents when needed, with vigilance for atypical presentations and high-risk hosts [^112AmniE] [^114zr5wX] [^112Sd4J3].

Well-demarcated itchy circular rashes most often reflect **tinea corporis** (ringworm) [^112AmniE], characterized by annular, scaly plaques with central clearing and pruritus; diagnosis is confirmed by KOH prep showing hyphae [^114ascVq]. Other common causes include **nummular eczema** (coin-shaped, scaly plaques) [^112AmniE], **psoriasis** (sharply demarcated, silvery plaques) [^112AmniE], and **urticaria** (transient, evanescent wheals) [^115f7eS8]. Less common but critical mimics include **erythema migrans** (Lyme disease) [^1167S1me], **secondary syphilis** [^112Sd4J3], and **granuloma annulare** (non-pruritic, annular plaques) [^112Zg8Bc]. Evaluation should include history, exam, KOH prep, and targeted labs (RPR, Lyme serology) [^114sAcaM]; management is cause-specific, with antifungals for tinea, topical steroids for eczema/psoriasis, and antihistamines for urticaria [^112QYqQP].

---

## Less common but clinically significant mimics

- **Erythema migrans (Lyme disease)**: Expanding annular lesion with central clearing, often with systemic symptoms; confirm with Lyme serology [^1167S1me].

- **Secondary syphilis**: Annular or papulosquamous lesions, often generalized; confirm with RPR/FTA-ABS [^112Sd4J3].

- **Granuloma annulare**: Non-pruritic, annular plaques with raised borders; diagnosis is clinical or by biopsy [^114sAcaM].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **History**: Onset, duration, progression, exposures (pets, gardening, travel), systemic symptoms, medication use [^113F39rh].

- **Physical examination**: Lesion morphology, distribution, scaling, central clearing, mucosal involvement [^113F39rh].

- **Laboratory tests**: KOH prep for tinea; RPR for syphilis; Lyme serology if erythema migrans suspected [^112AmniE].

- **Biopsy**: For refractory or atypical cases to exclude psoriasis, eczema, or granuloma annulare [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Tinea corporis**: Topical antifungals (clotrimazole, terbinafine); systemic therapy (terbinafine, itraconazole) for extensive or refractory cases [^notfound].

- **Nummular eczema**: Topical corticosteroids, emollients, and antipruritics [^notfound].

- **Psoriasis**: Topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogs, and systemic agents for severe disease [^notfound].

- **Urticaria**: Antihistamines, avoidance of triggers, and corticosteroids for severe cases [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications

Untreated or misdiagnosed rashes can lead to **secondary bacterial infections**, chronic dermatitis, and significant psychosocial distress. Early, accurate diagnosis and appropriate therapy are critical to prevent these outcomes.

---

Well-demarcated itchy circular rashes have a broad differential, but **tinea corporis, nummular eczema, psoriasis, and urticaria** are most common [^112AmniE]. A focused history, exam, and targeted tests (KOH, RPR, Lyme serology) guide diagnosis; treatment is cause-specific, and early intervention prevents complications [^112AmniE].

### Annular polycyclic plaques on the chest and upper back [^112Zg8Bc]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 75-year-old man presented with a 20-year history of intermittent slow-growing annular plaques on his chest, back, and upper arms. No preceding viral illness or new medications were started before the appearance of the rash. Physical examination found multiple photodistributed pink, annular, polcyclic rings with central clearing covering the chest, upper back, and upper arms (Fig 1). A 4-mm punch biopsy was sent for routine histology. Histopathology found middermal interstitial infiltrate of histiocytes and giant cells without necrobiosis or mucin. (Fig 2).

Question 1. What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Tinea imbricata
B. Granuloma annulare (GA)
C. Actinic granuloma
D. Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum
E. Erythema marginatum
Answers:
A. Tinea imbricate – Incorrect. Tinea imbricata is a slowly progressive superficial fungal infection caused by the dermatophyte Trichophyton concentricum. Endemic to Asia and South America, it appears as pruritic concentric rings and a characteristic amount of scale.
B. GA – Incorrect. GA is a benign granulomatous inflammatory disorder of the dermis, the cause of which is unknown. It presents as asymptomatic, smooth papules or annular plaques with a predilection for the extremities. Although some consider actinic granuloma to be a subset of GA, the presence of necrobiosis and mucin deposition within palisaded histiocytes differentiate GA from actinic granuloma.
C. Actinic granuloma – Correct. Actinic granuloma, or annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma (AEGCG), is a rare benign granulomatous disorder with unclear etiology. Patients have multiple asymptomatic annular concentric plaques on sun-exposed areas with characteristic hypopigmented or atrophic center. Chronic ultraviolent radiation is thought to be a major risk factor, and for this reason, one can appreciate phagocytosis of elastic fibers and solar elastosis in the periphery of the specimen histologically. According to some sources, the term actinic granuloma is reserved for AEGCG lesions occurring in sun-exposed areas.
D. Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum – Incorrect. Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is a disorder of collagen alteration with granuloma formation thought to be associated with diabetes mellitus. It presents as symptomatic slowly enlarging shiny, red-brown plaques on the shins.
E. Erythema marginatum – Incorrect. Erythema marginatum is an annular erythema associated with rheumatic fever. Evanescent, figurate, polycyclic patches that spread centrifugally on the extremities and trunk appear on children, are self-limited, and only last a few days.

### Delayed diagnosis of a generalized annular rash following immunosuppression [^113fMcvR]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Skin scraping is a readily accessible and economical point-of-care diagnostic procedure allowing for diagnosis of superficial skin infections caused by parasites, fungi, or mites. In this case, mineral oil preparation revealed multiple ovoid Sarcoptes scabei and scybala (Fig 2), confirming the diagnosis of crusted scabies. potassium hydroxide preparation also revealed occasional fungal forms and hematoxylin & eosin of a contemporary biopsy identified foci of intracorneal pityrosporum.

Fig 2
Mineral oil preparation of skin scrapings revealed multiple S scabei ova and scybala. S scabei, Sarcoptes scabei.

Crusted scabies is a highly contagious scabies infestation that classically presents with thick, hyperkeratotic gray-white plaques teeming with mites that result in intractable pruritus. A high index of suspicion was warranted in this case given the extent of his rash, his debilitating itch, and his many ineffective immunosuppressive regimens.

Skin scrapings, a lynchpin diagnostic tool, have variable sensitivity (50% to 90%) in most cases of scabies but are more likely to yield mites from immunosuppressed patients or in crusted scabies. First-line treatment for classic scabies includes topical permethrin 5% cream and/or oral ivermectin 200 μg/kg. Permethrin is applied to the entire body from the neck down and left on for 8 to 14 hours, while ivermectin is administered as a single dose. Both permethrin and ivermectin therapy can be repeated after 1 to 2 weeks, and combination therapy is more effective than either agent alone. More aggressive therapy is required in crusted scabies. Permethrin is applied daily for 7 days and then twice weekly, with repeat doses of ivermectin on days 1, 2, 8, 9, and 15, with additional doses on days 22 and 29 for severe cases. Close personal contacts should also be examined and treated regardless of symptoms. HIV testing should be strongly considered in cases of crusted scabies.

The patient was advised to launder all clothing and bedding in hot water and high heat. Upadacitinib was discontinued, and he was treated as crusted scabies with repeated regimens of oral ivermectin and topical permethrin. In follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement in both his pruritus and rash.

### Unusual lesion on the vulva of a postmenopausal woman [^111efqBa]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

An 82-year-old Chinese woman presented to our multidisciplinary vulva clinic with a mildly itchy patch on her external genitalia of unknown duration. Notably, she was also undergoing vaginal laser rejuvenation at a private clinic. Cutaneous examination revealed a 2 × 2 cm well-demarcated, smooth, slightly hypopigmented-to-pinkish patch in the lower one-third of the left labium majus without any surface change or underlying induration (Fig 1). The rest of the cutaneous examination was normal. There was no regional lymphadenopathy. Per-speculum and per-vaginal examination were normal. A 4-mm skin punch biopsy was taken from the lesion (Figs 2 and 3, A and B).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Focal vitiligo
B. Postinflammatory hypopigmentation
C. Extra-mammary Paget disease (EMPD)
D. Dermatomycosis

Question 3: What is the next best step in management?
A. Expectant management only
B. Scheduled operative delivery
C. Topical steroids
D. Systemic steroids
E. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy

Answers:
A. Expectant management only – Incorrect. Moderate-severe cases, such as this case, require treatment with a high dose and a prolonged duration of systemic corticosteroids.
B. Scheduled operative delivery – Incorrect. Neonatal complications can be circumvented by pharmacological treatment; there is no indication of this necessitating operative delivery.
C. Topical steroids – Incorrect. Mild or localized disease defined as fewer than 10 blisters per day may be treated with oral and/or high potency topical corticosteroids and antihistamines adjunctively for itch relief. Moderate-severe cases, such as this case, require treatment with a high-dose, prolonged duration of systemic corticosteroids.
D. Systemic steroids – Correct. Treatment is imperative to suppress active disease associated with neonatal complications such as stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and neonatal pemphigoid gestationis.
E. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy – Incorrect. Complete remission of disease occurs in 83.8% of cases; however, recalcitrant cases to high dose steroids have been successfully treated with intravenous immunoglobulin during pregnancy and steroid-sparing immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, dapsone, and cyclosporine after delivery.

### Ringworm… [^114zr5wX]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Ringworm Ringworm is a common skin infection that is caused by a fungus. It's called "ringworm" because it can cause a circular rash that is usually red and itchy. Anyone can get ringworm. The fungi that cause this infection can live on skin, surfaces, and on household items such as clothing, towels, and bedding. Ringworm goes by many names. The medical terms are "tinea" or "dermatophytosis. " Other names for ringworm are based on its location on the body – for example, ringworm on the feet is also called "athlete's foot.

### Beyond the herald patch: exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^113jmgF9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Differential Diagnosis

Several conditions may mimic PR and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Below is a list of common differentials with brief descriptions of why they need to be ruled out:
Secondary syphilis: Often presents with a generalized rash, including on palms and soles, which can resemble PR but usually lacks a herald patch and has a different distribution, and lymphadenopathy is almost always found in secondary syphilis but usually never in PR. A rapid plasma reagin test is essential to rule out this condition.
Tinea corporis: Fungal infections can present with annular, scaly lesions that may mimic PR. A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation can confirm the diagnosis by revealing fungal elements.
Erythema multiforme: This condition can present with targetoid lesions and mucosal involvement, which is not typical of PR. A detailed history and clinical examination help distinguish between the two, as erythema multiforme is often related to herpes simplex infection.
Guttate psoriasis: Characterized by small, rain-drop pattern, scaly papules, guttate psoriasis may resemble PR but often has a history of sore throat and psoriasis, scales are thicker and silvery-white, and it lacks the typical herald patch.
Pityriasis lichenoides chronica: Chronic, scaly, red–brown papules that may resemble PR, but lesions persist longer, the herald patch is lacking, and papules are in different stages of evolution, one or more of them showing a darker center and have a more varied appearance. Histopathology is often needed for differentiation.
Pityriasis alba: Hypopigmented, scaly patches usually seen in children with a history of eczema. The absence of a herald patch and the chronic nature of the condition help differentiate it from PR.
Lichen planus: Pruritic, purple, polygonal papules often involving the wrists, lumbar spinal region, glans penis, and oral mucosa. The chronicity and distribution help differentiate it from PR.
Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus: Erythematous, annular, or polycyclic lesions that may mimic PR but often have photosensitivity and systemic symptoms, and histology shows epidermal atrophy and basal layer degeneration.
Nummular eczema: Coin-shaped, scaly patches that may resemble PR. The chronic, relapsing nature, intense pruritus, and shin and dorsal hand localizations, rarely found in PR, are key differentiators.
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: Early stages may resemble PR, as the initial patch does not respond to topical steroids mimicking PR. However, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma typically has a chronic course and does not respond to standard PR treatments. Multiple serial biopsies are essential for diagnosis.
Kaposi sarcoma: Can present with red, purple, or brown plaques and nodules. Unlike PR, Kaposi sarcoma is associated with immunosuppression and has a more progressive course.

### Eosinophilic annular erythema: a striking clinical presentation with potential systemic implications [^116nhTpx]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 49-year-old woman reported to our dermatology clinic with a chief complaint of truncal rash present for 2 weeks. Her medical history included asthma, seropositive rheumatoid arthritis treated with hydroxychloroquine, and hypereosinophilia (3400/μL) with negative flow cytometry evaluation 2 years before presentation. The patient stated that the rash began as a scablike lesion on her upper back that evolved into large, red circles covering the majority of her trunk. She denied any inciting event, including change in medications or arthropod bite or sting. She reported severe pruritus associated with the rash that was not relieved by 1% hydrocortisone cream. She also reported occasional cough, which she associated with her asthma. She denied having fevers, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, oral involvement, palmoplantar involvement, recent travel, or close contacts with similar findings.

On physical examination, annular and polycyclic erythematous, nonscaly plaques with indurated raised borders were noted bilaterally on the trunk (Figs 1 and 2). A 4-mm punch biopsy specimen from an advancing border on the anterior trunk was obtained for hematoxylin and eosin evaluation and revealed a dense dermal infiltrate with numerous eosinophils (Figs 3 and 4). No flame figures were present. A complete blood count with differential showed continued and increased peripheral eosinophilia (8670/μL). Two examinations for ova and parasites performed on the patient's stool were negative. The patient was also negative for hepatitis B and hepatitis C. On the basis of her clinical, laboratory, and histologic findings, the patient received a diagnosis of EAE. She was referred to cardiology for assessment of cardiac damage secondary to hypereosinophilia and to hematology and oncology for workup for underlying neoplastic entities that may lead to hypereosinophilia. She was started on 12.5 mg of methotrexate weekly and 5 mg of prednisone daily. She chose to discontinue hydroxychloroquine. One month later when she was seen by oncology her eosinophil count had decreased to 1240/μL and her rash had improved. The oncologic workup included screening for BCR-ABL, Janus kinase 2, calreticulin, and myeloproliferative leukemia protein mutations, which were all negative. Tryptase level was also evaluated and found to be normal. The results of the chest x-ray and echocardiogram ordered by cardiology were unremarkable.

### Occupational skin disease [^113WrcbU]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Contact dermatitis, the most common occupational skin disease, is characterized by clearly demarcated areas of rash at sites of exposure. The rash improves on removal of the offending agent. In allergic contact dermatitis, even minute exposures to antigenic substances can lead to a skin rash. Common sensitizing agents include nickel and members of the Rhus genus (e.g., poison ivy, poison oak). Severe skin irritants tend to cause immediate red blisters or burns, whereas weaker irritants produce eczematous skin changes over time. An occupational cause should be suspected when rash occurs in areas that are in contact with oil, grease, or other substances. Direct skin testing (patch or scratch) or radioallergosorbent testing may help to identify a specific trigger. Skin cancer can have an occupational link in workers with prolonged exposure to sunlight and certain chemicals, although it can take decades for lesions to develop. In workers with occupational skin disease, workplace changes and protective measures are important to prevent future exposure.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis
B. Erythrasma
C. Tinea corporis and cruris
D. Erythrokeratodermia variabilis (EKV)
E. Progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma (PSEK)

Answers:
A. Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis – Incorrect. This autosomal dominant condition is characterized by episodic/seasonal circinate, erythematous plaques with scaling, and centrifugal peeling. It predominantly involves palms and soles and may extend up the extremities. It rarely involves the trunk and face. Blisters occasionally occur in the center of new plaques.
B. Erythrasma – Incorrect. Erythrasma is caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum overgrowth in the stratum corneum. Well-defined scaly plaques involve intertriginous sites of the trunk and toes. Coral red fluorescence on Wood's lamp examination is classic and was negative in this patient's case.
C. Tinea corporis and cruris – Incorrect. Tinea corporis and cruris are dermatophyte infections of the trunk, extremities, and groin, respectively. Classic lesions have advancing, scaly border and central clearing. Hyphae are seen on histopathology and potassium hydroxide preparation (KOH prep).
D. EKV – Correct. EKV, an autosomal dominant disorder, presents with transient erythematous patches and stable hyperkeratosis. Individual erythematous lesions persist for minutes to hours, although they may last for days. Simultaneously or over time hyperkeratosis evolves. Sharply demarcated, yellow-brown to pink-brown plaques with figurate borders progressively develop on the limbs, buttocks, and trunk in nearly symmetrical distribution. Histopathology shows orthokeratosis, basket-weave hyperkeratosis, moderate-to-severe acanthosis with prominent granular layer, papillomatosis, and dilated elongated capillaries with minimal perivascular inflammation in the papillary dermis.
E. PSEK – Incorrect. PSEK begins during infancy or early childhood with fixed, sharply demarcated polycyclic hyperkeratotic plaques on erythematous base with fine scale or a rough, verrucous surface. They are symmetrically distributed on extremities, buttocks, face, and occasionally the trunk. Transient erythema and relative sparing of the face differentiate EKV from PSEK.

### The generalized rash: part II. diagnostic approach [^113F39rh]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Although it is important to begin the evaluation of generalized rash with an inclusive differential diagnosis, the possibilities must be narrowed down by taking a focused history and looking for key clinical features of the rash. Part I of this two-part article lists the common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rashes. In part II, the clinical features that help distinguish these rashes are described. These features include key elements of the history (e.g., travel, environmental exposures, personal or family history of atopy); characteristics of individual lesions, such as color, size, shape, and scale; areas of involvement and sparing, with particular attention to palms, soles, face, nails, sun-exposed areas, and extensor and flexor surfaces of extremities; pruritic or painful lesions; systemic symptoms, especially fever; and dermatologic signs, such as blanching, and the Koebner phenomenon.

### Shades of grey: what is paediatric psoriasiform dermatitis and what does it have in common with childhood psoriasis? [^113zpdRE]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

While the majority of children with a chronic itchy rash suffer from atopic dermatitis (AD) and other forms of dermatitis, psoriasis is in the differential diagnosis. Certain patterns such as guttate and napkin psoriasis are accepted as classic paediatric psoriasis (PP); however, there are many patients who do not fit these classic forms of PP nor fulfil the accepted criteria for AD. 'Psoriasiform dermatitis' (PD) is a term that has been used for these patients; however, it has not been formally defined. Identification of this group of patients, who although not having the typical clinical features of psoriasis, respond well to psoriasis-specific treatment, may assist treatment decisions for these patients.

Aim

To describe PD and compare it with typical PP.

Methods

Patients with classic PP (n = 109) were compared with a control group with AD (n = 449) and assessed for 21 clinical features associated with PP. Multivariate nonlinear regression analyses determined which features best separated the groups. Patients with dermatitis who demonstrated any of these 21 features (n = 43), which were used to diagnose PD, were then compared with the PP and AD groups. They were managed with psoriasis-specific treatment and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) was recorded.

Results

Of the 21 clinical features, 12 were found to clearly separate the classic PP and AD groups. Using the eight most significant (P < 0.0001) features, we found these two groups clearly separated at a score of 3 out of 8. Children with PD with ≥ 4 of these features responded well to treatment for psoriasis with a mean reduction of PASI by 85% at 6 weeks.

Conclusions

We found that patients with dermatitis who have ≥ 4 psoriasis-associated features may have a condition that has been previously alluded to but not defined in the literature, 'psoriasiform dermatitis'. Treatments usually reserved for patients with psoriasis appear to be effective in these patients.

5 CONCLUSION

To conclude, our data emphasizes the importance of differentiating between studies assessing the HE prevalence based on self‐reported HE versus self‐reported signs. For a specific set of diagnostic criteria for HE, we consider two signs or more combined with itch as a promising first step. Future steps should include expert panel discussions and a clinical diagnostic accuracy study with dermatologist‐diagnosed HE followed by external validation for determination of a final set of standardized diagnostic criteria for HE.

### Common skin rashes in children [^115Ko85Q]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Because childhood rashes may be difficult to differentiate by appearance alone, it is important to consider the entire clinical presentation to help make the appropriate diagnosis. Considerations include the appearance and location of the rash; the clinical course; and associated symptoms, such as pruritus or fever. A fever is likely to occur with roseola, erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), and scarlet fever. Pruritus sometimes occurs with atopic dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, erythema infectiosum, molluscum contagiosum, and tinea infection. The key feature of roseola is a rash presenting after resolution of a high fever, whereas the distinguishing features in pityriasis rosea are a herald patch and a bilateral and symmetric rash in a Christmas tree pattern. The rash associated with scarlet fever usually develops on the upper trunk, then spreads throughout the body, sparing the palms and soles. Impetigo is a superficial bacterial infection that most commonly affects the face and extremities of children. Erythema infectiosum is characterized by a viral prodrome followed by the "slapped cheek" facial rash. Flesh-colored or pearly white papules with central umbilication occur with molluscum contagiosum, a highly contagious viral infection that usually resolves without intervention. Tinea is a common fungal skin infection in children that affects the scalp, body, groin, feet, hands, or nails. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin condition that may present with a variety of skin changes.

### It looks like childhood eczema but is it? [^113is5MC]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

In childhood, the most common type of eczema/dermatitis is atopic dermatitis, which occurs in up to 25% of children world-wide. However, the diagnosis may sometimes be challenging and atopic dermatitis may resemble other types of dermatitis as well as other skin diseases such as psoriasis, infections, infestations and malignancies as well as metabolic, genetic and autoimmune disorders. This review will focus on how to recognize the most common types of dermatitis in children and adolescents and how to separate them from the most common differential diagnoses clinically and histologically.

### Annular lesions: diagnosis and treatment… [^114sAcaM]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

PITYRIASIS ROSEA Pityriasis rosea may first present as a herald patch: a single erythematous lesion with raised, scaly borders. Within two weeks, diffuse cutaneous involvement occurs with the eruption of multiple, round or ovoid, collarette lesions with scaly borders. 2 The rash most commonly presents on the trunk and follows skin folds in a "Christmas tree" distribution. 21 An influenza-like prodrome precedes the rash in 5% of patients. 22 Workup should include a rapid plasma reagin test to exclude syphilis, especially if the rash is present on the palms and soles in sexually active patients. Pityriasis rosea is self-limited and usually resolves within six to eight weeks. Topical corticosteroids and oral antihistamines can be used to alleviate pruritus. There is some evidence that acyclovir and phototherapy may be effective. 23–27 Lesions that last longer than three months warrant a biopsy to rule out alternative diagnoses. 28–30.

URTICARIA Urticaria is a condition that develops in response to the release of histamines, resulting in increased vascular permeability and massive edema in the superficial dermis. The edema creates well-circumscribed, ery thematous lesions with raised borders and blanched centers. 35 is the most common vasculitis in children. The rash presents as violaceous ecchymoses, petechiae, and palpable purpura. The diagnosis can be made clinically based on the presentation of skin lesions with arthritic symptoms and colicky abdominal pain. If clinical findings are inconclusive, a complete blood count, urinalysis, IgA levels, and skin and kidney biopsies should be ordered. Diagnostic biopsies will show prominent IgA deposition. 36 The disease typically resolves in four to six weeks.
37. SECONDARY SYPHILIS The rash of secondary syphilis is diffuse, symmetric, erythematous, and annulopapular.

SARCOIDOSIS The rash of sarcoidosis is characterized by erythematous, indurated plaques. GRANULOMA ANNULARE Granuloma annulare is characterized by firm, shiny papules that can be violaceous, erythematous, or brown or flesh-colored with central involution.

### A pruritic annular and polycyclic eruption [^116cY63N]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case description

A 57-year-old male presented with 3 weeks of an intensely pruritic rash without associated systemic symptoms or preceding illness. He denied new medication exposures, apart from mushroom extract and taurine supplements he started several weeks prior. He had no improvement with topical or oral antifungals or topical corticosteroids. Physical examination demonstrated annular and serpiginous polycyclic plaques with an urticarial outer rim, violaceous inner border, and central golden hyperpigmented patches, over the mons pubis, buttocks, axillae, and inguinal folds (Figs 1 and 2). His dermatologic history was notable for 30 years of pruritic rashes that typically resolved within 24 hours, diagnosed as chronic idiopathic urticaria and managed with cetirizine.

Fig 1

He was advised to stop taking his supplements. Histopathology showed focal spongiosis, papillary dermal edema, and superficial and mid-dermal perivascular, periadnexal, and interstitial lymphocytic inflammation with prominent eosinophils (Fig 3), consistent with a diagnosis of eosinophilic annular erythema (EAE). Direct immunofluorescence studies and fungal cultures were negative. Laboratory evaluation was notable for hemoglobin A1c of 5.9%, negative human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C viral serologies, and normal mushroom immunoglobulin E. C-reactive protein, antinuclear antibodies, complements, rheumatoid factor, cryoglobulins, thyroid-stimulating hormone, complete blood count with differential, liver function tests, basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, and prostate-specific antigen were normal.

Fig 3
Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections from skin biopsy of right buttock at (A) 10× and (B) 20× magnification.

Following diagnosis of EAE, he started hydroxychloroquine 400 milligrams daily and a 4-week prednisone taper and resumed supplement use. He had complete clearance after 3 weeks of treatment. At this time, he self-discontinued therapy, and several days later, his rash recurred. He then resumed daily hydroxychloroquine. He has continued hydroxychloroquine monotherapy for 8 months with sustained clinical remission of skin disease.

Question: Which of the following is most strongly associated with this cutaneous finding?
A. Low serum complements
B. Immunosuppression
C. Monoclonal gammopathy
D. Recent group A Strep infection
E. Hematologic or solid organ malignancy

Correct answer: E.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^1111cq9a]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Contact dermatitis (CD) diagnostic approach — Contact dermatitis is a common skin disorder seen by allergists and dermatologists and can present with a spectrum of morphologic cutaneous reactions; the initial approach to clinical diagnosis of CD is to distinguish between allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) and irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), and the inflammatory lesions of CD may result from either ACD or ICD mechanisms with factors including the agent, the patient, the type and degree of exposure, and the environment; irritant contact dermatitis is usually the result of nonimmunologic, direct tissue reaction and must be clearly differentiated from ACD; the diagnosis of ACD is suspected from the clinical presentation of the rash, which then must be supported by a history of exposure to a putative agent and subsequently confirmed by patch testing whenever this is possible; the skin site of the dermatitis is important in the diagnosis of ACD because the area of predominant involvement and the regional distribution of the lesions often reflect the area of contact with the allergen; epicutaneously applied patch tests are the standardized diagnostic procedures to confirm ACD, and patch tests are indicated in any patient with a chronic, pruritic, eczematous, or lichenoid dermatitis if underlying or secondary ACD is suspected.

### Disseminated Lyme disease with a herpetiform center [^116Fhxvy]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A woman in her 30s with no significant medical history presented to her primary care provider with a small red "bump" and surrounding swelling on her back. She also noted having a rash in her left axilla with an ipsilateral swollen lymph node. Due to concern for cellulitis, she was started on cephalexin. Her symptoms progressed the next day despite 3 doses of cephalexin, with larger, warm, and more painful bumps on her back with increased swelling, prompting her to visit the emergency department. Additional symptoms included weeping and crusting of the bumps with the worst pain in the center of the targetoid lesion. Exposure history revealed that she had been hiking in the Northeast region a few days before symptom onset, but she denied seeing any ticks. She also denied exposure to poison ivy, chemical agents, or other irritants. She had never had a similar rash in the past but did tend to have exuberant reactions to bug bites. Additional systemic symptoms included mild cough, bilateral hip pain, and headache. Review of symptoms was otherwise negative.

Physical examination revealed normal vital signs and a 2-cm soft, tender, mobile lymph node in the left anterior axillary fold with no other lymphadenopathy. Skin examination showed a large, circular, well-demarcated erythematous plaque on the back with a central cluster of herpetiform vesicles, bullae, and purple necrotic puncta (Fig 1), as well as erythematous patches on the anterior aspect of the chest and left lateral aspect of the breast. Initial laboratory evaluation revealed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (25 mm/hr) and C-reactive protein (174 mg/L), while the complete blood count with differential was unremarkable. Bacterial wound cultures and blood cultures showed no growth. Herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and Ehrlichia / Anaplasma polymerase chain reactions were negative. There was no evidence of malaria or babesiosis on Giemsa blood smears. Lyme immunoglobulin M and G antibodies were not detected.

PHOTO QUIZ

A 32-year-old female with a past medical history notable for eczema and systemic lupus erythematosus presented to an outpatient dermatologist's office with a hypopigmented, painless large patch on her back. Upon physical exam, the patch comprised finely scaled, disrupted superficial epithelium with an erythematous, irregular border. The patient revealed that she had been prescribed a topical steroid cream several weeks ago; however, her skin had not improved. A superficial scraping of the erythematous border of the patch was sent to the microbiology laboratory for evaluation. A KOH calcofluor white stain showed clusters of round, budding yeast, some with broad collarettes or "shoulders" and short rectangular hyphal forms (Fig. 1). What is the most likely diagnosis?

Annular skin eruptions encompass a wide array of different cutaneous afflictions that are a common occurrence in the practice of dermatology. Annular lesions present as oval or circular shaped patches and plaques with central clearing. The term annular has been employed in the vernacular since the 16th century; yet, it does not seem to have appearedin the dermatologic literature until the early 20th century. Such lesions are described and even illustrated but with different phraseology. We describe the history of annular terminology and its use in various afflictions of the skin.

### Diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^111TDkng]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

COVID‐19 is now known to have varied clinical manifestations and to target multiple organs, including the skin.COVID‐19 rashes may present in many forms and at different stages of the disease.

In our app‐based study, 8.8% of patients who were positive for COVID‐19 via swab tests also reported skin rashes (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.42–1.97). Body rashes were more frequent than acral lesions (6.8% vs. 3.1%), although their predictive value was similar (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.37–1.99 vs. 1.74, 95% CI 1.33–2.28, respectively). Interestingly, the OR for both types of rash was greater than for fever (OR 1.48), a widely used criterion to suggest testing. Reports of cases with both body rashes and acral lesions were rare (1.1%), suggesting different pathogenesis, with the former caused by immunological reactions to the virus, and the latter more likely explained by delayed small thrombotic occlusions or damage to vessel walls.

### Annular urticarial lesions [^111QenHZ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Annular urticarial configurations are often associated with acute and chronic urticaria. Such lesions may be short-lived, migratory, transient, pruritic, and resolving with no residual evidence, making the diagnosis of urticaria an obvious one. Annular urticarial lesions can be the presenting signs of various cutaneous and systemic diseases. The differentiation of urticarial lesions may be made by considering the duration of an individual lesion longer than 24 hours, with burning and pain sensation in the lesions or lack of pruritus; skin marks such as postinflammatory pigmentation or purpura after resolution of the lesions; associated scaling or vehiculation in the lesions; systemic symptoms such as arthralgia, fever or fatigue; and several abnormal laboratory findings. The main differential diagnoses of annular urticarial lesions include urticarial vasculitis, autoinflammatory syndromes, hypersensitivity reactions, and connective tissue diseases.

Clinical vignette

A 48-year-old black woman with a history of infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma, now in remission, presented with a 6-month history of enlarging, pruritic, violaceous, annular plaques composed of concentric rings on the right flank, back, and right thigh (Fig 1). The rash initially started on her right flank and worsened during several months despite application of triamcinolone 0.1% cream daily. A punch biopsy was taken from the thigh (Fig 2).

Question 1: Which of the following is the best diagnosis?
A. Erythema gyratum repens
B. Superficial erythema annulare centrifugum
C. Tinea pseudoimbricata
D. Metastatic breast carcinoma
E. Nummular dermatitis

Answers:
A. Erythema gyratum repens — Incorrect. Erythema gyratum repens is a paraneoplastic figurate erythema typically associated with breast, lung, and esophageal cancer that presents within 1 year of a cancer diagnosis. Tinea pseudoimbricata and erythema gyratum repens can have similar morphology, with pruritic, annular, erythematous plaques composed of concentric rings with a wood-grain appearance and fine scale. Although histopathology is nonspecific, there are no fungal elements as observed in tinea pseudoimbricata. Erythema gyratum repens expands more rapidly than tinea pseudoimbricata and does not worsen with steroids.
B. Superficial erythema annulare centrifugum — Incorrect. Superficial erythema annulare centrifugum is a figurate erythema characterized by erythematous annular expanding plaques with trailing scale, not concentric rings. It is associated with dermatophyte infections, drugs, and malignancies. Histopathology is nonspecific, but tight "coat sleeving" of lymphocytes around superficial vessels is suggestive.
C. Tinea pseudoimbricata — Correct. Tinea pseudoimbricata is a dermatophytosis with the same clinical appearance of multiple concentric rings as tinea imbricata. Unlike tinea imbricata, which is caused by Trichophyton concentricum, tinea pseudoimbricata is caused by T tonsurans and other dermatophytes. Tinea pseudoimbricata is thought to be a form of tinea incognito associated with long-term topical steroid use. Histopathology is usually nonspecific but may show hyphae in the stratum corneum.
D. Metastatic breast carcinoma — Incorrect. Cutaneous metastases usually present suddenly as multiple firm, dark, painless papulonodules, located on the chest or involving mastectomy scars.
E. Nummular dermatitis — Incorrect. Nummular dermatitis classically presents as coin-shaped eczematous plaques on the extremities. It would not present with concentric rings.

### A photodistributed rash in a patient on apixaban [^112r2bNM]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case vignette

A 63-year-old female with recent diagnosis of atrial fibrillation presented with a 1 month history of pruritic rash. Apixaban was started 6 weeks prior to presentation after cardiac ablation. She was using triamcinolone ointment without improvement. Exam showed photodistributed erythematous coalescing scaly papules on the vertex scalp, shoulders, and upper arms, with sharp demarcation along shirt line (Fig 1). Shave biopsy showed interface dermatitis, dermal mucin, and superficial dermal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate (Figs 2 and 3). Lab testing was notable for anti-histone antibody 3.7U (strong positive), elevated liver enzymes, normal complete blood count, and negative anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-SSA, and SSB antibodies.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis for the patient's skin condition?
A. Psoriasis
B. Discoid lupus erythematosus
C. Dermatomyositis
D. Jessner's lymphocytic infiltrate of the skin
E. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE)

Answers:
A. Psoriasis – Incorrect. Psoriasis typically presents with well-defined erythematous plaques covered with silvery scales, commonly involving extensor surfaces like elbows and knees. It typically exhibits parakeratosis, acanthosis, and Munro microabscesses.
B. Discoid lupus erythematosus – Incorrect. Discoid lupus erythematosus presents with discoid lesions, often with adherent scales, and can cause scarring. It typically lacks the widespread photodistribution and histology findings including superficial and deep perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate.
C. Dermatomyositis – Incorrect. Dermatomyositis can have a similar photodistribution and erythematous papules, but it is often associated with proximal muscle weakness, heliotrope rash, and Gottron's papules. Histopathologic findings however can include interface dermatitis and dermal mucin deposition.
D. Jessner's lymphocytic infiltrate of the skin – Incorrect. Jessner's lymphocytic infiltrate of the skin can present photodistributed papular rash with histology showing dermal lymphocytic infiltrate. However, dermal mucin and interface dermatitis along with a strong anti-histone antibody positivity make another diagnosis more likely.
E. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) – Correct. SCLE typically presents with photodistributed erythematous scaly papules and specific histopathologic features including interface dermatitis, mucin deposition, and superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate.

### The rash that becomes purpuric, petechial, hemorrhagic, or ecchymotic [^113D181r]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhagic rashes are observed in a wide variety of conditions, ranging from harmless to life-threatening. This review offers a stepwise approach, which helps limit the possible differential diagnoses based on the clinical manifestations and the clinical picture. The most common and most important conditions, including infectious, coagulation and embolic disorders, vasculitides, and vasculopathies, are briefly reviewed focusing on morphology. Dermatologists often need to distinguish among infectious, reactive, or autoimmune etiologies of the rash and determine if the condition is dangerous or even life-threatening in order to make the right decision. Dermatologic expertise provides vital input in the diagnosis and care of complex interdisciplinary patients, such as those with sepsis, purpura fulminans, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

### The rash that presents as a vesiculobullous eruption [^114qTLAM]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Various infections and autoimmune and reactive skin conditions can present with blisters of varying sizes. Some of these disorders are seen in everyday practice, whereas others are rarely encountered. In many cases, the clinical picture is so typical that the diagnosis is easy and obvious; nevertheless, the significant clinical overlap between many of these diseases can cause frustration in both unexperienced and expert clinicians. We present the most typical clinical clues and offer simplified algorithms to the clinical diagnosis of skin conditions with vesicles and bullae. We focus on several aspects, when assessing a patient with blisters on the skin: age of onset, a history of comorbidities and medications intake, the general condition of the patient, and most importantly, the distribution, number, size, morphology, and evolution of the blisters, the characteristics of the peribullous skin, and the presence of mucosal involvement. Emphasis is put on differentiating between potentially life-threatening blistering eruptions and more benign self-limiting conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

### Diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^114r3d7g]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Papular rashes are the most common, while urticaria is short‐lived

Photographs of rashes were shared by 2328 surveyees, and 260 photographs were randomly selected to be assessed by four experienced dermatologists, who divided them into five common categories: papular, urticarial, vasculitic body, livedo reticularis and acral lesions. We discarded 52 photographs (20%) rejected by at least one dermatologist because the image was blurred, or the area photographed was too small to evaluate, or the person could be de‐anonymized. Out of the 208 good‐quality photographs, 30 were judged as not attributable to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (e.g. acne, shingles, molluscum contagiosum, pompholyx eczema, perioral dermatitis, impetigo or tinea; 14.4%), and 18 were discarded due to a disagreement in diagnosis between dermatologists (8.7%), resulting in 160 photographs used in the subsequent analyses. Notably, when asked whether a photograph showed a COVID‐19‐related skin rash, the four dermatologists agreed 82.2% of the time, and three out of four dermatologists agreed 95.7% of the time. The three most common presentations were papular rashes (including erythematopapular and erythematovesicular types, 41.2%), urticaria (30.0%) and acral lesions (23.1%). The overall levels of agreement for acral lesions and urticaria were 96.6% and 80.9%, respectively. Papular rashes showed the lowest agreement (76.4%), possibly because some the papular rashes may be more subtle and more difficult to photograph. Examples of COVID‐19 cutaneous manifestation are shown in Figure 2 and Figures S6–S8 (see Supporting Information). A large website, created in collaboration with the British Association of Dermatologists and including 400 manually curated high‐quality photographs, is available at.

### Diaper dermatitis: clinical characteristics and differential diagnosis [^117Jx1mf]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

A diverse group of diseases can cause skin conditions in the diaper area including those which are directly caused by diapers or the diaper environment, some which are not directly due to, but are worsened by, the wearing of diapers, and those which are independent of the presence of the diaper or its resulting environment. Many of these conditions are limited to this area of the skin, but others extend to skin outside this area, and some are signs of systemic disease. We review many of the important causes of eruptions in the diaper area and emphasize key points in the differential diagnosis.

### Diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^117LR5pL]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fourthly, some of these cutaneous manifestations could have been caused by adverse reactions to drugs used to treat SARS‐CoV‐2 and/or for other purposes. Due to the size of our study and to the nature of the app used to collect our data, we could not collect a full history for drug usage, either at the time of data collection or retrospectively. However, we expect the numbers of community‐based users on drugs that could have also caused a rash to be very low compared with the number of rashes observed in hospitalized patients, and therefore drugs are unlikely to have been a major alternate cause of rashes. Similarly, we could not collect information on pre‐existing skin diseases, and could not investigate whether they influenced the rate of the reported rashes.

In summary, this study strongly supports the inclusion of skin rashes in the list of suspicious COVID‐19 symptoms. Although they are less prevalent than fever, they are more specific and last longer, and can be easily spotted by patients. Importantly from the survey reported in this study, it was the only presentation in one‐fifth of the patients diagnosed with COVID‐19.

Increased awareness from the public and healthcare professionals regarding COVID‐19 skin changes will allow more efficient detection of infection and contact tracing.

### Follicular eruption as a cutaneous manifestation in COVID-19 [^112rRzSo]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 50-year-old man presented to our dermatology clinic with itchy skin rash. The rash began 5 days after systemic symptoms appeared such as mild fever and mild dyspnoea. The rashes were a characteristic of follicular eruption, which started on his stomach and spread all over his body. After a thorough evaluation, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 and was started on COVID-19 regimens. Skin lesions disappeared on the ninth day of treatment. Our findings contribute to the growing awareness of dermatological manifestations in patients with COVID-19.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111z9oYr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous anthrax — clinical features, diagnostics, and treatment evidence: After an incubation period of 1–12 days, pruritus begins at the entry site followed by a papule, vesicles develop on top of the papule, and finally a painless ulcer with a black scab; the eschar generally separates and sloughs after 12–14 days. Cultures of untreated lesions are positive > 80% of the time; white blood cell counts are generally normal and blood cultures are almost always negative. For specimen collection, vesicles should be unroofed and 2 dry swabs soaked in fluid, and at later stages 2 moist swabs rotated in the ulcer base or beneath the eschar's edge. No randomized, controlled trials of therapy exist; penicillin is effective and will "sterilize" most lesions within a few hours to 3 days without accelerating healing, with value primarily in reducing mortality from as high as 20% to zero. The optimal duration of treatment is uncertain, but 7–10 days appears adequate in naturally acquired cases, whereas Sixty days of treatment is recommended when associated with bioterrorism; until susceptibilities are available, ciprofloxacin is rational empiric therapy for bioterrorism-related cases, and other fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, or moxifloxacin are also likely to be effective.

### Identifying the best predictive diagnostic criteria for psoriasis in children [^114eysEo]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In children, psoriasis can be challenging to diagnose. Difficulties arise from differences in the clinical presentation compared with adults.

Objectives

To test the diagnostic accuracy of previously agreed consensus criteria and to develop a shortlist of the best predictive diagnostic criteria for childhood psoriasis.

Methods

A case-control diagnostic accuracy study in 12 UK dermatology departments (2017–2019) assessed 18 clinical criteria using blinded trained investigators. Children (< 18years) with dermatologist-diagnosed psoriasis (cases, N = 170) or a different scaly inflammatory rash (controls, N = 160) were recruited. The best predictive criteria were identified using backward logistic regression, and internal validation was conducted using bootstrapping.

Results

The sensitivity of the consensus-agreed criteria and consensus scoring algorithm was 84.6%, the specificity was 65.1% and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.75. The seven diagnostic criteria that performed best were: (i) scale and erythema in the scalp involving the hairline, (ii) scaly erythema inside the external auditory meatus, (iii) persistent well-demarcated erythematous rash anywhere on the body, (iv) persistent erythema in the umbilicus, (v) scaly erythematous plaques on the extensor surfaces of the elbows and/or knees, (vi) well-demarcated erythematous rash in the napkin area involving the crural fold and (vii) family history of psoriasis. The sensitivity of the best predictive model was 76.8%, with specificity 72.7% and AUC 0.84. The c-statistic optimism-adjusted shrinkage factor was 0.012.

Conclusions

This study provides examination- and history-based data on the clinical features of psoriasis in children and proposes seven diagnostic criteria with good discriminatory ability in secondary-care patients. External validation is now needed.

### The generalized rash: part I. differential diagnosis [^112QSrxp]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Physicians often have difficulty diagnosing a generalized rash because many different conditions produce similar rashes, and a single condition can result in different rashes with varied appearances. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is critically important to make treatment decisions, especially when mortality or significant morbidity can occur without prompt intervention. When a specific diagnosis is not immediately apparent, it is important to generate an inclusive differential diagnosis to guide diagnostic strategy and initial treatment. In part I of this two-part article, tables listing common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rash are presented to help generate an inclusive differential diagnosis. The tables describe the key clinical features and recommended tests to help accurately diagnose generalized rashes. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the primary care physician must decide whether to observe and treat empirically, perform further diagnostic testing, or refer the patient to a dermatologist. This decision depends on the likelihood of a serious disorder and the patient's response to treatment.

### Dermatological manifestations during dengue, chikungunya, and zika infections [^116voZPu]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Arboviral infections caused by Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya viruses continue to pose a significant global health threat, particularly in endemic regions. This review is timely because of the increasing prevalence of these infections, driven by factors such as urbanization and climate change. Dermatological manifestations of these viruses are crucial for early diagnosis, especially given the overlap in symptoms, which can complicate differential diagnosis.

Recent Findings

Recent studies emphasize the importance of mucocutaneous symptoms in diagnosing arboviral infections. In Dengue, distinctive rashes like the 'islands of white in a sea of red' and hemorrhagic skin manifestations have been key diagnostic features. Zika is marked by a pruritic maculopapular rash and nonpurulent conjunctivitis, whereas Chikungunya often results in persistent rashes, desquamation, and hyperpigmentation, particularly on the face. Emerging research highlights the skin's role as both a primary infection site and an immune mediator in these viral diseases, offering new insights into their pathophysiology and potential therapeutic targets.

Summary

The unique dermatological profiles of Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya are critical for guiding clinical diagnosis and treatment, especially in resource-limited settings. Understanding these cutaneous manifestations can improve early recognition, particularly in differentiating between these viruses in co-endemic areas. Future research may uncover novel therapeutic strategies by focusing on the interaction between these viruses and the skin's immune responses.

### Rash decisions: an approach to dangerous rashes based on morphology [^11413nH8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Rash is a common complaint in the emergency department. Many causes of rash are benign; however, some patients may have a life-threatening diagnosis.

Objective

This review will present an algorithmic approach to rashes, focusing on life-threatening causes of rash in each category.

Discussion

Rash is common, with a wide range of etiologies. The differential is broad, consisting of many conditions that are self-resolving. However, several conditions associated with rash are life threatening. Several keys can be utilized to rapidly diagnose and manage these deadly rashes. Thorough history and physical examination, followed by consideration of red flags, are essential. This review focuses on four broad categories based on visual and tactile characteristic patterns of rashes: petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. Rashes in each morphologic group will be further categorized based on clinical features such as the presence or absence of fever and distribution of skin lesions.

Conclusions

Rashes can be divided into petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. After this differentiation, the presence of fever and systemic signs of illness should be assessed. Through the breakdown of rashes into these classes, emergency providers can ensure deadly conditions are considered.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^1136S5Qb]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis differential diagnosis and reassessment — AD should be differentiated from other red, scaly skin conditions, and it is often difficult to separate AD from seborrheic dermatitis in infancy, with overlap possible in this age group. AD usually spares the groin and axillary regions, while seborrheic dermatitis affects these areas and tends not to be pruritic. Particularly if not responding to therapy, the diagnosis of AD should be re-reviewed and other disorders considered, including more serious nutritional, metabolic, and immunologic conditions in children and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in adults. The original UK criteria cannot be applied to very young children, although revisions to include infants have since been proposed, and allergic contact dermatitis may be both an alternative diagnosis to AD and/or an exacerbator of AD in some individuals.

### The rash that presents as target lesions [^113JbXQJ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

We have explored the rash that appears as target lesions, with the central and dominant diseases belonging to the Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis group. After presenting the clinical patterns of an individual target lesion and classifying them into different types of lesions, the contribution has been organized with groups characterized by such specific findings according to the type of lesion: flat or raised, typical or atypical, presence or absence of fever, presence or absence of mucosal ulcerations, presence or absence of arthralgias, and/or internal organ involvement. Other specific features, such as histologic appearance, immunofluorescence findings, and laboratory changes, are considered. We provide clinicians with an algorithmic, systematic, and logical approach to diagnose the condition of the patients who present with targetoid lesions, and enable them to differentiate between those with serious systemic and life-threatening diseases from others with ordinary skin ailments.

### A distinctive erythematous macular exanthem of the adult: a new entity? [^115T5qBA]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Delineating a new exanthem is difficult. Atypical or modified types of already known conditions can easily be mistaken for new entities.

Objectives

To report 29 cases of an acute, self-limiting exanthem never described before.

Methods

Clinical description, serology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and other laboratory investigations.

Results

The eruption starts with bright pink-red slightly oedematous macules symmetrically arranged on the trunk. The lesions tend to coalesce, and spread to the limbs on which they may acquire a marginated annular appearance. The lesions invariably spare the face (including oral mucous membranes), palms and soles. The eruption is pruritic and lasts 20–30 days, clearing spontaneously. The disease has a predilection for men aged 17–56 years and occurs mostly between spring and summer. Serological tests, PCR assays and investigations for bacteria, parasites or viruses were consistently negative.

Conclusions

The clinical picture does not recall any of the classical exanthems or their atypical forms.

### Is the hip prosthesis responsible for this rash? [^114ascVq]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) to a topical product
B. Allergic dermatitis related to a metal implant
C. Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD)
D. Superficial fungal infection
E. Psoriasis vulgaris
Answers:
A. ACD to a topical product – Incorrect. ACD classically presents as a pruritic, well-demarcated erythematous patch, linear streak, or plaque with vesicles corresponding to the area of allergen contact. There was no history suggesting a topical contacted this site.
B. Allergic dermatitis related to a metal implant – Incorrect. Systemic contact dermatitis is the term used to describe a cutaneous reaction resulting from a systemic allergen exposure. Between 1% and 5% of patients receiving orthopedic metal implants have a cutaneous reaction caused by metal sensitivity, often overlying the prosthesis. Rates of metal sensitivity are higher in failed implants. Other diagnoses must be excluded before accepting this as the presumptive diagnosis.
C. ICD – Incorrect. ICD is the most common type of contact dermatitis and is the result of localized chemical irritation that is toxic to the skin. Clinically, it may mimic ACD but is usually accompanied by complaints of burning and stinging rather than pruritus. This lesion's defined border would be unusual in ICD.
D. Superficial fungal infection – Correct. Tinea corporis is a superficial dermatophyte infection involving the skin on the trunk or extremities and is typically limited to the stratum corneum. Classically, dermatophyte infections spread outward causing an annular lesion with central clearing and a moderate amount of scale as seen here. Diagnosis was confirmed by KOH preparation of scale scrapings, which showed hyphal elements.
E. Psoriasis vulgaris – Incorrect. Psoriasis is characterized by sharply demarcated plaques with thick white, micaceous scaling. It classically involves the scalp and extensor surfaces of adult patients. Koebnerization can initiate psoriasis, but this plaque is distant from the incision.

### A painful rash on a white woman [^114gT6rK]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Based on the patient's history and photograph (Fig 1), what is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Morbilliform drug eruption
B. Irritant contact dermatitis
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy
D. Erysipelas
E. Herpes zoster

Answers:
A. Morbilliform drug eruption – Incorrect. Morbilliform drug eruption is typically bilateral and symmetric upon presentation. It is commonly caused by recently started antibiotics but may be caused by initiation of multiple classes of drugs. Onset is typically within 4 weeks of beginning a new medication, making this answer less likely, as this patient had been on the same chemotherapy regimen for greater than 6 months.
B. Irritant contact dermatitis – Incorrect. The clinical manifestations of irritant contact dermatitis range from mild skin dryness and erythema to acute or chronic eczematous dermatitis and even skin necrosis. This patient did not report exposure to chemical or physical irritants.
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy – Correct. Cutaneous metastases can display a wide morphologic spectrum of appearance in various locations, which is why in a patient with history of recent malignancy, a new rash located on the trunk should raise suspicion for a cutaneous metastasis. See Fig 2 for biopsy results of this lesion. This variable clinical morphology includes nodules, papules, plaques, tumors, and ulcers. Lung cancer commonly metastasizes to the head, neck, and trunk. Cutaneous metastases occur in 0.7% to 0.9% of all patients with cancer.
D. Erysipelas – Incorrect. Erysipelas manifests as areas of skin erythema, edema, and warmth and develops as a result of bacterial entry via breaches in the skin barrier. This rash is sometimes accompanied by symptoms including a high fever of sudden onset with chills, and most cases affect the lower leg, ankle, or foot. This patient's rash slowly progressed over 4 weeks, unlike erysipelas, which develops more acutely and involves desquamation of the skin 5 to 10 days after onset.
E. Herpes zoster – Incorrect. Although this patient fits the age group that is commonly affected with herpes zoster, this patient's rash does not fit clinically. The rash starts as erythematous papules, typically in a single dermatome or several contiguous dermatomes and evolves into grouped vesicles or bullae. This patient's rash does somewhat follow along contiguous dermatomes, but does not consist of papules or vesicles as you would expect with herpes zoster.

### Annular lesions in an HIV-positive male [^112Sd4J3]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Granuloma annulare
B. Cutaneous sarcoidosis
C. Secondary syphilis
D. Annular urticaria
E. Cutaneous plasmacytoma

Answers:
A. Granuloma annulare – Incorrect. Granuloma annulare shows a dermal palisading histiocytic infiltrate surrounding areas of collagenolysis with increased mucin deposition.
B. Cutaneous sarcoidosis – Incorrect. Sarcoidosis shows discrete collections of epithelioid histiocytes with sparse lymphocytic infiltrate (so-called "naked" granulomas).
C. Secondary syphilis – Correct. Secondary syphilis is the great inflammatory mimicker. It can manifest as different inflammatory patterns including psoriasiform, lichenoid, granulomatous, and superficial/deep perivascular dermatitides with an increased plasmacytic infiltrate. Some patients can present with localized or diffuse alopecia, clinically and histologically resembling alopecia areata. Clinically, our patient presented with pruritic annular plaques. A 10-year retrospective study (n = 307) found 25.8% of patients depicted atypical cutaneous presentations, most commonly in the secondary stage. Annular, pruritic, and scaly plaques with a psoriasiform appearance were the most common atypical presentations of secondary syphilis.
D. Annular urticaria – Incorrect. While annular urticaria may be considered due to the itching and stinging sensation upon onset and the edematous morphology of the lesions, annular urticaria usually presents with transient edematous plaques that resolve within 24–48 hours. In addition, central crusting is not typical of urticaria, and histopathology findings more typically show superficial dermal edema, rather than plasma cells and granulomatous features.
E. Cutaneous plasmacytoma – Incorrect. Clinically, cutaneous plasmacytoma more often presents as firm, red, or violaceous nodules or plaques. Many patients with cutaneous plasmacytoma also experience bone pain.

### Pruritic rash in a man with seminoma [^115bhbZL]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the best initial treatment of BIFE in a patient without evidence of lung toxicity?
A. Permanent discontinuation of bleomycin
B. Antihistamines and topical steroids
C. Oral corticosteroids
D. Topical ketoconazole
E. Avoid sun exposure

Answers:
A. Permanent discontinuation of bleomycin – Incorrect. It is important for dermatologists to recognize that bleomycin-induced cutaneous toxicities can frequently be treated symptomatically without interrupting chemotherapy. An attempt to treat the patient symptomatically is warranted before interrupting chemotherapy. If the skin symptoms severely worsen or do not improve with antihistamines and topical steroids, discontinuation of bleomycin may be considered.
B. Antihistamines and topical steroids – Correct. BIFE is typically self-limited and resolves upon cessation of bleomycin. Oral antihistamines and topical steroids are found improve the itching associated with BIFE. Hyperpigmentation may persist after therapy and occurs in 10% to 20% of patients on bleomycin. If the skin symptoms severely worsen or do not improve with antihistamines and topical steroids, discontinuation of bleomycin may be considered.
C. Oral corticosteroids – Incorrect. Local corticosteroids should be considered before systemic corticosteroids.
D. Topical ketoconazole – Incorrect. Given the patient's history, fungal skin infection is unlikely. There is no indication for ketoconazole, an antifungal.
E. Avoid sun exposure – Incorrect. Limiting sun exposure can be beneficial to all patients. However, avoidance of sun exposure alone is not the best treatment option.

### Arcuate, annular, and polycyclic inflammatory and infectious lesions [^117XLM4y]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Common shapes encountered in dermatologic diseases include linear, nummular, annular, polycyclic, and arciform. The last three have a relatively restricted differential, which must be entirely explored. It is not uncommon for a single disease to present in annular, arciform or polycyclic configurations; moreover, the lesions may evolve from being arciform to annular and then become polycyclic. Regardless, recognizing the arrangement of the defect will undoubtedly help in making a diagnosis and guiding subsequent management. We explore diseases that often present in annular, arciform, and/or polycyclic forms.

### Pemphigoid gestationis [^113pM5E3]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

A 39-year-old woman in the 39th week of her fifth pregnancy presented with severe itching. In recent weeks she had developed an increasingly itchy rash on her trunk and arms. Upon examination we observed multiple erythematous plaques and vesicles. Histological examinations of two skin biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of pemphigoid gestationis. Because the patient's complaints worsened we decided to deliver the baby, and as it was in transverse lie this was by caesarean section. A healthy son without rash was born. Although pemphigoid gestationis occurs in only 1 in 50,000 pregnancies, it is very important to be aware of this condition when a pregnant woman has itching. Not recognising pemphigoid gestationis may lead to inadequate maternal treatment and possible preterm birth and neonatal pemphigoid gestationis.

### Trichoscopy of the eyelashes in tinea blepharo-ciliaris shows the full spectrum of tinea capitis features [^112QYqQP]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 6-year-old boy presented with an 8-week history of an itchy rash of the left eye that was treated with topical antibiotics and corticosteroids, without improvement. No history of close contact with pets was reported. Clinical examination revealed the presence of a well-demarcated, roundish, ringlike, erythematous and desquamative patch involving the eyelid and the periocular area (Fig 1). On close observation, the upper eyelashes appeared broken at different levels. The result for dermoscopy of the eyelid was unspecific, showing the presence of erythema and fine scaling. Trichoscopic examination of the eyelashes revealed diffuse scaling, broken hairs, bent hairs, and Morse code hairs (Fig 2). The right eye was otherwise normal.

Fig 2
Trichoscopic examination of the eyelashes showing scaling, broken hairs (white arrows), bent hairs (yellow arrows), and Morse code hairs (blue arrows).

Based on unilaterality, ringlike appearance, resistance to previous treatment, and dermoscopic aspects, a fungal infection was suspected, and microscopic examination was positive for Microsporum canis infection. The final diagnosis was tinea blepharociliaris. The patient was treated with oral griseofulvin 150 mg/d, with complete clearing after 4 weeks.

### Persistent annular dermatosis: unraveling the cause of a 2-year rash [^113cTPYA]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Annular sarcoidosis – Incorrect. Sarcoidosis can also demonstrate annular plaques with a violaceous or brownish hue. Histology reveals noncaseating granulomas, often with systemic involvement.
B. Annular psoriasis – Incorrect. Annular psoriasis typically has well-defined, raised, plaques with silvery scale and central clearing, while the most well-described variant of lichen planus appears as flat-topped, purple, polygonal papules or plaques.
C. Annular lichen planus – Correct. Annular lichen planus is a rare morphological subtype of lichen planus, characterized by ring-shaped, violaceous, or hyperpigmented plaques with slightly raised nonscaly borders. It commonly affects the male genitalia, groin, axillae, and extremities. The etiology remains unclear but is thought to involve genetic predisposition, stress, skin trauma, and infections. Lichen planus has also been associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, with studies suggesting a higher prevalence of HCV in patients with cutaneous lichen planus, particularly in endemic regions. Annular lesions are typically isolated, and histopathological examination reveals classic features of lichen planus in the active edge of the lesion. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, but histopathology can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment includes topical corticosteroids, systemic immunosuppressants, and phototherapy. Prognosis is variable, with some cases resolving spontaneously and others persisting or recurring.
D. Mycosis fungoides – Incorrect. Mycosis fungoides is the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which evolves slowly with patch and plaque formation with/without erythroderma, with histology showing abnormal T-cell infiltration.
E. Tinea corporis – Incorrect. Tinea corporis presents with scaly ring-shaped lesions and may be confirmed by potassium hydroxide prep showing fungal hyphae.

### Scaly erythematous papules and plaques in a teenager [^114GYJ2b]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

A 13-year-old healthy Hispanic boy presented to the dermatology clinic with a 10-month history of a pruritic rash on his trunk and extremities. He was previously treated with fluocinolone 0.01% oil, triamcinolone 0.1% cream, and hydroxyzine 10 mg with no relief. The patient denied pain or a similar rash in the past. He had no relevant family or social history. Physical examination demonstrated non-blanching, scaly erythematous papules and plaques on his legs, right arm, and trunk (Figs 1 and 2). A punch biopsy from lower portion of his right leg was performed (Fig 3).

Question 1: Based on the clinical presentation, history, and histologic findings, what is your diagnosis?
A. Nummular eczema
B. Lichen planus
C. Erythema elevatum diutinum (EED)
D. Eczematid-like purpura of Doucas and Kapetanakis
E. Contact dermatitis

Answers:
A. Nummular eczema–Incorrect. Although clinically consistent with nummular eczema, biopsy revealed considerable perivascular dermal infiltrates and extravasated red blood cells, which are absent in eczema.
B. Lichen planus–Incorrect. While lichen planus can present with pruritic violaceous papules and plaques on the extremities, the histologic findings of the disease were absent in this patient's biopsy.
C. EED–Incorrect. EED is a necrotizing, small-vessel vasculitis characterized by erythematous plaques on the dorsal aspects of the hands or extensor surfaces. Histology would demonstrate a leukocytoclastic vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis of the dermal vessel wall.
D. Eczematid-like purpura of Doucas and Kapetanakis–Correct. Eczematid-like purpura of Doucas and Kapetanakis often presents as an eczematous, non-blanching, red-brown purpuric or petechial eruption in the lower extremities. Epidermal spongiosis with perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and extravasation of red blood cells are seen histologically. Therefore, the clinical and histologic picture of our patient best reflect eczematid-like purpura of Doucas and Kapetanakis.
E. Contact dermatitis–Incorrect. Contact dermatitis could be a plausible diagnosis for our patient, as it presents with a well-demarcated erythematous papule or plaque confined to the site of contact with an allergen or irritant. However, the histologic features of contact dermatitis were absent in this patient.

### The rash that becomes an erythroderma [^117TVTNh]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Erythroderma is a dermatologic emergency with potentially serious consequences. Several diseases with different etiologies characteristically appear as erythroderma. Depending on the age groups, congenital ichthyosiform disorders, infections, preexisting dermatoses, drug eruptions, and internal malignancies commonly present with, or progress to, erythroderma. The course, prognosis, and management strategies also vary depending on the cause of erythroderma; hence, an accurate diagnosis is essential in minimizing associated morbidity and mortality. The generalized erythema and scaling often obscure the classic clinical features of the underlying skin diseases, posing a diagnostic challenge to dermatologists. Awareness and elicitation of subtle signs and clinical manifestations are crucial. A step-wise approach ensures completeness of clinical evaluation and avoids missing any relevant clinical data. The initial clinical presentation, cutaneous examination findings, and systemic clues reveal important information regarding the diagnosis, course, and prognosis of erythroderma. The age at onset, symptomatology, duration of illness, initial lesions, initial site of onset, clinical course, family history, types of scales, changes in cutaneous integuments and systemic clues will assist in delineating the nature of underlying disease.

### Annular lesions: diagnosis and treatment [^112AmniE]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Annular lesions can present in a variety of diseases. Knowledge of the physical appearance and history of presentation of these skin findings can help in the diagnosis. A pruritic, annular, erythematous patch that grows centrifugally should prompt evaluation for tinea corporis. Tinea corporis may be diagnosed through potassium hydroxide examination of scrapings. Recognizing erythema migrans is important in making the diagnosis of Lyme disease so that antibiotics can be initiated promptly. Plaque psoriasis generally presents with sharply demarcated, erythematous silver plaques. Erythema multiforme, which is due to a hypersensitivity reaction, presents with annular, raised lesions with central clearing. Lichen planus characteristically appears as planar, purple, polygonal, pruritic papules and plaques. Nummular eczema presents as a rash composed of coin-shaped papulovesicular erythematous lesions. Treatment is aimed at reducing skin dryness. Pityriasis rosea presents with multiple erythematous lesions with raised, scaly borders, and is generally self-limited. Urticaria results from the release of histamines and appears as well-circumscribed, erythematous lesions with raised borders and blanched centers. Annular lesions occur less commonly in persons with fixed drug eruptions, leprosy, immunoglobulin A vasculitis, secondary syphilis, sarcoidosis, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and granuloma annulare.

### American Academy of Dermatology guidelines: awareness of comorbidities associated with atopic dermatitis in adults [^114QKksG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Urticaria — associations with atopic dermatitis (AD) include acute and chronic forms, with epidemiologic signals of strong linkage: AD is associated with food allergy, which commonly manifests as acute urticaria; AD is also associated with chronic idiopathic urticaria, with a Danish study showing an association between chronic urticaria and AD (OR, 9.92; 95%CI, 6.43–15.32) and a Danish cohort finding chronic urticaria predicted subsequent AD (hazard ratio [HR], 3.1; 95% CI, 2.0–4.8); the text notes this association may worsen dermatitis via the itch-scratch cycle.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of EGFR inhibitor-associated dermatologic toxicities [^112Tmyf3]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Medium credibility.

EGFR inhibitor–associated dermatologic toxicities — background and burden: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors (EGFRI) are used for treating lung, pancreatic, breast, head and neck, and colorectal cancers, and may be used as first-line through third-line treatments alone or in combination. Common dermatologic side effects include papulopustular (acneiform) rash, hair changes, radiation dermatitis enhancement, pruritus, mucositis, xerosis/fissures, and paronychia, with incidences ranging from 36% for mucositis to 80% for papulopustular (acneiform) rash. In cancer patients receiving systemic therapy, itchy skin or rash increase the number of visits to the outpatient clinic by 36% and 72%, respectively, underscoring the need to maximize supportive measures.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112X4A5b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Impetigo and ecthyma — clinical features describe that impetigo can be either bullous or nonbullous, with bullous impetigo caused by strains of S. aureus producing a toxin that cleaves the dermal-epidermal junction to form fragile, thin-roofed vesiculopustules that may rupture into crusted, erythematous erosions; nonbullous impetigo may be due to β-hemolytic streptococci or S. aureus and begins as erythematous papules that evolve into vesicles and pustules forming honey-colored crusts. Ecthyma is a deeper infection than impetigo caused by S. aureus and/or streptococci, with lesions that rupture into circular, erythematous ulcers with adherent crusts and surrounding edema, and unlike impetigo, ecthyma heals with scarring.

Case

A 73-year-old man with a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and idiopathic small fiber neuropathy presented to our dermatology clinic after 5 months of a progressive, generalized, and pruritic rash (Fig 1). He first developed a rash 2 weeks after a course amoxicillin-clavulanate and was thus prescribed a 5-day course of oral prednisone for a presumed drug exanthem. His rash worsened despite prednisone, prompting him to present to a local emergency department where he was prescribed a 3-week prednisone taper. His rash worsened, and he was referred to a local dermatologist. A biopsy revealed a spongiotic dermatitis. He was diagnosed with atopic dermatitis and initiated on dupilumab as well as 1 week of empiric itraconazole for a potential superficial fungal infection. His rash worsened on dupilumab, after which he was transitioned to upadacitinib for presumed atopic dermatitis. Upon presentation to our dermatology clinic, physical examination was notable for diffuse, deeply erythematous, well-demarcated annular plaques with variable scale and occasional pustules. His scrotum was covered in thick grey scale. Examination did not reveal onychomycosis or tinea pedis.

### Cutaneous eruption associated with (group C) bacteremia [^116KW56N]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Case report

A 48-year-old male with a history of Down syndrome and gout presented to a dermatology clinic with a 2-day history of a new rash. The rash first appeared on his buttocks and spread to his thighs. It was pruritic and nontender. The only new medication exposure was a short course of indomethacin 3 weeks before presentation. The patient denied new exposures, travel, or new contactants. A review of his medical records indicated he had a productive cough for a week that prompted his primary care physician to obtain a chest x-ray, the findings from which were normal. Physical examination showed symmetric, well-demarcated, and erythematous plaques on his buttocks and thighs bilaterally. Drug reaction was less likely given the lack of truncal involvement. There was no pain or rubor suggestive of cellulitis. A diagnosis of contact dermatitis was favored given the bilateral and symmetric distribution and pruritus. He was instructed to use emollients and triamcinolone 0.1% ointment, as well as hydroxyzine for the itch.

### Differential diagnosis of round or discoid lesions [^111Z96DE]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Dermatologists are called on to diagnose a variety of skin conditions in diverse age groups. Dermatologic diagnosis, based on identification of a primary lesion, uses morphologic clues to categorize the pathologic process causing the eruption. In addition, distribution and grouping of lesions helps support a specific diagnosis. Dermatologists consciously or unconsciously use pattern recognition to arrive at their differential diagnosis based on clinical experience and their having previously viewed similarly appearing skin lesions in lectures, texts, and journals. Round and discoid patches and plaques are extremely common in the clinical practice of dermatology. This contribution reviews the dermatologic conditions that present as round or discoid lesions and presents an approach to diagnosis.

### Summertime and the patient is itchy [^114w5QYU]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 21-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 36h history of a painful, itchy maculopapular rash and associated vesicles to his arms and neck. He had no history of exposure to new chemicals or hygiene products and no significant medical history. His physiological observations were normal and systemic examination was unremarkable. On close inspection the rash was noted to be present only on areas of skin exposed while wearing a polo shirt. On further questioning it transpired that he had been gardening 12h prior to the development of the rash. A diagnosis of phytophotodermatitis was made. The patient was discharged with chlorphenamine, simple analgesia and the advice to wear a long-sleeved t-shirt and sunscreen when gardening in future. Phytophotodermatitis is a cutaneous reaction caused by contact with light-sensitising compounds found in plants and exposure to ultraviolet A radiation. It is self-limiting and can be managed symptomatically.

### Diffuse plate-like sheets of desquamation [^113fVSmX]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 1: Based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Acquired ichthyosis
B. Pityriasis rotunda
C. Eczema craquelé (asteatotic eczema)
D. Progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma (PSEK)
E. Atopic dermatitis

Answers:
A. Acquired ichthyosis – Correct. This is a drug-induced acquired ichthyosis secondary to ponatinib therapy. Acquired ichthyosis is a rare condition with onset in adulthood and can be associated with underlying malignancies, infections, inflammatory disorders, or medications. Ichthyotic scaling commonly presents on the trunks, limbs, and scalp. Scales can be white, brown, or gray and vary in size from 1 mm to 1 cm. It has been reported that third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as ponatinib, are associated with ichthyosiform eruptions. Histopathology, which is nonspecific, may show compact ortho- and/or parakeratotic hyperkeratosis and inflammatory infiltrate in the papillary dermis. The granular layer may be absent (similar to ichthyosis vulgaris), normal, or thickened.
B. Pityriasis rotunda – Incorrect. Pityriasis rotunda is characterized by hypopigmented or hyperpigmened, well-demarcated, scaly, round patches or thick plaques, often 10 cm in size. Microscopic features resemble ichthyosis vulgaris with a diminished granular cell layer along with hyperkeratosis and no parakeratosis.
C. Eczema craquelé (asteatotic eczema) – Incorrect. Xerosis is the predisposing factor for eczema craquelé and has an indolent course over years. Eczema craquelé is characterized by pruritic skin with fine scale and interconnected fissures.
D. PSEK – Incorrect. Also known as Darier-Gottron syndrome, PSEK presents during infancy, extending into puberty but rarely into adulthood. PSEK is characterized by symmetric, well-demarcated, fixed, erythematous, hyperkeratotic plaques involving the cheeks, the extensor surfaces of the upper and lower extremities, and the buttocks. Histopathology demonstrates acanthosis, basket-weave and patchy parakeratotic hyperkeratosis, and a prominent granular layer.
E. Atopic dermatitis – Incorrect. Atopic dermatitis is a relapsing, pruritic condition commonly affecting infants and children. It is characterized by scaly, erythematous papules and plaques involving flexural areas with lichenification in chronic cases.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^112SfK1i]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) diagnosis — essential features must be present and include pruritus; eczema (acute, subacute, chronic) with typical morphology and age-specific patterns; and chronic or relapsing history, with patterns including facial, neck, and extensor involvement in infants and children, current or previous flexural lesions in any age group, and sparing of the groin and axillary regions. Important features seen in most cases, adding support to the diagnosis, include early age of onset, atopy with personal and/or family history or immunoglobulin E reactivity, and xerosis. Associated features help to suggest the diagnosis but are too nonspecific to be used for defining or detecting AD for research and epidemiologic studies, and include atypical vascular responses (facial pallor, white dermographism, delayed blanch response), keratosis pilaris/pityriasis alba/hyperlinear palms/ichthyosis, ocular/periorbital changes, other regional findings (perioral changes/periauricular lesions), and perifollicular accentuation/lichenification/prurigo lesions. Exclusionary conditions note that a diagnosis of AD depends on excluding scabies, seborrheic dermatitis, contact dermatitis (irritant or allergic), ichthyoses, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, psoriasis, photosensitivity dermatoses, immune deficiency diseases, and erythroderma of other causes.

### Heat urticaria: a revision of published cases with an update on classification and management [^114c2kDM]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Heat urticaria (HU) is a rare type of physical inducible urticaria, characterized by itchy erythema and well-demarcated weals appearing soon after heat exposure. Most cases occur in female patients aged 20–45 years. Both localized and generalized forms exist, depending on the limitation of the reaction to the skin area directly exposed to the physical stimulus or the involvement of distant sites, respectively. In most cases, HU is an immediate reaction, but delayed forms (mostly familial) have been described. HU is a long-lasting disease with overall duration at diagnosis of approximately 2 years. In about half of cases it is associated with systemic symptoms such as weakness, wheezing, headache, flushing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, tachycardia, even dyspnoea or syncope. The main differential diagnosis includes cholinergic urticaria, exercise-induced anaphylaxis and solar urticaria. The diagnosis of HU is established by provocation testing, which is also helpful to evaluate the critical temperature threshold. The mean threshold temperature is about 44 °C. A heat desensitization programme can be an effective treatment. Nonsedating H1 antihistamines administered at licensed doses are the mainstay of symptomatic therapy in nearly 60% of patients, but full symptom relief is achieved in only a minority of them. Omalizumab has proven effective in recent case reports.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^115f7eS8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinical features distinguishing chronic urticaria from urticarial vasculitis and angioedema — CU lesions are typically edematous pink or red wheals of variable size and shape with surrounding erythema and are generally pruritic, and individual urticarial lesions usually fade within 24 to 48 hours. A painful or burning dysesthesia is not characteristic of CU and suggests the presence of cutaneous vasculitis, in which lesions are palpable and usually nonblanching, spanning several days or more and often followed by residual hyperpigmented changes; diagnosis of urticarial vasculitis should be confirmed by a biopsy demonstrating leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Because urticarial vasculitic lesions might sometimes be evanescent, lasting less than 24 hours, this condition cannot be completely excluded based on a history of lesions spanning less than 24 hours. Angioedema typically appears as nonpitting, brawny, nonpitting edema, typically without well-defined margins and without erythema.

### Ustekinumab-induced fixed drug eruption [^112UdHF5]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 36-year-old healthy man with no known drug allergies presented to the dermatology clinic with a 2-year history of a generalized body rash. In accordance with clinical and histopathologic features (parakeratosis, acanthosis, psoriasiform hyperplasia, and absent granular layer), he received a diagnosis of moderate chronic plaque psoriasis without psoriatic arthritis, and ustekinumab was prescribed. He received a 90-mg subcutaneous initial dose, another similar dose 4 weeks later, and another 90 mg after 12 weeks.

Two days after the second injection of ustekinumab, the patient developed a single, itchy, and painful lesion on his right calf. The lesion recurred in the same site 2 days after the third injection. There was no history of any associated systematic symptoms nor the use of any concomitant medications. On skin examination, a solitary, well-demarcated, rounded, erythematous plaque with a dusky purple center surrounded by an erythematous rim was noticed over the right calf (Fig 1). Nail and mucous membrane examination results were normal.

Fig 1

### Contact dermatitis: a practice parameter-update 2015 [^111L8kB2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) — distinguishing features are outlined across common conditions: Irritant contact dermatitis shows that healing begins promptly on withdrawal of the offending agent and patch testing negative. Atopic dermatitis features a personal or family history of atopy with flexural areas in adolescence and adults. Seborrheic dermatitis involves distribution in areas with sebaceous glands and a distinctive morphology of dull, yellowish-red, sharply demarcated lesions covered with greasy-looking scales. Dyshidrotic eczema presents with small (1–2 mm) vesicles on a nonerythematous base affecting palms/soles/fingers, and it persists for 2–3 weeks before resolving. These differentiating findings help separate these entities from ACD.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^111XkRTg]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Contact dermatitis (CD) — epidemiology and clinical presentation indicate that CD is common, with 5.7 million physician visits per year, and the acute clinical expression is characterized by redness, edema, papules, vesiculation, weeping, crusting, and pruritus. The severity ranges from a mild, short-lived condition to a severe, persistent, but rarely life-threatening, disease; thinner skin sites such as the eyelids, ear lobes, and genital areas are most vulnerable, whereas the thicker palms and soles are more resistant. Exposure time to allergenic contactants varies from being brief (eg, poison ivy) to protracted (eg, nickel in jewelry or work chemicals).

### Dusky pink annular plaques with a vesicular border [^114bffwk]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 1: Based on clinical (Fig 1) and histologic findings (Fig 2), which leading diagnosis should be considered in this patient?
A. Atopic eruption of pregnancy
B. Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP)
C. Bullous pemphigoid
D. Pemphigoid gestationis (PG)
E. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT)

Answers:
A. Atopic eruption of pregnancy – Incorrect. Atopic eruption of pregnancy presents as an eczematous rash occurring in early pregnancy, it does not develop into vesicles or bullae. In addition, the histologic exam would show negative immunofluorescence and nonspecific hematoxylin and eosin findings.
B. PUPPP – Incorrect. Also referred to as Polymorphic Eruption of Pregnancy, in the prebullous stage, clinical differentiation between PG is difficult. However, PUPPP commonly develops during the third trimester as pruritic, erythematous papules and plaques in the abdominal striae distensae and spares the umbilical region.
C. Bullous pemphigoid – Incorrect. PG is a variant of bullous pemphigoid, the latter of which typically presents in elderly patients over 70 years of age.
D. PG – Correct. PG presents as pruritic papules and plaques that develop into a vesiculobullous eruption in multigravida women during the second or third trimester with pruritic, erythematous plaques on the upper arms, abdomen, trunk, and thighs. Differentials for PG include other pruritic dermatoses such as PUPPP in the prebullous stage and atopic eruption of pregnancy. Diagnosis is confirmed by histopathology showing subepidermal vesicles, epidermal spongiosis, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates eosinophilic preponderance. Direct immunofluorescence of the basement membrane shows linear deposition of C3 and IgG with a greater preponderance of C3.
E. PCT – Incorrect. PCT presents with tense bulla or vesicles that often are accompanied by crusting, erosion, milia formation in sun-exposed distributions. Scarring in PCT leads to hyperpigmented or atrophic scars. Pregnancy increases patient susceptibility to PCT, however, it clinically presents as vesicles or bullae on sun-exposed areas.

### Dermatitis herpetiformis: an update on diagnosis and management [^112guj9N]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Presentation, Sex, and Age at Diagnosis

Clinical Presentation

The clinical picture of DH consists of an itchy rash occurring in the favored sites of the elbows, the extensor surfaces of the forearms, the knees, and the buttocks, including the sacral area (Fig. 1). The rash is polymorphic, consisting of small blisters, papules, and erythema; however, because of the intense itch and associated scratching, erosions, crusts, and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation often dominate the clinical picture. The localization of the rash is so typical for DH that the itchy rash in the predominant skin sites usually raises suspicion of DH. However, the severity of the rash varies between individuals, and a more intense rash may also affect other sites, such as the scalp, face, and upper back. The clinical picture and severity of the DH rash seem to have remained unchanged over recent decades without becoming milder or otherwise nonclassical as seen in celiac disease. The itch in DH is very prominent; in half of the patients, it is a constant finding and correlates with common sleep disturbances. Triggering factors such as taking indomethacin and inadvertent dietary iodide ingestion are known to exacerbate the rash and itching. A few cases of localized DH on the face or elsewhere on the body have been described. Acral purpura is a rare finding in DH and may be seen either with the typical rash or as the only symptom of the disease, especially in children with DH.

Fig. 1
Dermatitis herpetiformis lesions on the a elbows and b knees: observe symmetrical distribution and erosions due to scratching. c A close-up view of a small blister. d Direct immunofluorescence finding of uninvolved skin showing pathognomonic granular immunoglobulin A deposits at the dermo-epidermal junction

The differential diagnosis of DH includes various itchy, excoriated, and blistering skin diseases. Linear IgA disease and sometimes bullous pemphigoid may clinically resemble DH, but immunofluorescence examination easily differentiates these disorders. Other itchy skin diseases, such as scabies, atopic and nummular dermatitis, lichen planus, and urticaria may also resemble DH, but the most obvious difference is the symmetrical distribution of the rash on the favored sites in DH.
