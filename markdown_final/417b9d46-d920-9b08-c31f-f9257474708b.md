## Question

Causes of nausea

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of nausea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame the problem clinically by duration and acuity. Then, I should categorize etiologies by organ system and mechanism. Next, I will prioritize common and high-yield causes, and explicitly flag emergencies. After that, I will integrate special populations and context-specific nuances. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic approach and highlight key takeaways, ensuring each assertion is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framing, because misclassifying acuity leads to missed emergencies and overtesting. Acute nausea and vomiting typically lasts up to 7 days and, in the absence of alarm features, is often managed symptomatically without extensive workup, whereas chronic symptoms persist beyond 4 weeks and warrant a broader differential and targeted evaluation, including medication review, metabolic assessment, and consideration of structural or functional gastrointestinal disease [^bf3d1737] [^63f2fc15].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should organize etiologies by system to avoid gaps. The major buckets are gastrointestinal, central nervous system, vestibular, endocrine and metabolic, medication and toxin-related, psychiatric, infectious, and postsurgical or iatrogenic causes, with pregnancy-related etiologies considered separately given their frequency and unique management principles [^bf3d1737] [^0a8752eb].

> I will now examine gastrointestinal causes, which are the most common in both acute and chronic presentations. Acute gastroenteritis and foodborne illness are frequent, often self-limited, and typically present with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; incubation periods and associated foods can guide suspicion, though many foods can harbor diverse pathogens, so I need to be cautious about attributing causality solely to a suspected food item [^4c805c90]. Chronic nausea often reflects delayed gastric emptying or functional disorders; gastroparesis is a key consideration, particularly in diabetes, and cyclic vomiting syndrome is a recognized entity with episodic patterns and often migraine associations, warranting a clinical diagnosis after excluding other causes [^5b06a0f9] [^817e1e69]. But wait, what if symptoms suggest obstruction? I should confirm that mechanical obstruction is actively excluded in chronic or severe cases because it changes management entirely [^afdba3a2].

> Next, I should review central nervous system etiologies, where red flags matter. Increased intracranial pressure from mass effect, hemorrhage, or infection typically produces nausea with other neurologic signs and mandates urgent imaging; migraine commonly includes nausea and may even present predominantly with nausea, so I need to ask about photophobia, phonophobia, and headache phenotypes [^bf3d1737] [^bc408cf5]. Let me verify a potential pitfall: area postrema syndrome from neuromyelitis optica can cause intractable nausea and vomiting and is frequently misattributed to gastrointestinal causes; recognizing this pattern prevents delays in appropriate immunotherapy [^14297a16].

> I need to check vestibular and motion-related causes because they are often overlooked. Motion sickness and vestibular disorders can drive prominent nausea; antihistamines and anticholinergics are reasonable symptomatic options, and I should consider vestibular testing when dizziness, vertigo, or gait instability accompany chronic nausea [^95227c26] [^fcb9cb1a]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to cite a 2002 paper for motion sickness prevalence, but I should double-check; the AAFP 2024 guidance supports antihistamines and anticholinergics for motion sickness, which is the more current and authoritative source for practice [^95227c26].

> Let me consider endocrine and metabolic causes next. In women of childbearing age, pregnancy is the most common endocrine cause and must be tested early; nausea and vomiting of pregnancy affects 50–80% of pregnancies, and hyperemesis gravidarum represents the severe end of the spectrum with substantial morbidity and economic burden, so I should not minimize its impact or delay treatment escalation when indicated [^bf3d1737] [^82926efd]. I should confirm that other endocrine and metabolic contributors are screened in chronic cases, including thyroid dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, and electrolyte disturbances, as these are explicitly recommended in high-quality guidelines for chronic nausea and vomiting evaluation [^c7e0f003].

> I will now examine medication and toxin-related causes, since they are common and modifiable. Opioids, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and numerous other drugs can precipitate nausea via central mechanisms; opioid-induced nausea reflects chemoreceptor trigger zone stimulation and may respond to 5-HT3 antagonists or dopamine antagonists, while chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting has robust, risk-stratified prophylaxis guidelines that I should follow to optimize outcomes [^cc56aa21] [^8c78d814]. Hold on, I should verify that a medication review is prioritized in chronic cases; contemporary consensus guidelines emphasize reviewing current medications early in the workup to exclude pharmacologic causes [^77ad7b87].

> Psychiatric and functional etiologies deserve careful attention, especially when organic disease is excluded. Anxiety and depression are strongly associated with nausea in community samples, and functional nausea is a recognized entity in pediatrics and adults; I need to ensure I screen for these without stigmatizing the patient, as they are real, treatable drivers of symptoms [^7b16e79d] [^85264083]. Let me reconsider the strength of evidence; while much of the functional literature is observational, the clinical yield of identifying and treating these contributors is meaningful in practice [^notfound].

> Infectious causes beyond gastroenteritis can present with nausea, so I should keep a broad differential when the story fits. Viral syndromes, hepatitis, and systemic infections can all feature nausea, and in immunocompromised hosts, opportunistic infections may be culprits; aligning the tempo of illness with exposure risks and systemic features helps prioritize testing and empiric management [^bf3d1737] [^0a8752eb].

> Postsurgical and iatrogenic nausea is common and often predictable. Postoperative nausea and vomiting affects roughly 30% of patients overall and up to 80% in high-risk cohorts; risk stratification and multimodal prophylaxis with agents from different classes reduce incidence and improve recovery, so I should incorporate consensus-based PONV prevention into preoperative planning [^f1216b17] [^2de9a93c]. I should double-check that patient-specific risk factors like female sex, nonsmoking status, history of motion sickness or prior PONV, and certain surgeries elevate risk and guide prophylaxis intensity [^8655dc5f].

> Now, I should integrate special populations and context-specific nuances. In pregnancy, I must distinguish physiologic nausea and vomiting of pregnancy from hyperemesis gravidarum and from other causes; early treatment reduces progression and complications, and I should follow RCOG and ACOG guidance for diagnosis, severity assessment, and escalation pathways, including recognizing increased risks of postpartum psychiatric sequelae after hyperemesis [^75566780] [^e58055cf]. In advanced cancer, nausea is often multifactorial and frequently due to constipation, opioids, bowel obstruction, or metabolic derangements; an etiology-based, mechanism-targeted antiemetic strategy is recommended, with a low threshold for parenteral therapy and combination regimens when refractory [^ad5d6bb5] [^cde0c5ae]. In chronic kidney disease, evidence for antiemetic management is limited, so I should prioritize correcting reversible contributors and coordinate with dietitians for nutritional support [^98320fb5].

> Next, I should review a practical diagnostic approach, but I need to ensure I do not overtest low-risk cases. For acute nausea without alarm features, supportive care and selective testing are appropriate; alarm features such as dehydration, acute abdomen, neurologic signs, or severe electrolyte disturbances warrant expedited evaluation and often imaging or hospitalization [^bf3d1737] [^ebdba6e2]. For chronic nausea, I should confirm a structured sequence: medication review, basic labs including metabolic panel and TSH, pregnancy testing when relevant, and targeted testing for suspected gastroparesis, obstruction, or CNS disease; endoscopy is reserved for alarm features or risk factors for malignancy, and gastric emptying studies are indicated when gastroparesis is suspected [^77ad7b87] [^afdba3a2] [^69417ba3].

> Let me synthesize the key takeaways, and I should double-check that each aligns with the evidence. Nausea arises from diverse mechanisms spanning peripheral gastrointestinal drivers, central vestibular and CNS pathways, endocrine and metabolic disturbances, pharmacologic triggers, and psychosocial factors; no single pathway explains all cases, which is why a careful history, judicious testing, and mechanism-aligned therapy are essential [^bf3d1737] [^77df296b]. Common causes include acute gastroenteritis, medication effects, pregnancy, migraine, gastroparesis, and functional or psychiatric disorders, while emergencies such as obstruction, increased intracranial pressure, or metabolic crises must be recognized early [^bf3d1737] [^0a8752eb]. Management is cause-specific: treat infections supportively, remove offending drugs when feasible, use guideline-directed antiemetics for CINV and PONV, and employ multimodal, mechanism-targeted strategies for chronic or multifactorial cases, including nutritional rehabilitation when indicated [^8c78d814] [^2de9a93c] [^b3db71be].

Nausea has a broad differential, but **most cases are due to gastrointestinal, medication-related, or vestibular causes** [^bf3d1737]. Common gastrointestinal causes include gastroenteritis, gastroparesis, and obstruction [^bf3d1737]; medications such as opioids, chemotherapy, and antibiotics are frequent triggers [^cc56aa21] [^8c78d814]; and vestibular disorders or motion sickness are classic drivers [^95227c26]. Other important etiologies include pregnancy, migraine, metabolic disturbances, and CNS disease [^bf3d1737] [^0a8752eb]. A focused history and exam, with selective testing, usually reveal the cause; **alarm features warrant urgent evaluation** [^bf3d1737] [^ebdba6e2].

---

## Gastrointestinal causes

Gastrointestinal disorders are the **most common cause of nausea** [^notfound]:

- **Gastroenteritis**: Viral or bacterial infections (e.g. norovirus, Salmonella) often cause acute nausea with vomiting and diarrhea [^4c805c90].

- **Gastroparesis**: Delayed gastric emptying, often diabetic or idiopathic, causes chronic nausea and early satiety [^5b06a0f9].

- **Obstruction**: Mechanical blockage (e.g. adhesions, tumors, volvulus) produces nausea with distension and vomiting [^afdba3a2].

- **Functional disorders**: Functional dyspepsia and IBS can present with chronic nausea [^notfound].

---

## Medication-induced nausea

Many drugs cause nausea via **central or peripheral mechanisms**:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Opioids | Morphine, oxycodone | CRTZ stimulation; delayed gastric emptying [^cc56aa21] |
| Chemotherapy | Cisplatin, doxorubicin | Serotonin release; CRTZ activation [^8c78d814] |
| Antibiotics | Erythromycin, metronidazole | GI irritation; dysgeusia |
| SSRIs/SNRIs | Fluoxetine, venlafaxine | Serotonin modulation |
| NSAIDs | Ibuprofen, naproxen | Gastric mucosal injury |

---

## Vestibular and neurologic causes

Vestibular and neurologic disorders commonly cause nausea, often with **vertigo or headache**:

- **Motion sickness**: Vestibular conflict from movement [^95227c26].

- **Meniere's disease**: Vertigo with nausea from endolymphatic hydrops.

- **Migraine**: Nausea accompanies attacks in ~90% of cases [^41f838e1].

- **Increased intracranial pressure**: Mass effect or hemorrhage causing nausea and vomiting [^0a8752eb].

---

## Pregnancy-related nausea

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) affects 50–80% of pregnancies, typically in the **first trimester** [^70e46ab0]; hyperemesis gravidarum is severe and may require hospitalization [^82926efd].

---

## Metabolic and endocrine causes

Metabolic derangements can precipitate nausea via **chemoreceptor trigger zone activation**:

- **Uremia**: Renal failure-related toxin accumulation [^ad5d6bb5].

- **Diabetic ketoacidosis**: Metabolic acidosis and ketosis [^notfound].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypercalcemia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia [^ad5d6bb5].

- **Thyroid disorders**: Hyper- and hypothyroidism [^notfound].

---

## Psychiatric and functional causes

Anxiety, depression, and functional gastrointestinal disorders are associated with **chronic nausea**; anxiety carries a particularly strong association in community samples [^7b16e79d] [^85264083].

---

## Evaluation approach

A **focused history and physical examination** are essential [^bf3d1737]:

- **History**: Onset, duration, associated symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, headache, vertigo), medication use, pregnancy, travel, diet [^bf3d1737].

- **Exam**: Vital signs, hydration, abdominal exam, neurologic and otologic findings [^0a8752eb].

- **Testing**: CBC, electrolytes, renal and liver function, glucose, TSH, pregnancy test; consider ECG, imaging, or endoscopy based on suspicion [^69417ba3].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring urgent evaluation

- Severe abdominal pain or distension
- Hematemesis or melena
- Altered mental status
- Focal neurologic deficits
- Severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance
- Weight loss > 5% in pregnancy [^70e46ab0]

---

Nausea is a common, multifactorial symptom; **most cases are due to gastrointestinal, medication-related, or vestibular causes**, and a focused history with selective testing usually identifies the etiology. Alarm features should prompt urgent evaluation.

### Nausea: a review of pathophysiology and therapeutics [^b7381434]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The sensation of nausea is a common occurrence with diverse causes and a significant disease burden. Nausea is considered to function as a protective mechanism, warning the organism to avoid potential toxic ingestion. Less adaptive circumstances are also associated with nausea, including post-operative nausea, chemotherapy-induced nausea, and motion sickness. A common definition of nausea identifies the symptom as a precursor to the act of vomiting. The interaction, though present, does not appear to be a simple relationship. Nausea is unfortunately the 'neglected symptom', with current accepted therapy generally directed at improving gastrointestinal motility or acting to relieve emesis. Improved understanding of the pathophysiological basis of nausea has important implications for exploiting novel mechanisms or developing novel therapies for nausea relief.

### Evaluation of nausea and vomiting [^0a8752eb]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

A comprehensive history and physical examination can often reveal the cause of nausea and vomiting, making further evaluation unnecessary. Acute symptoms generally are the result of infectious, inflammatory, or iatrogenic causes. Most infections are self-limiting and require minimal intervention; iatrogenic causes can be resolved by removing the offending agent. Chronic symptoms are usually a pathologic response to any of a variety of conditions. Gastrointestinal etiologies include obstruction, functional disorders, and organic diseases. Central nervous system etiologies are primarily related to conditions that increase intracranial pressure, and typically cause other neurologic signs. Pregnancy is the most common endocrinologic cause of nausea and must be considered in any woman of childbearing age. Numerous metabolic abnormalities and psychiatric diagnoses also may cause nausea and vomiting. Evaluation should first focus on detecting any emergencies or complications that require hospitalization. Attention should then turn to identifying the underlying cause and providing specific therapies. When the cause cannot be determined, empiric therapy with an antiemetic is appropriate. Initial diagnostic testing should generally be limited to basic laboratory tests and plain radiography. Further testing, such as upper endoscopy or computed tomography of the abdomen, should be determined by clinical suspicion based on a complete history and physical examination.

### Evaluation and treatment of nausea and vomiting in adults [^bf3d1737]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms that can reduce quality of life and indicate life-threatening illness. Acute nausea and vomiting last up to 7 days. In the absence of alarm symptoms, they are typically treated symptomatically and without an extensive evaluation. Typical causes include gastroenteritis or other viral syndromes, foodborne illness, acute migraine headaches, vestibular disturbances, early pregnancy, and adverse effects of medication. Chronic nausea and vomiting last 4 weeks or longer and have a broad differential diagnosis. Causes can be gastrointestinal, infectious, metabolic, neurologic, psychiatric, or related to medications and toxins. A careful history of related factors is essential to guide the initial evaluation and narrow the differential diagnosis. These factors include associated symptoms, timing of onset and duration of symptoms, exacerbating or relieving factors, alarm symptoms, medication and substance use, relationship with recent food ingestion, and comorbidities. Nonpharmacologic management options include fluid and electrolyte replacement; small, frequent meals; and avoidance of trigger foods. Antiemetic drugs effectively reduce symptoms of acute nausea and vomiting, but chronic symptoms are often more challenging to treat. When a specific etiology is not identified, a serotonin antagonist or dopamine antagonist can be used. However, medications may also target the suspected cause of symptoms and the neurotransmitters involved in central and peripheral pathways of nausea and vomiting. Pharmacologic therapy should be used for the shortest time necessary to control symptoms.

### Chronic nausea and vomiting: evaluation and treatment [^63f2fc15]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Nausea is an uneasy feeling in the stomach while vomiting refers to the forceful expulsion of gastric contents. Chronic nausea and vomiting represent a diverse array of disorders defined by 4 weeks or more of symptoms. Chronic nausea and vomiting result from a variety of pathophysiological processes, involving gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal causes. The prevalence of chronic nausea and vomiting is unclear, although the epidemiology of specific conditions, such as gastroparesis and cyclic vomiting syndrome, is better understood. The economic impact of chronic nausea and vomiting and effects on quality of life are substantial. The initial diagnostic evaluation involves distinguishing gastrointestinal causes of chronic nausea and vomiting (e.g., gastroparesis, cyclic vomiting syndrome) from non-gastrointestinal causes (e.g., medications, vestibular, and neurologic disorders). After excluding anatomic, mechanical and biochemical causes of chronic nausea and vomiting, gastrointestinal causes can be grouped into two broad categories based on the finding of delayed, or normal, gastric emptying. Non-gastrointestinal disorders can also cause chronic nausea and vomiting. As a validated treatment algorithm for chronic nausea and vomiting does not exist, treatment should be based on a thoughtful discussion of benefits, side effects, and costs. The objective of this monograph is to review the evaluation and treatment of patients with chronic nausea and vomiting, emphasizing common gastrointestinal causes.

### What are the costs associated with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum? A systematic review [^5fa145e6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), is a common condition and can be a significant cause of morbidity for pregnant women. Up to 70–80% of pregnant women suffer from nausea in pregnancy, with additional vomiting experienced by 50%. The level of severity varies among affected individuals, with around 1–3% of women developing hyperemesis gravidarum (HG); however, this number could be substantially underestimated. HG is a condition characterised by severe, intractable nausea and/or vomiting, usually requiring hospital admission to manage associated dehydration, electrolyte disturbances and other more severe complications such as preeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders. While there is a wide variety of definitions for NVP or for the more severe disorder, HG. The 2021 Windsor definition, which was developed using an international consensus process with all relevant stakeholders, has established the first international definition of HG to help achieve more uniformity in clinical studies and clinical management. The Windsor definition specifies criteria including symptoms beginning in early pregnancy (before 16 weeks' gestation), characterised by severe nausea and/or vomiting, inability to eat and/or drink normally and finally, strongly limits daily activities. HG is the primary cause of hospitalisation in the first half of pregnancy.

NVP and HG can create substantial physical, psychological, and economic burden for patients, significantly affecting a woman's quality of life and day-to-day functioning. While NVP is common, most women do not require medical intervention. However, as severity increases, women may suffer from debilitating dehydration and malnutrition often requiring medication to manage symptoms, the impact of which is often not recognised. In more severe cases of NVP and HG, pregnant women may require inpatient hospitalisation to manage symptoms and complications. While previously Australia lacked NVP-specific management guidelines for those requiring intervention, in 2019 The Society of Obstetric Medicine of Australia and New Zealand (SOMANZ) released new guidelines highlighting evidence-based treatments which range from outpatient management with various pharmacological therapies to ambulatory day-stay facilities and inpatient care depending on severity.

### Chronic nausea and vomiting: insights into underlying mechanisms [^77df296b]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic nausea and vomiting are common and debilitating symptoms in adults. There are some fundamental problems that make our understanding of mechanisms difficult, diagnostic definitions of patient-cohorts being central. As there is no unifying mechanism with a direct link to chronic nausea or vomiting, it is most likely that several mechanisms interact, e.g., pylorus function and its relation to gastric emptying, or gastric sensory and motor function. In this mini-review, we highlight the roles and evidence for brain-gut interactions as well as gastrointestinal neurophysiologic, motor, sensory, and hormonal factors involved in the pathophysiology of chronic nausea and vomiting. There are factors not mentioned in the text, mostly as they are not well characterized in the setting of chronic symptoms or only in animal models.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^0eb5316b]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) introduction — clinical impact and prior guidance notes that PONV is a common adverse event after surgery and anesthesia, and it is distressing for patients, delays post-anesthesia recovery, and can sometimes lead to more serious complications. Optimal management of PONV requires a multidisciplinary approach, with evidence-based care and appropriate institutional infrastructure, and in the last consensus guideline, the expert panel recommended a general approach to multimodal PONV prophylaxis, and rescue treatment with antiemetics from a different pharmacological class. Since the last guideline, there has been a plethora of studies on various novel antiemetic combinations and a growing body of literature on genetic, socioeconomic, and diversity considerations, and the updated guidelines will address the emerging clinical evidence as well as novel considerations in PONV management.

### Nausea and vomiting in 2021: a comprehensive update [^9a81bf8c]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Goal

A comprehensive review of treatments for nausea and vomiting (N/V).

Background

N/V are common symptoms encountered in medicine. While most cases of acute N/V related to a specific cause can be straightforward to manage, other cases of acute N/V such as chemotherapy-induced N/V and especially chronic unexplained N/V can be difficult to control, leading to a significant decline in the patient's quality of life and increased cost of medical care from repeated hospitalizations.

Study

Traditional management has relied on pharmacotherapy which may be inadequate in a certain proportion of these patients. Many of the medications used in the management of N/V have significant side effect profiles making the need for new and improved interventions of great importance.

Results

This review covers a broad review of the pathophysiology of N/V, pharmacotherapy, including safety concerns and controversies with established pharmaceuticals, newer immunotherapies, bioelectrical neuromodulation (including gastric electrical stimulation), behavioral and surgical therapies, and complementary medicine.

Conclusion

On the basis of emerging understandings of the pathophysiology of N/V, improved therapies are becoming available.

### Drugs for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in adults in the emergency department setting [^807c77f1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting is a common and distressing presenting complaint in emergency departments (ED). The aetiology of nausea and vomiting in EDs is diverse and drugs are commonly prescribed. There is currently no consensus as to the optimum drug treatment of nausea and vomiting in the adult ED setting.

Objectives

To provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of antiemetic medications in the management of nausea and vomiting in the adult ED setting.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 8), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1966 to August 2014), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1980 to August 2014) and ISI Web of Science (January 1955 to August 2014). We also searched relevant clinical trial registries and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of any drug in the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the treatment of adults in the ED. Study eligibility was not restricted by language or publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction and assessment of risk of bias in included studies. We contacted authors of studies to obtain missing information if required.

Main Results

We included eight trials, involving 952 participants, of which 64% were women. Included trials were generally of adequate quality, with six trials at low risk of bias, and two trials at high risk of bias. Three trials with 518 participants compared five different drugs with placebo; all reported the primary outcome as mean change in visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 to 100) for nausea severity from baseline to 30 minutes. Trials did not routinely report other primary outcomes of the change in nausea VAS at 60 minutes or number of vomiting episodes. Differences in mean VAS change from baseline to 30 minutes between placebo and the drugs evaluated were: metoclopramide (three trials, 301 participants; mean difference (MD) -5.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) -11.33 to 0.80), ondansetron (two trials, 250 participants; MD -4.32, 95% CI -11.20 to 2.56), prochlorperazine (one trial, 50 participants; MD -1.80, 95% CI -14.40 to 10.80), promethazine (one trial, 82 participants; MD -8.47, 95% CI -19.79 to 2.85) and droperidol (one trial, 48 participants; MD -15.8, 95% CI -26.98 to -4.62). The only statistically significant change in baseline VAS to 30 minutes was for droperidol, in a single trial of 48 participants. No other drug was statistically significantly superior to placebo. Other included trials evaluated a drug compared to "active controls" (alternative antiemetic). There was no convincing evidence of superiority of any particular drug compared to active control. All trials included in this review reported adverse events, but they were variably reported precluding meaningful pooling of results. Adverse events were generally mild, there were no reported serious adverse events. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low, mainly because there were not enough data.

Authors' Conclusions

In an ED population, there is no definite evidence to support the superiority of any one drug over any other drug, or the superiority of any drug over placebo. Participants receiving placebo often reported clinically significant improvement in nausea, implying general supportive treatment such as intravenous fluids may be sufficient for the majority of people. If a drug is considered necessary, choice of drug may be dictated by other considerations such as a person's preference, adverse-effect profile and cost. The review was limited by the paucity of clinical trials in this setting. Future research should include the use of placebo and consider focusing on specific diagnostic groups and controlling for factors such as intravenous fluid administered.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^87a2bb82]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a common condition that affects the health of a pregnant woman and her fetus. It can diminish a woman's quality of life and also significantly contributes to health care costs and time lost from work (1, 2). Because morning sickness is common in early pregnancy, the presence of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be minimized by obstetricians, other obstetric care providers, and pregnant women and, thus, undertreated (1). Furthermore, some women do not seek treatment because of concerns about the safety of medications (3). Once nausea and vomiting of pregnancy progresses, it can become more difficult to control symptoms. Treatment in the early stages may prevent more serious complications, including hospitalization (4). Safe and effective treatments are available for more severe cases, and mild cases of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be resolved with lifestyle and dietary changes. The woman's perception of the severity of her symptoms plays a critical role in the decision of whether, when, and how to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy should be distinguished from nausea and vomiting related to other causes. The purpose of this document is to review the best available evidence about the diagnosis and management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

### Management of common symptoms in terminally ill patients: part I. fatigue, anorexia, cachexia, nausea and vomiting [^273fc5a7]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Physical symptoms other than pain often contribute to suffering near the end of life. In addition to pain, the most common symptoms in the terminal stages of an illness such as cancer or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome are fatigue, anorexia, cachexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, delirium and dyspnea. Management involves a diagnostic evaluation for the cause of each symptom when possible, treatment of the identified cause when reasonable, and concomitant treatment of the symptom using nonpharmacologic and adjunctive pharmacologic measures. Part I of this two-part article discusses fatigue, anorexia, cachexia, nausea and vomiting. Fatigue is the most common symptom at the end of life, but little is known about its pathophysiology and specific treatment. Education of the patient and family is the foundation of treatment with the possible use of adjunctive psychostimulants. Anorexia and cachexia caused by wasting syndromes are best managed with patient and family education, as well as a possible trial of appetite stimulants such as megestrol or dexamethasone. For appropriate pharmacologic treatment, it is helpful to identify the pathophysiologic origin of nausea in each patient.

### Nausea and vomiting: a palliative care imperative [^1b2b17c5]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review was undertaken to survey recent literature for research reports and comprehensive clinical reviews addressing the pharmacologic management of nausea and vomiting (N&V) in advanced cancer. The goal was to integrate findings in a comprehensive article that incorporates palliative care concepts into antiemetic treatment.

Recent Findings

There are few published studies of N&V in advanced cancer; such research may be limited by the multicausal nature of N&V and participant burden to patients with life-limiting disease. Most articles are written by oncologists who also specialize in palliative care, and those addressing adverse effects of drugs used as antiemetics are found in other literature. Articles addressing more novel therapies, like cannabinoids and medical marijuana, are uncommon in the oncology literature. N&V in patients with progressive or advanced cancer is often multicausal. Nausea is more common and persistent, and even mild nausea is bothersome and may cause anxiety or depression. The mechanisms of nausea and vomiting overlap, but different neural pathways constitute the final pathway for each-the brainstem for vomiting and higher brain regions for nausea. Common causes of N&V in advanced cancer include constipation, opioids, and malignant bowel obstruction. About 40% have undetermined causes and may be exacerbated by impaired gastric emptying, chemical imbalances, or other factors. Several drugs that have antiemetic effects and act at different receptors are used to palliate N&V. There is a paucity of research that supports palliative antiemetic choices, and other research is needed to define potential therapeutic strategies that capitalize on differences between nausea and vomiting.

### The nature of nausea: prevalence, etiology, and treatment in patients with advanced cancer not receiving antineoplastic treatment [^7dc4f904]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of nausea/vomiting in patients with advanced cancer has a wide range. Due to a very low level of evidence regarding antiemetic treatment, current guidelines recommend an etiology-based approach. The evidence for this approach is also slim and research is urgently needed.

Objectives

(Part One) to elucidate the prevalence of nausea and the possible associations with sociodemographic and clinical variables and (Part Two) to investigate possible etiologies of nausea and antiemetic treatments initiated in patients with nausea.

Methods

Patients with advanced cancer and no recent antineoplastic treatment were included in a prospective two-part study. In Part One, patients completed an extended version of the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL. Nauseated patients could then be included in Part Two in which possible etiologies and antiemetic treatment were recorded and a follow-up questionnaire was completed.

Results

Eight hundred twenty-one patients were included and 46% reported any degree of nausea. Younger age and female sex were associated with a higher degree of nausea. Common etiologies included constipation, opioid use, and "other", and treatments associated with a statistically significant decrease in nausea/vomiting were olanzapine, laxatives, corticosteroids, domperidone, and metoclopramide.

Conclusion

Nausea was a common symptom in this patient population and many different etiologies were suggested. Most patients reported a lower degree of nausea at follow-up. More research in treatment approaches and specific antiemetics is strongly needed.

### Palliative care and the management of common distressing symptoms in advanced cancer: pain, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, and fatigue [^ad5d6bb5]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Nausea and Vomiting

Nausea, defined as the unpleasant subjective feeling of wanting to vomit or retch, and/or vomiting, are experienced by as many as 68% of patients with cancer at some point during their illness; during the last 6 weeks of life, the prevalence of nausea and vomiting is 40% or more. Poorly controlled nausea and vomiting is associated with physical, cognitive, and psychosocial distress, and can contribute to patient and family fears of death from dehydration and/or starvation.

Nausea and vomiting secondary to antineoplastic agents or radiation therapy should be anticipated and managed according to ASCO antiemetic, or equivalent, clinical practice guidelines. The latest ASCO antiemetic update includes evidence-based recommendations and information on the appropriate use of olanzapine, neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists, and use of subcutaneous 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonists.

Much less trial evidence is available for the use of antiemetics in patients with advanced cancer and nausea and vomiting unrelated to antineoplastic agents or radiation therapy. Instead, an etiologic or mechanism-based approach to choosing an antiemetic is commonly recommended. This approach requires clinicians to take a detailed history and perform a focused examination to determine the most likely underlying cause(s) of the patient's nausea and vomiting. In the advanced cancer population, the most common underlying causes of nausea and vomiting are chemical abnormalities (eg, renal or liver failure, hyponatremia, hypercalcemia); drugs (eg, opioids, antidepressants, antibiotics); infection; and impaired gastric emptying, as well as visceral and serosal causes of delayed gastrointestinal transit (bowel obstruction, gastric bleed, enteritis, constipation). - Once the most likely underlying cause of the patient's nausea and vomiting is determined, an appropriate antiemetic can then be selected based on the pathophysiology and receptors implicated (Table 1).

### Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy [^baa2ef20]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting is extensive and the underlying cause can be difficult to diagnose. Treatment of nausea and vomiting also can be unsatisfactory because the available pharmacotherapy does not correct the fundamental underlying pathophysiologic abnormalities. In contrast, the diagnosis of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy generally is straightforward. Almost 80% of women have some degree of nausea in the first trimester of pregnancy, and the diagnosis of pregnancy is established easily by the patient or physician. The spectrum varies from mild nausea to hyperemesis gravidarum. Various treatment approaches are addressed.

### Guidelines for antiemetic treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: past, present, and future recommendations [^d38151d2]. The Oncologist (2007). Low credibility.

Clinicians should be aware that chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is still one of the most feared side effects of chemotherapy. With the correct use of antiemetics, CINV can be prevented in almost 70% to up to 80% of patients. Treatment guidelines are useful tools that enable physicians to integrate the latest clinical research into their practices. The large volume of rapidly evolving clinical data has been summarized and incorporated into treatment recommendations by well-known and reliable institutions, including the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Despite the availability of such guidelines, however, there is evidence that adherence to and implementation of treatment recommendations are less than optimal. This review focuses, in particular, on the conformity and differences of these three guidelines. Furthermore, open questions and trends in the field of antiemesis are discussed as well.

### State of the art antiemetic therapy for cancer patients [^950584b8]. Current Oncology Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are common in cancer patients. The most common cause of nausea and vomiting is the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Apart from chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), biological agents may also cause these symptoms. In this review, discussion will be focused on management of nausea and vomiting due to antineoplastic therapies. The cornerstone of effective management of nausea and vomiting secondary to these antineoplastic drugs is the prevention with the use of appropriate guideline-directed combination antiemetic regimen. Type 3 serotonin receptor antagonists (5HT3RAs), neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists (NK1RAs), and dexamethasone are the backbone antiemetic drugs. In recent years, newer drugs and preparations have been introduced for clinical use and include second-generation 5HT3RA, palonosetron; granisetron transdermal patch; the recently introduced NK1RA rolapitant; and the novel oral combined drug NEPA (netupitant plus palonosetron); and last but not least, the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine.

### Intractable nausea due to the area postrema syndrome of neuromyelitis optica: an uncommon cause of a common symptom [^14297a16]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting are common emergency department (ED) complaints. Neuromyelitis optica, a demyelinating disorder, has a predilection for the area postrema, the central nausea and vomiting center. Demyelinating lesions in this region cause intractable nausea and vomiting.

Case Report

We present a case of area postrema syndrome due to neuromyelitis optica in a 34-year-old woman who was seen in several EDs before the appropriate diagnosis was made. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Nausea and vomiting are complaints that commonly bring people to the ED, thus, emergency physicians are likely to be the first to encounter and diagnose the area postrema syndrome.

### Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^d7df50b1]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are common experiences in pregnancy, affecting 70% to 80% of all pregnant women. Various metabolic and neuromuscular factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) and hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), an entity distinct from NVP. However, their exact cause is unknown. Consequently, treatment of NVP and HG can be difficult, as neither the optimal targets for treatment nor the full effects of potential treatments on the developing fetus are known. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis, outcomes, and treatment of NVP and HG.

### Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy [^823c09d4]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

More than half of pregnant women suffer from nausea and vomiting, which typically begins by the fourth week and disappears by the sixteenth week of pregnancy. The cause of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is unknown, but may be due to the rise in human chorionic gonadotrophin concentration. In 1 in 200 women, the condition progresses to hyperemesis gravidarum, which is characterised by prolonged and severe nausea and vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatment for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy? What are the effects of treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to September 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 22 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupressure, acupuncture, antihistamines, corticosteroids, corticotrophins, diazepam, dietary interventions other than ginger, domperidone, ginger, metoclopramide, ondansetron, phenothiazines, and pyridoxine (vitamin B6).

### Methotrexate-induced nausea in the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^b3ae17e3]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is defined by the International League of Associations for Rheumatology as arthritis of an unknown etiology that persists for at least 6 weeks in children under the age of sixteen and is the most common rheumatic disease in childhood. Effective and timely treatment is necessary to ensure present and future quality of life for children with JIA.

After initially serving in the 1950's as a treatment for acute leukemia and other malignancies, methotrexate (MTX) was shown to be efficacious in the treatment of children with chronic arthritis. This was first published in 1992 in the breakthrough US-USSR controlled study, with subsequent controlled trials and observational studies supporting its findings. MTX became the most commonly used disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) to treat JIA and remains the most common to the present day. Treatment with MTX has the infrequent but serious potential to cause significant hepatotoxicity or bone marrow suppression; however, the frequency and consequences of MTX-induced nausea likely have a greater clinical impact in practice.

The gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects of MTX, most commonly MTX-induced nausea, frequently lead to non-adherence or discontinuation of this otherwise effective and low-cost drug. Different strategies have been employed to diminish the adverse GI effects of MTX, and these have met with variable success. In this paper, we aim to review the published data about MTX-induced nausea in the treatment of JIA, as well as possible management approaches including the use of newer anti-nausea medications.

### Evaluation of nausea and vomiting: a case-based approach [^69417ba3]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

In the absence of acute abdominal pain, significant headache, or recent initiation of certain medications, acute nausea and vomiting is usually the result of self-limited gastrointestinal infections. Nausea and vomiting is also a common adverse effect of radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgical anesthesia. Other potential diagnoses include endocrine conditions (including pregnancy), central nervous system disorders, psychiatric causes, toxin exposure, metabolic abnormalities, and obstructive or functional gastrointestinal causes. The likely cause of acute nausea and vomiting can usually be determined by history and physical examination. Alarm signs such as dehydration, acidosis caused by an underlying metabolic disorder, or an acute abdomen warrant additional evaluation. Based on the suspected diagnosis, basic laboratory testing may include urinalysis, urine pregnancy testing, complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, amylase and lipase levels, thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and stool studies with cultures. Imaging studies include abdominal radiography, ultrasonography, and computed tomography. Computed tomography of the head should be performed if an acute intracranial process is suspected. Chronic nausea and vomiting is defined by symptoms that persist for at least one month. Patients with risk factors for gastric malignancies or alarm symptoms should be evaluated with esophagogastroduodenoscopy. If gastroparesis is suspected, a gastric emptying study is recommended. In addition to functional causes, it is also important to consider psychiatric causes when evaluating patients with chronic nausea and vomiting.

### Nausea, gastroparesis, and aerophagia [^c1bd16b8]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Nausea, gastroparesis, and aerophagia are gastrointestinal phenomena that have variable impact on affected patients. The causes of nausea are varied; treatment of these conditions relates to the underlying etiology. Antiemetic agents acting on several distinct receptor subtypes produce benefits in distinct patient subsets. Gastroparesis is characterized by delays in gastric emptying, usually defined scintigraphically. Standard care of gastroparesis relies on dietary modification, antiemetic drug therapy, and initiation of medications that stimulate gastric motor activity. Recent advances include pyloric injection of botulinum toxin and surgical implantation of an electrical neurostimulator. Other surgical therapies are reserved for refractory cases. Aerophagia presents in individuals of normal and impaired cognitive function, most commonly with symptoms of overdistension or eructation. There are no pharmaceutical remedies for this condition; thus, therapy relies on behavioral treatments.

### Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy [^b92b869d]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

More than half of pregnant women suffer from nausea and vomiting, which typically begins by the 4th week and disappears by the 16th week of pregnancy. The cause of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is unknown, but may be due to the rise in human chorionic gonadotrophin concentration. In 1 in 200 women, the condition progresses to hyperemesis gravidarum, which is characterised by prolonged and severe nausea and vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss.

Methods and Outcomes

### Functional nausea in children [^85264083]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic nausea is a highly prevalent, bothersome, and difficult-to-treat symptom among adolescents. When chronic nausea presents as the predominant symptom and is not associated with any underlying disease, it may be considered a functional gastrointestinal disorder and named "functional nausea". The clinical features of functional nausea and its association with comorbid conditions provide clues to the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. These may include gastrointestinal motor and sensory disturbances, autonomic imbalance, altered central nervous system pathways, or a combination of these. This review summarizes the current knowledge on mechanisms and treatment strategies for chronic, functional nausea in children.

### Management of intractable nausea and vomiting in patients at the end of life: "I was feeling nauseous all of the time… nothing was working" [^cde0c5ae]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Nausea and vomiting, symptoms that occur commonly near the end of life, represent a substantial source of physical and psychological distress for patients and families. In the context of the case of Mr Q, a 50-year-old man with metastatic esophageal cancer admitted to the hospital with intractable nausea and vomiting, we review the evaluation and treatment of this symptom complex. A thorough history and physical examination are essential first steps in the management of these patients because they define the severity of the symptoms and clues to their underlying etiology. Once the most likely cause is determined, the clinician discerns the mechanism, specific transmitters, and receptors by which this etiology is triggering nausea and vomiting. Subsequent pharmacological management focuses on prescribing the appropriate antagonist to the implicated receptors. If symptoms are refractory despite adequate dosage and around-the-clock prophylactic administration, an empirical trial combining several therapies to block multiple emetic pathways should be attempted. Less traditional agents are also discussed, although evidence for their use is limited. Often, oral administration of medication is not feasible and alternate routes such as rectal suppositories, subcutaneous infusions, and orally dissolvable tablets should be considered. Using this step-wise approach, nausea and vomiting can be successfully managed in most patients at the end of life.

### Evidence-based recommendations for cancer nausea and vomiting [^fa7afc29]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

The experience of patients living with cancer and being treated with chemotherapy often includes the symptoms of nausea and vomiting. To provide a framework for high-quality management of these symptoms, we developed a set of key targeted evidence-based standards through an iterative process of targeted systematic review, development, and refinement of topic areas and standards and consensus ratings by a multidisciplinary expert panel as part of the RAND Cancer Quality-Assessing Symptoms Side Effects and Indicators of Supportive Treatment Project. For nausea and vomiting, key clinical standards included screening at the initial outpatient and inpatient visit, prophylaxis for acute and delayed emesis in patients receiving moderate to highly emetic chemotherapy, and follow-up after treatment for nausea and vomiting symptoms. In addition, patients with cancer and small bowel obstruction were examined as a special subset of patients who present with nausea and vomiting. The standards presented here for preventing and managing nausea and vomiting in cancer care should be incorporated into care pathways and should become the expectation rather than the exception.

The duo has an extensive aetiology ranging from common known causes to uncommon idiopathic reasons. Our case illustrates the fact that identifying the aetiology of nausea and vomiting can be lifesaving, given the characteristics of the patient. This case is about a 31-year-old Caucasian woman, with history significant for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus on insulin pump since the age 2, Hypothyroidism, diabetic peripheral neuropathy with no significant known family history, who was admitted with intractable nausea and vomiting. She was discharged twice from hospital after temporary symptom control with presumed diagnosis of diabetic gastroparesis. Her third hospital visit enabled us to identify the cause of her symptoms being Addison's crisis rather than gastroparesis.

### What are the costs associated with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum? A systematic review [^51e8a159]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Research and development

The limited number of studies included in this review highlights the scarcity of research on the economic burden of NVP and HG which is so far unexplored in the Australian context. To address the existing gap in evidence, routine data collection, such as that used by Pont and colleagues,6 is recommended, and can be used to examine the economic impact of NVP and HG, as well as other maternal health conditions. Australia, being a high-income country, may indeed share certain characteristics with countries included in this study, potentially experiencing a similarly significant economic burden of NVP and HG. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that differences in healthcare systems, geographic variance and policies can limit the generalisability of these findings. Therefore, conducting country-specific research is imperative to obtain more precise and contextually relevant insights.

Additionally, the variations in approaches used to assess the cost of NVP and HG in the included studies are crucial to recognise and explore. Conducting further research with consistent methodologies and employing more standardised outcome measures to generate a larger body of high-quality evidence, would assist policy makers in better allocating resources for appropriate interventions, with potential for more effective and streamlined healthcare services to treat this population. Continued research into the cost-effectiveness of different treatments and care models is essential. Policymakers should support studies that provide robust data and use consistent outcome measures to inform future healthcare strategies.

By recognising the outcomes and implications of the current research, and addressing the gaps in knowledge, healthcare policies can better manage the economic burden of NVP and HG, improve patient outcomes, and ensure efficient use of healthcare resources.

### Features of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy as predictive factors of post-partum depression: a systematic review [^48b35627]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) represent a common disorder, reported by 50–90% of pregnant women with a severe form named Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG), which is the leading cause of hospitalization during the first trimester. NVP now recognized as a genetic and biological condition, has frequently been misdiagnosed as a mental health disorder. Affected women were often accused of feigning their symptoms, and management approaches that are now deemed unacceptable — such as isolation — were historically employed in the care of women with NVP. It is assumed that serious physical illnesses significantly affect patients' quality of life and cause psychological distress. Indeed, NVP exerts a significant psychological burden and negatively impact quality of life and emotional well-being during and after pregnancy. They are associated with psychiatric conditions including anxiety and depression. Given the comorbidity between several psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), it is essential to distinguish between them in order to ensure targeted and effective clinical management.

Furthermore, PPD is the most common post-partum complication and affects 10 to 20% of new mothers. PPD is strongly associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation and attempts, and suicide remains a leading cause of death during the perinatal period. PPD can have long-term negative effects on the child, the mother and the family environment. Early identification and timely intervention are essential; therefore, recognizing predictive symptoms of postpartum depression is crucial to enable preventive, individualized follow-up and to avert devastating impacts on families and society.

In the literature, although NVP and HG have validated definitions (see Table 1), their descriptions vary among studies. Furthermore, the relationship between nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and PPD is controversial. Some studies have reported this association, but others have not. This could be explained by several reasons: the studies included data gathered with different methodologies and mainly focused on HG and not NVP. PPD was assessed using different tools and at different times after delivery. In addition, the authors often investigated the causal relationship between NVP/HG and psychiatric symptoms.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome: commentary [^817e1b69]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — future directions and conclusions — There are major gaps in understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of CVS, which limits the development of more effective treatments. Similarly, an incomplete understanding of the clinical features and comorbidities that predict clinical responses is a barrier to developing personalized therapeutic approaches. Clinical research leveraging multicenter, standardized registries of patients with CVS and directed investments by both industry and governmental sources are needed. CVS is a common and disabling condition in adults, but need not be so, as it is a treatable condition, and prompt recognition remains the key factor in avoiding unnecessary investigations and providing patients with effective treatments.

### Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^ddc0b12c]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, commonly known as "morning sickness", affects approximately 80 percent of pregnant women. Although several theories have been proposed, the exact cause remains unclear. Recent research has implicated Helicobacter pylori as one possible cause. Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is generally a mild, self-limited condition that may be controlled with conservative measures. A small percentage of pregnant women have a more profound course, with the most severe form being hyperemesis gravidarum. Unlike morning sickness, hyperemesis gravidarum may have negative implications for maternal and fetal health. Physicians should carefully evaluate patients with nonresolving or worsening symptoms to rule out the most common pregnancy-related and nonpregnancy-related causes of severe vomiting. Once pathologic causes have been ruled out, treatment is individualized. Initial treatment should be conservative and should involve dietary changes, emotional support, and perhaps alternative therapy such as ginger or acupressure. Women with more complicated nausea and vomiting of pregnancy also may need pharmacologic therapy. Several medications, including pyridoxine and doxylamine, have been shown to be safe and effective treatments. Pregnant women who have severe vomiting may require hospitalization, orally or intravenously administered corticosteroid therapy, and total parenteral nutrition.

### Fourth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting [^6fecc70c]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions and practice implications for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) — the guidelines provide comprehensive evidence-based clinical recommendations, emphasizing that prevention of PONV should be integral to anesthesia, achieved through risk assessment, baseline risk prevention, and pharmacoprophylaxis. A major change is that in adults, the panel consensus is now to implement multimodal PONV prophylaxis in patients with 1 or 2 risk factors to reduce the risk of inadequate prophylaxis, while clinician discretion is advised. Combination therapy should consist of drugs from different classes using minimum effective doses, with drug choice determined by patient factors, institutional policy, and availability.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^9e787654]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 189 — evidence grading and recommendation categories for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy are defined as follows: The MEDLINE database, the Cochrane Library, and ACOG resources were used to identify English-language articles published between January 2000 and September 2017; abstracts at symposia were not included, and when reliable research was not available, expert opinion was used. Studies were reviewed according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force method with levels I (evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled trial), II-1 (evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization), II-2 (evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case–control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group), II-3 (evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention; dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments also could be regarded as this type of evidence), and III (opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees). Based on the highest level of evidence, recommendations are graded as Level A (based on good and consistent scientific evidence), Level B (based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence), and Level C (based primarily on consensus and expert opinion).

### Humanistic and economic burden of nausea and vomiting among migraine sufferers [^41f838e1]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Migraine is a neurological disorder that involves excitation and sensitivity of certain areas of the brain and is thought to possess a genetic underpinning. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of headache, often accompanied by related symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. Migraine attacks typically last for 4–72 hours and can be disabling, forcing people to miss work or other activities. Noteworthy in the context of the current study is that nausea and vomiting are experienced by the majority of patients, with estimates of nausea occurring in 90% of cases and vomiting in 70%.

Studies suggest that prevalence rates of migraines in developed countries range from 18% to 18.2% among females and 6% to 6.5% among males.–Importantly, migraine patients are at greater risk of experiencing a number of other comorbid conditions than the general population, including, for example, stroke, coronary heart disease, hypertension, epilepsy, and asthma. Extensive research has also established a consistent association between migraine and increased risk of psychiatric illness, such as symptoms of depression and anxiety.–Additionally, it has been found that migraine patients have poorer sleep quality independent of depression or anxiety.

In addition to managing comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions, the symptoms associated with migraine headache can be severe and can often require bed rest and medication. Migraine has thus been associated with substantial and ongoing impairments in quality of life and health outcomes among sufferers. A number of large-scale survey studies have established significant and persistent impairments in quality of life among migraine sufferers, including physical, social, functional, and emotional domains. However, research has also suggested that treatment and stable symptomatology can be associated with improved quality of life.

Migraine-related impairments also represent a tangible economic burden, as migraineurs often miss work or school, have decreased productivity while at work, and often utilize health care resources at a greater frequency than nonmi-graineurs. Indeed, headaches or head pain was the fourth leading cause of visits to the emergency room (ER) in the US in 2009–2010 and accounted for 0.5% of visits across all ambulatory care settings. Additionally, those with chronic migraine incurred significantly higher health care costs compared with those with episodic migraine.

### Maternal susceptibility to nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: is the vestibular system involved? [^f5959145]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy shares many characteristics with motion sickness, a vestibular dependent phenomenon. A number of physiologic changes that occur in normal pregnancy are also known to accompany nausea and vomiting in patients with motion sickness and certain vestibular disorders. This chapter summarizes some shared features of both phenomena. The unmasking of subclinical vestibular disorders may account for some cases of hyperemesis gravidarum. Hormonal effects on neurotransmitter function may also play a role in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and in some vestibular disorders; however, the specific neural mechanisms of nausea and vomiting have not been identified. Until the neurochemical processes underlying these phenomena are understood, prevention and management will remain in the domain of astute, but so far limited, clinical observation.

### Functional nausea and vomiting [^b6468daf]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Medium credibility.

Although functional vomiting (FV), cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) and chronic idiopathic nausea (CIN) are fairly rare disorders, it has been increasingly recognized that these conditions can be highly disabling. Traditionally, FV, CVS and CIN have been under-investigated; however, interest in the cause and treatment of these disorders has increased, particularly with regard to their pathophysiology and the evaluation of new treatment approaches. This article presents a literature-based review of the nomenclature, pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of CIN, CVS and FV. There is a dearth of randomized, controlled trials of treatments for these disorders, owing mainly to their low prevalence. Consequently, referral centers that see a large number of patients with these challenging disorders are working together to share their experience, so that the most productive treatment strategies can be used to help patients. Our knowledge of the treatment of FV, CVS and CIN, as best we know it, is presented here.

### Fourth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting [^f1216b17]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). High credibility.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) — burden and rationale for update are described: PONV has an estimated incidence of 30% in the general surgical population and as high as 80% in high risk cohorts and is associated with significant patient dissatisfaction. Optimal management of PONV is a complex process, with numerous antiemetics of varying pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and side-effect profiles, so choice depends on clinical context and benefits must be balanced with adverse effects, while institutional factors such as cost-effectiveness, drug availability, and formulary decisions also influence management. Existing published guidelines are limited to specific patient populations, do not address all aspects, or are not up to date; this group previously published 3 iterations in 2003, 2009, and 2014. A systematic literature search identified over 9000 published studies since the last consensus guideline (literature search up to October 2011), and the establishment of enhanced recovery pathways (ERPs) has led to a significant paradigm shift, prompting an updated set of recommendations.

### Migraine as a cause of persistent nausea or vomiting in palliative care: a case series [^ea1d1e67]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2009). Low credibility.

Migraine is common, underdiagnosed, and frequently inadequately treated in the general population. Nausea and vomiting are common reasons for patients to be referred for symptom control. Nausea can be the most prominent feature of migraine; the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) recognizes cyclical vomiting syndrome as a migraine variant in children, and there is increasing evidence for a similar entity in adults. We present three patients with troublesome nausea uncontrolled by conventional antiemetic therapy. On questioning, all three had other symptoms suggestive of migraine, and two had a family history. Their symptoms settled with the use of various antimigraine therapies. Amitriptyline appears to be particularly useful. A therapeutic trial of prophylaxis may be indicated for patients whose nausea and vomiting may be attributed to migraine.

ACOG Practice Bulletin — Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy definition, incidence, severity assessment, and hyperemesis gravidarum: Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is common with "prevalence rates for nausea of 50–80% and for vomiting and retching of 50%," and "recurrence of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy with subsequent pregnancies ranges from 15–81%." Severity has been categorized by daily duration and frequency, assessing "the duration of nausea and vomiting each day (from less than 1 hour in mild cases to more than 6 hours in severe cases)" and "the amount of vomiting and retching per day (up to two times for mild and moderate nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and more than five times in severe cases)." A validated "pregnancy-unique quantification of emesis and nausea (PUQE) assesses the severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy during the first trimester," and "scores from the PUQE index are associated with quality of life measurements," supporting clinical utility. Regarding timing of care, "Early treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be beneficial to prevent progression to hyperemesis gravidarum." For hyperemesis gravidarum, "No single accepted definition of hyperemesis gravidarum exists," it "is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion," and commonly cited criteria include "persistent vomiting," "usually large ketonuria," and weight loss "most often at least 5% of prepregnancy weight"; epidemiologically, it "appears to represent the extreme end of the spectrum of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy."

### What are the costs associated with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum? A systematic review [^2669ae51]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

The different medical interventions lead to direct costs incurred by the healthcare system and result in an economic burden of disease. Other costs incurred include the societal costs stemming from the impact of severe NVP and HG on decreased productivity, absenteeism from work, need for partner support and other effects often referred to as indirect costs. These include loss of income, where one-third of women with NVP require time off work, and any other costs incurred by the patient's family or partner/carer (loss of income, transport, childcare).

Despite the prevalence, morbidity, and known direct and indirect costs of NVP and HG, limited research exists regarding resource use, treatments, and potential cost savings for treatments and models of care. It is therefore crucial to examine economic evidence to inform health policies, and understand appropriate funding and resource allocation to mitigate the severe impact of NVP and HG.

Aims and Objectives

The aim of this study was to systematically identify and examine the existing evidence on the economic burden of NVP and HG. Specifically, the study sought to review and synthesise costs associated with NVP and HG in terms of (1) healthcare resource utilisation (direct costs) and (2) personal costs to the woman and her family/caregivers (indirect costs), with the goal of directing healthcare resource allocation in the future. The estimation of costs will provide evidence for the economic burden of NVP and HG and an insight into the key areas that these costs are originating from.

### Antiemetic guidelines: creating a more practical treatment approach [^82b2904a]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Antiemetic guidelines from a variety of professional organizations have been available for several years. It is unclear just how often these guidelines have been used, however; data indicate that some practitioners still do not treat their patients according to the recommendations. Some of those involved in the creation of the original guidelines convened to try to create a simpler, more practical approach to the use of antiemetics in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. The group's intention was to clarify available guidelines and produce a practical document, based on evidence, that could be used in everyday practice. The group created four consensus statements that would serve as a basis for their recommendations. One primary strategy used was to have chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting viewed as a single process that can occur throughout a treatment cycle, and not so much as an acute and a delayed process, as is usual in clinical trials. Patients' management should be considered over a 4- to 5-day period, rather than primarily dealing with the day of treatment only. The group created three tables: emetic risk of chemotherapy; treatment options based on emetic category; and antiemetic dosing recommendations. Use of these tables should make appropriate antiemetic selection more straightforward and easier for the practitioner in an everyday setting. Although this document alone may not solve all the challenges with appropriate antiemetic management, it will hopefully prove to be a step in the right direction.

### What are the costs associated with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum? A systematic review [^51c066b0]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Cost estimates of NVP and HG

Cost estimates from the included studies are summarised in Table 1. Two studies estimated an annual cost of NVP and HG in their respective countries of origin, both identifying a substantial economic burden associated with NVP and HG. Table 1 illustrates that all studies included in the review used diverse costs inputs and outcome measures, thus making it impractical to draw direct comparisons between estimates across the studies.

Three studies presented cost estimates per patient over different time frames. A modelling study estimated a cost per patient with HG in the United States (US) of USD$61,528 (in 2023-year value). Another study analysing primary data reported an estimated weekly cost per patient with severe NVP in Canada of USD$880 (in 2023-year value). This weekly cost value when considered over 36 weeks of pregnancy equates to USD$31,680 per patient.

Three studies reported increasing costs with increasing severity of symptoms. A Canadian study, reported increasing costs from all perspectives with increasing self-reported severity of the symptoms, an association further illustrated in a later modelling study in the United States.

Costs to facility and system level costs

Most studies (n = 6) included direct medical costs substantially contributing to the economic burden of disease. Common cost components included cost of hospital inpatient and day stay admissions, cost of drug treatments, cost of healthcare professionals as well as cost of emergency services.

Cost effectiveness of models of care

Two studies performed cost analyses of models of care. A study from the UK performed a cost utility analysis of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) which compared day care to inpatient management of NVP after random allocation of pregnant women presenting to a tertiary referral maternity hospital for treatment of NVP. The study revealed a notable cost difference between day care and inpatient management of NVP, with day care treatment demonstrating significantly lower costs compared to hospital stays. Similarly, another study from the UK specifically assessed the cost saving benefits in treatment of NVP and HG after the introduction of a specific day stay Hyperemesis Unit. Implementation of the ambulatory unit for the assessment and management of HG showed cost benefits for both the service provider and the patient.

Indirect costs

Four studies considered the economic burden associated with absenteeism from work resulting in an opportunity cost of lost income. Resulting lost income from time off from work was shown to be a significant cost to the woman across multiple studies. No other indirect costs were examined in these studies.

### Nausea, vomiting and poor appetite during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes in rural Nepal: an observational cohort study [^3021d06b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Pregnant women experiencing nausea, vomiting or poor appetite during pregnancy in a low resource setting have an increased relative risk of LBW and SGA and a decreased relative risk for preterm birth. The estimates differ by trimester in which the symptoms were experienced. Specifically, symptoms in the second and third trimester have the most impact on the studied birth outcomes. Further studies are needed in similar settings and where symptom severity as well as pre-pregnancy BMI is available. Given that inadequate nutrition and limited access to vitamin supplements is common in low resource settings, interventions targeting these issues should be explored as a way to reduce the impact of nausea, vomiting and poor appetite in high-risk populations.

### Treatment of nausea in pregnancy: a cross-sectional multinational web-based study of pregnant women and new mothers [^e96bd8eb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) is one of the most common pregnancy-related complaints, affecting millions of pregnant women worldwide each year. Approximately 7 out of 10 women experience nausea during pregnancy and 50% experience both nausea and vomiting. For most patients, symptoms appear around the sixth week of pregnancy and gradually decline during the second trimester, peaking at 8–13 weeks. However, 10% of women will still experience symptoms after 20–22 weeks of pregnancy. The most severe form of NVP, hyperemesis gravidarum, is characterised by severe and persistent nausea and vomiting leading to weight loss, ketonuria, nutritional deficiencies, dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, often so severe as merits hospitalisation, and affects about 1.1% of the pregnant women.

NVP has been shown to greatly impact a woman's life, negatively affecting daily activities, relationship with partner, parenting, occupation and social functioning. Feelings of isolation, fatigue, depression, and helplessness due to nausea have also been described. Nausea has been reported to be responsible for 33% of all sick leave during pregnancy. In the USA and Canada, NVP is a significant economic burden to women and society.

Because NVP is often most intense during the first trimester when organogenesis occurs, teratogenic effects are a concern in treatment. This may lead to caution in prescribing and taking conventional medicines to treat this condition, despite the proven safety of use during pregnancy of many medicines. Pregnant women often overestimate the teratogenic risk associated with the use of medicines in general. Consequently, many women may turn to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to alleviate their symptoms or choose to not treat their symptoms due to the fear that taking anything during pregnancy may harm the baby. Despite the high prevalence of NVP, little is known about differences in NVP treatments, i.e. conventional and herbal medicines, across countries. An informal survey in various European countries in 1998 found wide variations in the types of treatment used against mild and moderate nausea and vomiting, whereas hyperemesis gravidarum was treated in a similar fashion in the vast majority of countries.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^bc408cf5]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.3.4.12. Associated symptoms – nausea and vomiting

Recommendation:

The presence or absence of nausea should be recorded at the time trial treatment is administered and at the time of assessment of the primary efficacy outcome (e.g. 2 hours).

Comments:

Nausea and vomiting are important associated symptoms of migraine, and acute migraine treatments should demonstrate efficacy against these symptoms. Nausea and vomiting can also complicate treatment when they occur as AEs, and therefore these variables should be recorded for at least 24 hours after treatment. When interpreting data about nausea or vomiting, investigators should consider that they can be attributed to (a) treatment efficacy effects; (b) treatment-induced adverse effects (i.e. treatment-emergent nausea or vomiting); and (c) use of rescue medication for nausea or vomiting when applicable. Finally, it is important to rate the severity of nausea in trials that include anti-emetics, either alone or in combination with other treatments. A simple 4-point categorical verbal/numerical scale (e.g. 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, or 3 = severe) can and has been used.

1.3.4.13. Associated symptoms – photophobia

Recommendation:

The presence or absence of photophobia should be recorded before treatment is administered and at the time of assessment of the primary efficacy outcome (2 hours).

Comments:

Photophobia is very commonly associated with migraine attacks and can be disabling. Similar to nausea and phonophobia, the effect of an acute treatment of migraine on photophobia should be evaluated in migraine clinical trials. A simple assessment such as presence or absence of photophobia is practical, although verbal scales of severity can be used (e.g. a 4-point scale where 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe). The presence or absence of photophobia should also be recorded at 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours post-dose.

### Opioids in gastroenterology: treating adverse effects and creating therapeutic benefits [^cc56aa21]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Opioid-induced nausea and emesis — Opioids can cause postoperative nausea and vomiting, as "Opioid administration can induce nausea or vomiting, and this is commonly seen in the postoperative period, with opioids being one factor in the multifactorial etiology." The primary mechanism is central: "the primary mechanism of opioid-induced nausea and emesis is central, with direct stimulation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the area postrema in the floor of the fourth ventricle," with "NK-1 receptors in the area postrema" implicated and noting "there are no reports of aprepitant, an NK-1 antagonist, on nausea." Therapeutically, "The clinical efficacy of 5-HT3 antagonists for opioid-induced emesis" is described, and "Adding a prokinetic (eg, metoclopramide), prochlorperazine, or a 5-HT3 antagonist to the opiate regimen is beneficial, especially in a postoperative pain control setting."

### Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: an obstetric syndrome [^da3d4501]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Although the cause of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is not known, there is strong evidence linking human chorionic gonadoptropin or estrogens. Evidence is presented to show that the incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is linked to temporal and pathologic alterations in these hormones during pregnancy. The way in which the pregnant woman responds to the primary stimulus to nausea and vomiting of pregnancy appears to depend on her susceptibility mediated by vestibular, gastrointestinal, olfactory, and behavioral pathways. Conceiving of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy as a syndrome suggests new pathways of investigation and possible therapies.

### Effects of a preoperative carbohydrate load on postoperative recovery in children: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^472f2816]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting are common causes for prolonged postoperative length of hospital stay (LOS) in children. A preoperative carbohydrate load may reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting by improving the perioperative metabolic state. The aim of this study was to determine if a preoperative carbohydrate-containing drink would lead to an improvement in the perioperative metabolic state and consequently reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea, vomiting and LOS in children undergoing day-case surgical procedures.

Method

Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving children aged 4 to 16-years undergoing day-case surgical procedures. Patients were randomised to receive a carbohydrate-containing drink or a placebo. During the induction of anaesthesia, a venous blood gas, and blood glucose and ketone levels were measured. Postoperatively, the incidence of nausea, vomiting, and LOS were documented.

Results

120 patients were randomised with 119/120 (99.2%) undergoing analysis. Blood glucose level was higher in the carbohydrate group; 5.4 mmol/L [3.3–9.4] versus 4.9 mmol/L [3.6–6.5] (p = 0.01). Blood ketone level was lower in the carbohydrate group; 0.2 mmol/L versus 0.3 mmol/L (p = 0.003). The incidence of nausea and vomiting was not different (p > 0.9 and p = 0.8, respectively). LOS in the carbohydrate group was 26 min shorter than the placebo group (p = 0.02).

Conclusion

Although a preoperative carbohydrate load may provide a more stable metabolic state at the induction of anaesthesia, we did not find a reduction in postoperative nausea and vomiting. A preoperative carbohydrate load has also minimal effects on the postoperative LOS.

Type Of Study

TABLE 1.
Etiology-Based Guidance for Antiemetic Prescribing

Unless contraindicated, antiemetics should be prescribed regularly and with a low threshold for being administered parenterally. If, despite titration, treatment with a single agent remains ineffective, a second-line antiemetic should be commenced. The addition of a second-line antiemetic is preferred over switching, because cancer-related nausea and vomiting is often multifactorial, involving multiple neurotransmitters and receptor sites. Currently, only limited and low-quality evidence exists for the use of corticosteroids, olanzapine, and cannabinoids, for nausea and vomiting that is not secondary to antineoplastic agents or radiation therapy. Nonpharmacologic measures, such as dietary advice, psychological services, and acupuncture/acupressure, may offer some benefit when used alongside standard pharmacologic approaches, although again, evidence of their effectiveness for nausea and vomiting unrelated to antineoplastic treatment is limited.

Fatigue

Fatigue is "a subjective, unpleasant symptom which incorporates total body feelings ranging from tiredness to exhaustion creating an unrelenting overall condition which interferes with individuals' ability to function to their normal capacity." (p527) The severe and unrelenting nature of fatigue negatively affects patients and those close to them. It is highly prevalent, affecting three quarters of patients with advanced cancer, perhaps related to the proinflammatory state that plays a role in its pathogenesis. Other contributing factors include anemia, malnutrition, neuro-endocrine impairment, and muscle dysfunction. Assessment of fatigue can be via single-item tools (eg, 0 to 10 numeric rating scale), unidimensional (eg, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: Fatigue), or multidimensional (eg, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-FA13 and Chalder Fatigue Scale) scales (for a comprehensive review, see Minton and Stone).

Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms during pregnancy. A total of 0.3%–3.6% of pregnant women develop severe or protracted nausea and vomiting, termed HG. Risk factors include hyperthyroidism, psychiatric illness, molar pregnancy, pre-existing diabetes and multiple pregnancy. The aetiology is poorly understood, but is thought to involve hormonal, immunological and psychological factors.

Diagnosis

The most commonly used definition of HG is severe or protracted nausea and vomiting leading to dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities and loss of at least 5% of prepregnancy body weight.HG develops in the first trimester and is a clinical diagnosis after excluding other causes of nausea and vomiting.

Abnormal LFTs develop in approximately 50% of patients from mild elevation in serum aminotransferases to 20 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (table 2). Jaundice and hepatic synthetic dysfunction are rare. Hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypophosphataemia, raised serum urea and creatinine are common. Biochemical and liver function abnormalities should normalise on resolution of symptoms and persistently deranged LFTs warrant consideration of an alternative diagnosis, such as viral hepatitis.

### Hyperemesis gravidarum and placental dysfunction disorders [^a6889187]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting are common and usually benign symptoms of primarily the first trimester of pregnancy. The onset of nausea correlates with the level of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which typically rises within 4 weeks after the last menstrual period, peaking at approximately 9 weeks of gestation. Sixty percent of nausea cases resolve by the end of the first trimester and 91% by 20 weeks of gestation. Hyperemesis gravidarum is at the severe end of the nausea spectrum and according to The International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems (ICD-9), is defined as 'persistent and excessive vomiting starting before the end of the 22nd week of gestation'. Hyperemesis gravidarum is clinically classified as mild or severe, depending on associated metabolic disturbances such as carbohydrate depletion, dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Its incidence is estimated at 0.3 to 1.5% of all live births but is unevenly distributed on a global level. Asian women, for instance are more likely to suffer from hyperemesis than Caucasian women. Hyperemesis greatly affects maternal well-being and quality of life and is among the most common reasons for pregnancy-associated hospitalization.

Relatively little is known about the etiology of hyperemesis. Causal roles of sex hormones, thyroid hormones, H. pylori infections and paternal genes have been suggested, although consensus has not been reached. Levels of hCG are positively associated with occurrence and severity of hyperemesis complaints, as seen in multiple- or molar pregnancies. While benign nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy are closely related to temporarily increased hCG levels, it has been argued that in women with hyperemesis, the persistently high hCG level dysregulates normal stimulation of trophoblast migration, which consequently alters placentation. Ultimately abnormal placentation could lead to placental dysfunction that clinically manifests as gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, as well as miscarriage, stillbirth and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). In particular, elevated hCG plasma levels in the second trimester are associated with development of these conditions. Thus, hyperemesis gravidarum, occurring in first and early second trimester, could be an early pregnancy indicator of a process that results in symptomatic placental dysfunction later.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^4c805c90]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Overview of Chapter 2. Fundamental concepts of public health surveillance and foodborne disease — clinical presentation and incubation are described: illnesses from preformed toxins manifest rapidly, often in a matter of minutes or hours, and the most common symptom is vomiting; illnesses caused by infections take longer, ranging from hours to days or weeks; symptoms usually include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps; fever and an elevated white blood cell count also can occur. Because certain pathogens are commonly associated with certain foods, the suspected food in an outbreak can occasionally suggest a particular disease agent, but most foods can be associated with a variety of pathogens and new vehicles emerge each year, so care must be taken in inferring an etiologic agent on the basis of a suspected food.

### Hyperemesis gravidarum [^82926efd]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum describes nausea and vomiting in pregnancy severe enough to cause weight loss, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and nutritional deficiencies. The condition can render women so physically and mentally unwell that they are at increased risk of terminating a wanted pregnancy and experiencing suicidal ideation. Concerns regarding prescribing in pregnancy and inaccurate assumptions that the condition is self-limiting result in women being dismissed and having difficulty accessing appropriate care. Over the past decade, a wealth of literature has been published that gives new insights into the causes of hyperemesis gravidarum, the safety of antiemetic therapy, and short-term and long-term consequences for women with the condition and their children. This Review summarises the findings of this literature with the aim of informing decisions about the care of these women and future research priorities.

### The role of behavioral conditioning in the development of nausea [^ca7ea37e]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Literature related to the prevalence and etiology of anticipatory nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy is reviewed. Physiologic causes and psychological factors, including expectations, beliefs, and conditioning, are examined to help explain these phenomena. The efficacy of pharmacologic and behavioral treatments is discussed. Similarities between the experience of anticipatory nausea and vomiting and morning sickness suggest that the conditioning model may be relevant to understanding the development of pregnancy-related nausea.

### Epidemiology and pathophysiology of gastroparesis [^5b06a0f9]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Gastroparesis is a complex syndrome with symptoms that include nausea, vomiting, and postprandial abdominal pain, and is frequently accompanied by significant delays in gastric emptying. The pathophysiology of diabetic gastroparesis is fairly well understood; however, idiopathic gastroparesis, which accounts for one-third of all cases, may stem from infections, or autoimmune or neurologic disorders, among other causes. To date, few population-based studies have estimated the true prevalence and incidence of gastroparesis. Nonetheless, its prevalence appears to be rising, as does its incidence among minority populations, documented via hospitalizations, which can impose significant economic burdens on patients.

### Developing drugs for prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: draft guidance from the FDA [^a33d94e6]. Clinical Cancer Research (2021). Medium credibility.

The administration of preventative therapy for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is an essential component of the treatment plan for many patients with cancer. In May 2021, the FDA issued a draft guidance for industry to facilitate the clinical development of drugs for the prevention of CINV in adults. FDA guidance has a vital role in the regulatory dialogue between the Agency and external stakeholders. Sharing the FDA's current recommended approach can expedite drug development and ultimately the availability of safe and effective therapies to patients in need. In addition, guidance documents may be leveraged to facilitate communication between regulatory agencies, the academic community, patient advocacy groups, and the pharmaceutical industry. The draft guidance for industry Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting: Developing Drugs for Prevention (May 2021) outlines the FDA's current recommendations regarding clinical development programs for drugs for the prevention of CINV and the required attributes of patients for enrollment, aspects of trial design, and efficacy assessments. This article provides an overview of the recommendations contained in the draft guidance.

### Postoperative nausea and vomiting after metabolic bariatric surgery: a comprehensive review [^083096a1]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) has become an increasingly common treatment for morbid obesity and its comorbidities. Despite significant advances in surgical techniques and anesthesiological management, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) remain frequent complications that significantly affect patient recovery. This review examines the epidemiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, risk factors, clinical features, prevention strategies, and treatment approaches for PONV in patients undergoing metabolic bariatric surgery.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted in Cochrane Library, PubMed, and MEDLINE databases for relevant literature published between 2000 and 2024. Keywords included "metabolic bariatric surgery", "postoperative nausea and vomiting", "PONV", "laparoscopic gastric bypass", "sleeve gastrectomy", "PONV prevention", and "PONV treatment". Randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses were included.

Results

The incidence of PONV after metabolic bariatric procedures ranges from 20% to 70%, depending on the type of surgical intervention, anesthesia techniques, and patient characteristics. PONV after MBS is multifactorial, involving neurohormonal, inflammatory, mechanical, and pharmacological mechanisms. Female gender, non-smoking status, history of PONV or motion sickness, and postoperative opioid use are established risk factors. Multimodal prophylaxis based on individual risk assessment, including 5-HT3 antagonists, NK-1 antagonists, dexamethasone, and non-pharmacological approaches, has shown efficacy. The integration of PONV management into Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols has reduced PONV incidence and shortened hospital stays.

Conclusions

Effective PONV management in metabolic bariatric patients requires a multimodal approach to prevention and treatment based on individual risk assessment and application of current pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods. Further research is needed to develop MBS-specific guidelines that consider the unique characteristics of these patients and contemporary surgical techniques.

### The prevalence of nausea in the community: psychological, social and somatic factors [^7b16e79d]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Nausea is a commonly reported symptom with a point prevalence of about 12% in the community. Nausea is a prominent symptom in functional gastrointestinal disorders and patients with anxiety and depression frequently present gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and abdominal discomfort as their main problem when they consult a doctor. Functional gastrointestinal disorders are strongly related to anxiety and depressive disorders with a lifetime prevalence of 80–90% in samples from clinics of gastroenterology. This study examines the relationship between anxiety disorders, depressions and nausea in a large community sample. A questionnaire on physical and mental health and demographic and life-style factors was sent to all adults 20 years and above in Nord Trøndelag county in Norway. A total of 94,197 questionnaires were sent, with 62,651 persons returning the questionnaire, a response rate of 66.5%. The presence of nausea, heartburn, diarrhea and constipation during the last year was recorded. Anxiety disorders and depressions were based on self-rating of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Forty-eight per cent reported one or several gastrointestinal complaints during the last year. 12.5% complained of nausea. 15.3% had an anxiety disorder and 10.4% a depression based on HADS ratings. Presence of anxiety disorders carried the highest risk for nausea (OR 3.42). Presence of depression also increased the risk, but less than anxiety disorders (OR 1.47). Demographic factors, life-style factors and extra-gastrointestinal conditions did not reduce the OR of anxiety disorders and depressions to any significant extent. We found that the presence of anxiety disorders was the strongest risk factor for nausea. Depression also carried a certain risk while demographic factors, life-style factors and other somatic conditions did not carry any substantial risk for nausea. Differential diagnoses of nausea should therefore include both anxiety and depressive conditions.
