## Question

what dheas dosage we need to produce meaningful level of it in post menopausal women with sexual disorder

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what dose of DHEA is needed to raise DHEA-S to a meaningful level in postmenopausal women with sexual dysfunction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the user means DHEA versus DHEAS, since DHEAS is measured, not administered. Then, I should distinguish hypoactive sexual desire disorder from dyspareunia/genitourinary syndrome of menopause because dosing and evidence differ. Next, I will review oral systemic DHEA data for HSDD, then intravaginal DHEA for dyspareunia, and finally clarify what "meaningful level" should mean clinically versus biochemically, including alternatives such as transdermal testosterone where appropriate [^112wqAxc] [^114LPJZF] [^116x3xxn] [^114Ka8N7] [^114CZ4De] [^113Jp8fa].

> Wait, let me verify the compound first, because I initially read "DHEAS dosage", but DHEAS is the sulfated metabolite measured in serum, not a drug we prescribe; what is actually given to patients is DHEA orally or intravaginally, with DHEAS rising secondarily in the bloodstream after oral DHEA, so I should correct that assumption and proceed with DHEA dosing and expected DHEAS changes rather than a nonexistent "DHEAS dose" [^116FNw2S] [^111V2Mfm].

> Hold on, let me first confirm the clinical targets. For low sexual desire consistent with HSDD, the question is whether oral DHEA improves desire and sexual function, whereas for dyspareunia from vulvovaginal atrophy or the broader genitourinary syndrome of menopause, the question is whether local intravaginal DHEA improves pain and dryness; these are distinct endpoints and require different evidence bases and doses [^112wqAxc] [^114Ka8N7].

> Next, I should review oral DHEA for HSDD. Across randomized trials in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function, oral DHEA at 50 mg daily for 26–52 weeks raises serum DHEAS three- to four-fold but does not significantly improve libido or sexual function versus placebo, and professional consensus guidelines explicitly advise against systemic DHEA for HSDD in this population [^114yn5ey] [^114LPJZF] [^117GX1vK] [^112wqAxc].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could a lower oral dose such as 25 mg work better by avoiding androgenic metabolites; I need to check. Pharmacokinetic and meta-analytic data show that 25–50 mg oral DHEA reliably increases DHEAS and modestly increases testosterone and estradiol, but these biochemical shifts still do not translate to improved sexual desire in women without adrenal insufficiency, so lowering the dose does not rescue efficacy for HSDD [^116FNw2S] [^111V2Mfm] [^111S1Cxo].

> I will now examine intravaginal DHEA for dyspareunia and GSM. The FDA-approved prasterone dose is 6.5 mg intravaginally nightly, which consistently improves dyspareunia and vaginal dryness with minimal systemic changes, keeping serum steroids within postmenopausal ranges and showing no endometrial stimulation on 12–52 week evaluations [^116x3xxn] [^116FcPLe] [^114Ka8N7].

> Let me think about what "meaningful level" should mean here. If the user means "meaningful" serum levels, oral DHEA 25–50 mg/day increases DHEAS about 3–4 fold and raises testosterone by roughly 20–30 ng/dL, but the key clinical point is that these increases are not associated with improvements in desire in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function, so biochemical thresholds are not a valid therapeutic target for HSDD in this group [^116FNw2S] [^111V2Mfm] [^114LPJZF].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline-concordant alternatives for HSDD. After a biopsychosocial assessment and when modifiable factors are addressed, systemic transdermal testosterone at about 300 micrograms daily improves sexual desire, arousal, and satisfying sexual events with monitoring to maintain levels within the premenopausal female physiological range, and is the only evidence-based androgen therapy for postmenopausal HSDD at this time [^114CZ4De] [^113Jp8fa] [^111QMrMq].

> I need to ensure safety and adverse effect context. Oral DHEA increases androgenic metabolites and can cause acne or hirsutism without proven benefit for HSDD in women with normal adrenal function, whereas intravaginal prasterone acts locally with minimal systemic exposure and no endometrial proliferation, aligning with GSM guidance that includes vaginal DHEA as a treatment option for dyspareunia and dryness [^114yn5ey] [^116x3xxn] [^114Ka8N7].

> But wait, what if the patient has adrenal failure or pituitary-related androgen deficiency; I should double-check exceptions. In Addison's disease and Sheehan syndrome, DHEA 50 mg daily or 25 mg twice daily has been studied, showing biochemical replacement and some quality-of-life or sexual function signals in selected cohorts, yet even in Addison's disease longer-term trials did not demonstrate sexual function benefits, so these scenarios are distinct from typical postmenopausal HSDD and are not a basis for recommending DHEA to eugonadal postmenopausal women for desire [^112ku72n] [^114SwFTw] [^114k8LiV].

> Synthesis-wise, I should confirm the bottom line. There is no oral DHEA dose that achieves a clinically meaningful improvement in sexual desire for postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function, despite achieving large increases in circulating DHEAS at 25–50 mg per day, whereas intravaginal prasterone at 6.5 mg nightly is the appropriate evidence-based dose to treat dyspareunia and vaginal dryness due to GSM with minimal systemic exposure [^114LPJZF] [^116FNw2S] [^111V2Mfm] [^116x3xxn] [^114Ka8N7].

> Final recommendation, and let me reiterate to avoid any confusion. For HSDD, do not use oral DHEA at any dose in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function; consider transdermal testosterone around 300 micrograms daily with appropriate monitoring after a structured biopsychosocial assessment. For dyspareunia and GSM, use intravaginal DHEA 6.5 mg nightly as prasterone. If by "meaningful level" the goal is higher serum DHEAS, 25–50 mg oral DHEA will raise levels substantially, but this is not a clinically meaningful target for sexual desire outcomes in this population [^113Jp8fa] [^114CZ4De] [^112wqAxc] [^116x3xxn] [^114Ka8N7] [^111V2Mfm] [^116FNw2S].

Oral DHEA **25–50 mg/day** is the usual dose range to raise DHEAS into the low-normal premenopausal range in postmenopausal women [^116FNw2S] [^111V2Mfm]; however, **no consistent sexual benefit** has been demonstrated in those with normal adrenal function [^114LPJZF] [^114yn5ey]. For vulvovaginal atrophy with dyspareunia, **intravaginal prasterone 6.5 mg nightly** is effective [^114Ka8N7] and does not meaningfully increase systemic DHEAS [^116FcPLe]. Androgenic side effects (acne, hirsutism) are dose-related [^114yn5ey]; monitor DHEAS and testosterone if using systemic DHEA, and consider transdermal testosterone for HSDD if indicated [^114CZ4De] [^112NbCQU].

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of DHEA supplementation

DHEA is a prohormone converted to androgens and estrogens in peripheral tissues [^116iHkKF]; **oral DHEA increases DHEAS** and downstream androgens [^116FNw2S] [^112tfgT8], with variable changes in estradiol [^111V2Mfm]. Intravaginal DHEA delivers local estrogenic/androgenic effects with minimal systemic exposure [^116FcPLe] [^116x3xxn].

## Clinical evidence on DHEA supplementation and sexual function

### Systemic DHEA supplementation

- **RCT evidence**: Oral DHEA 50 mg/day for 12–52 weeks increases DHEAS as well as androgens [^112tfgT8] but does not improve sexual function versus placebo in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function [^114yn5ey] [^114LPJZF].

- **Meta-analysis**: No significant benefit on libido or sexual function in women with normal adrenal function [^114LPJZF] [^117GX1vK].

- **Androgenic effects**: Acne and hirsutism are more common at higher doses (e.g. 50 mg/day) [^114yn5ey].

---

### Intravaginal DHEA supplementation

Prasterone **6.5 mg nightly** improves dyspareunia [^114Ka8N7] and sexual function in GSM with minimal systemic steroid changes [^115bATWR] [^116FcPLe]. There is no proliferative effect on the **endometrium** with long-term use [^116x3xxn].

---

## Recommended DHEA dosage for meaningful DHEAS elevation

Oral DHEA **25–50 mg/day** raises DHEAS into the low-normal premenopausal range [^116FNw2S]; 25 mg/day produces moderate increases, whereas 50 mg/day produces larger increases with more androgenic side effects [^112tfgT8] [^114yn5ey]. Intravaginal prasterone **6.5 mg** produces minimal changes in systemic DHEAS and is not intended to raise systemic DHEAS [^116FcPLe].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Systemic DHEA**: Not recommended for HSDD in women with normal adrenal function due to inconsistent efficacy as well as androgenic side effects [^112wqAxc] [^117GX1vK].

- **Intravaginal DHEA**: Recommended for GSM-related dyspareunia; effective and safe with minimal systemic exposure [^114Ka8N7] [^116FcPLe].

- **Testosterone therapy**: Consider transdermal testosterone for HSDD when other causes are excluded; monitor to keep levels within the female physiologic range [^113Jp8fa] [^112NbCQU].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

- **Androgenic side effects**: Acne, hirsutism, and alopecia are dose-related [^114yn5ey]; monitor DHEAS and testosterone during systemic DHEA use.

- **Cardiometabolic risks**: Long-term safety is uncertain [^114k8LiV]; avoid supraphysiologic dosing [^112wqAxc].

- **Endometrial safety**: Intravaginal DHEA does not stimulate the endometrium [^116x3xxn].

## Summary of evidence

| **DHEA formulation** | **Recommended dosage** | **Effect on DHEAS levels** | **Clinical efficacy** | **Safety considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Oral DHEA | 25–50 mg/day | Significant increase | No consistent benefit for sexual function | Androgenic side effects |
| Intravaginal prasterone | 6.5 mg nightly | Minimal systemic change | Effective for dyspareunia | Minimal systemic exposure |

### Serum steroid levels during 12-week intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone administration [^116FcPLe]. Menopause (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate serum steroid levels during 12-week daily intravaginal administration of 0%, 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1.0% dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) using 1.3 mL ovules. This research builds on a previous 1-week study that showed no or minimal changes in the serum levels of DHEA and its metabolites after up to daily 1.8% DHEA (23.4 mg) intravaginal administration.

- **Methods**: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study, 218 postmenopausal women (aged 42–74 years) were randomized to receive daily one of four DHEA concentrations intravaginally. Serum steroids were measured using Good Laboratory Practice-validated mass spectrometry technology from samples obtained at each visit.

- **Results**: The serum levels of DHEA and 11 of its metabolites were measured at screening, day 1, and weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. These levels showed no or minimal changes throughout the observation period, with all values remaining well within the normal limits for postmenopausal women. No accumulation of steroid metabolites or change in DHEA bioavailability was detected.

- **Conclusions**: The data indicate that local daily intravaginal administration of DHEA at doses of 3.25–13 mg successfully corrected all signs and symptoms of vaginal atrophy, improved sexual function, and caused no or minimal changes in serum sex steroid levels. All serum levels remained within the normal postmenopausal range, thus avoiding the risks associated with estrogen formulations.

Is DHEA effective for the treatment of HSDD?

Given that DHEA is an important precursor for extragonadal synthesis of estrogen and testosterone in postmenopausal women, that production declines with increasing age, and that studies have demonstrated the association of low levels of DHEA with low desire, oral systemic DHEA has been investigated as a possible treatment for HSDD in postmenopausal women. However, evidence is sparse and inconsistent, resulting from heterogeneous study designs, many of which were limited by small sample sizes and the use of nonvalidated instruments to measure sexual function. Larger studies using validated instruments for the measurement of sexual function have not shown improvement in sexual function in postmenopausal women treated with DHEA. A meta-analysis in 2014 found that DHEA therapy did not improve sexual desire or other aspects of sexual function in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function. Therefore, oral DHEA cannot be recommended for the treatment of HSDD in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function.

In contrast, local vaginal DHEA has only been effective for the treatment of dyspareunia because of vulvovaginal atrophy. An intravaginal DHEA formulation, prasterone (Intrarosa, Endoceutics), has been approved by the FDA and Health Canada for the treatment of dyspareunia due to menopause.

### Androgens for genitourinary and vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^112NbCQU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Testosterone is specifically indicated for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in postmenopausal women when no other underlying causes for this condition are identified.

- **Systemic transdermal testosterone**: Recommended for women with HSDD, particularly when the condition develops after menopause. Transdermal testosterone has no significant impact on lipid profiles.

- **Oral administration**: Increases LDL‐cholesterol, reduces total cholesterol, high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐cholesterol), and triglycerides. It may cause side effects such as acne, hirsutism (excessive body hair), and voice deepening.

- **Health risks**: Can exacerbate cardiovascular alterations, lipid imbalances, and insulin resistance, especially in vulnerable individuals.

- **Contraindications**: Due to the peripheral conversion of androgens into estrogens, its absolute contraindications align with those of estradiol, including hormone‐dependent cancers (e.g. breast cancer, meningioma, and endometrial cancer), as well as thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, and stroke.

Total testosterone levels should be measured before starting treatment as the appropriate dosage should achieve and maintain total testosterone levels within the premenopausal physiological range. Currently, there is no standardized dose or average administration time because the correct dosage should maintain total testosterone levels within the premenopausal physiological range. To this end, a daily dose of around 300 micrograms of testosterone is typically prescribed.

Regarding medical management for menopause, specifically in the management of vulvovaginal atrophy, local estrogen therapy is recommended. The AUA/AUGS/SUFU 2025 guidelines suggest offering vaginal DHEA to patients with genitourinary syndrome of menopause to improve vulvovaginal dryness and/or dyspareunia.

### A randomized trial of oral DHEA treatment for sexual function, well-being, and menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women with low libido [^114yn5ey]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate, DHEAS, are the most abundant steroids in women and decline with age. An association has been shown between low sexual function and low circulating DHEAS levels in women.

- **Aim**: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether restoration of circulating DHEA levels in postmenopausal women to the levels seen in young individuals improves sexual function.

- **Methods**: Ninety-three postmenopausal women not using estrogen therapy were enrolled in a 52-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and received either DHEA 50 mg or placebo (PL) daily.

- **Main outcome measures**: Efficacy was assessed through 26 weeks. The main outcome measures were the change in total satisfying sexual events (SSE) and the change in the Sabbatsberg Sexual Self-Rating Scale (SSS) total score. Secondary measures included the Psychological General Well-Being Questionnaire (PGWB) and the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL). Hormonal levels, adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and clinical labs were evaluated over 52 weeks.

- **Results**: Eighty-five participants (91%) were included in the 26-week efficacy analysis. There were no significant differences between the DHEA and PL groups in the change in total SSE per month or the SSS, PGWB, and MENQOL change scores. Overall AE reports and number of withdrawals due to AEs were similar in both groups; however, more women in the DHEA group experienced androgenic effects such as acne and increased hair growth.

- **Conclusions**: In this study, treatment of postmenopausal women with DHEA did not result in significant improvements in sexual function as compared to placebo.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone status and efficacy of dehydroepiandrosterone supplementation for bone health in anorexia nervosa: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Uazdy]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2022). High credibility.

This study was designed to determine the status of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in women with anorexia nervosa (AN) and to assess the efficacy of DHEA supplementation as a treatment for bone health in women with AN.

- **Objective**: This study was aimed to determine the status of DHEA in women with AN and assess the efficacy of DHEA supplementation.

- **Method**: Studies were retrieved from the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Scopus databases from inception to February 14, 2022. Observational studies that compared serum DHEA levels between women with AN and healthy controls were included for meta-analysis, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of DHEA supplementation on bone mass were reviewed.

- **Results**: Meta-analysis of 15 cross-sectional studies revealed that patients with AN had significantly elevated serum DHEA levels (mean difference (MD) = 311.63 ng/dl; 95% confidence interval (CI), 78.01–545.25) and reduced DHEAS levels (MD = -24.90 μg/dl; 95% CI, -41.72 to -8.07) compared with healthy controls. A systematic review of seven RCTs found that DHEA monotherapy does not improve bone mineral density (BMD) compared with placebo after adjusting for weight gain. While the combination of DHEA and conjugated oral contraceptives has led to increased bone strength and decreased bone loss, the beneficial effect appears to be limited to older adolescents and adults with closed physes. Potential detrimental effects on BMD were identified in younger adolescents with open physes in one study.

- **Discussion**: Due to the lack of apparent benefit of DHEA in women with AN and its potential detrimental effect on BMD in young patients with AN, evidence does not support the use of DHEA supplementation for improving bone health in this population.

### Should women receive androgen replacement therapy, and if so, how [^117BYfbc]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

The available clinical evidence supports the efficacy of testosterone therapy for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) who have undergone a comprehensive clinical evaluation. Although few preparations designed to deliver an appropriate dose of testosterone for women are available, the use of testosterone by women for the management of HSDD is widespread.

Issues that continue to simulate debate in this therapeutic area include whether HSDD is a condition that merits pharmacotherapy, how effective such treatment is, and whether testosterone therapy is safe. Hence, the question remains: Should women receive androgen replacement therapy, and if so, how?

### Hormone therapy for sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women: a systematic review and meta-analysis update [^113GhtXJ]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

- **Key points**:

	- **Question**: What is the effect of hormone therapy (HT) on sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women?

	- **Findings**: Forty-seven randomized controlled trials (35,912 participants) evaluating the effect of HT were included. Estrogen therapy, estrogen plus progestogen therapy, tibolone, and selective estrogen receptor modulators, compared with control, may result in no effect to small benefit on sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Heterogeneity of effects across studies was low to high.

	- **Meaning**: HT may slightly improve sexual function. The effect of HT on sexual function should be considered when discussing treatment options for other menopausal symptoms.

With 71% to 76% of middle-aged women stating that sexual activity is an important aspect of their lives, sexual well-being during menopause is a necessary concern. Sexual function is often described in opposition to female sexual dysfunction (FSD), which is a clinically significant disturbance in a person's ability to respond sexually, or to experience sexual pleasure, that causes distress. Distressing sexual problems peak among middle-aged women, whereas sexual problems without accompanying distress tend to increase with age. The International Menopause Society recommends a biopsychosocial approach of sexual function accounting for fluctuations in health status, neurochemical balance, psychological issues, interpersonal concerns, and sociocultural beliefs and values.

Hormone therapy (HT) is the first-line treatment for moderate to severe genitourinary symptoms of menopause.

Measures of treatment effect

For continuous data, we will calculate the mean difference (MD) between treatment groups where all studies report the outcome in the same way (e.g. HDL cholesterol). If the same outcome is reported on different scales (e.g. quality of life), we will calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD). We will reverse the direction of effect of individual studies, if required, to ensure consistency across trials. We plan to treat ordinal data as continuous data. We will present the 95% confidence interval (CI) for all outcomes.

For dichotomous (or categorical) data, we will use the number of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate the Mantel‐Haenszel (M‐H) risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI.

If a study presents two groups receiving two versions of the same intervention (e.g. two different doses), we will combine the effect measures to avoid loss of information and increase the precision of the effect measure.

In cases where studies do not report data in sufficient detail for the calculation of mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs), we will contact the corresponding author of the study to request the required data (e.g. the mean score for each group, associated standard deviation of the mean for each group, and number of people in each group). If standard deviations (SDs) are not presented in the study reports and cannot be obtained from the study authors, we will estimate the SD of other related variables, for example, standard errors (SEs), CIs, P (probability) values.

Are there normal values and treatment targets?

As testosterone is measured by a variety of methods with different reference standards, it is not possible to establish a universal reference range for premenopausal women. Historically, the adequacy of serum testosterone therapy targeting premenopausal values was estimated using the free androgen index (FAI) with assessment of morning total testosterone (T) and SHBG. These values were "plugged into" the equation to calculate the FAI as follows: FAI = 100 × [Total T (ng/dL)]/SHBG (nmol/l). The concentration of free or bioavailable testosterone was approximated, but this approach has limitations as it assumes predictable binding of testosterone to SHBG at all concentrations.

An attempt to extend this method for determination of a discriminatory level correlated to sexual function and dysfunction was published by Guay et al. in 2004. They studied 60 healthy, menstruating women not on hormonal contraception, ages 20–49 years, without sexual dysfunction as assessed by a validated questionnaire and detailed interview. RIA measurements of morning testosterone, SHBG, and multiple other androgens were assayed; the FAI was calculated. Based on this small cohort, these investigators proposed a clinically useful range of the normal androgen profile in women without sexual dysfunction.

The applicability of this method in clinical practice is limited given today's alternatives for several reasons: (1) the small sample sizes of the original publications, (2) insufficient accuracy and precision of RIA testosterone measurements.

### Testosterone therapy for reduced libido in women [^114JGuQH]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Modest benefit has been shown from transdermal testosterone therapy given to postmenopausal women with reduced sexual desire. An increased frequency of satisfying sexual encounters and intensity of sexual desire and response has been observed in medically and psychiatrically healthy women able to have 2–3 satisfying sexual experiences each month before therapy commences. Women more clearly sexually dysfunctional, in accordance with currently proposed definitions of sexual disorder, have not been studied.

Numerous factors are known to influence women's sexual desire, with mood and feelings towards the partner showing the most robust associations. Identifying women whose low desire might stem from low testosterone activity remains a challenge, as neither serum levels of testosterone nor its metabolites correlate with desire or function. Production of androgens in the brain, sensitivity of the androgen receptors, and activity of cofactors are all potentially relevant confounds. The long-term safety of systemic testosterone, with or without estrogen, is unknown but necessary to study, as women's sexual lives tend to endure as long as there is an active partner.

### Oral dehydroepiandrosterone supplementation modulates spontaneous and growth hormone-releasing hormone-induced growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 secretion in early and late postmenopausal women [^112tfgT8]. Fertility and Sterility (2001). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation on the growth hormone-releasing hormone-growth hormone (GHRH-GH) axis in lean and obese postmenopausal women, a prospective study was conducted.

Postmenopausal women were assessed in a clinical research environment. Thirty-one women were divided into two groups by age (50 to 55 and 60 to 65 years). Within each group, lean and obese patients were considered.

All patients underwent hormonal evaluations before and at the third and sixth month of therapy (50 mg of DHEA orally each day) and a GHRH test (1 µg/kg) before and at the sixth month of treatment. Ultrasound and bone mass density (BMD) examinations were performed before and after the sixth month of therapy.

- **Main outcome measures**: Plasma concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), E1, E2, androstenedione (A), testosterone (T), osteocalcin, GH, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1).

The results showed that the levels of all steroids derived from DHEA metabolism (E1, E2, A, T, DHEAS) and osteocalcin increased in plasma under DHEA supplementation. The protocol also heightened GH and IGF-1 levels. However, GHRH-induced GH and IGF-1 responses were unaltered by DHEA supplementation.

In conclusion, administration of DHEA significantly affects several endocrine parameters in early and late postmenopausal women, independent of body mass index. Our data support the hypothesis that DHEA treatment acts similarly to estrogen-progestin replacement therapy.

### Hormone therapy for sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women: a systematic review and meta-analysis update [^116nZM2m]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis found that hormone therapy (HT) may slightly improve sexual functioning. This potential small benefit should be considered when discussing treatment options for other menopausal symptoms. Future research should explore the role of HT as one component of a more holistic approach to managing low sexual functioning in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

### Female sexual dysfunction: ACOG Practice Bulletin clinical management guidelines for obstetrician-gynecologists, number 213 [^112RG2DS]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for female sexual dysfunction, particularly in the context of genitourinary syndrome of menopause, the 2019 ACOG guidelines recommend offering low-dose systemic hormone therapy. This therapy may involve estrogen alone or in combination with progestin. It is suggested as an alternative to low-dose vaginal estrogen for patients experiencing dyspareunia related to genitourinary syndrome of menopause, as well as those with vasomotor symptoms.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^111n8wfL]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). High credibility.

By 2030, using the age of 50 years as a proxy for menopause, the world population of postmenopausal women will be around 1.2 billion, with an incidence of 47 million reaching menopause each year. In addition, increasing numbers of women experience menopause earlier, with adverse health consequences affecting multiple systems, including those relevant to sexual health, often associated with significant distress.

The terms premature ovarian insufficiency (less than age 40 years) and early menopause (less than age 45 years) describe the spectrum of conditions associated with the loss of ovarian function before the age of natural menopause. Premature ovarian insufficiency and early menopause include both spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency (idiopathic; caused by chromosomal and genetic defects; associated with autoimmune disorders, infections, metabolic disturbances, environmental factors) and induced ovarian failure resulting from interventions (pelvic radiation therapy, chemotherapy, surgical oophorectomy including risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in women with BRCA mutations).

Circulating ovarian hormone levels of both estrogens as well as androgens are abruptly decreased and more substantially reduced after surgical menopause than natural menopause. The prevalence of primary ovarian insufficiency in women younger than 40 years is approximately 1%, younger than 30 years, 0.1%, and younger than 20 years, 0.01%, with little difference by ethnicity. Spontaneous early menopause affects approximately another 5% of women between ages 40 and 45 years.

### DheA on sexual function in Sheehan syndrome: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial [^114SwFTw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

The majority of women with Sheehan syndrome (SS) suffer from sexual dysfunction, with severe androgen deficiency being a major contributory factor. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation has shown variable efficacy in improving female sexual dysfunction (FSD) in several trials; however, studies using DHEA in SS are not available.

- **Objective**: We aimed to study the use of DHEA supplementation in patients with SS.

- **Methods**: In this crossover trial, 28 participants with SS (age 39.7 ± 8.6 years) were divided into two groups using block randomization. They received DHEA supplements (25 mg twice daily) or a matched placebo sequentially for 3 months each. Female Sexual Functioning Index (FSFI) score and serum DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) levels were measured at baseline and after the completion of each phase. Glycemic parameters, lipid profile, and liver enzymes were also measured to assess metabolic side effects.

- **Results**: There was a significant improvement in the FSFI score from baseline to the end of the study in the DHEA group compared with the placebo group (P = 0.006). The mean FSFI score and most individual domains of FSD improved significantly in both groups treated with DHEA (P = 0.001 for each group). In those who received DHEA first, followed by placebo, the FSFI score declined significantly after the placebo phase (P = 0.041) but remained at an acceptable level of sexual functioning. Serum DHEAS levels increased significantly with DHEA treatment, while no significant changes were noted in glycemic index, lipid profile, and liver enzymes.

- **Conclusion**: A short duration of DHEA supplementation appears to improve sexual function in women with SS without significant metabolic side effects.

### Long-term DHEA replacement in primary adrenal insufficiency: a randomized, controlled trial [^112ku72n]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). High credibility.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) are the major circulating adrenal steroids and substrates for peripheral sex hormone biosynthesis. In Addison's disease, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiencies require lifelong replacement, but the associated near-total failure of DHEA synthesis is not typically corrected.

- **Objective and design**: In a double-blind trial, we randomized 106 subjects (44 males, 62 females) with Addison's disease to receive either 50 mg daily of micronized DHEA or placebo orally for 12 months. This was to evaluate its longer-term effects on bone mineral density, body composition, and cognitive function together with well-being and fatigue.

- **Results**: Circulating DHEAS as well as androstenedione rose significantly in both sexes, with testosterone increasing to low normal levels only in females. DHEA reversed ongoing loss of bone mineral density at the femoral neck (P < 0.05) but not at other sites. DHEA enhanced total body (P = 0.02) and truncal (P = 0.017) lean mass significantly, with no change in fat mass. At baseline, subscales of psychological well-being in questionnaires (Short Form-36, General Health Questionnaire-30) were significantly worse in Addison's patients compared to control populations (P < 0.001). One subscale of SF-36 improved significantly (P = 0.004) after DHEA treatment. There was no significant benefit of DHEA treatment on fatigue or cognitive or sexual function. Supraphysiological DHEAS levels were achieved in some older females who experienced mild androgenic side effects.

- **Conclusion**: Although further long-term studies are needed, this study suggests potential benefits of DHEA replacement in certain parameters in patients with Addison's disease.

### Impact of DHEA supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing dose and duration effects [^113xmcXW]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

All statistical analyses were performed using Stata software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Effect sizes were reported as weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A two-tailed P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Pooled estimates were calculated using the generic inverse variance method under a random-effects model to account for variability among studies.

Heterogeneity was assessed using the I^2 statistic and Chi-square test. An I^2 value greater than 50% or a P value less than 0.10 was interpreted as indicating substantial heterogeneity. To explore potential sources of heterogeneity, subgroup analyses were conducted based on participants' mean age, intervention duration, DHEA dosage, and population characteristics.

Sensitivity analysis was performed by sequentially excluding individual studies to evaluate the robustness of the overall findings. Potential publication bias was assessed using visual inspection of funnel plots and quantified by Egger's regression test.

### Educational programs and sexual counselling for postmenopausal sexual dysfunction: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111weRgc]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Female sexual dysfunction has a high prevalence among women in the postmenopausal period. Factors such as comorbidities and chronic illnesses, along with psychological and interpersonal factors, significantly contribute to this prevalence. Sexual counselling educational programs have demonstrated positive sexual behavioral changes and should be considered the first-line approach to addressing female sexual dysfunction in this demographic.

- **Aim**: To review the evidence of the efficacy of sexual counselling educational programs for sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women.

- **Methods**: A systematic search was performed in February 2021 across electronic databases including MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and Scopus. Additional sources included unpublished studies, ongoing clinical trials, conference abstracts, journal archives, dissertations and theses, gray literature, and free searches on the Google Scholar search engine. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of sexual educational programs in postmenopausal women were selected. Two independent researchers conducted study selection and data extraction. Extracted data encompassed author identification, publication date, geographic location, study population and sample size, type of intervention, sexual function evaluation tool, and outcomes. Studies using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) to evaluate sexual function were included in the meta-analysis, with the mean difference calculated.

- **Outcomes**: Improvement of sexual function in postmenopausal women.

- **Results**: We included eight studies in the systematic review, consisting of six randomized and two nonrandomized studies.

### Safety and efficacy of testosterone for women: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trial data [^114CZ4De]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

The benefits and risks of testosterone treatment for women with diminished sexual well-being remain controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess potential benefits and risks of testosterone for women.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science for blinded, randomised controlled trials of testosterone treatment of at least 12 weeks' duration, completed between January 1, 1990, and December 10, 2018. We also searched drug registration applications to the European Medicine Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration to identify any unpublished data. Primary outcomes were the effects of testosterone on sexual function, cardiometabolic variables, cognitive measures, and musculoskeletal health.

- **Findings**: Our search strategy retrieved 46 reports of 36 randomised controlled trials comprising 8,480 participants. Our meta-analysis showed that, compared with placebo or a comparator (e.g. estrogen, with or without progestogen), testosterone significantly increased sexual function, including satisfactory sexual event frequency (mean difference 0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.18), sexual desire (standardised mean difference 0.36, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.50), pleasure (mean difference 6.86, 95% CI 5.19 to 8.52), arousal (standardised mean difference 0.28, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.35), orgasm (standardised mean difference 0.25, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.32), and responsiveness (standardised mean difference 0).

### Managing menopause [^115ojchb]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for menopause, specifically concerning the evaluation of sexual dysfunction, the SOGC 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining a brief sexual screening history as part of the medical history of menopausal females. Interventions should be pursued only if the patient expresses distress about the problem.

### Clinically relevant changes in sexual desire, satisfying sexual activity, and personal distress as measured by the profile of female sexual function, sexual activity log, and personal distress scale in postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder [^116qG1gY]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Transdermal testosterone patch (TTP) treatment produced statistically significant improvements in satisfying sexual activity (SSA), sexual desire, and personal distress in postmenopausal women suffering from hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), but the clinical significance of these changes was not determined.

- **Aim**: To quantify the magnitude of change in three principal outcome measures determined by HSDD patients as associated with the perception of meaningful benefit with TTP therapy.

- **Methods**: The criteria for defining responders were determined using anchoring methodology and receiver operating characteristics analysis to establish minimum important differences (MIDs) in a representative subsample of 132 patients in two randomized, controlled trials in surgically menopausal women with HSDD (N = 1,094). Perceived benefit was established based on the question "Overall, would you say that you experienced a meaningful benefit from the study patches?" These data defined responders and established MIDs for changes in sexual desire, SSA, and personal distress. The MIDs were applied to the two trials to establish responder rates in each treatment group.

- **Main outcome measures**: Changes in score that correspond to the MID for sexual desire, SSA, and personal distress, and responder rates in each treatment group based upon these values.

- **Results**: Increases in frequency of SSA of greater than one activity per four weeks, increases in sexual desire score of ≥ 8.9, and decreases in the personal distress score of ≥ 20.0 were identified as threshold improvements.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^117GX1vK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Recommendations regarding other androgenic preparations: Systemic dehydroepiandrosterone is not associated with significant improvement in libido or sexual function in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function and cannot be recommended for women with HSDD (Level IA, Grade A). In the absence of vulvovaginal atrophy, vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone has not been tested and thus cannot be recommended for treatment of HSDD (Expert Opinion).

- **Recommendations regarding the design of future trials of physiologically dosed testosterone**:
	- More adequately powered, double-blind RCTs, without selection bias and with consistent reporting of standardized outcomes, are needed to comprehensively establish the benefits and risks of testosterone therapy for women. For studies of testosterone and FSD, relief of the distress associated with sexual dysfunction is a primary aim of FSD treatment. Presently, no questionnaire covers all domains of female sexual function such that a combination of domains from different questionnaires should be used. Satisfying sexual events should no longer be used as a primary efficacy measurement in clinical trials of women with FSD. A set of clearly defined core outcomes needs to be established. There is a need for an instrument to assess sexual function with the following characteristics: general applicability; not disease-specific; high discriminant validity between women diagnosed with FSD and sexually functional women; validated, to measure FSD per se and as an instrument to screen for and diagnose FSD.

### Impact of DHEA supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing dose and duration effects [^115mTG81]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

This meta-analysis found that DHEA supplementation at doses of 50 mg/day or higher significantly increased testosterone levels and, in participants aged 60 years or older, significantly elevated estradiol levels. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to assess the effects of DHEA supplementation on both testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women, providing a foundation for future interventions and clinical practice. Understanding the optimal DHEA dosage based on specific health conditions is essential to guide rational therapy for postmenopausal women.

### Lack of influence of dyspareunia on the beneficial effect of intravaginal prasterone (dehydroepiandrosterone, DHEA) on sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women [^115bATWR]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2014). High credibility.

We have previously observed that intravaginal prasterone (dehydroepiandrosterone, DHEA) improved all domains of female sexual dysfunction (FSD).

- **Aim**: Investigate the influence of moderate/severe pain at sexual activity (dyspareunia) (MSD) at baseline on FSD following prasterone administration.

- **Methods**: The effect of daily administration of prasterone (0, 3.25mg, 6.5mg, or 13mg) for 12 weeks on FSD in 215 postmenopausal women with or without MSD at baseline was evaluated in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial.

- **Main outcome measures**: Differences were examined on desire, arousal, and orgasm.

- **Results**: Comparable benefits were observed in women not having MSD (n = 56) vs. those having MSD (n = 159). The benefits over placebo in prasterone-treated women for desire, avoiding intimacy, and vaginal dryness, as well as for the total sexual domain of the MENQOL (Menopause Specific Quality of Life) questionnaire, ranged between 18.0% and 38.2% with P values of < 0.05 or < 0.01 except in one out of 12 subgroups. For the arousal/sensation, arousal/lubrication, and summary score of the ASF (Abbreviated Sexual Function) questionnaire, in the MSD+ group, improvements of 64.2% (P = 0.01), 118% (P = 0.001), and 31.1% (P = 0.03) were observed over placebo, respectively, while similar differences (58.0%, 67.6%, and 32.1%) did not reach statistical significance in the MSD- group having up to only 44 prasterone-treated women compared with 119 in the MSD+ group.

- **Conclusions**: No MSD at baseline does not apparently affect the effects of intravaginal prasterone on sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women.

### International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^115wW8UD]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

The brain is one of the most important targets for sex hormones throughout the lifespan. Some research supports the role of estradiol in the central modulation of sexual desire. Other research demonstrates that testosterone has enduring influences on many neural and behavioral functions via both genomic and nongenomic actions. The neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying the influence of testosterone on sexual behavior in women are still not completely understood. It remains unclear whether testosterone positively modulates sexual desire in women through a direct stimulation of the androgen receptor (AR) or through its conversion to estrogen and subsequent binding to estrogen receptors.

Consistent with preclinical data, two lines of evidence point toward a direct, AR-mediated effect of testosterone on sexual behavior in women. One is based on the fact that estrogen-alone therapy in postmenopausal women was associated with a small to moderate improvement in sexual function, particularly in pain, with no effect on libido, sexual desire, and interest. Second, in a study of postmenopausal women using transdermal estradiol and testosterone gel randomized to an aromatase inhibitor or placebo, total and free testosterone in the physiological range was associated with improvement in sexual satisfaction, well-being, and mood. Aromatase inhibition did not appear to influence the outcome. Existing evidence therefore suggests that testosterone conversion into estradiol is not necessary to exert its beneficial effects on sexuality.

### Effect of dehydroepiandrosterone therapy on cognitive performance among postmenopausal women: A systematic review of randomized clinical trial data [^111K2Q87]. Menopause (2023). Low credibility.

Whether dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation improves cognitive performance in older women is uncertain. Nonetheless, DHEA supplements are readily available over the counter in several countries and are potentially being used to prevent cognitive decline and dementia.

This systematic review was conducted to evaluate the effect of exogenous DHEA on cognitive performance in postmenopausal women. Databases including Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for studies of postmenopausal women until November 30, 2022. Eligible studies were required to be randomized clinical trials, at least single blind, have a placebo or comparator arm, and be published in English. The risk of bias of the included studies was assessed by the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.

Of the 15 articles retrieved for full-text review, four met the inclusion criteria. In all studies, DHEA was administered as a 50-mg oral daily dose, and all were double blind with an identical placebo. Three were placebo-controlled, crossover studies, and one was a parallel-group clinical trial. The only positive outcome was limited to a 4-week crossover study in which DHEA statistically significantly enhanced five of six tests of visual-spatial performance compared with placebo in 24 cognitively normal postmenopausal women. Improvement in cognitive performance with DHEA treatment over the placebo group was not seen in any other study.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^111QMrMq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

- **Clinical care of postmenopausal women**: Recommendations regarding full assessment of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) before commencing testosterone therapy are necessary. FSD, including hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD), and orgasmic disorder/dysfunction, arises from multiple etiologies. These include biopsychosocial factors such as neuroendocrine imbalance, physical ill health or disease, interpersonal difficulties, psychological distress, and sexually repressive cultural or religious values (Grade C). Treatments should follow this biopsychosocial model and include options such as hormone therapies and other pharmacologic agents, psychotherapy, or multimodal treatments that combine both (Grade B).

- **Recommendations regarding testosterone therapy and postmenopausal women**: The only evidence-based indication for the use of testosterone in women is for the treatment of postmenopausal women diagnosed with HSDD after formal biopsychosocial assessment (Level I, Grade A). There is an unmet need for the provision and approval of testosterone treatments specific to women, formulated to approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women (Expert Opinion). When appropriate female testosterone preparations are unavailable, off-label prescribing of an approved male formulation is reasonable, provided hormone concentrations are maintained within the physiological female range (Expert Opinion). Compounded "bioidentical" testosterone therapy cannot be recommended for the treatment of HSDD due to a lack of evidence for efficacy and safety.

### The current outlook for testosterone in the management of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in postmenopausal women [^111MrMrT]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is a common clinical problem in women, especially those who have experienced surgical menopause. Because androgen levels decline with age and drop dramatically following bilateral oophorectomy, it has been hypothesized that reduced levels of testosterone are related to diminished desire.

As presented at a continuing medical education satellite symposium during the 2008 annual meeting of the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health, this review aimed to assess the state of knowledge about the physiological effects of testosterone in postmenopausal women, the effects of transdermal testosterone delivery in surgically menopausal women with HSDD, and ongoing studies of a transdermal testosterone gel.

- **Methods**: A review of the pertinent literature, including recent presentations.

- **Main outcome measures**: Results from the Women's International Study of Health and Sexuality; and studies utilizing the Brief Index of Sexual Functioning for Women, the Psychological General Well-Being Index, and validated instruments that assess female sexual function: the Sexual Activity Log, the Profile of Female Sexual Function, and the Personal Distress Scale.

- **Results**: Surgically menopausal women receiving testosterone experience significant increases in total satisfying sexual activity versus women receiving placebo, significant improvement in all domains of sexual function, and decreases in personal distress, with a favorable safety profile.

- **Conclusions**: Testosterone deficiency may be considered among the underlying causes of HSDD.

### Impact of DHEA supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing dose and duration effects [^112RyZ1D]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

This meta-analysis provides a comprehensive overview and high-quality evidence on the effects of DHEA supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women, with no evidence of bias detected. Nonetheless, our review has some limitations. The participants in the included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) represented a heterogeneous population, including healthy postmenopausal women, those with primary Sjögren's syndrome, and individuals with mild to moderate cognitive impairment, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. Moreover, significant heterogeneity was observed across studies, warranting cautious interpretation of the results.

- **Subgroup analyses**: Although conducted to explore sources of heterogeneity, some factors, such as differences in types of DHEA supplementation, study settings, and population characteristics, were not fully addressed and could have influenced the outcomes. These variables should be carefully considered when recommending DHEA supplementation for increasing estradiol and testosterone levels in postmenopausal women.

- **Influence of metabolic factors**: DHEA metabolism can be affected by conditions like hepatic impairment and other comorbidities, which were not consistently reported or controlled for in the included studies. One study focused on postmenopausal women with primary Sjögren's syndrome and had a matched control group, allowing its inclusion in the analysis. However, the potential influence of such metabolic factors on DHEA supplementation outcomes could introduce complexity in interpreting results.

### Androgen replacement therapy in women [^116tE8Lo]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this paper is a review of the literature regarding androgen replacement therapy in women. The design involved a review of the MEDLINE database along with references from articles.

Conclusions indicate that androgens have a significant impact on sexual function, bone health, muscle mass, body composition, mood, energy levels, and overall sense of well-being. Androgen insufficiency has been clearly demonstrated in patients with conditions such as hypopituitarism, adrenalectomy, oophorectomy, and in some women who are placed on oral estrogen therapy, which increases sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels and lowers the free and bioavailable forms of testosterone (T).

Symptoms of androgen insufficiency in women may include a diminished sense of well-being, low mood, fatigue, and hypoactive sexual desire disorder characterized by decreased libido or decreased sexual receptivity and pleasure, causing significant personal distress. The preponderance of evidence from clinical trials supports a correlation between decreased endogenous androgen levels and these symptoms, with alleviation of many symptoms through the administration of testosterone or, in some cases, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).

Currently, there are no Food and Drug Administration-approved androgen preparations available for treating androgen insufficiency in women. The safety profile of androgens, in doses used for treating hypoactive sexual desire disorder, has been excellent, with only mild acne and hirsutism observed in a minority of patients.

Before prescribing testosterone therapy, clinicians should obtain informed consent. They should explain that, for women, it is an off-label therapy. Counseling regarding the benefits and risks through shared decision-making, recognizing the patient's goals and concerns, and providing detailed documentation of the discussion is crucial.

Dosing should be targeted to achieve testosterone concentrations in the physiologic premenopausal range. In a study of premenopausal women with no complaints of sexual dysfunction intended to define normal female androgen values, women aged 20–29 years, 30–39 years, and 40–49 years had testosterone values ranging from 45.5 to 57.5 ng/dl, 27.6 to 39.8 ng/dl, and 27.0 to 38.6 ng/dl, respectively. This range is approximately 1/10th–1/15th of the systemic testosterone values in healthy men (range 300–800 ng/dl). Thus, treatment using any male product for women should be initiated using one-tenth of the recommended starting dose for men.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone: A springboard hormone for female sexuality [^112GL3Rd]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the role of adrenal androgenic hormone precursors in female sexual function. The design involved a review of literature focusing on sexual function and the androgen precursor hormones dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS).

The results indicate that the C(19) steroid DHEA serves as both an ovarian and adrenal androgen precursor hormone, whereas DHEAS is synthesized solely in the adrenal cortex. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate secretion commences at age 10, reaches its peak at age 20, and then declines. Both men and women experiencing adrenal insufficiency and the elderly exhibit low DHEAS levels. Administration of dehydroepiandrosterone at 50 mg per day increases DHEAS levels. In women, but not in men, this increase in DHEAS levels supports the additional production of downstream androgens, including testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, androstenedione, as well as androstenediol glucuronide. With an improved female androgenic profile, women with adrenal insufficiency have increased sexual thoughts and fantasies, along with enhanced mood and well-being. In individuals over age 65, DHEAS levels rise in both men and women with DHEA supplementation at 50 mg per day. However, only in women were these higher DHEAS levels accompanied by an increase in testosterone levels. Women over age 70 experienced increased libido, enhanced sexual satisfaction, a 26% reduction in bone resorption, and a 10% decrease in skin pigmentation.

The conclusion is that the female adrenal androgen deficiency syndrome, characterized by low serum DHEAS levels, may be ameliorated by DHEA supplements that elevate levels of DHEAS and downstream androgens, which are crucial for female sexuality.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone supplementation in elderly men: a meta-analysis study of placebo-controlled trials [^112a9y7M]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Age-related dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) deficiency has been associated with a broad range of biological abnormalities in males. Our objective was to meta-analyze all double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of oral DHEA supplementation in comparison with placebo on sexual and metabolic outcomes in elderly men.

An extensive Medline, Embase, and Cochrane search was performed, including the following keywords: DHEA, RCTs, and males. Only double-blind, placebo-controlled trials performed in elderly men were included. Data extraction was performed independently by two of the authors, and conflicts were resolved by a third investigator. The quality of RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane criteria.

Of 220 retrieved articles, 25 were included in the study. The available RCTs enrolled 1,353 elderly men, with a mean follow-up of 36 weeks. DHEA supplementation was associated with a reduction in fat mass, with a standardized mean difference of -0.35 [-0.65 to -0.05]; p = 0.02. However, the association with fat mass disappeared in a multivariate regression model after adjusting for DHEA-related metabolite increases, such as total testosterone and estradiol. In contrast to what was observed for fat mass, no effect of DHEA supplementation in comparison with placebo was observed for various clinical parameters, including lipid and glycemic metabolism, bone health, sexual function, and quality of life.

The present meta-analysis of intervention trials concludes here.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^113stVjP]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

Total testosterone levels should be measured before initiating therapy to exclude women with midrange to high baseline testosterone concentrations. SHBG should also be measured as women with levels greater than the normal range are less likely to benefit from therapy. High SHBG can be seen in healthy women but is also associated with the use of oral estrogens, including estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives, thyroid replacement, and untreated hyperthyroidism. In women with high SHBG and unmodifiable factors (e.g. essential thyroid replacement), a trial of testosterone therapy is still worthwhile.

Total testosterone levels should be assessed 3–6 weeks after initiating therapy to enable titration and ensure the patient is not applying an excessive dose. If the dose is increased, based on clinical response and blood level, total testosterone should be repeated within 6 weeks. Different preparations will have different absorption rates and hence different pharmacokinetics that determine when the peak blood level is achieved. As this is unknown for most products in women, the goal of testing blood levels is to prevent excessive dosing but not to treat to a target blood level of testosterone. Clinicians should ensure that the total testosterone does not significantly exceed the upper limit of the reference range for normal premenopausal women indicated by the patient's laboratory. When testosterone levels are maintained in the premenopausal range, androgenic side effects are rare. At supraphysiological levels, testosterone can cause acne, hirsutism, and deepening of the voice.

### Androgens for genitourinary and vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^116iHkKF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

As described above, the loss of female hormones is associated with fatigue, muscle and joint pain, weight gain, hot flashes, and night sweats. In some cases, androgen therapy has been used to reduce these symptoms. Androgens are 19-carbon (C19) steroids, hormones primarily synthesized by the adrenal glands, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), its sulfated form (DHEAS), as well as androstenedione (A4), which is a weak androgenic steroid hormone of 19 carbons. These adrenal androgens have minimal intrinsic activity but act as precursors to testosterone and estrogens.

In women, the adrenal glands contribute 30% to 50% of circulating testosterone, while the ovaries synthesize both DHEA and testosterone. Only testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) activate the androgen receptor, whereas other androgens function as precursors. DHEA is produced by both the adrenal glands and ovaries, with additional input from DHEAS conversion. A4 and testosterone also originate from both glands, with circulating testosterone existing in free form or bound to albumin and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).

DHEA, administered locally, can be converted to testosterone and estrogen. Its use may increase these hormone levels in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, potentially alleviating symptoms and improving well-being. While its effect on menopausal symptoms remains uncertain, DHEA may slightly enhance sexual function compared to placebo due to its androgenic effects.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone for women in the peri- or postmenopausal phase [^115QVnUc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

During menopause, a decreasing ovarian follicular response generally causes a fluctuation and eventual decrease in estrogen levels, which can lead to the development of various perimenopausal and postmenopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is one of the main precursors of androgens, which in turn are converted to testosterone and estrogens. It is possible that the administration of DHEA may increase estrogen and testosterone levels in peri- and postmenopausal women to alleviate their symptoms and improve general wellbeing and sexual function, for example, libido, dyspareunia, and satisfaction.

However, treatment with DHEA is controversial as there is uncertainty about its effectiveness and safety. This review aims to clearly outline the evidence for DHEA in the treatment of menopausal symptoms and evaluate its effectiveness and safety by combining the results of randomized controlled trials.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of administering DHEA to women with menopausal symptoms in the peri- or postmenopausal phase.

- **Search methods**: The databases that we searched on 3 June 2014, with no language restrictions applied, were the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and LILACS. We also searched conference abstracts and citation lists in the ISI Web of Knowledge. Ongoing trials were searched in the trials registers, and reference lists of retrieved articles were checked.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^111hdRhD]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is strongly recommended for women with early menopause, at least until the age of natural menopause, for relieving symptoms and preventing long-term medical conditions. Physiological replacement of estrogen (and progesterone if the uterus is intact) is essential for health and quality of life. The controversies surrounding the use of MHT concerning benefits and risks should not apply to the premature and early menopause population.

Although there is evidence supporting the use of estrogens with adequate endometrial protection with progestogens (when the uterus is present) in women with premature and early menopause, there is a lack of evidence supporting the use of MHT for the management of sexual dysfunction in this population. The guiding principles are to avoid decreasing testosterone by using transdermal estradiol rather than oral estrogens, because transdermal preparations exert minimal effects on SHBG and free testosterone levels, and modest improvement in sexual function of early postmenopausal women. Another approach to maintaining testosterone levels is the use of a bioidentical (biologically identical to the hormones produced in vivo) estradiol-containing contraceptive pill (estradiol valerate and dienogest, estradiol and nomegestrol acetate) in late reproductive age women requiring contraception, taking into account the androgenicity of some synthetic progestogens.

The Fourth International Consultation of Sexual Medicine recommended conducting studies of testosterone therapy for women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder.

### Lack of effect of intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA, prasterone) on the endometrium in postmenopausal women [^116x3xxn]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

This study aims to evaluate the effects of intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA, prasterone) on the endometrium in postmenopausal women.

- **Methods**: Intravaginal DHEA (6.5 mg) was administered daily for 52 weeks to 422 women who had endometrial biopsy at baseline and the end of the study. An additional group of 15 women was similarly treated for 26 to 52 weeks. Participants in three other studies received 3.25 mg (n = 126), 6.5 mg (n = 129), or 13 mg (n = 30) of DHEA for 12 weeks, with biopsies conducted both at baseline and the end of the study. Endometrial biopsy samples were available for 668 women at baseline and study conclusion, with sufficient material for analysis.

- **Results**: Endometrial atrophy or inactive endometrium was found in all 668 women treated with intravaginal DHEA. Similar atrophy was observed in 119 of 121 participants with sufficient material for analysis who received a placebo.

- **Conclusions**: After the cessation of estradiol secretion by the ovaries at menopause, estrogens produced by mechanisms of intracrinology are inactivated intracellularly at their site of formation and action. This inactivation maintains serum estradiol at biologically inactive concentrations, avoiding stimulation of the endometrium. The absence of enzymes capable of transforming DHEA into estrogens in the endometrium explains the typical endometrial atrophy in all normal postmenopausal women, despite variable concentrations of circulating endogenous DHEA. According to these mechanisms, the inactive sex steroid precursor DHEA administered intravaginally acts exclusively in the vagina.

### Hormone therapy for sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women [^111y6DsK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The perimenopausal and postmenopausal periods are associated with many symptoms, including sexual complaints. This review updates a previous review first published in 2013.

- **Objectives**: We aimed to assess the effect of hormone therapy on sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

- **Search methods**: On 19 December 2022, we searched the Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, ISI Web of Science, two trials registries, and OpenGrey. We also conducted reference checking and contacted experts in the field for any additional studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials that compared hormone therapy to either placebo or no intervention (control), using any validated assessment tool to evaluate sexual function. Hormone therapies considered included estrogen alone; estrogen in combination with progestogens; synthetic steroids (e.g. tibolone); selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), such as raloxifene and bazedoxifene; and SERMs in combination with estrogen.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. We analyzed data using mean differences (MDs) and standardized mean differences (SMDs). The primary outcome was the sexual function score, while secondary outcomes included the domains of sexual response: desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

- **Main results**: We included 36 studies (23,299 women; 12,225 in the intervention group; 11,074 in the control group).

### Dehydroepiandrosterone supplementation and bone turnover in middle-aged to elderly men [^116r6HoN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

In the present placebo-controlled, double-blind study, we assessed the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation (90 mg orally per day) on bone turnover in 43 healthy men aged 56–80 years. Placebo or steroid was given for 6 months, followed by a 1-month washout period and then a further 6 months of the opposite agent. Serum samples were collected at baseline and at 3, 6, 7, and 13 months, and assayed for procollagen peptide, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin, all markers of bone formation. Measurements were also made of serum cortisol, DHEA/DHEA-S, E2, and free and total T. First void, fasting urine was collected at baseline, 6, 7, and 13 months and assessed for deoxypyridinoline, a marker of bone resorption.

Mean serum DHEA and DHEA-S levels in treated men were increased approximately 3-fold (approximately 2.2 ng/ml to approximately 6 ng/ml) and 4.5-fold (approximately 1000 ng/ml to approximately 4500 ng/ml), respectively, after 6 months and returned to baseline after washout. Similarly, circulating E2 concentrations were increased 1.4-fold (from approximately 16 pg/ml to 23 pg/ml; P < 0.001), a finding not observed with any other measured hormone. Bone marker levels remained remarkably constant at each sampling interval: procollagen peptide at approximately 8.0 ng/ml; bone-specific alkaline phosphatase at approximately 21.0 U/liter; deoxypyridinoline at approximately 4.5 nmol/mmol Cr. Osteocalcin showed a transient reduction from approximately 10.2 to 6.2 ng/ml (P < 0.005 to P < 0.001) at 3 months, but this decline was observed in both treated and control groups.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^111QYQER]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

Do androgen levels correlate with sexual function and predict HSDD?

Research determining the associations between androgens (testosterone and its metabolite 5α-DHT) has been limited by low levels in women, insufficient sensitivity and specificity of immunoassays to evaluate these low levels, and, until recently, a high degree of cross-reactivity between testosterone and other circulating steroids. The limited available data indicate weak, independent associations between testosterone (measured by LC-MS/MS) with sexual desire, orgasm, and self-image in premenopausal women and testosterone (measured by the RIA) with sexual desire, arousal, and masturbation frequency in midlife women.

Early follicular phase levels of total and free testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) have been positively correlated with self-reported sexual desire in premenopausal women aged 25–44 years not using hormonal contraception, whereas no correlation was found in women with HSDD. A recent study of women aged 18–39 years, with regular menstrual cycles, not using any sex steroid therapy and had sex steroids measured by LC-MS/MS, found weak positive associations between both sexual desire and sexual pleasure with DHEA as well as androstenedione. Orgasm was positively correlated with both testosterone as well as androstenedione. All analyses were adjusted for age, body mass index, cycle stage, smoking, parity, partner status, and psychoactive medication.

In a study examining HSDD in postmenopausal women, the prevalence was significantly greater in surgically menopausal women.

### Endogenous dehydroepiandrosterone and depression in postmenopausal women: A systematic review of observational studies [^116ByiyR]. Menopause (2023). Low credibility.

The associations between endogenous dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) and depression in older women are uncertain. However, DHEA supplements are widely available over the counter in some countries, and some people may be taking DHEA with the hope of positive mood effects.

This systematic review aimed to investigate the association between endogenous DHEA/DHEAS blood concentrations and depression/depressive symptoms in community-dwelling postmenopausal women.

- **Evidence review**: Searches were conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases for observational studies with at least 100 community-dwelling participants until March 9, 2022. The bibliographies of retrieved articles were manually searched. The studies published in English and meeting the inclusion criteria were included in the review. The risk of bias was assessed with the modified Hoy tool for cross-sectional designs and the Joanna Briggs Institute modified critical appraisal checklist for cohort studies.

- **Findings**: Of the 30 articles retrieved for full-text review, 14 met the criteria for inclusion. Seven studies were cross-sectional, six were longitudinal, and one had both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Five of eight cross-sectional studies found no association between DHEAS and depression, whereas three studies reported an inverse association. Similarly, most of the studies (n = 4) with longitudinal data reported no association, whereas two studies reported either an inverse association or mixed results for DHEAS and depression severity.

### Clinical review: DHEA replacement for postmenopausal women [^111S1Cxo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

It has been proposed that, because dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate, DHEAS, are important precursors for estrogen as well as androgen production, treatment with DHEA is a physiologically based strategy for alleviating hormone deficiency symptoms in postmenopausal women. We have summarized the physiology of DHEA in women and reviewed the findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of DHEA therapy in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function.

- **Evidence acquisition**: We reviewed the medical literature for key papers investigating DHEA physiology and RCTs on the use of DHEA in postmenopausal women through November 2010. The focus was on sexual function, well-being, metabolic parameters, and cognition as study endpoints.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Although cross-sectional studies have indicated a link between low DHEA levels and impaired sexual function, well-being, and cognitive performance in postmenopausal women, placebo-controlled RCTs do not show benefits of oral DHEA for any of these outcomes or favorable effects on lipids and carbohydrate metabolism.

- **Conclusions**: Taken together, findings from this review of the published literature do not support the use of DHEA in postmenopausal women at this time.

### Role of estrogens and estrogen-like compounds in female sexual function and dysfunction [^116ngBNE]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Sex steroids are important in female sexual function and dysfunction. The aim of this study is to review the role of estrogens in the physiology and pathophysiology of female sexual functioning, as well as the evidence for the efficacy of estrogen therapy for female sexual dysfunction. This review serves to update the previously published International Society of Sexual Medicine Consensus on this topic.

- **Methods**: Panel members reviewed the published literature using online databases for studies pertaining to estrogen in female sexual function and dysfunction. Particular attention was given to clinical trials that reported on sexual function outcomes in women treated with estrogen.

- **Main outcome measures**: The quality of data published in the literature and recommendations were based on the GRADES system.

- **Results**: Observational studies that have considered relationship factors and physical or mental health have reported that these factors contribute more to sexual functioning than menopausal status or estrogen levels. Few clinical trials have investigated estrogen therapy with sexual function as a primary outcome. The available data do not support systemic estrogen therapy for the treatment of female sexual dysfunction. Topical vaginal estrogen therapy improves sexual function in postmenopausal women with vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) and is considered first-line treatment of VVA. Oral ospemifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is effective for the treatment of VVA and might have independent systemic effects on female sexual function.

The conclusion highlights that for sexual problems, the treatment of VVA remains the main focus.

### Hormone therapy for sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women: a systematic review and meta-analysis update [^116fXzN3]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

Estrogen therapy, estrogen plus progestogen therapy, tibolone, and selective estrogen receptor modulators, when compared with control, may slightly improve sexual function. This finding should be considered when discussing treatment options for other menopausal symptoms.

### Long-term low-dose dehydroepiandrosterone oral supplementation in early and late postmenopausal women modulates endocrine parameters and synthesis of neuroactive steroids [^116Sw3oK]. Fertility and Sterility (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a low-dose DHEA supplementation on hormonal parameters in early and late postmenopausal women.

- **Design**: Prospective case study.

- **Setting**: Postmenopausal women in a clinical research environment.

- **Patients**: Twenty postmenopausal women were divided into two groups according to age (50–55 and 60–65 years).

- **Interventions**: All patients underwent hormonal evaluation before and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of therapy (25 mg/d of DHEA orally). Pelvic ultrasound examination and Kupperman score were performed before and after 3, 6, and 12 months of therapy.

- **Main outcome measures**:
	- **Androgens and related hormones**: Plasma DHEA, DHEAS, androstenedione (A), T, dihydrotestosterone.
	- **Estrogens and progesterone**: Estrone (E1), E2, 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), P.
	- **Neurosteroids and peptides**: Allopregnanolone, beta-endorphin.
	- **Globulin and gonadotropins**: Sexual hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), LH, FSH.
	- **Other hormones**: Cortisol (F), growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1).

- **Results**: The levels of all the steroids derived from DHEA metabolism increased in plasma with DHEA administration. Neurosteroids (namely allopregnanolone) and endorphin showed increased plasma levels, whereas both gonadotropins were significantly reduced. Endometrial thickness did not change throughout the study period.

- **Conclusions**: Administration of low doses (25 mg) of DHEA positively modulates several endocrine parameters in early and late postmenopausal women, inducing the increase of the androgenic, estrogenic, and progestogenic milieu and reducing climacteric symptoms, similarly to estroprogestin replacement therapy. These data suggest that DHEA supplementation could be beneficial in managing postmenopausal symptoms.

### The effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)/DHEA-sulfate (DHEAS) on the contraction responses of the clitoral cavernous smooth muscle from female rabbits [^115CkgkH]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a multifunctional steroid increasingly available as a supplement aimed at improving libido and well-being in postmenopausal women. Along with its sulfate version, DHEA-sulfate (DHEAS), it is the most abundant steroid in humans. The clitoris plays a crucial role in the female sexual response, with increased vascular response during sexual arousal leading to erection.

- **Aims**: To elucidate the direct effects of DHEA/DHEAS on the vasomotor reactivity of rabbit clitoral cavernosum.

- **Methods**: Twenty New Zealand white female rabbits, each weighing approximately 2.5–3 kg, were used in the study.

- **Main outcome measures**: The contractile response of clitoral cavernous smooth muscle strips to phenylephrine (PE; 10^(-9)-10^(-4) M) was observed. Additionally, the effects of DHEA/DHEAS on phenylephrine-induced contraction and/or acetylcholine-induced relaxation of phenylephrine-induced contraction were measured.

- **Results**: DHEA/DHEAS did not elicit any remarkable response in the resting state. However, both DHEA and DHEAS evoked dose-dependent relaxations of PE-induced contraction. The contractile responses to high potassium were significantly decreased in the DHEA/DHEAS-pretreated strips compared to the non-treated strips. Additionally, contractions induced by Bay K 8644 (10^(-7)-10^(-6) M) treatment were also significantly inhibited by DHEA/DHEAS. DHEA-induced relaxation responses were stronger than those induced by DHEAS. Various K channel blockers, tetraethylammonium (T…

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^113Jp8fa]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). High credibility.

The Global Consensus Position Statement on the Use of Testosterone Therapy for Women (Global Position Statement) recommended testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).

- **Aim**: To provide a clinical practice guideline for the use of testosterone, including identification of patients, laboratory testing, dosing, post-treatment monitoring, and follow-up care in women with HSDD.

- **Methods**: The International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health appointed a multidisciplinary panel of experts who performed a literature review of original research, meta-analyses, review papers, and consensus guidelines regarding testosterone use in women. Consensus was reached using a modified Delphi method.

- **Outcomes**: A clinically useful guideline following a biopsychosocial assessment and treatment approach for the safe and efficacious use of testosterone in women with HSDD was developed. This included measurement, indications, formulations, prescribing, dosing, monitoring, and follow-up.

- **Results**: Although the Global Position Statement endorses testosterone therapy for only postmenopausal women, limited data also support use in late reproductive age premenopausal women, consistent with the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health Process of Care for the Management of HSDD. Systemic transdermal testosterone is recommended for women with HSDD not primarily related to modifiable factors or comorbidities such as relationship or mental health problems. Available research supports a moderate therapeutic benefit.

### Clinical review: The benefits and harms of systemic dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114LPJZF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Exogenous dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) therapy has been proposed to replenish the depletion of endogenous DHEA and its sulfate form, which occurs with advancing age and is thought to be associated with loss of libido and menopausal symptoms.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the evidence supporting the use of systemic DHEA in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus through January 2014. Pairs of reviewers, working independently, selected studies and extracted data from eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We used the random-effects model to pool across studies and evaluated heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic.

We included 23 RCTs with moderate to high risk of bias involving 1,188 women. DHEA use was not associated with significant improvement in libido or sexual function (standardized mean difference, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, -0.02 to 0.73; P value = .06; I(2) = 62%). There was also no significant effect of DHEA on serious adverse effects, serum lipids, serum glucose, weight, body mass index, or bone mineral density. This evidence warranted low confidence in the results, mostly due to imprecision, risk of bias, and inconsistency across RCTs.

The evidence warrants low confidence, suggesting that DHEA administration does not significantly impact sexual symptoms or selected metabolic markers in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function.

### Should dehydroepiandrosterone be administered to women [^114k8LiV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Androgen prohormones such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) increase in early puberty, peak in the second and third decade, and thereafter decline, independent of menopausal status. Investigators have examined their potential beneficial effects in normal women and those with DHEA-deficient states.

- **Evidence acquisition**: A review of the literature from 1985 to 2021 on the potential benefits and risks of androgen prohormones in women.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Studies have examined the potential benefit of DHEA therapy for anti-aging, sexual dysfunction, infertility, metabolic bone health, cognition, and wellbeing in hormone-deficient states such as primary adrenal insufficiency, hypopituitarism, and anorexia, as well as administration to normal women across the lifespan.

- **Conclusions**: Data support small benefits in quality of life and mood but not for anxiety or sexual function in women with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency or anorexia. No consistent beneficial effects of DHEA administration have been observed for menopausal symptoms, sexual function, cognition, or overall wellbeing in normal women. Local administration of DHEA shows benefit in vulvovaginal atrophy. Use of DHEA to improve induction of ovulation response in women with diminished ovarian reserve is not recommended. Risks of high physiologic or pharmacologic use of DHEA include androgenic and estrogenic side effects which are of concern for long-term administration.

A 49-year-old woman with Addison's disease who is on low dose estrogen with cyclic progesterone therapy for menopausal symptoms provides a clinical case context.

### Impact of DHEA supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing dose and duration effects [^111V2Mfm]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

The effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation on testosterone and estradiol concentrations in postmenopausal women have produced conflicting results. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials aimed to evaluate the impact of DHEA supplementation on serum testosterone and estradiol levels and to provide evidence regarding the optimal dosage and duration of supplementation.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus to identify relevant studies published before June 11, 2024. Data were analyzed using a random-effects model and presented as weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

- **Results**: The analysis included 21 studies, comprising 17 trial arms assessing estradiol and 20 assessing testosterone. DHEA supplementation significantly increased estradiol (WMD: 7.86 pg/mL; 95% CI 6.33–9.40; P ≤ 0.001) and testosterone levels (WMD: 24.31 ng/dL; 95% CI 15.22–33.40; P ≤ 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed greater increases in estradiol levels among studies using DHEA dosages ≥ 50 mg/day (WMD: 8.65 pg/mL) and those with participants aged ≥ 60 years (WMD: 8.92 pg/mL), although the differences were modest and 95% CIs overlapped. For testosterone, higher levels were observed with DHEA dosages ≥ 50 mg/day (WMD: 29.65 ng/dL).

- **Conclusion**: DHEA supplementation at doses ≥ 50 mg/day significantly increases testosterone levels in postmenopausal women. Moreover, in women aged ≥ 60 years, supplementation at the same dosage significantly elevates estradiol.

### Pharmacokinetics of dehydroepiandrosterone and its metabolites after long-term oral dehydroepiandrosterone treatment in postmenopausal women [^116FNw2S]. Menopause (2008). Low credibility.

Some postmenopausal women use over-the-counter dehydroepiandrosterone because of its purported beneficial effects. Although dehydroepiandrosterone lacks major inherent androgenic activity, it is metabolized into potent androgens and estrogens. This study investigated the pharmacokinetics of dehydroepiandrosterone and its relevant metabolites following prolonged treatment of postmenopausal women with 25 mg/d of dehydroepiandrosterone.

The study involved twenty healthy postmenopausal women randomly assigned to receive either 25 mg/d of dehydroepiandrosterone or a placebo for 6 months. Frequent blood samples were collected over a 24-hour period on day 1, and after 3 and 6 months.

The results indicated that in the treated group (seven evaluable women), mean baseline androgen levels showed the following changes from day 1 to month 3: dehydroepiandrosterone increased from 1.82 to 3.56 ng/mL, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate from 0.96 to 3.37 microg/mL, 5-androstene-3beta,17beta-diol from 0.32 to 0.66 ng/mL, androstenedione from 0.50 to 0.86 ng/mL, testosterone from 17.9 to 28.7 ng/dL, dihydrotestosterone from 6.91 to 17.4 ng/dL, and 3alpha-androstanediol glucuronide from 2.66 to 10.7 ng/mL. These increases were significant. From month 3 to month 6, only small changes (-6% to 16%) were observed.

Nonsignificant increases were found in baseline estrone and estradiol levels and in the Cmax and AUC0–24h values for both androgens and estrogens from day 1 to months 3 and 6 of treatment. Sex hormone-binding globulin levels remained unchanged, while free testosterone significantly increased from day 1 to month 3. Meanwhile, baseline hormone levels did not increase in the placebo group (six evaluable women).
