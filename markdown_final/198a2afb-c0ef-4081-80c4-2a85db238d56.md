## Question

Fatty pancreas

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about fatty pancreas disease, covering definition, prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical associations, diagnostics, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define fatty pancreas and distinguish fatty replacement from fatty infiltration. Then, I should verify prevalence estimates and how modality affects them. Next, I will examine pathophysiology, including lipotoxicity and genetic interactions. After that, I need to review clinical associations with metabolic syndrome, diabetes, pancreatitis, and cancer. Then, I should appraise diagnostic methods and thresholds. Finally, I will consider management, reversibility, and knowledge gaps, making sure to flag controversies and correct myself if I overstate causality or understate uncertainty.

> Let me first confirm the definition and terminology so I don't conflate entities. Fatty pancreas disease, also called pancreatic steatosis or intrapancreatic fat deposition, reflects excess lipid accumulation within pancreatic parenchyma, encompassing both fatty replacement, where acinar cells die and are replaced by adipocytes, and fatty infiltration, where fat accumulates without significant cell death; importantly, minimal physiologic intrapancreatic fat exists even in healthy individuals, so "excess" is the operative concept here [^113UNap5] [^114eodaM] [^112vr3ad].

> I should double-check prevalence estimates across modalities before drawing conclusions. Meta-analytic data suggest an overall prevalence around 21% globally, with modality-specific pooled estimates of approximately 17.5% by MRI, 30% by CT, and 21% by ultrasound, underscoring that diagnostic method meaningfully influences reported prevalence; this aligns with earlier reviews describing 16–35% ranges in general populations, and the condition appears common in children as well, with echogenic pancreas seen in roughly a quarter of pediatric cohorts [^112Yy2YV] [^116tcEK4] [^11622WTj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without distinguishing replacement from infiltration. Pathophysiologically, fatty replacement implies irreversible loss of acinar mass, whereas fatty infiltration may be reversible with metabolic improvement; both patterns can impair exocrine and endocrine function via lipotoxicity, chronic low-grade inflammation, adipocytokine signaling, and oxidative stress, with emerging evidence for a gene–environment interaction whereby pancreatic fat impairs insulin secretion primarily in genetically predisposed individuals, while paradoxically associating with higher insulin secretion in low-risk phenotypes [^113UNap5] [^112qwaXA] [^116RBQE1] [^113KxXyh].

> Next, I should review metabolic syndrome and diabetes associations and verify independence from obesity. Multiple meta-analyses and cohort studies link fatty pancreas with a roughly twofold higher risk of metabolic syndrome and with incident type 2 diabetes, with one 10-year MRI cohort showing that each 1% increase in pancreatic fat increases diabetes risk by 7% independently of liver fat and BMI; however, wait, let me verify conflicting longitudinal data: a Japanese CT-based cohort found the association attenuated to null after adjustment, suggesting residual confounding and modality limitations, so I need to be cautious about asserting causality [^112DVx7D] [^114inUP2] [^112y7hHn].

> I will now examine pancreatitis risk, and I should confirm both spontaneous and procedure-related signals. Case-control and cohort data associate fatty pancreas with higher odds of acute pancreatitis and with more severe systemic inflammatory responses, and fatty pancreas independently increases the risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis; mechanistically, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and free fatty acids can trigger acinar injury and pyroptosis via inflammatory pathways, providing a biologically plausible link to hyperlipidemic pancreatitis [^113WzciK] [^114XWGow] [^1162Nw8D] [^116VLX7B].

> But wait, what about cancer risk; I need to check whether associations persist after matching. A matched U.S. cohort showed higher rates of pancreatic cancer, chronic pancreatitis, acute pancreatitis, and pancreatic cysts in fatty pancreas versus controls over four years, and a meta-analysis suggested a roughly 4–6 fold higher odds of pancreatic cancer with fatty pancreas, though heterogeneity is high and causality remains unproven; importantly, some imaging studies propose CT attenuation indices as potential risk markers, but these require prospective validation [^1145E8KA] [^11689vFA] [^114D5N3s].

> Let me consider exocrine dysfunction and surgical outcomes so I don't overlook clinically actionable domains. Fatty pancreas correlates with lower fecal elastase and exocrine insufficiency in diabetes cohorts, and higher pancreatic fat content is associated with postoperative pancreatic fistula after pancreatoduodenectomy, likely reflecting reduced fibrosis and vessel density in fatty, soft pancreata; guideline-based evaluation for EPI with fecal elastase is appropriate when symptoms suggest malabsorption, recognizing that quantitative fecal fat testing is rarely practical outside research [^1114LJW9] [^116xPchW] [^115mPafY].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic approach is methodologically sound. MRI with multi-echo Dixon techniques is the most accurate and reproducible for quantifying pancreatic fat, with CT attenuation and the pancreas-to-spleen attenuation ratio offering pragmatic surrogates, whereas ultrasound is accessible but operator-dependent; emerging data suggest continuous glucose monitoring metrics correlate with pancreatic fat burden, hinting at functional consequences, but these tools are adjunctive rather than diagnostic [^112qwaXA] [^113UNap5] [^112bYMtg].

> Next, I should review management and reversibility, and I must confirm that improvement in pancreatic fat tracks with metabolic outcomes. Weight loss, dietary pattern shifts, and exercise are first-line strategies, with evidence that reductions in pancreatic fat accompany diabetes remission after bariatric surgery or caloric restriction, supporting the concept of a personal "trigger level" of pancreatic fat beyond which beta-cell function is impaired; pharmacotherapy targeting insulin resistance and dyslipidemia may secondarily reduce pancreatic fat, though pancreas-specific agents are investigational [^114eodaM] [^116Wkx8t] [^112qwaXA].

> Hold on, I should verify knowledge gaps and avoid overstating certainty. There is no universally accepted diagnostic threshold for "pathologic" pancreatic fat, limited longitudinal data on natural history, and unresolved questions about causality versus epiphenomenon; standardization of imaging protocols and harmonized definitions are needed, and future work should integrate genetics, metabolic phenotyping, and prospective outcomes to clarify who benefits most from aggressive pancreatic fat reduction strategies [^114sNrfR] [^112Yy2YV] [^112qwaXA].

> In summary, fatty pancreas disease is a common, imaging-defined ectopic fat phenotype with plausible mechanisms linking it to metabolic syndrome, diabetes, pancreatitis, and possibly pancreatic cancer; it is best viewed as a modifiable marker of systemic metabolic risk rather than a benign incidentaloma, warranting lifestyle intervention, risk stratification for exocrine dysfunction, and judicious use of imaging and functional testing in appropriate clinical contexts [^114eodaM] [^114inUP2] [^115mPafY].

Fatty pancreas, or pancreatic steatosis, is **defined by excess intrapancreatic fat** [^114eodaM] and is strongly linked to obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes [^112DVx7D] [^114inUP2]. It is common, with a prevalence of 16–35% depending on the imaging method and population [^112Yy2YV] [^116tcEK4], and is best detected by MRI-PDFF or CT attenuation [^112qwaXA] [^114D5N3s]. Clinically, it is associated with insulin resistance, β-cell dysfunction, and increased risks of acute and chronic pancreatitis, exocrine insufficiency, and pancreatic cancer [^111AAfQQ] [^1145E8KA] [^11689vFA]. Management centers on **weight loss, dietary change, and exercise** [^114eodaM]; pharmacologic therapy is limited, and prognosis depends on severity and reversibility with lifestyle intervention [^114eodaM].

---

## Definition and pathophysiology

Fatty pancreas reflects **excess intrapancreatic fat deposition** — either fatty infiltration (lipid within acinar/ductal cells) or fatty replacement (loss of parenchyma with adipocyte replacement) [^113UNap5]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Lipotoxicity**: Free fatty acids impair β-cell function and insulin secretion [^115EPq9x].
- **Inflammation**: Cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) promote insulin resistance and β-cell apoptosis [^115EPq9x].
- **Genetics**: Polygenic risk interacts with pancreatic fat to worsen insulin secretion in predisposed individuals [^116RBQE1].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

Prevalence varies by modality: **MRI 16–35%**, **CT 30–50%**, and **ultrasound 20–30%** [^112Yy2YV]. Major risk factors include obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, advanced age, male sex, and alcohol use [^112DVx7D] [^113UNap5].

---

## Clinical implications

Fatty pancreas is linked to **multiple adverse outcomes**:

| **Clinical domain** | **Associated conditions** |
|-|-|
| Endocrine | - Insulin resistance <br/> - β-cell dysfunction <br/> - Type 2 diabetes [^114inUP2] [^112qwaXA] |
| Exocrine | - Acute pancreatitis <br/> - Chronic pancreatitis <br/> - Exocrine insufficiency [^1145E8KA] [^111AAfQQ] |
| Oncologic | Increased risk of pancreatic cancer [^1145E8KA] [^11689vFA] |

---

## Diagnostic methods

Imaging is the **primary diagnostic approach**:

- **MRI-PDFF**: Gold standard; accurate quantification of pancreatic fat [^112qwaXA].
- **CT**: Lower pancreatic attenuation indicates higher fat; pancreas-to-spleen ratio aids diagnosis [^114D5N3s].
- **Ultrasound**: Echogenic pancreas is suggestive but operator-dependent and less specific [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on **lifestyle modification**:

- **Weight loss**: Reduces pancreatic fat and improves insulin secretion [^114eodaM].
- **Diet**: Caloric restriction, Mediterranean-style eating, and reduced saturated fat intake [^116tcEK4].
- **Exercise**: Regular physical activity improves insulin sensitivity and β-cell function [^notfound].
- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Limited evidence; metformin, GLP-1 agonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors may help indirectly via weight loss and glycemic control [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and reversibility

Prognosis depends on severity and reversibility; **early, mild steatosis is reversible** with lifestyle change, whereas advanced fibrosis or replacement is less likely to regress [^114eodaM]. Reversal of pancreatic fat is associated with diabetes remission in some cohorts [^114eodaM].

---

Fatty pancreas is a **common, reversible manifestation of ectopic fat** with significant metabolic and pancreatic consequences; early detection and lifestyle intervention are key to improving outcomes [^114sNrfR].

## References

### Fatty pancreas: should we Be concerned? [^115ok6bb]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

The metabolic consequences of visceral fat deposition are well known, and the presence of intrapancreatic fat (IPF) has been recognized for decades. However, our knowledge about the distribution of fat in the pancreas and its clinical implications is in a nascent stage. Various terms have been proposed to describe IPF; for the purpose of this narrative review, we chose the general term fatty pancreas. Herein, we describe the radiologic, endoscopic, and histopathologic aspects of diagnosing fatty pancreas and provide an overview of the diseases associated with this condition. Our purpose is to highlight diagnostic challenges and identify specific clinical questions that would benefit from further study. As evident in this review, IPF is associated with various metabolic diseases, pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and precancer-yet establishing causality needs careful, further study.

### Prevalence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of fatty pancreas disease: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Yy2YV]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fatty pancreas disease (FPD) is a condition characterized by diffuse excessive intrapancreatic fat deposition with relevant metabolic implications but often overlooked by healthcare professionals. Our study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of FPD. PubMed and Embase databases were searched from inception to 10 April 2024. Pairwise meta-analysis was performed using the DerSimonian-Laird method. Meta-analysis of proportions was conducted using the inverse-variance method with logit transformation. Between-study heterogeneity was examined, with subsequent subgroup and meta-regression analyses, and publication bias was assessed. Eighteen studies with 111 682 individuals were included in this meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of FPD was 21.11% [95% confidence interval (CI): 11.04–36.58]. Diagnostic method influenced FPD prevalence (P < 0.01), with pooled prevalences of 17.53% (95% CI: 16.20–18.95), 30.05% (95% CI: 24.14–36.70), and 21.23% (95% CI: 8.52–43.88) for MRI, computed tomography, and transabdominal ultrasound, respectively. Patients with FPD were more likely to be older, have higher BMI, male, and have metabolic dysfunction. They also had an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, endocrine-related outcomes (i.e. diabetes and glycemic progression), and exocrine-related outcomes (i.e. acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer) compared with those without FPD. This study summarizes the epidemiology of FPD and highlights its clinical and prognostic significance. Increased multidisciplinary collaboration is needed to improve understanding of the disease and raise awareness among healthcare professionals. This study was a priori registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42024514116).

### Pancreatic steatosis: an update [^114FeHN2]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pancreatic steatosis is a clinical entity with emerging significance and impacts patient health in a multitude of ways. It has a high prevalence in the global population with predilections for different demographics by age, sex and ethnicity. Understanding the pathophysiology, clinical features and complications of this entity may be important to understanding the consequences of the ongoing obesity global epidemic.

Recent Findings

Obesity and metabolic syndrome contribute to metabolic derangements that result in lipid mishandling by adipocytes. Adipocytokine imbalances in circulation and in the pancreatic microenvironment cause chronic, low-grade inflammation. The resulting beta cell and acinar cell apoptosis leads to pancreatic endocrine and exocrine dysfunction. Furthermore, these adipocytokines regulate cell growth, differentiation, as well as angiogenesis and lymphatic spread. These consequences of adipocyte infiltration are thought to initiate carcinogenesis, leading to pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

Summary

Obesity will lead to millions of deaths each year and pancreatic steatosis may be the key intermediate entity that leads to obesity-related complications. Enhancing our understanding may reveal strategies for preventing mortality and morbidity related to the global epidemic of obesity. Further research is needed to determine the pathophysiology, long-term complications and effective treatment strategies for this condition.

### Fatty change of the pancreas: the pandora's box of pancreatology [^114sNrfR]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Prevention of common diseases of the pancreas or interception of their progression is as attractive in theory as it is elusive in practice. The fundamental challenge has been an incomplete understanding of targets coupled with a multitude of intertwined factors that are associated with the development of pancreatic diseases. Evidence over the past decade has shown unique morphological features, distinctive biomarkers, and complex relationships of intrapancreatic fat deposition. Fatty change of the pancreas has also been shown to affect at least 16% of the global population. This knowledge has solidified the pivotal role of fatty change of the pancreas in acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and diabetes. The pancreatic diseases originating from intrapancreatic fat (PANDORA) hypothesis advanced in this Personal View cuts across traditional disciplinary boundaries with a view to tackling these diseases. New holistic understanding of pancreatic diseases is well positioned to propel pancreatology through lasting research breakthroughs and clinical advances.

### The clinical significance of pancreatic steatosis [^111AAfQQ]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

More research is now focused on pancreatic steatosis. Multiple definitions, clinical associations and synonyms for pancreatic steatosis are described in the literature and can be confusing. The integration and comparison of several studies concerning this topic is therefore challenging. In the past, pancreatic steatosis was considered an innocuous condition, a bystander of many underlying diseases (such as congenital syndromes, hemochromatosis and viral infection). However, evidence that pancreatic steatosis (strongly associated with obesity and the metabolic syndrome) has a role in type 2 diabetes mellitus, pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, acute pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer and the formation of pancreatic fistula after pancreatic surgery is emerging. This Review focuses on the different etiological factors and the clinical consequences of pancreatic steatosis.

### Pancreatic steatosis: an emerging clinical entity [^116tcEK4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic steatosis is an emerging clinical entity whose pathophysiology, natural history, and long-term complications are poorly characterized in the current literature. Epidemiological and prospective studies have described prevalence rates between 16% and 35%. Although the natural history is not well known, there are strong associations with obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Ectopic fat accumulation of the pancreas can cause chronic, low-grade inflammation from adipocytokine imbalances that involve beta cells and acinar cells. This mechanism can lead to pancreatic endocrine and exocrine dysfunction and initiate carcinogenesis. Although it is associated with morbid conditions, pancreatic steatosis may be amendable to treatment with a healthy diet, less meat consumption, exercise, and smoking cessation. Pancreatic steatosis should factor into clinical decision-making and prognostication of patients with pancreatic and systemic disease. This review seeks to describe the pathophysiology, natural history, diagnosis, and complications of this emerging clinically relevant entity.

### Fatty pancreas represents a risk factor for acute pancreatitis: a pilot study [^113WzciK]. Pancreas (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Fatty pancreas (FP), previously believed to be without clinical significance, recently has been shown to be associated with comorbid diseases. We aimed to explore whether FP predispose to acute pancreatitis.

Methods

Patients who underwent endoscopic ultrasound for hepatobiliary indications were included. Patients with pathological pancreato-biliary findings other than FP were excluded. The cohort was divided into patients with a history of pancreatitis (within 6 months of endoscopic ultrasound, group A) and patients without (group B).

Results

Overall, 189 patients were included. Sixty-one (32.3%) patients were in group A, and 128 (67.7%) patients were in group B. The average age in group A was 55.5 (standard deviation, 17.7) versus 58.5 (standard deviation, 13.5) in group B. The prevalence of FP in group A (37.7%) was higher compared with group B (4.7%) (P = 0.001). On univariate analysis, FP showed significant correlation with a history of acute pancreatitis [odds ratio (OR), 5.14, P = 0.006] and hyperlipidemia (OR, 4.19; P = 0.002). On multivariate analysis, FP remained significantly associated with a history of acute pancreatitis after stratification for obesity and hyperlipidemia (OR, 10.78; 95% confidence interval, 3.75–30.89; P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Fatty pancreas was associated with acute pancreatitis. Clinicians should be aware of this association.

### Fatty pancreas disease and the risk of future diseases of the exocrine pancreas: a US matched cohort study [^1145E8KA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Fatty pancreas disease (FPD), marked by excess fat within the pancreas, is often incidentally detected on imaging. Despite recognized metabolic links, its clinical significance remains unclear. More granular data from large, well-characterized U.S. cohorts are needed to clarify its relevance. This study quantified intra-pancreatic fat deposition (IPFD) and assess its natural history and related outcomes.

Methods

Adults ≥ 18 years with radiologically confirmed FPD between 2004 and 2024 were identified from institutional databases. Controls without FPD were matched 1:2 by age, sex, BMI, and smoking status. Patients with excessive alcohol intake, prior pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, surgery, cystic fibrosis, or prolonged steroid/antiviral use were excluded. Fat content in the pancreas and liver, as well as subcutaneous and visceral fat areas, were measured using iNtuition® software on non-contrast CT scans.

Findings

We included 82 FPD patients and 164 matched controls (median age 65 years; 55% female; median BMI 32). Subcutaneous and hepatic fat were similar between groups, but IPFD was markedly higher in FPD patients (26.8% vs. 4.9%, p < 0.001). Over a mean 4-year follow-up, FPD patients had significantly higher rates of acute pancreatitis (12% vs. 1.2%, p < 0.001), chronic pancreatitis (6.1% vs. 0.6%, p = 0.017), pancreatic cysts (34.1% vs. 4.9%, p < 0.001), and pancreatic cancer (1.6% vs. 0%, p = 0.012). Extra-pancreatic cancer incidence did not differ.

Interpretation

FPD is associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer, acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, and incidental pancreatic cysts, independent of obesity or hepatic steatosis, suggesting a potentially causative role of FPD in the pathogenesis of exocrine pancreatic diseases.

### Type 2 diabetes: does pancreatic fat really matter? [^114UM8or]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

With the increasing prevalence of obesity, the interest of research in nonalcoholic fatty pancreas disease (NAFPD) has grown. Even though the pancreas appears more susceptible to lipid accumulation compared with the liver, NAFPD has been less investigated due to the limits in detecting techniques. Several definitions and synonyms for NAFPD are used by authors and can be misleading. This, together with differences in methodology and ethnicity, make the integration and comparison of studies on this topic challenging. NAFPD could be used as an early indicator of ectopic fat deposition, which is recognized as a key factor of obesity cardio-metabolic complications. However, evidence that NAFPD has a pathogenetic role in type 2 diabetes is also emerging. This article reviews the current state of knowledge on the clinical and pathophysiologic relevance of NAFPD in β-cell function and insulin resistance.

### Bidirectional association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and fatty pancreas: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11313dxV]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Accumulating evidence suggests a potential relationship between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and fatty pancreas, as both conditions are associated with fat deposition in the liver and pancreas, respectively. The meta-analysis aimed to investigate the bidirectional association between NAFLD and fatty pancreas, as well as their respective effects on disease severity.

Methods

A systematic search of the EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, from inception to August 2022, was conducted to identify observational studies examining the association between NAFLD and fatty pancreas, as well as their impact on disease severity. The pooled odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated using a random-effects model.

Results

Our analysis included 26 case-control or cross-sectional studies, comprising 67,803 participants. We observed a significant association between NAFLD and an increased odds of having fatty pancreas (OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 4.49–8.51; I² = 92%). Similarly, fatty pancreas was significantly associated with an increased odds of having NAFLD (OR, 9.56; 95% CI, 5.09–17.95; I² = 83%). Furthermore, the presence of fatty pancreas was associated with a 1.75-fold increased risk of severe NAFLD based on ultrasonographic classification (95% CI, 1.46–2.10; I² = 0%). Among NAFLD patients, the coexistence of fatty pancreas was associated with a trend towards increased odds of having non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (OR, 3.52; 95% CI, 0.65–18.93; I² = 82%) and advanced fibrosis (OR, 2.47; 95% CI, 0.52–11.80; I² = 76%).

Conclusion

This meta-analysis discloses a bidirectional association between NAFLD and fatty pancreas, emphasizing the importance of understanding the intricate relationship between these two conditions.

### Metabolic syndrome and ectopic fat deposition: what can CT and MR provide? [^112tCLFB]. Academic Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Metabolic syndrome affects 20–30% of adults and is increasing in prevalence, making it a leading public health issue. Radiologists often encounter images of obese patients during routine studies and are in a unique position to address the importance of excess fat and need to be aware of the spectrum of pathologic consequences in different organ systems. In this review, the role of CT and MR imaging in assessment of patients with metabolic syndrome will be reviewed and the constellation of structural and functional changes in the major affected organ systems due to ectopic fatty deposition will be discussed.

Methods

We specifically discuss the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome, visceral versus subcutaneous obesity, cardiac lipomatosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty pancreas disease, and fat deposition in other organs.

Conclusion

Many of the multisystem manifestations of metabolic syndrome can be visualized on routine CT and MR images and radiologists can provide clinicians with important data regarding anatomic and pathologic distribution of fat in different organs. Perhaps the visualization of the fatty changes will provide tangible evidence to motivate patients to begin lifestyle modification.

### Pancreatic steatosis associates with impaired insulin secretion in genetically predisposed individuals [^114sS1oe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic steatosis (ie, pancreatic fat) is characterized by an increased pancreatic triacylglycerol content and embodies adipocytes interspersed in the pancreatic parenchyma. Accumulating evidence implicates this fat compartment as a modulator of islet function. Specifically, pancreatic steatosis was inversely associated with insulin secretion in subjects with prediabetes. Further, it has been suggested that reduction of pancreatic steatosis is pivotal in improving beta-cell function during a lifestyle intervention. However, subjects with normal glucose tolerance do not exhibit the negative association between pancreatic steatosis and insulin secretion. In longitudinal studies, there was no association between age-adjusted computed tomography-measured pancreatic steatosis and diabetes incidence, but only in lean subjects. In patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), pancreatic fat associated with a reduction of glucagon-stimulated insulin secretion. A possible explanation to these controversial findings could be a large heterogeneity of individual responses to increased pancreatic fat mass. As a complex disease, T2D results from an interplay of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. We hypothesized that unfavorable effects of pancreatic steatosis on beta-cell function arise only in the context of a genetic predisposition for diabetes.

### Associations of intra-pancreatic fat deposition with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and lipoprotein lipase [^113NJ4Sv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Fatty pancreas disease (hereafter referred to as fatty pancreas) — a disorder that affects around one‐fifth of the general population — is also associated with CVD. A systematic review and meta‐analysis showed a strong relationship of fatty pancreas with atherosclerosis and heart diseases. This might be attributed to fatty pancreas being significantly associated with high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) dyslipidemia and reduced levels of large HDL subfractions — both of which are established risk factors for CVD. Remnant cholesterol is another key contributor as it is significantly associated with intra‐pancreatic fat deposition (IPFD). Further, increased production of VLDL (as part of de novo lipogenesis in the liver) was suggested to be one of the drivers of fatty pancreas. However, the relationship between IPFD and all individual triglyceride‐rich lipoproteins (measured directly in the fasting state) has never been investigated. Specifically, levels of remnant cholesterol in previous studies were estimated based on a formula and, therefore, these estimates might have been inaccurate. Available state‐of‐the‐art techniques, such as linear polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, offer an opportunity to measure VLDL and IDL particles directly. Studies using these techniques found significant and independent associations of VLDL and IDL with atherosclerosis, and coronary artery disease. While there is no lack of research investigating triglyceride‐rich lipoproteins in regard to CVD risk, no study has explored all these lipoproteins in the context of IPFD yet.

The present study aimed to address the above gaps by investigating the associations of directly measured (rather than calculated indirectly based on a formula) triglyceride‐rich lipoproteins with IPFD, as well as exploring the role of LPL.

### Metabolic implications of pancreatic fat accumulation [^112qwaXA]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Fat accumulation outside subcutaneous adipose tissue often has unfavourable effects on systemic metabolism. In addition to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which has received considerable attention, pancreatic fat has become an important area of research throughout the past 10 years. While a number of diagnostic approaches are available to quantify pancreatic fat, multi-echo Dixon MRI is currently the most developed method. Initial studies have shown associations between pancreatic fat and the metabolic syndrome, impaired glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Pancreatic fat is linked to reduced insulin secretion, at least under specific circumstances such as prediabetes, low BMI and increased genetic risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This Review summarizes the possible causes and metabolic consequences of pancreatic fat accumulation. In addition, potential therapeutic approaches for addressing pancreatic fat accumulation are discussed.

### Can our experience with surveillance for inherited pancreatic cancer help to identify early pancreatic cancer in the general population? [^1177hy5a]. Familial Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

In a recent systematic review, clinical prediction models were developed to assess the risk of PDAC in the general population. The study evaluated a total of 15'848'100 individuals, of whom 58'313 developed PDAC (0.3%) 24. The clinical risk factors included the usual suspects: cigarette smoking, chronic pancreatitis, and BMI, the CI running from 0.65 to 0.77 (diabetes mellitus), CI 0.75–0.89 (biomarkers and said risk factors).

Newly onset diabetes mellitus (NOD) has been identified as a "red flag" for the development of PDAC. While the scientific basis is sound, the question arose as to whether it would be feasible to screen for pancreatic cancer in the general population all those who have NOD. A recent health economy analysis concluded that risk-based PAC screening in patients with NOD is likely to be cost-effective, at least in the United States if even a modest fraction (> 25%) of screen-detected patients with PAC are resectable. Future studies should reassess the value of this intervention once clinical trial data become available.

As part of a metabolic syndrome, the fatty pancreas has been claimed to pave the road for pancreatic cancer as well. A recent systematic review of 2956 patients from 17 studies seem to confirm the potential association of a fatty pancreas and pancreatic cancer (6-fold higher probability of fatty pancreas among patients with pancreatic cancer). Limitations regarding the considerable statistical heterogeneity of the studies included leave this question open. Furthermore, the authors themselves questioned the definition for the fatty pancreas since there are no guidelines or agreements amongst the radiologists.

Radiomics based on the primary lesion holds great potential for prognosis prediction. First-order entropy was significantly associated with the overall survival of PDAC and might improve the accuracy of current PDAC prognosis prediction.

### The association between pancreas steatosis and metabolic syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112DVx7D]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Pancreas steatosis is the description of fat accumulation in the pancreatic gland. The prevalence and development mechanisms of pancreatic steatosis in patients with metabolic disorders still remain unclear. The aim of this study is to systematically review the association between pancreatic steatosis and metabolic co-morbidities.

Methods

We performed a systematic search strategy using three electronic databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase) for relevant studies concerning the associations of pancreatic steatosis with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its clinical relevance from inception until 30 September 2018.

Results

One thousand three hundred fifty one references were identified in the initial search, and a total of 13 studies involving 49 329 subjects were included. This analyses elucidated the presence of non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disease (NAFPD) and was associated with a significant increased risk of metabolic syndrome (RR = 2.25; 95% CI, 2.00–2.53; P < 0.0001; I² = 42.8%; eight studies included), hypertension (RR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.08–1.90; P = 0.013; I² = 94.7%; nine studies included), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (RR = 2.49; 95% CI, 2.06–3.02; P < 0.0001; I² = 96.9%; nine studies included), diabetes mellitus (RR = 1.99; 95% CI, 1.18–3.35; P = 0.01; I² = 97.6%; 10 studies included), and central obesity (RR = 1.91; 95% CI, 1.67–2.19; P < 0.0001; I² = 95.9%; six studies included). The association between NAFPD and hyperlipidaemia was not statistically significant (RR = 1.33; 95% CI, 0.82–2.17; P = 0.249; I² = 97%; five studies included).

Conclusions

The existing evidence indicates that NAFPD is significantly associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and its components. Well-designed prospective cohort studies between pancreatic steatosis and MetS are needed to elaborate the causality in the future.

### Understanding the association of intrapancreatic fat deposition with adiposity and components of metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115NRBV6]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The pancreas, primarily an exocrine organ with essential endocrine functions in glucose homeostasis and metabolism, has garnered significant research attention due to its role as an ectopic fat depot. This interest has expanded over the past decade, largely driven by advancements in imaging techniques that facilitate precise localization and quantification of lipid infiltration in body tissues and organs.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a significant global health concern characterized by alarming prevalence rates, which are expected to escalate further due to the increasing adoption of Western lifestyles. Insulin resistance and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction are key factors in the development of T2D. Obesity-induced insulin resistance is a major risk factor for T2D, and intrapancreatic fat deposition content appears to increase proportionally with obesity. In both preclinical models and human adults, adipocyte infiltration within the pancreas and intracellular lipid deposition within islet endocrine cells plays a significant role in impaired glucose metabolism and T2D pathogenesis. Additionally, fat accumulation in acinar cells is associated to β-cell dysfunction through paracrine and molecular mechanisms. However, conflicting results exist, and the impact of increased intrapancreatic fat deposition on glucose homeostasis remains controversial, especially in children where research is limited.

In the adult population, the estimated prevalence of fatty pancreas disease ranges from 16% to 33%, depending on the estimated cutoff point. However, in children, the information on this condition is very limited, and its relationship with other fat depots, such as visceral adipose tissue, subcutaneous adipose tissue, and hepatic fat is inconclusive. In adults, fatty pancreas disease is significantly associated with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)and obesity, with approximately 70% of fatty liver disease patients also having fatty pancreas disease. Intrapancreatic fat deposition could be an early indicator of abnormal ectopic fat deposition, a key factor in the development of T2D, atherosclerosis, and metabolic syndrome. While not the primary focus here, fatty pancreas disease is associated with impaired exocrine pancreas function, pancreatic cancer risk, and the severity of acute pancreatitis. Despite being prevalent, fatty pancreas disease is frequently overlooked by clinicians. There is a need for increased attention to intrapancreatic fat deposition as an early marker of ectopic fat deposition and insulin resistance in metabolic syndrome. Lifestyle modifications can prevent metabolic syndrome, and identifying high-risk individuals can prevent severe complications such as cardiovascular disease and stroke.

### Significance of pancreatic steatosis as a predictor of new-onset diabetes mellitus following pancreatectomy [^115EPq9x]. Pancreas (2025). Medium credibility.

When considering organ function and reserve, determining the quality of the organ, not just its volume, is crucial. In this context, pancreatic fat infiltration is an extremely important factor for assessing the quality of pancreatic function. Pancreatic fat infiltration has garnered recent attention as a component of metabolic syndrome, alongside obesity and fatty liver. – Similar to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), research on pancreatic fat deposition is progressing through studies on nonalcoholic fatty pancreatic disease, as viewed from the perspective of metabolic syndrome. Excessive weight gain gradually causes the accumulation of surplus fat tissue in non-fatty tissues, including the pancreas, where fat is stored within acinar and islet cells, a condition potentially contributing to future dysfunction. Furthermore, fat accumulation in the pancreas induces oxidative stress, leading to the release of cytokines, such as adiponectin, leptin, tumor necrotic factor-α, and interleukin-6. This process results in β-cell dysfunction, inflammation, and eventual cell death.– As other potential mechanisms contributing to impaired β-cell function, chronic exposure of the pancreatic islets to nonesterified fatty acids induces β-cell apoptosis. Thus, pancreatic fat deposition is considered to be strongly related with the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Chan et alassessed pancreatic fat in 631 patients using magnetic resonance imaging and conducted long-term follow-up to examine the relationship between fatty pancreas and diabetes onset. Their findings indicated that, unlike hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are metabolic syndrome-related diseases, fatty pancreas is an independent risk factor for T2DM. Therefore, pancreatic fat infiltration may indicate declining endocrine pancreatic function and serve as an effective predictor of pancreatic function quality.

The present study hypothesized that the anticipated remnant pancreatic fat infiltration is strongly associated with the onset of NODMP. Thus, we examined patients who underwent PD or DP through preoperative computed tomography (CT) assessments of pancreatic fat infiltration to identify risk factors for NODMP.

### Role of pancreatic lipase inhibition in obesity treatment: mechanisms and challenges towards current insights and future directions [^111Vpt7R]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanistic insights into pancreas lipase

Among the vast array of biological mechanisms involved in the onset and advancement of obesity, the function of digestive enzymes, especially pancreatic lipase (PL), has attracted notable interest. Obesity is a multifaceted disease impacted by genetic, environmental, and lifestyle elements. Pancreatic lipase plays a key role in the digestive system, crucially breaking down dietary fats into fatty acids and monoglycerides that can be absorbed. This process is vital for the proper digestion and absorption of fats. When this process is disrupted, it can lead to imbalances in lipid levels and, ultimately, obesity or lipid absorption disorder.

Recent advancements in molecular biology and biochemistry have shed light on the intricate mechanisms governing PL activity and its regulation within the gastrointestinal tract. Understanding these mechanistic insights is crucial for unraveling the complex interplay between dietary fat metabolism and the pathogenesis of obesity. This section seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of its role in energy homeostasis and its key role in managing and preventing obesity in the context of the significance of PL functions and related of the biochemical pathways.

Overview of pancreas roles

Pancreas is a vital organ that serves key functions within both the digestive and endocrine systems. It is essential for the metabolism and breakdown of fats and proteins. However, it is susceptible to a variety of diseases and disorders that can impact an individual's health severely. The pancreas has dual roles; its exocrine function involves producing digestive enzymes like trypsin, chymotrypsin (proteases) for proteins, amylase for carbohydrates, and lipase for fats, along with pancreatic juices that aid in the digestion process in the duodenum (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Role of pancreas as dual function-related endocrine and exocrine systems.

The pancreas regulates blood glucose via insulin and glucagon, with dysfunction worsening diabetes and obesity.

Its endocrine role is essential in regulating blood glucose levels, primarily through the secretion of insulin and glucagon. The pancreas extends horizontally across the abdomen, with its wider section situated on the right and narrowing towards the spleen. Various conditions can impact the pancreas, such as pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, cysts, insufficiency, and fluid accumulation, each carrying significant health implications. The pancreas plays a critical role in managing the body's metabolism and energy expenditure via its insulin production. However, disturbances in this function can lead to obesity by altering the manner in which the body stores and utilizes fats.

### Clinical significance of pancreatic fat in children: a single-center experience [^11622WTj]. Pancreas (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Recently, interest in pancreatic fat has increased, and fatty pancreas is considered to be related to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and metabolic syndrome. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of echogenic pancreas in children and its related factors.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients aged 5 to 18 years who had undergone abdominal sonography between January 2020 and December 2020. Patients with chronic or pancreatic diseases were excluded.

Results

Of 102 patients, 27 (26.5%) had echogenic pancreas and 55 (53.9%) had NAFLD. Among the 55 patients with NAFLD, 18 (32.7%) had an echogenic pancreas. Patients with echogenic pancreas had significantly higher fasting glucose, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels than those without echogenic pancreas. The proportion of NAFLD and obesity was higher in the echogenic group; however, only the proportion of obese subjects showed a significant difference. In multivariate analysis, family history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and/or dyslipidemia and presence of DM and/or dyslipidemia were factors related to the presence of echogenic pancreas.

Conclusions

Echogenic pancreas is relatively common in children. Echogenic pancreas, typically observed in patients with a family history of DM and/or dyslipidemia, was strongly associated with metabolic syndrome, even in the absence of fatty liver.

### Type 2 diabetes: etiology and reversibility [^116Wkx8t]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

How long will diabetes stay away after weight loss? Long-term normal blood glucose control in previously diabetic individuals after bariatric surgery demonstrates that diabetes does not recur for up to 10 years, unless substantial weight gain occurs. These observations are consistent with the twin cycle hypothesis and the existence of a trigger level for adverse metabolic effects of fat in the pancreas. Hence, for a given individual with type 2 diabetes, reducing the liver and pancreas fat content below his or her personal trigger levels would be expected to result in a release from the fatty acid–mediated dysfunction. Individual tolerance of different degrees of fat exposure vary, and understanding this liposusceptibility will underpin the future understanding of genetically determined risk in any given environment. However, this should not obscure the central point: If a person has type 2 diabetes, there is more fat in the liver and pancreas than he or she can cope with.

### Prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disease (NAFPD) and its risk factors among adult medical check-up patients in a private hospital: a large cross sectional study [^112WjGRM]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The prevalence of NAFPD in Indonesia is high and it is strongly correlated with other metabolic conditions. The clinical significance of routine fatty pancreas screening needs to be included in our clinical practice. However, it would need further investigation about the long standing condition of fatty pancreas and the usefulness of pancreatic biopsy to see the possibility of disease progression.

### Fatty pancreas is independently associated with subsequent diabetes mellitus development: a 10-year prospective cohort study [^114inUP2]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Although the association between fatty pancreas and metabolic syndrome has been suggested in retrospective studies, long-term prospective data on the effect of fatty pancreas on various metabolic outcomes are lacking. We aimed to prospectively investigate the association between fatty pancreas and the development of major metabolic outcomes.

Methods

A total of 631 subjects from a population study using fat-water magnetic resonance imaging to quantify pancreatic and liver fat content during 2008 to 2010 were followed up prospectively until December 2020 (mean follow-up time, 11.1 ± 1.1 y). Subjects with significant alcohol intake and diabetes mellitus (DM) at baseline were excluded. Incidence of newly diagnosed DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia, ischemic heart disease, cardiovascular accidents, pancreatic cancer, and mortality were evaluated.

Results

Among the 631 subjects (mean age, 48 ± 11 y), 93 (14.7%) had fatty pancreas. The fatty pancreas group had a higher incidence of DM (33.3% vs 10.4%; P < .001), hypertension (37.7% vs 22.7%; p = 0.003), and dyslipidemia (37.7% vs 14.6%; P < .001) during long-term follow-up evaluation. Individuals with both fatty liver and pancreas had the highest DM incidence, followed by fatty liver only and fatty pancreas only groups (P < .001). Fatty pancreas was associated independently with DM (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.10–3.00; p = 0.020), but not hypertension or dyslipidemia on multivariate analysis. Each percentage increase of pancreatic fat increased the risk of incident DM by 7% (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01–1.13; p = 0.016). No participants developed pancreatic cancer during the follow-up period.

Conclusions

Fatty pancreas is associated independently with subsequent DM development, but not hypertension or dyslipidemia.

### Vanishing pancreas: CT and MRI features and imaging diagnostic strategies [^113UNap5]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Definitions

Fatty pancreas disease, with a prevalence between 16% and 35%, refers to the fat deposition in the pancreas. A dozen terms, such as 'intra-pancreatic fat deposition', 'pancreatic steatosis', 'fatty infiltration of the pancreas', 'pancreatic fat accumulation', and 'non-alcoholic fatty pancreas', have been used to refer to this phenomenon. However, a consensus on the best terms has not been reached worldwide. In this review, we used the term 'intra-pancreatic fat deposition (IPFD)' to manifest as fatty change within the pancreas.

Etiology

There are two distinct mechanisms that will lead to fatty change within the pancreas: fatty replacement and fatty infiltration. Fatty replacement involves the death of pancreatic acinar cells and their subsequent replacement by adipocytes, leading to a loss of functional pancreatic tissue. In contrast, fatty infiltration is characterized by the accumulation of fat within the pancreas without significant cell death. IPFD can include intra-lobular fat (for example, islet cells or acinar cells) or inter-lobular fat. Risk factors such as older age, obesity, alcohol, diabetes, enlarged abdominal waist circumference, and metabolic variables (including glycated hemoglobin, lipid levels, and systolic blood pressure) have been linked to the occurrence of IPFD. Additionally, congenital diseases that can manifest as IPFD are as follows:

Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects the exocrine function of multiple organs, including the lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, sweat glands, and urogenital system. It arises from genetic variations in the CFTR gene. It primarily affects the lungs and manifests as bronchiectasis. In classic cystic fibrosis, secretions become thicker, leading to pancreatic autodigestion and replacement of the pancreatic tissue with fat. Notably, nearly 80% of individuals with cystic fibrosis suffer from pancreatic insufficiency, which typically manifests as abdominal discomfort, bloating, steatorrhea, ileus, and weight loss.

Maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 8 (MODY8) is a monogenic inherited disorder and exhibits as both endocrine and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction. Patients often exhibit exocrine pancreas dysfunction in childhood, progressing to diabetes in adulthood.

Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by neutropenia, IPFD, and metaphyseal dysplasia.

Johanson-Blizzard Syndrome (JBS) is an exceptionally rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by UBR1 gene mutations, featuring congenital exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, nasal wings hypoplasia or aplasia, or other malformations.

### NAFLD as a continuum: from obesity to metabolic syndrome and diabetes [^113T2ut7]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been increasing rapidly. It is nowadays recognized as the most frequent liver disease, affecting a quarter of global population and regularly coexisting with metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. In a more simplistic view, NAFLD could be defined as an increase in liver fat content, in the absence of secondary cause of steatosis. In fact, the clinical onset of the disease is a much more complex process, closely related to insulin resistance, limited expandability and dysfunctionality of adipose tissue. A fatty liver is a main driver for a new recognized liver-pancreatic α-cell axis and increased glucagon, contributing to diabetes pathophysiology.

Main text

This review will focus on the clinical and pathophysiological connections between NAFLD, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. We reviewed non-invasive methods and several scoring systems for estimative of steatosis and fibrosis, proposing a multistep process for NAFLD evaluation. We will also discuss treatment options with a more comprehensive view, focusing on the current available therapies for obesity and/or type 2 diabetes that impact each stage of NAFLD.

Conclusion

The proper understanding of NAFLD spectrum — as a continuum from obesity to metabolic syndrome and diabetes — may contribute to the early identification and for establishment of targeted treatment.

### Relationship of high-density lipoprotein subfractions and apolipoprotein A-I with fat in the pancreas [^116RsAqF]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Fatty change of the pancreas (hereafter referred to as fatty pancreas) is another common disorder characterized by considerable changes in the standard lipid profile. A 2017 systematic review of small studies showed a negative association between fatty pancreas and HDL‐C, and the relationship was one of the strongest among the 20 studied biomarkers for fatty pancreas. More recently, a large cohort study confirmed that HDL‐C was strongly associated with intrapancreatic fat deposition (IPFD). Consistent associations were observed according to dyslipidaemia states, where individuals with low levels of HDL‐C (< 60 mg/dL) had a 3.7‐fold higher risk of fatty pancreas, much higher than LDL‐C dyslipidaemia or triglyceride dyslipidaemia. While earlier studies of fatty pancreas focused invariably on the overall level of HDL‐C, there is a growing appreciation that HDL‐C is heterogeneous in its size and composition. Variations in their cardioprotective effects have also been noted: lower levels of larger (and less dense) HDL‐C particles were consistently reported in people with CVD. Further, an inverse association of large HDL‐C particles with the progression of coronary lesions and the severity of coronary heart disease was reported. Therefore, large HDL‐C particles are thought to be a better predictive marker of CVD than total HDL‐C or small HDL‐C particles. The underlying mechanism remains unclear, yet it has been suggested that apo A‐I may play a role. Although there have been studies connecting HDL subfractions with CVD, there have been no studies investigating HDL subfractions in relation to fatty pancreas.

The current study aimed to address the above gaps by comprehensively investigating the relationship of HDL subfractions with fatty pancreas, as well as exploring the role of apo A‐I in this context.

### Intra-pancreatic fat deposition: bringing hidden fat to the fore [^114eodaM]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Development of advanced modalities for detection of fat within the pancreas has transformed understanding of the role of intra-pancreatic fat deposition (IPFD) in health and disease. There is now strong evidence for the presence of minimal (but not negligible) IPFD in healthy human pancreas. Diffuse excess IPFD, or fatty pancreas disease (FPD), is more frequent than type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (the most common disease of the endocrine pancreas) and acute pancreatitis (the most common disease of the exocrine pancreas) combined. FPD is not strictly a function of high BMI; it can result from the excess deposition of fat in the islets of Langerhans, acinar cells, inter-lobular stroma, acinar-to-adipocyte trans-differentiation or replacement of apoptotic acinar cells. This process leads to a wide array of diseases characterized by excess IPFD, including but not limited to acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, T2DM, diabetes of the exocrine pancreas. There is ample evidence for FPD being potentially reversible. Weight loss-induced decrease of intra-pancreatic fat is tightly associated with remission of T2DM and its re-deposition with recurrence of the disease. Reversing FPD will open up opportunities for preventing or intercepting progression of major diseases of the exocrine pancreas in the future.

### Type 2 diabetes as a disease of ectopic fat? [^112XADWd]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Although obesity and diabetes commonly co-exist, the evidence base to support obesity as the major driver of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and the mechanisms by which this occurs, are now better appreciated.

Discussion

This review briefly examines several sources of evidence - epidemiological, genetic, molecular, and clinical trial - to support obesity being a causal risk factor for T2DM. It also summarises the ectopic fat hypothesis for this condition, and lists several pieces of evidence to support this concept, extending from rare conditions and drug effects to sex- and ethnicity-related differences in T2DM prevalence. Ectopic liver fat is the best-studied example of ectopic fat, but more research on pancreatic fat as a potential cause of β-cell dysfunction seems warranted. This ectopic fat concept, in turn, broadly fits with the observation that individuals of similar ages can develop diabetes at markedly different body mass indexes (BMIs). Those with risk factors leading to more rapid ectopic fat gain - for example, men (compared with women), certain ethnicities, and potentially those with a family history of diabetes, as well as others with genes linked to a reduced subcutaneous adiposity - are more likely to develop diabetes at a younger age and/or lower BMI than those without.

Summary

Obesity is the major risk factor for T2DM and appears to drive tissue insulin resistance in part via gain of ectopic fat, with the best-studied organ being the liver. However, ectopic fat in the pancreas may contribute to β-cell dysfunction. In line with this observation, rapid resolution of diabetes linked to a preferential and rapid reduction in liver fat has been noted with significant caloric reduction. Whether these observations can help develop better cost-effective and sustainable lifestyle /medical interventions in patients with T2DM requires further study.

### Ectopic fat accumulation in the pancreas and its biomarkers: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113BejLs]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Presence of fat in the pancreas increases the risk of metabolic co-morbidities. Detection and quantification of pancreatic fat is not a routine clinical practice, at least in part because of need to use expensive imaging techniques. We aimed to systematically review common markers of pancreatic fat in blood and to investigate differences in these markers associated with fatty pancreas. The search was conducted in 3 databases (EMBASE, Scopus, and MEDLINE). Studies in humans were eligible for inclusion if they reported on biological markers and percentage of pancreatic fat or fatty pancreas prevalence. Data were pooled for correlation and effect size meta-analysis. A total of 17 studies including 11 967 individuals were eligible for meta-analysis. Markers of lipid metabolism, including circulating triglycerides (r = 0.38 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31, 0.46]) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = -0.33 [95% CI -0.35, -0.31]), and markers of glucose metabolism, including glycated haemoglobin (r = 0.39 [95% CI 0.30, 0.48], insulin (r = 0.38 [95% CI 0.33, 0.43]), and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (r = 0.37 [95% CI 0.30, 0.44], yielded the best correlations with percentage of pancreatic fat. Further, effect size analysis showed large and medium effects for the above markers of lipid and glucose metabolism. Circulating levels of triglycerides and glycated haemoglobin appear to be the best currently available markers of pancreatic fat. The approach of non-invasive and accurate detection of pancreatic fat by blood analysis should be further explored in the future, by investigating other potential biological markers of pancreatic fat.

### Pancreatic steatosis associates with impaired insulin secretion in genetically predisposed individuals [^111uQuBK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The gene × environment interaction between gwPS and pancreatic steatosis leads to a turning of the direction of association between pancreatic steatosis and insulin secretion, dependent on the genetic background (Fig. 2A).

When analyzed in an unstratified cohort, opposing association directions can wipe out each other. This may explain the lack of association of pancreatic steatosis with insulin secretion and diabetes reported in some clinical studies.

The elevated insulin secretion with higher pancreatic fat content, seen in low-risk individuals in our data, warrants further examination. Whether this phenomenon is secondary to insulinotropic effects of free fatty acids and could play a role in a perpetuation of insulin hypersecretion especially in individuals with pancreatic steatosis are important questions that currently cannot be answered from our data.

Our work shows the genetic-risk dependent association of pancreatic fat in a diabetes-prone population using gold standard measurements for pancreatic fat. Although the findings were replicated in a different cohort with complementary methods, the data in the validation cohort are limited by restricted regions of sampling, available amount of tissue, and potential collateral effects of pancreatic diseases underlying the surgery.

The findings show that pancreatic fat is relevant in the decrease of insulin secretion. However, this factor has to be interpreted in the context of genetically determined insulin resistance. Further studies have to examine the metabolic effects of pancreatic steatosis in relation to genetic risk for diabetes and other potential effect-modifying factors.

### Association between non-alcoholic fatty pancreatic disease (NAFPD) and the metabolic syndrome: case-control retrospective study [^114cx3hR]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, non-alcoholic fatty pancreatic disease (NAFPD or fatty pancreas) may represent a meaningful manifestation of metabolic syndrome. The associations of fatty pancreas with age, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, fatty liver, serum amylase, and platelet count require further examination. The incidental abdominal ultrasonographic finding of fatty pancreas in a subject without known metabolic syndrome but abdominal obesity should alert further investigation. Further cohort study should be carried out to observe serial changes of fatty pancreas in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects.

### Experimental investigation for nonalcoholic fatty pancreas management using probiotics [^116q5jLt]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pancreatic fat infiltration, documented for nearly a century, raises numerous unanswered questions in scientific research. Emerging evidence links pancreatic fat infiltration to various illnesses such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, pancreatitis, and pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Pancreatic fat accumulation associated with obesity in the absence of substantial alcohol consumption is known as nonalcoholic fatty pancreatitis (NAFP).

There exists a reciprocal relationship between NAFP and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as both conditions are linked to fat deposition in the liver and pancreas, respectively. Moreover, fatty pancreas comorbidity has been reported in 50–80% of patients with NAFLD.

NAFP pathogenesis is complex process, and like NAFLD is increasingly diagnosed yearly. The metabolic stress resulting from obesity and insulin resistance (IR) in NAFP can cause acute pancreatitis and severe cell damage, which initiate a cascade of signaling pathways and result in acinar cell death and necrosis. The metabolic oxidative stress has an impact on multiple signaling cascades, which in turn induces the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kB) signaling pathways to generate proinflammatory cytokines and trigger fibrogenesis. As a result, additional research into these signaling pathways may be helpful in developing new treatments for NAFP.

### Fatty pancreas was associated with a higher acute pancreatitis systemic inflammatory response syndrome score at hospital admission [^114XWGow]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pancreatic fat infiltration was shown to be linked with acute pancreatitis and probably its severity. These interesting findings merit more investigation to elucidate the effect of fatty pancreas on acute pancreatitis severity.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study of patients hospitalized with documented acute pancreatitis. Pancreatic fat was determined according to pancreas attenuation on computed tomography. Patients were divided into two groups, with and without fatty pancreas. The Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) score was compared.

Results

Overall, 409 patients were hospitalized with acute pancreatitis. Among them, 48 patients had fatty pancreas (group A), vs. 361 patients who did not (group B). The mean ± SD age in group A was 54.6 ± 21.3, vs. 57.6 ± 16.8 in group B (P = 0.51). Patients in group A, had a significantly higher rate of fatty liver, as compared to group B (85.4% vs. 35.5%, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the medical history among the two groups. Fatty pancreas was associated with more severe acute pancreatitis as assessed by SIRS score at admission. The mean ± SD of SIRS score was significantly higher in group A (0.92 ± 0.87), as compared to 0.59 ± 0.74 in group B (P = 0.009). Positive SIRS score was present in a significantly higher proportion of patients with fatty pancreas (25%), as compared to only 11.4% in group B (P = 0.02).

Conclusion

The occurrence of acute pancreatitis with higher SIRS score was significantly associated with fatty pancreas. Fatty pancreas may represent a predictor of acute pancreatitis severity.

### Combined influence of nonalcoholic fatty liver and body size phenotypes on diabetes risk [^1119jWhn]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2015). Low credibility.

Accumulating evidence shows that NAFLD is strongly associated with CVD risk factors. However, most of the studies regarding the association of NAFLD with CVD risk factors focused on obese subjects. Few studies have examined whether the diabetes risk associated with NAFLD is influenced by BMI categories or by metabolic status. A recent study that examined the associations of NAFLD with CVD risk factors according to BMI categories reported a more pronounced association in non-obese group than in obese group, indicating that the associations of NAFLD with CVD risk factors may vary by a patient's BMI status. The present analysis extended these findings to report the association between NAFLD and diabetes risk according to body size phenotypes (that is, cross-classification of BMI categories and metabolic status). We found that, in the absence of metabolically at-risk, NAFLD was associated with increased diabetes risk, regardless of obesity status. However, the association was more pronounced in non-obese group than in overweight/obese group. In the presence of metabolically at-risk, the significant association between NAFLD and diabetes was lost. Taken together, the association between NAFLD and diabetes varies both by a patient's BMI category and metabolic status. Although explanations for the results remain to be elucidated, it is probably related to differences in regional adipose tissue distribution. BMI provides a general measure of obesity but cannot discriminate among visceral, ectopic, and subcutaneous fat accumulation. It is possible that visceral fat accumulation or ectopic fat deposition in tissues such as liver and pancreas have a stronger relationship with obesity-associated comorbidities than BMI. The anatomic, cellular and molecular features of visceral or ectopic fat define the obesity-associated outcomes. The significance of other factors such as the generational transfer of metabolic phenotype or NAFLD to offspring which occurred partly through epigenetic changes or micro-biota, and sleep apnea may also explain our results. Obstructive sleep apnea, which often coexists with obesity, can mediate fatty pancreas through tissue hypoxia and lipolysis. Evidence shows that fatty pancreas is a sensitive marker for NAFLD, and metabolic syndrome.

### Fatty pancreas: a factor in postoperative pancreatic fistula [^116xPchW]. Annals of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether patients who develop a pancreatic fistula after pancreatoduodenectomy are more likely to have pancreatic fat than matched controls.

Background

Pancreatic fistula continues to be a major cause of postoperative morbidity and increased length of stay after pancreatoduodenectomy. Factors associated with postoperative pancreatic fistula include a soft pancreas, a small pancreatic duct, the underlying pancreatic pathology, the regional blood supply, and surgeon's experience. Fatty pancreas previously has not been considered as a contributing factor in the development of postoperative pancreatic fistula.

Methods

Forty patients with and without a pancreatic fistula were identified from an Indiana University database of over 1000 patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy and matched for multiple parameters including age, gender, pancreatic pathology, surgeon, and type of operation. Surgical pathology specimens from the pancreatic neck were reviewed blindly for fat, fibrosis, vessel density, and inflammation. These parameters were scored (0–4+).

Results

The pancreatic fistula patients were less likely (P < 0.05) to have diabetes but had significantly more intralobular (P < 0.001), interlobular (P < 0.05), and total pancreatic fat (P < 0.001). Fistula patients were more likely to have high pancreatic fat scores (50% vs. 13%, P < 0.001). Pancreatic fibrosis, vessel density, and duct size were lower (P < 0.001) in the fistula patients and negative correlations (P < 0.001) existed between fat and fibrosis (R = -0.40) and blood vessel density (R = -0.15).

Conclusions

These data suggest that patients with postoperative pancreatic fistula have (1) increased pancreatic fat and (2) decreased pancreatic fibrosis, blood vessel density, and duct size. Therefore, we conclude that fatty pancreas is a risk factor for postoperative pancreatic fistula.

### Editorial: abdominal fat: a key player in metabolic acute pancreatitis [^114R1gJw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Excess body fat is widely considered one of the factors that is linked to acute pancreatitis (AP), but its specific role is far from being fully understood. This Editorial offers an insight into the recent research in this field with particular emphasis on findings of the latest prospective population-based studies. It discusses whether body fat distribution influences the risk of developing first-time AP, whether excess body fat affects clinically meaningful outcomes in patients with developed AP, and whether a case can be made for biological interaction between several metabolic components in this disease.

### Comprehensive analysis of dyslipidemia States associated with fat in the pancreas [^114WHZum]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The global burden of cardiovascular diseases continues to rise, and it is increasingly acknowledged that guidelines based on traditional risk factors fail to identify a substantial fraction of people who develop cardiovascular diseases. Fat in the pancreas could be one of the unappreciated risk factors. This study aimed to investigate the associations of dyslipidemia states with fat in the pancreas.

Methods

All participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging on the same 3.0 T scanner for quantification of fat in the pancreas, analyzed as both binary (i.e., fatty change of the pancreas) and continuous (i.e., intra-pancreatic fat deposition) variables. Statistical analyses were adjusted for body mass index, glycated hemoglobin, fasting insulin, ethnicity, age, and sex.

Results

There were 346 participants studied. On most adjusted analyses, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol dyslipidemia was significantly associated with both fatty change of the pancreas (p = 0.010) and intra-pancreatic fat deposition (p = 0.008). Neither low-density lipoprotein cholesterol dyslipidemia nor triglyceride dyslipidemia were significantly associated with fatty change of the pancreas and intra-pancreatic fat deposition. The absence of any dyslipidemia was inversely associated with both fatty change of the pancreas (p = 0.016) and intra-pancreatic fat deposition (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Dyslipidemias are uncoupled when it comes to the relationship with fat in the pancreas, with only high-density lipoprotein cholesterol dyslipidemia having a consistent and strong link with it. The residual cardiovascular diseases risk may be attributed to fatty change of the pancreas.

### Enigmatic ectopic fat: prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty pancreas disease and its associated factors in a Chinese population [^111rDsCA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

From the viewpoint of ectopic fat deposition, it is conceivable that NAFLD and fatty pancreas are closely related. In an animal study, mice fed a high‐fat diet develop obesity and insulin resistance accompanied by features of both NAFLD and NAFPD. However, a longer duration of high‐fat diet feeding increased triglyceride content in the pancreas but not the liver, suggesting that the pancreas is particularly susceptible to ectopic fat deposition. Although two human studies using magnetic resonance spectroscopy or imaging failed to demonstrate the relationship between pancreatic and hepatic fat, their results are limited by the small number of study subjects (n = 36 and 17). In contrast, one recent histopathological study examining the relationship between pancreas fat and liver fat suggested that a cutoff of > 15% total pancreatic fat is significantly correlated with hepatic steatosis. Meanwhile, both interlobular and total pancreatic fat were related to macrovesicular liver fat and NAFLD activity score, but the relationship disappeared after adjustment for BMI. This result implies the relationship between NAFLD and fatty pancreas is mediated by general obesity. However, we demonstrated in the present study that adjustment for general or central obesity did not affect the association between NAFLD and fatty pancreas. This discrepancy may be attributed to the differences in the study design, the methods by which fatty infiltration of liver and pancreas were estimated, and the selection of study subjects, because our cohort was younger, had a larger sample size, and generally was healthier than that in the earlier study.

### Prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disease (NAFPD) and its risk factors among adult medical check-up patients in a private hospital: a large cross sectional study [^116tZCvc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical significance of non-alcoholic fatty pancreatic disease (NAFPD) or fatty pancreas is largely unknown. It is often an incidental finding on abdominal ultrasound, which is not explored further, especially its association with metabolic condition and the risk of pancreatic malignancy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the presence of NAFPD and its associated risk factors among adult medical check-up patients.

Method

A large cross-sectional study was done among adult medical check-up patients underwent abdominal ultrasound between January and December 2013 in Medistra Hospital, Jakarta. Data was obtained from the patients' medical record and include demographic data, blood pressures, fasting blood glucose level, and lipid profile. The presence of fatty pancreas was diagnosed by ultrasound. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were done to find associated risk factors for NAFPD. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 17.

Results

A total of 1054 cases were included in this study; pancreas cannot be visualized in 153 cases and were excluded from the analysis. Fatty pancreas was present in 315 (35.0%) patients. Bivariate analyses found associations among fatty pancreas and several risk factors such as gender, age, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol levels.

Conclusion

Fatty pancreas is a common finding during medical check-up with a prevalence of 35%. Fatty pancreas has significant association with metabolic factors and it might have an important role in risk of malignancy.

### Triglyceride-glucose index is independently associated with fatty pancreas disease in Chinese elderly [^113XJnLZ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As the world's population ages, a variety of chronic diseases are gradually becoming the leading cause of disability and mortality in the elderly. Aging increases the risk of many chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered as a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, and its prevalence rises among the old population. Because of the close histological and embryological relationship between the liver and the pancreas, fat deposition in the pancreas has become a focus of research. The pancreas can contain small amounts of fat in healthy people, and the deposition of fat in the pancreas has recently been described as intrapancreatic fat deposition (IPFD). When IPFD exceeds the upper normal limit, the condition is known as fatty pancreas disease (FPD).

The prevalence of FPD in adults usually ranges from 16 to 35%, with significant variations between age groups and comorbidities. Previous studies have shown that patients with FPD have a significantly increased risk of metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome, and are closely associated with the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. Furthermore, FPD may be associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Therefore, early identification and diagnosis of FPD in the elderly is of particular importance. Currently, transabdominal ultrasound (US), computer tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are the most common methods for diagnosing FPD in the clinic. These methods have certain limitations as well as variations in diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy. Currently, MRI has good performance as a non-invasive tool for assessing IPFD, but the relatively high cost and the need for experienced operators make it less widely used than transabdominal ultrasound in primary care. Therefore, a reliable and cost-effective biomarker to diagnose FPD is still needed.

### Prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disease (NAFPD) and its risk factors among adult medical check-up patients in a private hospital: a large cross sectional study [^115Sq7hF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

High energy intake in human may lead to excessive fat which could be accumulated in visceral organs that are unusual for adipose tissue storage, the so-called ectopic fat. Fatty pancreas or nonalcoholic fatty pancreatic disease (NAFPD) is an excessive fat infiltration of the pancreas due to obesity in the absence of significant alcohol intake. Fatty pancreas is a common ultrasound finding which has increased echogenicity when compared to the normal pancreas.

On the contrary to the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the potential systemic and local consequences of excessive fat accumulation in the pancreas have not been well established. Fatty infiltration in the pancreas has been showed to correlate with the metabolic risk factors and may represent a meaningful manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Epidemiology study also suggests that obesity is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Based on a recent study, fatty infiltration in the pancreas may increase the risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma beyond the effect of obesity alone. The problem with the organ location needs the more accurate imaging diagnostic procedures, such as abdominal MRI or even Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS). The fat content of the pancreas also can be estimated by 3D two point Dixon techniques. However, in population or medical checkup settings, it would be unpractical and also costly to examine the pancreas.

Since the clinical implication of fatty pancreas is still a mater of debate, especially in countries where alcohol consumption is not an issue, therefore, this study was aimed to evaluate the presence of fatty pancreas and estabslihed its associated risk factors.

### Fatty pancreas disease in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients: a case-control study on relationships with glycemic control and exocrine function [^1114LJW9]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

The clinical implications of our findings include the potential role of FPD as an underrecognized complication of T2DM, similar to hepatic steatosis. The evaluation of FPD during the clinical assessment of T2DM patients may aid in identifying individuals at risk for exocrine insufficiency. For patients presenting with unexplained dyspeptic symptoms, exocrine pancreatic dysfunction should be investigated using fecal elastase measurement. The observed U-shaped relationship between HbA1c levels and FPD highlights the importance of evaluating patients with moderate HbA1c elevations, particularly those exceeding 7.4%, for potential FPD and associated exocrine dysfunction. Additionally, even in patients with poorly controlled diabetes and HbA1c levels exceeding 9.8%, where FPD may be less evident due to advanced catabolic processes, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency could still be present and should be carefully assessed. This approach could facilitate early detection and intervention, ultimately improving glycemic control and digestive symptom management.

In conclusion, our findings highlight the complex interplay between IPFD, glycemic control, and exocrine pancreatic function in individuals with T2DM. While FPD is increasingly recognized in this population, its clinical significance remains to be fully understood, and further research is needed to clarify its long-term metabolic implications. The observed U-shaped relationship between HbA1c levels and FPD, alongside the associations with fecal elastase and hepatic fat fraction, suggests the importance of considering comprehensive metabolic assessments in T2DM. In contrast, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency may have more immediate clinical relevance, as it could necessitate targeted evaluation and potential therapeutic interventions. Future studies are warranted to further explore these relationships and their clinical impact.

Best practice advice 6 — fecal fat testing: Best Practice Advice 6: Fecal fat testing is rarely needed and must be performed on a high-fat diet. Quantitative testing is generally not practical for routine clinical use. Steatorrhea is the cardinal clinical feature of EPI and has been defined as a coefficient of fat absorption of < 93% (> 7% of ingested fat is present in the stool), and a formal quantitative test requires a diet of known fat content ingested over 5 days and collection of stool for fat measurement over the course of the final 3 days; the test is burdensome, difficult to implement, and rarely performed outside clinical research, and stool fat measures, including Sudan stain, are nonspecific for EPI.

### Association between non-alcoholic fatty pancreatic disease (NAFPD) and the metabolic syndrome: case-control retrospective study [^114ebKFr]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The present study reveals significant associations of fatty pancreas with aging, obesity, systolic hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia. As compared to subjects without fatty pancreas, a significantly greater percentage of subjects with this condition were also diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. It should be noted that all subjects in this study received abdominal ultrasonography by gastrointestinal specialists blinded to all demographic and laboratory findings for these subjects.

Controversy has surrounded the association of fatty pancreas with advanced age. For example, findings from endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and autopsy studies are consistent with this association. However, no such association was observed in another prospective EUS study.

### Enigmatic ectopic fat: prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty pancreas disease and its associated factors in a Chinese population [^113G7Q87]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Similar to the condition in the liver, excessive lipid deposition in the pancreas is referred to as pancreatic steatosis or nonalcoholic fatty pancreas disease (NAFPD). Long‐term exposure to a high‐fat diet in rats induces both interlobular and intralobular fat accumulation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and fibrosis in the pancreas, and thus damage to the normal pancreatic architecture and islets. Likewise, C57BL/6 mice fed a high‐fat diet develop insulin resistance and features of both NAFLD and NAFPD. –

In human studies, pancreatic fat content is closely associated with increasing BMI, insulin resistance, – metabolic syndrome, – and hepatic fat content.– However, reports on the relationship between fatty pancreas and β‐cell function are inconsistent. Some studies indicate that pancreatic lipid content is negatively associated with insulin secretion in nondiabetic subjectsor individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG)/impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), while others suggest no relationship between β‐cell function and pancreatic fat in subjects with IFG and/or IGTor diabetes patients. However, while there have been studies with a small number of selected subjects, –, there have been no large‐scale studies to examine the prevalence and associated factors of fatty pancreas. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of fatty pancreas and its association with NAFLD and cardiometablolic risk factors in a Chinese population.

### Retrospective study: analysis of risk factors and construction of prediction model for pancreatic steatosis [^114Dv3u1]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

At present, there is no unified disease name for pancreatic steatosis, which is often described as "fatty infiltration of the pancreas", "non-alcoholic fatty pancreas", "pancreatic lipomatosis", etc. The incidence of pancreatic steatosis in the general population is estimated to be between 16% and 35%. The occurrence of pancreatic steatosis is related to various factors, mainly including: obesity, metabolic syndrome, alcohol consumption, non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as well as other factors such as sex hormone levels, low birth weight, changes in intestinal microbiota and high-fat diet. Moreover, the development of pancreatic steatosis can affect the function of pancreatic beta cells which can lead to abnormal insulin secretion, or trigger the onset of acute pancreatitis which can cause necrosis of pancreatic acinar cells through a series of mechanisms, and finally lead to diabetes, pancreatitis and even pancreatic cancer.

### Enigmatic ectopic fat: prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty pancreas disease and its associated factors in a Chinese population [^114WaX1e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

In contrast to NAFLD, the pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical relevance of fatty pancreas remain unclear. In the present study, we found that diabetes mellitus was independently associated with fatty pancreas, and vice versa. Subjects with fatty pancreas had an increased risk of diabetes (OR 1.593) compared with those without it. Many previous studies have indicated that fatty infiltration of the pancreas may contribute to a loss of β‐cell mass and function, – which possibly leads to the development of diabetes. In obese Zucker diabetic fatty rats, the triacylglycerol content of islets in prediabetic rats increased significantly and preceded the development of diabetes. However, in human studies, the data are inconsistent. One study finds that pancreatic fat, as measured by using magnetic resonance spectroscopy or magnetic resonance imaging, is negatively associated with glucose tolerance test–based measures of insulin secretion in nondiabetic subjects. Moreover, the results of the regression analysis in Heni et al indicated that pancreatic fat is a stronger determinant of impaired insulin secretion than visceral fat in subjects with prediabetes. In contrast to these studies, another study that used the gold standard hyperglycemic clamp found no relation between pancreatic fat content and β‐cell function in subjects with impaired glucose metabolism. Similarly, Tushuizen et al reported no association between pancreatic fat and β‐cell dysfunction in diabetic patients. This lack of association suggests that once diabetes occurs, factors additional to pancreatic fat account for further declines in β‐cell functioning.

### The relationship between pancreas steatosis and the risk of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance in Chinese adolescents with concurrent obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^112p83HW]. Pediatric Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Childhood obesity and its associated comorbidities are increasing. 1 The excess fat tends to accumulate in undesired areas such as the liver, pancreas, heart, skeletal muscle and visceral adipose tissue. 2 It is this distribution of fat that plays a critical role in the development of complications 3 and is understood to pose a risk for insulin resistance. 4 Lee et al 5 showed that a third of children and adolescents with obesity have glucose intolerance and relative β‐cell failure. Fatty pancreas for instance has been shown to be a significant risk factor for insulin resistance/diabetes in children and adults. 6 In adults, fatty pancreas is found to be significantly correlated with β‐cell dysfunction and decreased insulin secretion. 7

Fatty pancreas has also been associated with metabolic syndrome, which is characterized by central obesity, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia. 8 Singh et al 9 showed a 2 fold increased risk of metabolic syndrome in people with fatty pancreas while Elhady et al 6 showed an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (OR 11.40; CI 95%: 2.69‐48.22) in children with obesity and fatty pancreas, with fatty pancreas being an independent predictor of metabolic syndrome. Maggio et al 1 demonstrated that increased pancreatic fat was present in adolescents with obesity who also had metabolic syndrome. Likewise, fatty pancreas is further associated with central obesity, which is linked to both insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. 8

Association between fatty pancreas and diabetes mellitus

Type 2 diabetes mellitus was present in 62 (6.9%) of the study subects and fatty pancreas was detected in 31 (50%) of them. Statistically, diabetes has significant associated with fatty pancreas (OR 1.953; 95% CI: 1.164–3.280; p < 0.001). However, when entered into the multivariate analyses; diabetes failed to show a significant association, suggesting that it was a confounding factor rather than an independent risk factor.

### Understanding the association of intrapancreatic fat deposition with adiposity and components of metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114v77BC]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

To date, conflicting data have been published on the association of pancreatic with hepatic lipid infiltration in adult and in children and adolescents, even with accurate measurements of intrapancreatic fat deposition. While several studies have reported a positive association, others found no association. There are also studies in which the association of intrapancreatic fat deposition with liver fat seemed to be mediated by obesity, and the association disappeared when correcting with BMIor with visceral adipose tissue. Alternatively, it is also possible that the timing of fat infiltration in both organs differs, explaining differences among studies. The intricate inter-relationships between intrapancreatic and hepatic fat further emphasizes the need for comprehensive investigations into the underlying mechanisms and potential clinical implications in conditions such as obesity or diabetes.

The current study found a small positive association between intrapancreatic fat deposition and cardiometabolic risk factors that, together with adiposity, are part of metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents with overweight or obesity, but not in normal weight children. This finding concurs with the results reported in two previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses in adults, involving 49,329and 12,675 individuals, in which the presence of fatty pancreas disease increased the risk of metabolic syndrome. However, it is worth noting that these two studies focus on individuals analysed for having fatty pancreas (> 6.2%). In contrast, in this systematic review, the presence of fatty pancreas disease was not an inclusion criterion, and in many cases, the measurement of intrapancreatic fat deposition was a secondary outcome of the study. Thus, the percentage of intrapancreatic fat is much lower than that in adult studies. Indeed, studies investigating the association of intrapancreatic fat deposition with cardiometabolic risk factors have only recently commenced in children and adolescents. This trend has been influenced by several factors such as advancements in the measurement of ectopic fat deposits. Additionally, there is growing concern about the effects of excess adiposity in childhood on the cardiometabolic health of children and early-onset of diabetes.

### Enigmatic ectopic fat: prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty pancreas disease and its associated factors in a Chinese population [^114v1KRA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Fatty infiltration of the pancreas is an enigmatic manifestation of ectopic fat deposition in obesity. Studies have shown that pancreatic lipid accumulation interferes with insulin secretion in humans. However, the prevalence of fatty pancreas and its associated factors in the general population remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of fatty pancreas and its association with diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and cardiometabolic risk factors in a Chinese population.

Methods and Results

This was a cross‐sectional study. A total of 8097 subjects with or without fatty pancreas (n = 1297 and 6800, respectively) were recruited. Each subject was assessed by using abdominal sonography to diagnose NAFLD and fatty pancreas. Clinical and metabolic parameters were compared between groups, and their associations with fatty pancreas were examined. The prevalence of fatty pancreas was 16%. The fatty pancreas group had a significantly greater proportion of subjects with diabetes (12.6% versus 5.2%) and NAFLD (67.2% versus 35.1%) than did the non–fatty pancreas group (P < 0.001). In the logistic regression analysis, age (P < 0.001), general or central obesity (P < 0.001), diabetes (P < 0.001), and NAFLD (P < 0.001) were independently associated with fatty pancreas after adjustment for sex, lipid profile, alanine transaminase/aspartate transaminase ratio, hypertension, smoking, alcohol drinking, and exercise.

Conclusions

The prevalence of fatty pancreas is high in the general population. Both diabetes and NAFLD are important associated factors of fatty pancreas, independent of age, sex, adiposity, and other cardiometabolic risk factors.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is related to nonalcoholic fatty pancreas disease [^115WNcwb]. Pancreas (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Obesity and insulin resistance cause fatty infiltration of many organs, including the pancreas (pancreatic steatosis [PS]) and the liver (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD]). In contrast to NAFLD, pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical relevance of PS remain unknown. This study aimed to identify a possible relation between PS and NAFLD.

Methods

In this study including postmortem collected material of 80 patients, clinical and histological data were collected and revised. Patients with hepatic or pancreatic disease and alcohol abuse were excluded. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score was used for grading the histology of the liver, whereas pancreatic lipomatosis score assessed PS. Ordinal logistic regression was used to analyze correlations.

Results

Interlobular and total pancreatic fat were both related to NAFLD activity score in patients without steatogenic medication (P = 0.02 and P = 0.03, respectively). When corrected for body mass index, no relation could be found. Total pancreatic fat was a significant predictor for the presence of NAFLD (P = 0.02). Presence of intralobular pancreatic fat was related to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; however, total fat was not.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that NAFLD and PS are related. This relationship seems to be mediated by general obesity. Intralobular pancreatic fat is associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

### Fatty pancreas, insulin resistance, and β-cell function: a population study using fat-water magnetic resonance imaging [^112vr3ad]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common chronic liver disease. Fatty pancreas has also been described but is difficult to assess. It is now possible to measure pancreatic and liver fat accurately with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We aimed to define the normal range of pancreatic fat and identify factors associated with fatty pancreas. In addition, the effect of fatty liver and fatty pancreas on insulin resistance (IR) and pancreatic β-cell function was studied.

Methods

Fat-water MRI and proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy were performed on 685 healthy volunteers from the general population to measure pancreatic and liver fat, respectively. On the basis of fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels, the IR and β-cell function were assessed using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA).

Results

Among subjects without significant alcohol consumption or any component of metabolic syndrome, 90% had pancreatic fat between 1.8 and 10.4%. Using the upper limit of normal of 10.4%, 110 (16.1%; 95% confidence interval 13.3–18.8%) subjects had fatty pancreas. On multivariable analysis, high serum ferritin, central obesity, and hypertriglyceridemia were independent factors associated with fatty pancreas. Subjects with both fatty pancreas and fatty liver had higher HOMA-IR than did those with either condition alone. Fatty pancreas was not associated with HOMA-β after adjusting for liver fat and body mass index.

Conclusions

In all, 16.1% of this community cohort of adult Hong Kong Chinese volunteers had a fatty pancreas by our definition. Central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperferritinemia are associated with fatty pancreas. Individuals with fatty pancreas have increased IR.

### Fatty pancreas disease in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients: a case-control study on relationships with glycemic control and exocrine function [^115b9ffE]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex and widespread metabolic disease, characterized by chronic hyperglycemia due to insulin resistance and/or inadequate insulin secretion. Diffuse excess intra-pancreatic fat deposition (IPFD), or fatty pancreas disease (FPD), is frequently observed and may even precede the development of T2DM. Among the systemic complications of T2DM, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and FPD have emerged as conditions of increasing clinical interest.

Non-alcoholic FPD refers to the accumulation of fat in the pancreas independent of excessive alcohol consumption and is increasingly common in T2DM patients, being associated with both endocrine and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction. Moreover, strong evidence supports the presence of minimal, yet clinically relevant, IPFD even in the healthy human pancreas. The exact pathophysiology of this clinical condition remains inadequately defined. Major risk factors for FPD include obesity and metabolic syndrome. Lipid accumulation and subsequent lipotoxicity in pancreatic acinar cells can lead to acinar cell damage, resulting in exocrine insufficiency. However, the impact of FPD on exocrine pancreatic functions has not been thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, pancreatic fat cells contribute to insulin resistance, impairing islet cell function. Comprehensive studies are needed to elucidate the relationships among FPD, diabetes, insulin secretion, and other influencing factors.

The relationship between FPD and T2DM appears to be bidirectional. While hyperglycemia and insulin resistance promote pancreatic fat accumulation, FPD may impair pancreatic functions, exacerbating glucose dysregulation. Risk factors such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and advanced age are strongly associated with FPD, paralleling those of MASLD.

Despite advances in imaging techniques and diagnostic tools, such as fecal elastase testing and hepatic fat fraction measurements, the precise factors influencing IPFD and its impact on endocrine and exocrine pancreatic functions remain inadequately explored. Understanding these interactions is crucial for improving the clinical management of people living with T2DM.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of FPD, the factors influencing its development, and its effects on endocrine and exocrine pancreatic functions in newly diagnosed T2DM patients compared with a control group matched for age, body weight, body mass index (BMI), and body composition. A secondary objective was to investigate the relationship between hepatic steatosis and FPD, with a focus on their presence and severity within the T2DM patient group.

### Association between non-alcoholic fatty pancreatic disease (NAFPD) and the metabolic syndrome: case-control retrospective study [^111F6M19]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Fatty liver is associated with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and obesity and is therefore considered a phenotype of metabolic syndrome. However, less is known regarding the metabolic abnormalities associated with non-alcoholic fatty pancreatic disease (NAFPD; fatty pancreas). The present study was performed to ascertain whether fatty pancreas is associated with specific metabolic risk factors and with metabolic syndrome as defined by the Adult Treatment Panel III.

Methods

Five-hundred-fifty-seven healthy and consecutive subjects without known hypertension or diabetes and who received a health investigation at the National Taiwan University Hospital Health Management Center were enrolled in this retrospective study. Fatty pancreas was diagnosed via trans-abdominal ultrasonographic findings.

Results

Seventy-two (12.9%) subjects diagnosed with fatty pancreas comprised the fatty pancreas group, and remaining subjects comprised the normal pancreas group. The presence of various demographic and metabolic risk factors was recorded for all subjects, and the two groups were examined for statistically significant differences in these factors. As compared to the absence of fatty pancreas, the presence of the disease was associated with older age and with higher values for each of the following: BMI, abdominal girth/height, abdominal girth (both genders), fasting and postprandial blood glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and platelet count. In contrast to previously reported findings, serum amylase values were lower in the fatty pancreas as compared to the control group.

Conclusion

The presence of fatty pancreas represents a meaningful manifestation of metabolic syndrome together with obesity.

### Pancreatic fatty degeneration and fibrosis as predisposing factors for the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [^111VTKdB]. Pancreas (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Knowledge of risk factors for development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is limited. To clarify the background condition of the pancreas for the development of PDAC, we analyzed pancreatic histological changes in noncancerous lesion specimens after pancreatectomy in PDAC patients.

Methods

Seventy-six patients with PDAC were enrolled in this study. The PDAC was in the pancreatic head in 37 patients, in the body in 31, and in the tail in 8. No patients had a history of clinical chronic pancreatitis. As controls, 98 patients without PDAC were enrolled. The following parameters were examined: fibrosis, fatty degeneration, and inflammatory cell infiltration. More than 5% of fatty degeneration in the specimen, more than 10% of fibrosis, and more than 5% of inflammatory cell infiltration were considered positive changes.

Results

Pancreatectomy specimens showed a higher ratio of positive change in fibrosis (86% vs 42%), fatty degeneration (72% vs 44%), and inflammatory cell infiltration (14% vs 3%) than control samples. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that each histological change was a significant, independent determinant for PDAC.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrated that cryptogenic pancreatic inflammation with fatty changes represents an important predisposing factor for PDAC. Screening for subclinical chronic pancreatitis in healthy populations may enable the detection of PDAC at an early stage.

### A prospective evaluation of fatty pancreas by using EUS [^117TyawF]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Fatty liver is associated with obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and the metabolic syndrome. The pathophysiology of fatty pancreas is poorly understood, but it may be closely related to fatty liver.

Objective

The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of fatty pancreas and risk factors associated with its development.

Design

Prospective, single center study.

Setting

Tertiary-care academic medical center.

Patients

This study involved 250 consecutive patients referred for EUS examination.

Intervention

All patients undergoing EUS at our institution were prospectively identified. Information regarding demographics, tobacco use, alcohol use, blood test results, and comorbidities were collected before EUS. Pancreatic echogenicity was graded in comparison to the spleen at the time of EUS by using an a priori specified grading scheme.

Main Outcome Measurements

Prevalence of fatty pancreas and factors associated with its development.

Results

During the study period, 250 consecutive patients were prospectively enrolled. The prevalence of fatty pancreas was 27.8% (95% CI, 22.1–34.1). Fatty liver was seen in 22.6% of patients. Factors associated with fatty pancreas on univariate analysis were increasing body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.004), fatty liver (P < .0001), hyperlipidemia (P = 0.04), and the metabolic syndrome (odds ratio [OR] 3.13, P = 0.004). The presence of any metabolic syndrome components, that is, BMI ≥ 30, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or hypertension, increased the prevalence of fatty pancreas by 37% (OR 1.37, P = 0.01). Factors independently associated with fatty pancreas on multivariate analysis were increasing BMI (OR 1.05, P = 0.03) and fatty liver (OR 3.61, P < .001). We found no association between fatty pancreas and chronic pancreatitis or adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

Limitations

Single institution study. All patients were referred for EUS, which limits generalizability. Lack of histological confirmation of pancreatic fat.

Conclusion

We found a strong association between fatty pancreas and the metabolic syndrome.

### Lack of independent association between fatty pancreas and incidence of type 2 diabetes: 5-year Japanese cohort study [^112y7hHn]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Previous cross-sectional studies have shown that attenuation in the pancreas seen on unenhanced computed tomography (CT) scans was inversely correlated with histologic pancreatic fat, and that fatty pancreas was associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, no longitudinal study has evaluated whether fatty pancreas increases the incidence of T2DM. We conducted a cohort study to investigate the association between fatty pancreas and the incidence of T2DM.

Research Design and Methods

A total of 813 participants without diabetes underwent health checks by unenhanced CT scanning in 2008 and 2009, and were observed for a median follow-up period of 5.06 (interquartile range 3.01–5.92) years. Attenuation in three regions of the pancreas seen on an unenhanced CT scan was measured, and the mean pancreatic attenuation was calculated to evaluate fatty pancreas at baseline; the more severe the fatty pancreas, the lower the mean pancreatic attenuation. The incident T2DM hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between fatty pancreas and T2DM incidence were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, BMI, liver attenuation seen on unenhanced CT scan, and alcohol intake of ≥ 20 g/day.

Results

T2DM occurred in 62 participants (7.6%) during the follow-up period. The higher pancreas attenuation (i.e., less pancreatic fat) at baseline was associated with decreased T2DM incidence in a univariate analysis (crude HR 0.97 [95% CI 0.96–0.99]); and fatty pancreas (lower pancreas attenuation) was positively associated with increased T2DM incidence. However, the association was substantially explained by the confounders (multivariate HR 1.00 [95% CI 0.98–1.02]).

Conclusions

Fatty pancreas was not independently associated with future T2DM.

### Enigmatic ectopic fat: prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty pancreas disease and its associated factors in a Chinese population [^112sQ3Dr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the prevalence of fatty pancreas, an enigmatic ectopic fat, and its risk factors in a large cohort. Our results explicitly indicate that NAFLD and diabetes were strongly associated with fatty pancreas after adjustment for age, sex, adiposity, ALT/AST ratio, and other cardiometabolic risk factors.

To date, there are only a few studies regarding pancreatic steatosis, and its pathophysiological mechanisms are largely unknown. It was Ogilivie who first coined the term "pancreatic lipomatosis" for "excessive storage of fat in pancreatic tissue". The term "lipomatosis" is now replaced by "steatosis". Recently, van Greenen et al developed the first histopathological grading system, the "pancreatic lipomatosis score", for the scoring of pancreatic steatosis. This grading system emphasizes the distribution of intralobular, interlobular, and total pancreatic fat. However, no dichotomous histopathological cutoff has been yet proposed to define "fatty pancreas". In addition, there has been no study exploring the link between the pathological findings of fatty pancreas with those of imaging studies. One reason may be due to the difficulty of rapid autolysis encountered in autopsy specimens. Furthermore, in contrast to the widely used liver biopsy for various diagnostic purposes, pancreatic biopsy has not been suggested and regularly performed in clinical practice.

Previous studies have shown that fatty pancreas is associated with BMI, visceral fat, and fatty liver. However, an association of NAFLD and fatty pancreas has never been demonstrated in large‐cohort studies. Most of these studies had a small sample size (n = 120 to 293), and the subjects are highly selective, either "scheduled for endoscopic ultrasound" for a diseased state, or "visited the obesity clinic"for investigation, which limits the generalizability of their results. In contrast, our study recruited a general population admitted for a physical checkup. With a significantly larger number of subjects, we observed that the prevalence of fatty liver was 16%, which could be considered a reliable estimate for the general population. Furthermore, we found that both NAFLD and BMI or WC were independently associated with fatty pancreas.

### Impact of pancreatic fat on the risk of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis [^1162Nw8D]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Study Aims

Fatty pancreas is a potential risk factor for acute pancreatitis; however, whether it is also a risk factor for post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis (PEP) has not been evaluated. We aimed to determine the impact of fatty pancreas on the development of PEP.

Methods

We analyzed the data of patients who underwent abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan and sequential therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Fatty change in the pancreas was evaluated based on pancreatic attenuation of unenhanced image on CT scan. The risk of fatty pancreas for the development of PEP was evaluated using a logistic regression model.

Results

Of a total of 858 patients included in the study, 354 (41.3%) had fatty pancreas, while 504 (58.7%) did not have fatty pancreas. PEP developed in 28 patients (7.9%) in the fatty pancreas group and in 13 patients (2.6%) in the no fatty pancreas group. Fatty pancreas was significantly associated with the development of PEP (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval] 2.38 [1.16–4.87]). A history of acute pancreatitis, female sex, difficult cannulation, and endoscopic papillary balloon dilation were also risk factors for the development of PEP. The risk for moderate-to-severe PEP development tended to be higher in the fatty pancreas group than in the no fatty pancreas group (OR [95% CI] 5.61 [0.63–49.62]).

Conclusions

Fatty pancreas is a significant risk factor for the development of PEP. Clinicians need to be aware of the risk of fatty pancreas for the development of PEP prior to performing ERCP.

### Relationship of high-density lipoprotein subfractions and apolipoprotein A-I with fat in the pancreas [^111M8MKo]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aim

To investigate the associations of high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) subfractions and apolipoprotein A‐I (apo A‐I) with fat in the pancreas.

Methods

A total of 170 individuals were studied. All participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging on a single 3.0‐Tesla scanner to determine the presence/absence of fatty pancreas. HDL subfractions were measured using a commercially available lipoprotein subfractions testing system and classed as large, intermediate and small HDL. Both unadjusted and adjusted (accounting for demographics, anthropometrics, insulin resistance and other covariates) logistic regression models were built.

Results

Individuals with fatty pancreas had significantly lower circulating levels of the large HDL class and apo A‐I. Every unit decrease in the large HDL class was associated with a 93% increase in the likelihood of fatty pancreas in the most adjusted model (P < .001). Every unit decrease in apo A‐I was associated with a 45% increase in the likelihood of fatty pancreas in the most adjusted model (P = 0.012). The intermediate and small HDL classes were not significantly associated with fatty pancreas.

Conclusions

Fat in the pancreas is inversely associated with the circulating levels of large HDL particles and apo A‐I. Purposely designed studies are warranted to investigate the potential of fatty pancreas as an indicator of the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

### Association between non-alcoholic fatty pancreatic disease (NAFPD) and the metabolic syndrome: case-control retrospective study [^111LU9x4]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Unlike fat stored in subcutaneous adipocytes, visceral fat and ectopic fat stored in tissues such as liver, heart, muscle, and pancreas are both associated with obesity and/or insulin resistance. Fatty liver is reported to be associated with insulins resistance, dyslipidemia, and obesity and is therefore considered a phenotype of metabolic syndrome. However, only a few studies of the metabolic abnormalities associated with non-alcoholic fatty pancreatic disease, termed NAFPD or fatty pancreas, have been performed, and the clinical consequences of fatty pancreas remain unclear (Figure 1).

Figure 1
The association between ectopic fat deposition and metabolic syndrome.

Ogilvie, who first described fatty infiltration of the pancreas in 1993, reported 17% pancreatic fat storage for obese cadavers as compared with 9% for lean ones. Findings from studies with animals reveal that pancreatic steatosis promotes islet cell abnormalities resulting in hyperglycemia. Additionally, findings from older autopsy and transabdominal ultrasonography studies reveal an association of fatty pancreas with advanced age, obesity, and increased body fat. Results of more recent studies indicate additional possible associations for fatty pancreas including male gender, age older than 60 years, hypertension, hepatic steatosis, alcohol use, increased body mass index (BMI), impaired insulin secretion, insulin resistance, visceral fat deposition, elevated triglycerides (TG), increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values, β-cell dysfunction, and diabetes. Lee et al. and Sepe et al. suggested that fatty pancreas is associated with an increased frequency of metabolic syndrome and correlates with the number of parameters of metabolic syndrome. The present study was undertaken to ascertain whether NAFPD is associated with specific demographic and metabolic risk factors and with metabolic syndrome as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III).

### The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty pancreas by endoscopic ultrasonography [^11698UzP]. Pancreas (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Pancreatic steatosis or fatty pancreas refers to the fat accumulation in the pancreas, which can lead to inflammation and fibrosis, β-cell dysfunction, fibrosis, and, possibly, pancreatic cancer. This study aimed to study the prevalence of fatty pancreas and its risk factors in patients referred to an endosonography center.

Methods

During 18 months, 228 patients who were referred to our endosonography center for various reasons were evaluated for fatty pancreas. Fatty pancreas was defined as hyperechoic pancreas echotexture compared with spleen echotexture. Demographic characteristics, past medical history, and laboratory measurements were compared between groups with and without fatty pancreas to determine the risk factors for fatty pancreas.

Results

The prevalence of fatty pancreas was 25.9%. Patients with fatty pancreas had a significantly higher mean level of uric acid (P = 0.04), frequency of ischemic heart disease (P = 0.03), hyperlipidemia (P = 0.04), frequency of fatty liver (P < 0.001), and aortic intima thickness (P = 0.01). There was no significant difference in age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, substance abuse, and use of oral contraceptives in the 2 groups.

Conclusions

Fatty pancreas is a common disorder. There are meaningful relationships between coronary artery disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver, and atherosclerosis with fatty pancreas.

### Focal fatty replacement of the pancreas: usefulness of chemical shift MRI [^112aG1Fp]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to describe the typical CT and chemical shift MRI findings and to evaluate their usefulness in the diagnosis of focal fatty replacement of the pancreas in five patients.

Conclusion

The presence of a perceptible focal low-attenuation lesion in the pancreas on CT and the reduction in signal intensity of the lesion on the opposed phase of chemical shift MR images are useful for differentiating focal fatty replacement of the pancreas from true pancreatic neoplasm. Therefore, these imaging findings obviate invasive diagnostic procedures and surgery in the care of patients with focal fatty replacement of the pancreas.

3.2 Associations ofsubfractions with fatty pancreas

Individuals with fatty pancreas had significantly lower circulating levels of HDL‐1 (P = 0.001), HDL‐2 (P = 0.003), HDL‐3 (P < .001) and HDL‐4 (P < .001) than individuals without fatty pancreas. The levels of HDL‐5 (P = 0.237), HDL‐6 (P = 0.417), HDL‐7 (P = 0.306), HDL‐8 (P = 0.326), HDL‐9 (P = 0.296) or HDL‐10 (P = 0.287) did not differ significantly between the two groups (Figure 3). In both unadjusted and all adjusted analyses, the large HDL class (encompassing HDL‐1, HDL‐2 and HDL‐3) and HDL‐4 subfraction were significantly associated with fatty pancreas (P < .05) (Table 2). In the most adjusted model, every unit decrease in HDL‐1, HDL‐2, HDL‐3 and HDL‐4 was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of fatty pancreas by 60% (P = 0.028), 76% (P = 0.041), 94% (P < .001) and 97% (P = 0.003), respectively. There were no significant associations of the other HDL subfractions with fatty pancreas (Table 2). The likelihood of fatty pancreas increased by 93% for each unit decrease in the large HDL class (P < .001). The intermediate and small HDL classes were not significantly associated with fatty pancreas (Table 2).

### Retrospective study: analysis of risk factors and construction of prediction model for pancreatic steatosis [^111BE8ri]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Pancreatic steatosis is a common disease of the pancreas. Surprisingly, its prevalence is higher than the sum of type 2 diabetes (T2DM, the most common pancreatic endocrine disease) and acute pancreatitis (the most common pancreatic exocrine disease). Its pathogenesis may be related to multiple factors such as obesity, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, leptin resistance, and genetics. The occurrence of pancreatic steatosis is closely related to factors such as age, metabolic syndrome, and fatty liver. However, it has not been given sufficient attention in clinical practice due to the lack of criteria about its diagnosis.

Current LD, pancreatic CT value, and pancreatic/spleen CT value were the main factors causing pancreatic steatosis in cases. Here, current study manifested that cases with pancreatic steatosis showed higher age and BMI, higher serum LDL level, lower pancreatic CT value as well as pancreatic/spleen CT value, and were more common in male populations and NAFLD patients. Therefore, early diagnosis of pancreatic steatosis is particularly important as it may alter the clinical outcome of patients, but extensive prospective studies are still needed to observe the long-term effects and prognosis of pancreatic steatosis.

### Relationship of high-density lipoprotein subfractions and apolipoprotein A-I with fat in the pancreas [^112vxxi6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

To investigate the associations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) subfractions and apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) with fat in the pancreas.

Methods

A total of 170 individuals were studied. All participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging on a single 3.0-Tesla scanner to determine the presence/absence of fatty pancreas. HDL subfractions were measured using a commercially available lipoprotein subfractions testing system and classed as large, intermediate and small HDL. Both unadjusted and adjusted (accounting for demographics, anthropometrics, insulin resistance and other covariates) logistic regression models were built.

Results

Individuals with fatty pancreas had significantly lower circulating levels of the large HDL class and apo A-I. Every unit decrease in the large HDL class was associated with a 93% increase in the likelihood of fatty pancreas in the most adjusted model (P < .001). Every unit decrease in apo A-I was associated with a 45% increase in the likelihood of fatty pancreas in the most adjusted model (P = 0.012). The intermediate and small HDL classes were not significantly associated with fatty pancreas.

Conclusions

Fat in the pancreas is inversely associated with the circulating levels of large HDL particles and apo A-I. Purposely designed studies are warranted to investigate the potential of fatty pancreas as an indicator of the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

### Intra-pancreatic fat is associated with continuous glucose monitoring metrics [^112bYMtg]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

To investigate the relationship of fat in the pancreas with time spent in different glycaemic ranges.

Methods

Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging at 3.0 Tesla was used to quantify fat in the pancreas as both continuous [i.e. intra-pancreatic fat deposition (IPFD)] and binary (i.e. fatty change of the pancreas vs. normal pancreas) variables. Dexcom G6 devices were used to collect continuous glucose monitoring data every 5min over a continuous 7-day period. Time above range (TAR), time in range (TIR) and time below range were computed. Statistical models were built to adjust for age, sex, body composition, and other covariates in linear regression analysis and analysis of covariance.

Results

In total, 38 individuals were studied. IPFD was significantly associated with TAR (p = .036) and TIR (p = .042) after adjustment for covariates. For every 1% increase in IPFD, there was a 0.3 unit increase in TAR and a decrease in TIR. Individuals with fatty change of the pancreas, when compared with those with normal pancreas, had significantly higher TAR (p = .034) and lower TIR (p = .047) after adjustment for covariates. Neither IPFD (p = .805) nor fatty change of the pancreas (p = .555) was associated with time below range after adjustment for covariates.

Conclusion

Increased fat in the pancreas is associated with excessive glycaemic variability. Fatty change of the pancreas may contribute to heightening the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

### Prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disease (NAFPD) and its risk factors among adult medical check-up patients in a private hospital: a large cross sectional study [^1172xJBn]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Association between fatty pancreeas and metabolic risk factors

Our results showed significant association between fatty pancreas and metabolic risk factors (Table 2). Table 3 showed independent risk factors to predict fatty pancreas. These results were consistent with previous epidemiological report in Hong Kong Chinese population. The OR of DM and other variables mostly around the value of 2.0; therefore although systolic BP have higher OR, the difference with DM or triglycerides can be considered not too wide. However, the number of subjects with DM is relatively small compared to other variables. It could affect the statistical calculation of OR and may explain the slight difference with systolic BP. From the statistical point of view, clinical value of an OR occurs when it is more than 1.5. Compared to age or BMI (which have OR > 4.0), the ORs of DM and systolic BP are much weaker, it's also the same with other variables with OR value less than 2.0. From the metabolic point of view, DM is considered as part of metabolic syndrome with could confound other variables within the metabolic markers group (such as cholesterol or TG). On the other hand, blood pressure is a hemodynamic marker. High blood pressure in metabolic syndrome is a consequence of insulin resistance with various underlying mechanisms. Therefore, higher OR of systolic BP might reflect that is more important as risk factor than DM or other lipid parameters.

Association between fatty pancreas and fatty liver

Fatty liver was reported as a predictor of "hyperechogenic pancreas" seen during endoscopic ultrasound. A postmortem study collected from 80 cadavers found that total pancreatic fat was a significant predictor of NAFLD, but no correlation was found between pancreatic fat and NAFLD activity score after corrected for body mass index. Our study showed significant correlation between fatty pancreas and fatty liver, however whether with these two entities might doubling the risk of malignancy is still unknown.

Despite the presence of statistical association, the pathophysiology underlying both conditions might be coincidence rather than causative. Both fatty pancreas and fatty liver are significantly associated with metabolic risk factors due to excessive energy intake.

### Human and molecular genetics shed lights on fatty liver disease and diabetes conundrum [^113CzyQZ]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

New insights by molecular human genetics robustly support that FLD is causally associated with dysmetabolism and T2D. 89, 124 Recent studies highlighted that the key molecular mechanism of dysmetabolism is not fat accumulation per se but the degree of hepatic fibrosis (excess liver fat content — lipotoxicity), leading to reduced insulin clearance, insulin resistance and T2D. 59 Notably, initial findings show that these genetic factors might be directly implicated in modulating pancreatic beta‐cell function, 124 although future studies are needed to fully understand this relationship. In this context, it is worth noting that a consensus of experts has recently proposed novel criteria for diagnosing MAFLD (mainly based on the presence of overweight/obesity, T2D or other metabolic syndrome traits), irrespective of other concomitant liver diseases. 19, 20 We believe that this novel definition is the first attempt to define the complexity of FLD and its heterogeneous clinical phenotypes, paving the way for a more fit design of clinical trials that will lead to precision medicine. Finally, it is also reasonable to speculate that the quantitative assessment of liver fat content by novel unconventional methods and the discovery of specific biomarkers of hepatic lipotoxicity will provide a better opportunity to improve the overall risk prediction of incident T2D in all individuals with FLD.

### Retrospective study: analysis of risk factors and construction of prediction model for pancreatic steatosis [^116QNjB7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of pancreatic steatosis has its current existing problems, which there is no clear consensus or guideline. Unlike hepatic steatosis, the diagnosis of pancreatic steatosis does not have a unified standard and relies on the experience of imaging doctors for judgment through imaging examinations such as ultrasound scanning, multi-echo Dixon MRI and CT. For example, pancreatic steatosis is related to higher visceral fat tissue area (VFA), a cut-off value of VFA ≥ 107.2 cm² may predict pancreatic steatosis. Numerous previous studies have confirmed that CT values of the pancreas and spleen can serve as surrogate markers for pancreatic fat deposition. However, to date, no studies have reported the pancreas/spleen CT ratio as a marker for pancreatic fat deposition.

In addition to imaging examinations, laboratory tests, including the detection of related indicators such as glucose (GLU), triglycerides (TG), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), can also help to evaluate the functional status of the pancreas. The accumulation of fat outside subcutaneous adipose tissue often has adverse effects on systemic metabolism. Preliminary studies have shown that pancreatic fat is associated with metabolic syndrome, impaired glucose metabolism, and reduced insulin secretion. Therefore, when referring to diseases related to fat and pancreas, NAFLD often accompanies them because they have similar pathological basis and pathogenesis. On the one hand, elevated serum triglyceride levels lead to their ectopic deposition in organs such as the liver or pancreas, causing related diseases. On the other hand, inflammation and lipid disorders are key factors leading to the release of free fatty acids, ectopic fat deposition, and pancreatic steatosis. Meanwhile, inflammation mediated by adipocyte cytokines can cause oxidative stress in the pancreas, leading to dysfunction and apoptosis of beta cells and acinar cells, ultimately resulting in endocrine and exocrine dysfunction of the pancreas. However, to date, it remains unclear whether these biological indicators are involved in the early warning of pancreatic steatosis.

At present, there is a lack of relevant research on pancreatic steatosis in the world. In order to prevent the occurrence of pancreatic steatosis, current study aims to analyze independent risk factors, builds a prediction model of pancreatic steatosis, guides early diagnosis, improves diagnosis and treatment programs, and ultimately reduces the incidence of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.

### Enigmatic ectopic fat: prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty pancreas disease and its associated factors in a Chinese population [^112mre8M]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

There are some limitations in this work, as follows. First, because this study used a cross‐sectional design, it does not allow causal inference between fatty pancreas and diabetes or NAFLD, although the causal relationship is expected to link fatty pancreas with diabetes, not vice versa. Second, although fatty pancreas is associated with impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance, we did not measure the serum insulin level because it is not part of a routine health checkup, and we did not have the specimen for this measurement. Instead, we adjusted components of metabolic syndrome as a proxy for insulin resistance. Third, because the racial differences in the fatty pancreas have not yet been reported, more studies on this topic are needed. Fourth, we did not adjust for socioeconomic parameters, such as educational level or income, to investigate their possible effects on fatty pancreas because we did not have these data in our database. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have suggested any role for these socioeconomic variables in the prevalence of fatty pancreas. Finally, in this work, the diagnosis of fatty pancreas and NAFLD was made with sonography but not confirmed pathologically. Although magnetic resonance–based techniques are frequently used for measurement of pancreatic fat content, they are expensive and difficult to perform in clinical practice for a large‐scale cohort. On the other hand, abdominal sonography is an established noninvasive and reproducible tool as a screening modality, which has been shown to be accurate and cost‐effective in diagnosing fatty pancreas in previous cohort studies. The results of these earlier works support its use in the present study. More important, increased deposition of fat, which has infiltrated along the pancreatic septa, has been shown to be a major determining factor of pancreatic echogenicity in one study evaluating pancreatic echogenicity and its correlation with the morphologic appearance of the pancreas in computed tomography. Therefore, it seems plausible to assume that the "fatty pancreas" found on ultrasonography is associated with increased fat deposition pathologically. Furthermore, the ultrasonography data were interpreted by hepatologists who were blind to the examinees' past history or biochemical results, to reduce potential bias.

In conclusion, in this work we found a high prevalence of fatty pancreas via abdominal sonography in a large Chinese cohort drawn from the general population. Our results also show that both diabetes and NAFLD are important associated factors of fatty pancreas independent of age, sex, adiposity, and other cardiometabolic risk factors. Because obesity is one of the most important challenges to public health worldwide, there is a need for further studies to better understand ectopic pancreatic fat deposits.

### The relationship between pancreas steatosis and the risk of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance in Chinese adolescents with concurrent obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^113GHbSN]. Pediatric Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Binary logistic regression showed that both pancreas and liver PDFF were independent predictors of metabolic syndrome similar to other studies. 6, 53 We further showed that the odds ratio of metabolic syndrome in adolescents with obesity and fatty pancreas was 2 folds than in those without fatty pancreas, similar to findings of Singh et al. 9 These findings support the hypothesis that fatty pancreas and fatty liver are a part of the metabolic syndrome. They further reiterate the essential role of pancreas and liver in glucose and energy homeostasis/lipid metabolism. Any disruption of the anatomical integrity such as ectopic fat infiltration has the potential to distort organ function resulting in metabolic disorders and associated complications such as T2DM and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, in our opinion, the presence of fatty pancreas at imaging should not be considered as a benign finding but rather as an imaging biomarker of pancreatic metabolic and endocrine dysfunction. This could serve as a wake‐up call to the clinicians to prioritize these patients under early interventional programme with best possible treatment option to reverse the vulnerable metabolic situation.

Strangely, no direct correlations among pancreas PDFF, liver PDFF and VAT were noted in our study similar to the findings of van der Zijl et al. 42 However, BMI and central obesity correlated significantly with all these parameters including SAT in agreement with a previous study. 51 These findings imply that the relationship that exists among these parameters is mediated by both general and central obesity. In view of the above inter‐related associations and correlations, we postulate that any early intervention aimed at reducing excess body fat would have a ripple effect in reducing ectopic fat within the liver, pancreas and other visceral organs like kidneys, resulting in reduced risks of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and possibly minimize long term complications such as T2DM.

Thus, we would recommend "screening" in this population group once the waist circumference and BMI/BMI z‐scores are outside the normal range. Furthermore, as total cholesterol and plasma fasting glucose were found to be independent predictors of fatty pancreas, we would recommend initiating "screening" if these parameters are elevated. Moreover, as the presence of fatty pancreas was as high as 50% in this Hong Kong Chinese cohort with fatty liver, the presence of fatty liver could be an indicator of the presence of fatty pancreas. Since fatty liver and fatty pancreas can be assessed during the same scanning session using chemical shift encoded MRI (CSE‐MRI) PDFF, the assessment of pancreatic fat can be performed in addition to assessment of hepatic fat.

Association between fatty pancreas and diabetes mellitus

Based on our study, even though there is a significant association between the presence of fatty pancreas and diabetes mellitus, however the association was not observed in the multivariate analysis. Different result was reported among 7464 subjects underwent physical check-up in Taiwan. This might be due to the smaller size effect in the subgroup analysis. The investigators did found an independent association between fatty pancreas and diabetes (OR: 1.379; 95%CI: 1–047–1.816). However, this study was not designed to establish a direct causal relationship between diabetes mellitus and fatty pancreas or vice versa and should be interpreted as such. The complex factor in insulin resistance pathway might play an important factor. High free fatty acid (FFA) will induce the accumulation of pancreatic fat and the fat deposition will disrupt the beta cell function. The beta cell dysfunction results in unmet relative insulin need to maintain optimal glycemic control and in combination with insulin resistance at the periphery synergistically contributes to the long-term hyperglycemia. This is an important pathway for the development of diabetes mellitus. In return, the insulin resistance condition where induced by FFA source in the pancreas might induce the chronic inflammation stage where this can become a malignancy risk. With these findings, we might also need to screen our diabetes patients for pancreatic malignancy risk.

This study has several limitations. First, the study was designed as a cross-sectional study which cannot prove causal link between fatty pancreas and the associated factors. However, the large sample size in this study could provide generalization to the larger population of interest. Body mass index (BMI) as a risk for pancreatic lipomatosis might be a confounding factor to detect the presence of fatty pancreas. Second, the data about diabetes medication not being reported based on our MCU standard examination record. But this study has given the importance of metabolic factors associated with the presence of NAFPD. Third, the need to differentiate between simple steatosis and steatosis with inflammation in the pancreas has not been elucidated. The transabdominal ultrasound study might not be the best of choice, but ultrasound is still a qualified technique in an experienced hand, and also cheaper when compared to MRI in the community setting. Further study with ethical consideration will be needed to perform pancreas biopsy using EUS study.

### Pancreatic steatosis associates with impaired insulin secretion in genetically predisposed individuals [^116RBQE1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our data provide evidence that pancreatic fat has distinct association patterns with insulin secretion depending on genetic T2D risk. In case of low genetically determined T2D risk, there was a positive association of pancreatic steatosis with insulin secretion in the discovery cohort. In contrast, subjects with a high genetic T2D risk showed lower insulin secretion levels associated with increased pancreatic steatosis. Because these associations were independent of BMI, insulin sensitivity index, MRI-measured visceral adipose tissue, and liver fat content — all bona fide confounders of insulin resistance — the impact of pancreatic steatosis on insulin secretion appears to be independent from whole-body insulin action but highly dependent on genetic predilection to diabetes. The lower insulin secretion in case of high pancreatic fat content and elevated genetic risk was validated in a different set of patients with histologically quantified pancreatic fat content.

Data from the partitioned polygenic scores provide insights on the biological background of the observed interaction. We identify an interaction between the insulin-sensitivity modulating group of SNPs and pancreatic fat content, suggesting that variants determining insulin resistance are involved in flipping the action of pancreatic fat on insulin secretion to negative. Among the polygenic scores proposed by Udler et al, the liver/lipid cluster showed a consistently directed interaction with pancreatic fat (ie, higher polygenic risk led to a more negative slope of the association of pancreatic fat with insulin secretion).

These findings complement recent experimental data from human pancreatic adipocytes and islets cocultures showing that pancreatic fat cells lead to a deterioration of islet function only in a typical environment that characterizes insulin resistance. Specifically, the hepatokine fetuin-A, which is typically increased in fatty liver disease, induced the secretion of inflammatory cytokines from preadipocytes and adipocytes in the presence of palmitate. Of note, palmitate is secreted as part of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) from the liver. This process is amplified in persons with insulin resistance resulting from enhanced hepatic de novo lipogenesis. The existence of a metabolic crosstalk between pancreatic fat, fatty liver, and pancreatic beta-cells is now supported by the interaction between the liver/lipid polygenic risk cluster and the amount of pancreatic fat on insulin secretion. Of note, capturing complex relationships that underly such a multiorgan crosstalk in human subjects is challenging. The individual metabolic environment shows considerable within-person or day-to-day variation and characteristic biomarkers are not fully known or difficult to measure. Thus, genetic instruments can be used as substitutes either for the general predisposition to develop T2D (gwPS), or for specific features of the pathology (partitioned polygenic scores).

### Relationship of high-density lipoprotein subfractions and apolipoprotein A-I with fat in the pancreas [^117U4E3s]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3 Associations of apolipoprotein A‐I with fatty pancreas

Individuals with fatty pancreas had significantly lower circulating levels of apo A‐I than individuals without fatty pancreas (P = 0.028). Apo A‐I had a significant negative association with fatty pancreas in the crude model (OR = 0.64, P = 0.030) and after adjusting for age, sex and ethnicity (OR = 0.57, P = 0.010). The association remained significant in the most adjusted model, where each unit decrease in apo A‐I was associated with a 45% increase in the likelihood of fatty pancreas (OR = 0.54, P = 0.012).

3.4 Associations ofsubfractions with apolipoprotein A‐I

The large HDL class, as well as HDL‐1 and HDL‐8 subfractions, were significantly associated with circulating levels of apo A‐I in both unadjusted and all adjusted analyses (P < .05 for all). In the most adjusted model, HDL‐1 and the large HDL class were significantly and positively associated with apo A‐I (HDL‐1: β = .20, P = 0.033; large HDL: β = .24, P = 0.020). There was a significant negative association between HDL‐8 and apo A‐I (β = −.20, P = 0.030). No significant associations were found between the other HDL subfractions and classes and apo A‐I (Table 3).

### Pancreatic steatosis and its relationship to β-cell dysfunction in humans: racial and ethnic variations [^1142Lj7g]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

The steep relationship observed between low levels of pancreatic TGs and compensatory insulin secretion in black adults is consistent with glucose-free fatty acid cross-talk, a well-described phenomenon in which free fatty acids stimulate insulin secretion either directly or secondarily by promoting insulin resistance. The weaker positive relationship seen in white adults and the inverse relationship seen in Hispanic adults is consistent with lipotoxicity offsetting, or even overriding, glucose-free fatty acid cross-talk. The stimulatory effect of free fatty acids on insulin secretion also has been shown to be attenuated in persons who are genetically predisposed to develop type 2 diabetes.

A novel finding of our study is that Hispanic subjects were the only group with both pancreatic and hepatic steatosis, the latter being known to 1) attenuate insulin-mediated suppression of gluconeogenesis, elevating fasting plasma glucose and basal insulin secretion; and 2) augment hepatic TG secretion, exposing the pancreas to a higher TG load. Thus, we speculate that hepatic steatosis begets pancreatic steatosis.

### Enigmatic ectopic fat: prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty pancreas disease and its associated factors in a Chinese population [^116R7fYT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Subjects with the following conditions or diseases were excluded: (1) an age of < 18 or ≥ 80 years; (2) a BMI of ≥ 35 kg/m²; (3) alcohol consumption ≥ 20 g/d in the past year; (4) serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL; (5) any acute or chronic inflammatory disease as determined by a leukocyte count > 10 000/mm³ or clinical signs of infection; and (6) any other major diseases, including generalized inflammation or advanced malignant diseases contraindicating this study. All authors had access to the study data and reviewed and approved the final manuscript.

Statistical Analysis

SPSS software (version 17.0; SPSS) was used for statistical analysis. All normally distributed continuous variables were expressed as mean ± SD. Study subjects were divided into 2 groups based on the presence or absence of fatty pancreas, and their clinical characteristics were compared using Student t test (in continuous variables) or χ² tests (in categorical variables). The Kruskal–Wallis test was used in cases where the data was nonparametric. Logistic regression analysis adjusted for general obesity in model 1 and central obesity in model 2 was used to identify the clinical and metabolic factors independently associated with fatty pancreas. A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Relationship of high-density lipoprotein subfractions and apolipoprotein A-I with fat in the pancreas [^111mdc8c]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This was the first study to comprehensively investigate 10 HDL subfractions and three HDL classes in relation to fat in the pancreas (determined with the use of 3.0‐Tesla MRI). The main finding was that HDL‐1 to HDL‐3 (as individual HDL subfractions and collectively as the large HDL class), as well as HDL‐4, were significantly associated with fatty pancreas. Consistent with this was the finding that apo A‐I is significantly and directly associated with the large HDL class, and significantly and inversely associated with fatty pancreas. All the above findings held true even after adjusting for demographics (age, sex and ethnicity), anthropometrics (waist‐to‐hip ratio), lipid metabolism (total cholesterol) and glucose metabolism (HbA1c and insulin resistance) — variables that are known to influence IPFD.

### Vanishing pancreas: CT and MRI features and imaging diagnostic strategies [^112WwDoo]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Pancreatic vanishing is demonstrated by pancreatic agenesis, IPFD and pancreatic atrophy. In patients with dorsal pancreatic agenesis, only part of the pancreas is visible. Additionally, in patients with IPFD, the entire pancreas exhibits fatty density/signal. Pancreatic vanishing can sometimes be overlooked, but it is also important for diagnosis at times. Therefore, our study highlights the essential points for diagnosing these pancreatic diseases, taking into account their clinical and imaging features. As described in this article, a systems-based approach for addressing potential complications provides a strong interpretive framework for reviewing postoperative CT or MRI examinations. By following this systems-based approach, we aim to achieve a clearer categorization of diseases associated with the "pancreatic vanishing".

### Islet inflammation is associated with pancreatic fatty infiltration and hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes [^113KxXyh]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and impaired insulin-secreting capacity. Chronic inflammation in various organs is observed in patients with type 2 diabetesand is associated with insulin resistance. Inflammation in adipose tissue and the liver has been well studied, and this inflammation is closely associated with obesity, including metabolic syndrome. It has recently been reported that increased pancreatic islet-associated immune cells were also observed in patients with human type 2 diabetes, high-fat diet-fed C57BL/6J mice, GK rats and db/db mice, where macrophages were the most frequent immune cells.β-cell dysfunction with worsening glucose tolerance might be partly derived from this type of inflammation. However, the etiology and pathophysiology of this islet inflammation have not been elucidated.

Pancreatic fatty infiltration is one of the ectopic fat depositions, as are visceral fat accumulation and fatty liver. These ectopic fat depositions may be derived from lipid oversupply and may be associated with the elevation of intracellular lipid metabolites and/or fatty infiltration, which is adipocyte infiltration. Fatty liver, which is lipid deposition in hepatocytes, induces inflammation and progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; thus, ectopic fat deposition might be one of the causes of organ inflammation, leading to organ failure. We demonstrated that pancreatic fat deposition evaluated by CT scans was strongly and positively associated with the longitudinal decrease in endogenous insulin-secreting capacity, and we also showed that histological pancreatic fatty infiltration had a strong correlation with glucose intolerance within 1 year of pancreatectomy in preoperative patients without diabetes. In Zucker diabetic fatty rats, triglyceride accumulation in the exocrine pancreas precedes the onset of overt diabetes.

Thus, the association of chronic inflammation with type 2 diabetes and the association of pancreatic fat deposition with type 2 diabetes have been studied, but it is unclear whether this islet inflammation is relevant to pancreatic fat deposition. We aimed to clarify the relationship between islet inflammation, evaluated by macrophage infiltration, and pancreatic fatty infiltration in patients with various degrees of glucose intolerance by immunohistochemical analyses.

### The association of fatty pancreas with subclinical atherosclerosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^113uJuuH]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ectopic fat accumulation in many tissues has been shown to be a risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease. No study to date has investigated whether fatty pancreas plays a role in the development of subclinical atherosclerosis. We aimed to assess the relationship between fatty pancreas and subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and healthy controls.

Patients and Methods

One hundred patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and 38 healthy controls were included. Transabdominal ultrasonography examination was performed on all the cases with high-resolution ultrasonography (Acuson S3000) using 6mHz convex probes. The measurements of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV) were performed to investigate the relationship between fatty pancreas and atherosclerosis.

Results

The rate of newly diagnosed DM and prediabetes in the NAFLD patients was 6 and 21%, respectively. Most of the patients with NAFLD (97%) were found to have an increased echogenicity of the pancreas at ultrasound examination. Grade of fatty pancreas was correlated positively with cf-PWV levels (P < 0.05), whereas no correlation was found with CIMT (P > 0.05). The presence of fatty pancreas was associated significantly with higher CIMT and cf-PWV levels (P < 0.05). The results for cf-PWV and CIMT did not remain significant after adjustment for confounding factors. Although the levels of cf-PWV and CIMT increased with increasing grade of fatty pancreas, there was no significant association.

Conclusion

We have shown for the first time that fatty pancreas is a contributing factor for the development of atherosclerosis in patients with NAFLD. This study also confirms the strong association between NAFLD and fatty pancreas.

### CT density in the pancreas is a promising imaging predictor for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [^114D5N3s]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Fatty pancreas (FP) was recently recognized as a risk factor for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). It is unclear whether computed tomography (CT) can be used to make a FP diagnosis. This study investigated whether CT could provide a predictive value for PDAC by diagnosing FP.

Methods

The study included 183 consecutive patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy from February 2007 to January 2017, including 75 cases of PDAC and 108 cases of other pancreatic disease. Pancreatic CT density (pancreatic index; PI) at the initial diagnosis was calculated by dividing the CT number in the pancreas by the number in the spleen. To assess whether CT could be used to detect FP, 43 cases were evaluated pathologically for FP. We investigated the correlation between FP and PI, and determined the optimal PI cutoff value for detecting FP using receiver operating characteristics analysis. We then investigated whether the PI value could be used as a predictor for PDAC.

Results

Fourteen cases (32.6%) were pathologically diagnosed with FP. PI was significantly lower in the FP group versus the non-FP group (0.51 vs. 0.83; p = 0.0049). ROC analysis indicated that the PI had good diagnostic accuracy for FP diagnosis (cutoff value 0.70; sensitivity 0.79, specificity 0.79). Low PI (≤ 0.70) was identified in the multivariate analysis as an independent risk factor for PDAC (odds ratio 2.31; p = 0.023).

Conclusions

PI was strongly associated with pathological FP, which was independently associated with PDAC. PI shows promise as an imaging predictor for PDAC.

### Can pancreatic steatosis explain the finding of pancreatic hyperenzymemia in subjects with dyslipidemia? [^112vjorQ]. Pancreas (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

It has been proposed by some investigators that benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia could result from pancreatic steatosis that they believe would have been caused by dyslipidemia; their diagnosis of steatosis was based on the finding of a hyperechogenic pancreas at ultrasound. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of this proposed model.

Methods

The study group was composed of 18 subjects with benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia, 12 men and 6 women; mean age, 55 years; range, 38 to 68 years. All 18 had dyslipidemia and 9 had hyperechogenic pancreas at ultrasound. In addition, 6 subjects with benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia but who did not have dyslipidemia or hyperechogenic pancreas and 10 healthy subjects with none of these conditions were also studied as controls. In each of these subjects, magnetic resonance imaging of the pancreas was performed to assess the presence of pancreatic steatosis.

Results

Magnetic resonance imaging showed normal pancreas with no signs of fatty infiltration in all 18 subjects with dyslipidemia, including those with both dyslipidemia and hyperechogenic pancreas at ultrasound. A similar result was found in all control subjects.

Conclusion

The finding of a completely normal pancreas at magnetic resonance imaging does not support the proposed model in which pancreatic hyperenzymemia in subjects with dyslipidemia is attributed to pancreatic steatosis.

### Pancreatic fat content and β-cell function in men with and without type 2 diabetes [^114EYRDq]. Diabetes Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Insulin resistance, associated with increased lipolysis, results in a high exposure of nonadipose tissue to lipids. Experimental data indicate that fatty infiltration of pancreatic islets may also contribute to beta-cell dysfunction, but whether this occurs in humans in vivo is unknown.

Research Design and Methods

Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and oral glucose tolerance tests, we studied the association of pancreatic lipid accumulation in vivo and various aspects of beta-cell function in 12 insulin-naive type 2 diabetic and 24 age- and BMI-matched nondiabetic men.

Results

Patients versus control subjects had higher A1C, fasting plasma glucose, and insulin and triglyceride levels and lower HDL cholesterol, but similar waist circumference. Median (interquartile range) pancreatic fat content in patients and control subjects was 20.4% (13.4–43.6) and 9.7% (7.0–20.2), respectively (P = 0.032). Pancreatic fat correlated negatively with beta-cell function parameters, including the insulinogenic index adjusted for insulin resistance, early glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, beta-cell glucose sensitivity, and rate sensitivity (all P < 0.05), but not potentiation. However, these associations were significantly affected by the diabetic state, such that a significant association of pancreatic fat with beta-cell dysfunction was only present in the nondiabetic group (all P < 0.01), suggesting that once diabetes occurs, factors additional to pancreatic fat account for further beta-cell function decline. In control subjects, the association of pancreatic fat and beta-cell function remained significant after correction for BMI, fasting plasma glucose, and triglycerides (P = 0.006).

Conclusions

These findings indicate that pancreatic lipid content may contribute to beta-cell dysfunction and possibly to the subsequent development of type 2 diabetes in susceptible humans.

### Pancreatic ectopic fat is characterized by adipocyte infiltration and altered lipid composition [^11787U7Y]. Obesity (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Sustained exposure to lipids is deleterious for pancreatic islet function. This could be mediated through increased pancreatic fat following increased dietary fat and in obesity, which has implications for the onset of type 2 diabetes. The aims of this study were to determine changes in extent and composition of pancreatic, hepatic, and visceral fat in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD, 40% by weight) compared with a control diet (5% fat) of similar fatty acid composition, and to compare composition and extent of pancreatic fat in human type 2 diabetes.

Methods and Procedures

Mice were fed HFD for 3 or 15 weeks. Human postmortem pancreas was examined from subjects with type 2 diabetes (n = 9) and controls (n = 7). Tissue lipid content and composition were determined by gas chromatography and pancreatic adipocyte infiltration quantified by morphometry.

Results

Pancreatic triacylglycerol (TG) content was 20x greater (P < 0.05) in HFD mice and there were more pancreatic perilipin-positive adipocytes compared with controls after 15 weeks. The proportions of 18:1n -9 and 18:2n -6 in pancreatic TG and the 20:4n -6/18:2n -6 ratio in phospholipids, were higher (both P < 0.05) after HFD compared with controls. Human pancreatic TG content was correlated with the proportion of pancreatic perilipin-positive adipocytes (r = 0.64, P < 0.05) and associated with unsaturated fatty acid enrichment (P < 0.05).

Discussion

Adipocyte infiltration in pancreatic exocrine tissue is associated with high-fat feeding in mice and pancreatic TG content in humans. This alters the fatty acid milieu of the islet which could contribute to islet dysfunction.

### Excess fatty acids induce pancreatic acinar cell pyroptosis through macrophage M1 polarization [^116VLX7B]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Free fatty acid derived from hyperlipidemia contributes to the development of inflammation in the pancreas. Here we explore the molecular mechanisms of fatty acid-induced pancreatitis through cellular experiments and the construction of a mouse model of hyperlipidemic pancreatitis. We found that palmitic acid stimulation leads to M1 polarization of macrophage, which secretes cathepsin S via exosomes to pancreatic acinar cells and leads to activation of the caspase1-mediated classical pyrolysis pathway, resulting in inflammation and pancreatic tissue damage. In vivo experiments have also demonstrated that the high levels of fatty acids induced by hyperlipidaemia exacerbate the development of pancreatitis, and that cathepsin S inhibitors significantly alleviate hyperlipidemic pancreatitis. Therefore, cathepsin S may be a new target for the clinical treatment of hyperlipidemic pancreatitis.

### Clinical staging to guide management of metabolic disorders and their sequelae: a European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement [^116oypAC]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Consensus key points

Systemic metabolic disorder is complex and multi-factorial, resulting from metabolic abnormalities that affect multiple organs. It often arises due to dysfunctional excess adiposity, particularly visceral obesity, driven by an imbalance between caloric intake and energy expenditure. Systemic metabolic disorder progresses through various stages, with the initial phase driven by genetic predispositions and lifestyle factors, eventually leading to multi-organ dysfunction and increased morbidity and mortality.
Visceral obesity is a central driver of SMD, contributing to insulin resistance, MASLD, atherogenic dyslipidaemia, hypertension, and inflammation. The accumulation of lipids in ectopic tissues such as the liver, muscles, and pancreas triggers organ-specific fibro-inflammatory responses, leading to diverse metabolic dysfunctions that increase the risk of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular diseases.
Genetic factors contribute to the susceptibility to SMD, with heritability estimates ranging between 40% and 70% for different components. Genetic predispositions, such as those favouring visceral fat accumulation, are associated with higher risks of conditions such as hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidaemia, particularly among certain ethnic groups. However, lifestyle factors can exacerbate the genetic risk of developing SMD.
Lifestyle changes are the cornerstone of treatment for all stages and should be combined with pharmacological treatment and, in extreme cases, metabolic surgery.

### The relationship between pancreas steatosis and the risk of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance in Chinese adolescents with concurrent obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^111HDEpN]. Pediatric Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

For limitation, this study only involved a cohort of adolescents with both obesity and NAFLD without healthy controls. Insulin resistance and beta cells function were not directly measured. Instead we used HOMA‐IR and HOMA‐B, acceptable surrogates to measure insulin resistance and beta cells function respectively. Besides, a relatively small sample size may also reduce the statistical power of our measurements. Finally, our study cohort was predominantly Chinese, therefore caution should be taken in the generalization of the results.

In the future, it will be valuable to provide longitudinal follow up for those participants with high risk of developing insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome into their adulthood, to monitor their biochemical profile. With our established quantitative imaging and analysis technique for fat content in abdominal viscera, it would also be interesting to evaluate the change of pancreas. PDFF, liver PDFF and body fat components in participants who might be undergoing life‐modifying intervention or other kinds of medical treatment, to correlate the changes of body fat content with metabolic risks. Additionally, Wong et al 54 showed the utility of pancreatic PDFF in an adult population study in Hong Kong. As the procedure is simple and straightforward, such a study can be extended to study groups with individuals who do not have obesity and/or without NAFLD.

In conclusion, fatty pancreas is a common finding in Chinese adolescents with both obesity and non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease. A significant causal relationship exists between fatty pancreas, fatty liver, body fat and the risk of developing metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.

### Association of fatty pancreas with increased risk of pancreatic adenocarcinoma… [^11689vFA]. ASCO (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract e16729 Background: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains one of the most fatal malignancies with poor outcomes and prognosis. Several risk factors have been associated with its development such as smoking, age, obesity, chronic pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus and a family history of PADC. Furthermore, recent pathologic studies demonstrated that fatty infiltration of the pancreas is positively correlated with PADC development. We sought to systematically review the literature and perform the first meta-analysis to study the risk of PADC among patients with FP. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of the Pubmed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases from inception through November-2019 for studies correlating FP with PADC. Relevant data was extracted and analyzed using comprehensive meta-analysis software. Random-effects model was used for all variables. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² measure and Cochrane Q-statistic.

Publication bias was assessed using Egger's test. Meta regression models accounting for independent variables such as age, sex, smoking, family history of PADC, chronic pancreatitis and method of FP diagnosis were constructed to explain heterogeneity. Results: Five observational case-control studies published between 2014 and 2019 including a total of 761 patients were included. FP was associated with increased PADC with an OR 4. 6 compared to controls with a considerable heterogeneity. Meta regression analysis accounting for modality used to diagnose FP was able to explain 100% of the noted heterogeneity. Conclusions: While we noted FP to be significantly associated with increased PADC, heterogeneity in FP diagnostic approach resulted in significant inter-study variation.

A consensus on a clear definition of FP with a standardized diagnostic approach is needed to better appraise literature on this emerging disease entity. Further prospective studies are needed to validate our results and explore the possible role for PADC screening in FP in addition to known factors such as family history and new-onset diabetes mellitus.

### Is fatty infiltration a pathologic process? [^1125Y6ps]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

It is not always easy to draw a sharp distinction between what is physiologic and what is pathologic in some of the processes encountered in the organism. Unusual accumulations of fat are sometimes found in the liver, the myocardium and the pancreas, and less frequently in the kidney, spleen and muscles. As a rule, such occurrences have been looked on as pathologic manifestations, ever since Virchow published his classic discussion of the forms of fatty changes which may be found under abnormal conditions and which he designated as either infiltration or degeneration. Thus, it has been contended that in certain organs fatty degeneration means an infiltration of fat from outside into cells which have been degenerated by the action of poisons or other influences; whereas, in other cases, the increase of fat seldom occurs from these causes, but the cells may show a marked fatty metamorphosis through the setting free.
