## Question

What time to take cephalexin 500 mg QID

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what times to take cephalexin 500 mg four times daily (QID) and what practical schedule, administration instructions, and special considerations apply. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics and whether strict timing is required. Then, I should verify the standard adult dosing framework and whether 500 mg QID is within label guidance. Next, I will translate QID into a practical daily schedule, consider administration with or without food, and review adherence strategies. After that, I need to check for special populations and drug interactions that might modify timing or dose. Finally, I will reconcile any conflicting data and synthesize a clear, grounded recommendation with safety caveats and a sample schedule.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic basis for dosing frequency. Cephalexin reaches a peak about 1 hour after a 500 mg dose and remains detectable in serum up to roughly 6 hours, which supports QID (every 6 hours) to maintain adequate time above MIC for beta-lactam efficacy, although exact PK/PD targets vary by pathogen and site of infection, and this timing is aligned with label PK data and PK/PD principles for beta-lactams requiring sustained free-drug exposure over the dosing interval [^112gCEso] [^111f9mKR].

> I should confirm whether 500 mg QID is within FDA-labeled adult dosing. The label allows the usual dose to be 250 mg every 6 hours and permits 500 mg every 12 hours, and it also notes that for more severe infections, total daily doses up to 4 g can be given in 2 to 4 equally divided doses, which accommodates 500 mg QID when clinically indicated for specific infections such as mastitis or selected SSTIs per guidelines, so 500 mg QID is label-consistent when infection severity or site warrants it [^117Kysaj].

> Wait, let me verify a common confusion about QID meaning "every 8 hours". Hold on, I should verify: QID traditionally means four times per day, i.e., every 6 hours if spaced evenly over 24 hours, not every 8 hours, which would be TID; the standard translation is 6 AM, 12 PM, 6 PM, and 12 AM, or shifted to 7 AM, 1 PM, 7 PM, and 1 AM to align with waking hours, which keeps intervals close to 6 hours and supports PK coverage.

> Next, I should review administration with respect to meals. I need to ensure there is no food restriction. The label indicates cephalexin is acid stable and may be given without regard to meals, so it can be taken with or without food; practically, anchoring doses to consistent meal times can improve adherence, and separating from calcium-rich foods or antacids by a couple of hours can help absorption, although specific calcium-interaction data are not detailed in the label [^112QmpPX] [^112gCEso].

> Let me consider adherence strategies and interval flexibility. I should confirm that while exact 6-hour spacing is ideal, a pragmatic approach of about every 6 hours with a window of roughly ± 1 hour is reasonable to accommodate sleep and daily routines, provided the full 4 doses are completed each day; for example, 7 AM, 1 PM, 7 PM, and bedtime near 11 PM to 12 AM, with the key being consistency across days to avoid prolonged subtherapeutic gaps.

> I will now examine special populations and dose adjustments. For creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min, dose reductions and longer intervals are recommended, with typical adjustments to 250 mg every 8–12 hours depending on severity, so a 500 mg QID regimen would generally be inappropriate in significant renal impairment; elderly patients are more likely to have reduced renal function, so I should double-check creatinine clearance before finalizing QID dosing, and adjust if needed to prevent accumulation and toxicity [^112QmpPX] [^115mGUXG].

> But wait, what about drug interactions that could alter exposure and thus timing considerations. Cephalexin can increase metformin exposure by inhibiting renal tubular secretion, so if the patient is on metformin, I should consider glucose monitoring and, if needed, coordinate the timing of metformin relative to cephalexin to mitigate overlap; additionally, probenecid co-administration increases cephalexin AUC and half-life and may permit less frequent dosing in select contexts, but that strategy requires prescriber oversight and is not standard for routine QID use [^112gCEso] [^111TDoif].

> Next, I should review condition-specific durations and whether QID is truly necessary. For lactational mastitis, 500 mg QID for 10–14 days is a first-line regimen in breastfeeding medicine guidance, which justifies QID frequency; for many other infections, the label allows 250 mg every 6 hours or 500 mg every 12 hours, with total daily doses up to 4 g for severe disease, so QID is appropriate when clinical severity or site warrants tighter PK coverage or when supported by guidelines, such as certain SSTIs or bone/joint infections where beta-lactam exposure goals favor more frequent dosing [^115jd7oQ] [^112QmpPX] [^113cdboF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all infections requiring QID. For uncomplicated UTIs, emerging ED data suggest 500 mg twice daily may perform similarly to QID for treatment failure, and stewardship guidance lists 500–1000 mg every 6 hours among oral options but notes other regimens may be more effective, so QID is pharmacodynamically sound but BID may be acceptable in selected uUTI cases when adherence is a concern, balancing PK targets with real-world adherence and resistance risk [^111zdRxa] [^117GrFR3].

> I should double-check that the patient's infection and organism susceptibilities support cephalexin. Cephalexin lacks activity against MRSA and many gram-negative non–Proteus mirabilis/E. coli/Klebsiella organisms, so if MRSA or resistant gram-negatives are suspected, alternative or adjunctive therapy may be needed; verifying the clinical syndrome and local susceptibility patterns helps ensure QID cephalexin is appropriate before finalizing the schedule [^112gCEso].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the final instruction is clear and actionable. Take 500 mg four times daily at approximately 6-hour intervals, such as 7 AM, 1 PM, 7 PM, and 11 PM to 12 AM, with or without food, and aim for consistency within about an hour of the target times to maintain exposure; complete the full prescribed course, which is commonly 7–14 days depending on indication, and confirm renal function before using 500 mg QID in anyone with possible CKD to avoid overdosing [^112QmpPX] [^112gCEso] [^115jd7oQ].

---

Take cephalexin 500 mg **four times daily (QID)** — every 6 hours — for 7–14 days, depending on the infection [^117Kysaj]. Space doses **evenly every 6 hours** (e.g. 6 AM, 12 PM, 6 PM, 12 AM) to maintain consistent drug levels [^112QmpPX]. Take with or without food, but **with water** to reduce GI upset [^112gCEso]. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's within 2 hours of the next dose; **do not double up**. For creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min, adjust the dose to 250 mg every 8–12 hours [^112QmpPX].

---

## Recommended dosing schedule

- **Standard dosing**: 500 mg orally every 6 hours (QID) [^113cdboF].
- **Total daily dose**: 2,000 mg (2 g) per day.
- **Duration**: 7–14 days, depending on infection type and severity [^117Kysaj].

---

## Practical timing of doses

To achieve **consistent drug levels**, space doses evenly every 6 hours. A practical schedule is:

| **Dose** | **Time** |
|-|-|
| 1st dose | 6:00 AM |
| 2nd dose | 12:00 PM (noon) |
| 3rd dose | 6:00 PM |
| 4th dose | 12:00 AM (midnight) |

---

Alternatively, adjust times to your routine (e.g. 7 AM, 1 PM, 7 PM, 1 AM) while keeping the **6-hour intervals** [^112QmpPX].

---

## Administration with meals

Cephalexin can be taken with or without food [^112QmpPX]; taking it with food may reduce GI upset. Swallow capsules whole with a **full glass of water** to prevent esophageal irritation and enhance absorption.

---

## Missed dose guidelines

If a dose is missed, take it as soon as you remember unless it is within 2 hours of the next dose; in that case, skip the missed dose and resume the regular schedule. Do not double the dose to catch up, as this increases the risk of side effects.

---

## Special considerations

### Renal impairment

In renal impairment, **dose adjustment** is required for creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 30 mL/min [^112QmpPX]. The usual dose is reduced to 250 mg every 8–12 hours [^112QmpPX].

---

### Pediatric patients

For pediatric patients, dosing is **weight-based** at 25–50 mg/kg/day, divided into four equal doses (every 6 hours) [^112QmpPX].

---

### Elderly patients

In elderly patients, exercise caution due to a higher prevalence of renal impairment; **monitor renal function** and adjust dosing accordingly [^115mGUXG].

---

## Cephalexin 500 mg QID dosing schedule

| **Aspect** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Dose | 500 mg orally every 6 hours (QID) |
| Total daily dose | 2,000 mg (2 g) |
| Duration | 7–14 days |
| Administration | With or without food; take with water |
| Missed dose | Take if remembered; skip if close to next dose |
| Renal impairment | Adjust dose if CrCl < 30 mL/min |
| Pediatric dosing | 25–50 mg/kg/day divided QID |

---

Cephalexin 500 mg QID should be taken **every 6 hours** (e.g. 6 AM, 12 PM, 6 PM, 12 AM) for 7–14 days, with or without food, and with a full glass of water. Adjust dosing for renal impairment and avoid doubling doses if a dose is missed.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Duration of therapy ranges from 7 to 14 days depending on the infection type and severity. (2)
Dosage adjustment is required in patients with severe and end stage renal disease (ESRD) defined as creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min. (2.3)

2.1 Adults and Pediatric Patients at Least 15 Years of Age

The usual dose of oral cephalexin capsules is 250 mg every 6 hours, but a dose of 500 mg every 12 hours may be administered. Treatment is administered for 7 to 14 days.

For more severe infections larger doses of oral cephalexin capsules may be needed, up to 4 grams daily in two to four equally divided doses.

2.2 Pediatric Patients (over 1 year of age)

The recommended total daily dose of oral cephalexin capsules for pediatric patients is 25 to 50 mg/kg given in equally divided doses for 7 to 14 days. In the treatment of β-hemolytic streptococcal infections, duration of at least 10 days is recommended. In severe infections, a total daily dose of 50 to 100 mg/kg may be administered in equally divided doses.

For the treatment of otitis media, the recommended daily dose is 75 to 100 mg/kg given in equally divided doses.

2.3 Dosage Adjustments in Adult and Pediatric Patients at Least 15 Years of Age with Renal Impairment

Administer the following dosing regimens for cephalexin capsules to patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

### Cephalexin twice daily versus four times daily for the treatment of urinary tract infections diagnosed in the emergency department [^111zdRxa]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cephalexin is an oral cephalosporin approved for the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Data regarding the optimal dosing interval for cephalexin in UTIs, including uncomplicated UTIs (uUTI) and complicated UTIs (cUTI), remains limited.

Objective

The primary objective of this study was to compare the rates of treatment failure between patients prescribed cephalexin twice daily versus four times daily for the management of uUTIs and cUTIs once discharged from the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This retrospective, single-center cohort study conducted between July 31st, 2016 and July 31st, 2023, included patients who were ≥ 18 years of age, discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of UTI, prescribed cephalexin 500 mg twice or four time daily, and a urine culture positive for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Proteus mirabilis susceptible to cefazolin. Treatment failure was defined as return to the ED or outpatient clinic with similar or worsening UTI symptoms or change in antibiotic therapy within 30 days of the initial ED visit. Sub-group analyses were performed for both uUTI and cUTIs.

Results

In total, 214 patients were included in this analysis (50.0% in each group). Treatment failure rates between the twice daily and four times daily dosing groups were 18.7% versus 15.0% (P = 0.465). Treatment failure rates in those with uUTI were 14.9% versus 8.1% (P = 0.197) and those with cUTI were 27.3% versus 30.3% (P = 0.786).

Conclusion

For patients with UTIs, there was no statistically significant difference in treatment failure rates between patients prescribed cephalexin twice daily versus four times daily. These findings suggest cephalexin dosed twice daily may be a reasonable option for the outpatient management of UTIs diagnosed in the ED, thus increasing adherence and decreasing cost without statistically compromising effectiveness.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of cephalexin in pediatric patients was established in clinical trials for the dosages described in the dosage and administration section [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 701 subjects in 3 published clinical studies of cephalexin, 433 (62%) were 65 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.

This drug is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Cephalexin should be administered with careful monitoring in the presence of renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min, with or without dialysis). Under such conditions, careful clinical observation and laboratory studies renal function monitoring should be conducted because safe dosage may be lower than that usually recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Monitor patients longer for toxicity and drug interactions due to delayed clearance.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113voFEA]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Dosing and duration of prophylactic antibiotics — women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) most commonly receive daily dosing; fosfomycin used prophylactically is dosed every 10 days. Intermittent versus daily prophylaxis showed no difference in risk of ≥ 1 UTI (2 studies; RR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.50, I2 = 0%); in individual trials, single-dose exposures versus daily antibiotics had RR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.51, and single-dose ciprofloxacin after sexual intercourse versus daily dosing had RR: 1.24; 95% CI: 0.29 to 5.32. Reported prophylaxis duration ranged from 6 to 12 months, while in practice it can be from three to six months to one year with periodic assessment, and continuing prophylaxis for years is not evidence-based. Continuous prophylaxis dosing options include: TMP 100 mg once daily; TMP-SMX 40 mg/200 mg once daily; TMP-SMX 40 mg/200 mg thrice weekly; Nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 50 mg daily; Nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg daily; Cephalexin 125 mg once daily; Cephalexin 250 mg once daily; Fosfomycin 3 g every 10 days.

### Twice-and thrice-daily cephalexin dosing for Staphylococcus aureus infections in children [^115fAxVQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cephalexin is used for the treatment of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infections in children. Although 4 times daily dosing is recommended, less frequent dosing regimens are often prescribed to improve treatment acceptability and adherence. We developed a population pharmacokinetic model of cephalexin in children to determine a twice-daily (BID) and thrice-daily (TID) cephalexin dosing regimen for MSSA infections.

Methods

A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using a nonlinear mixed effects modeling approach. The dataset used was from a prospective open-label pharmacokinetic study of orally administered cephalexin in 12 children 1–16 years of age with bone and joint infections. Simulations were performed to determine a BID and TID dosing regimen so that ≥ 90% of children in this age group would achieve the pharmacodynamic target for MSSA (ie, time that the free drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration of the bacteria for at least 40% of the dosing interval).

Results

The final model was 1 compartment with a transit compartment model to account for delay in oral absorption. For BID dosing, doses of 22–45 and 80mg/kg were required for MSSA with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 1–2 and 4mg/L, respectively. For TID dosing, the respective required doses were 15–25 and 45mg/kg.

Conclusions

Our study proposes a BID and TID cephalexin dosing regimen that can be prospectively evaluated. Through reducing the dose frequency of this widely prescribed antibiotic, we can reduce the medication burden for children and improve treatment compliance for MSSA infections.

### Cephalexin [^112gCEso]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Cephalexin is a cephalosporin antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption:

Cephalexin is acid stable and may be given without regard to meals. Following doses of 250 mg, 500 mg, and 1 g, average peak serum levels of approximately 9, 18, and 32 mcg/mL, respectively, were obtained at 1 hour. Serum levels were detectable 6 hours after administration (at a level of detection of 0.2 mcg/mL).

Distribution:

Cephalexin is approximately 10% to 15% bound to plasma proteins.

Excretion:

Cephalexin is excreted in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Studies showed that over 90% of the drug was excreted unchanged in the urine within 8 hours. During this period, peak urine concentrations following the 250 mg, 500 mg, and 1 g doses were approximately 1000, 2200, and 5000 mcg/mL respectively.

Drug Interactions:

In healthy subjects given single 500 mg doses of cephalexin and metformin, plasma metformin mean Cmaxand AUC increased by an average of 34% and 24%, respectively, and metformin mean renal clearance decreased by 14%. No information is available about the interaction of cephalexin and metformin following multiple doses of either drug.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Cephalexin is a bactericidal agent that acts by the inhibition of bacterial cell-wall synthesis.

Resistance

Methicillin-resistant staphylococci and most isolates of enterococci are resistant to cephalexin. Cephalexin is not active against most isolates of Enterobacter spp. Morganella morganii, and Proteus vulgaris. Cephalexin has no activity against Pseudomonas spp., or Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae is usually cross-resistant to beta-lactam antibacterial drugs.

Antimicrobial Activity

Cephalexin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Gram-positive bacteria

Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only)

Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates)

Gram-negative bacteria

Escherichia coli

Haemophilus influenzae

Klebsiella pneumoniae

Moraxella catarrhalis

Proteus mirabilis

### Clinical outcomes of failing to dose-reduce cephalosporin antibiotics in older adults with CKD [^114PjLEf]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Current dosing recommendations for cephalosporin antibiotics are on the basis of pharmacokinetic studies and are frequently ignored in practice. This study was undertaken to investigate the clinical outcomes of failing to dose-reduce cephalosporin antibiotics in CKD.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Retrospective cohort study conducted in Ontario, Canada using linked population-based health care databases. Nine thousand three hundred forty-seven outpatients (median age 83; interquartile range, 77–88 years; 57% women) with an eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m² and no prior history of dialysis were dispensed oral cephalexin, cefuroxime, or cefprozil between April of 2007 and March of 2016. Two thirds of the patients (6253 of 9347) received a higher than recommended daily dose of cephalexin (> 1000 mg), cefuroxime (> 500 mg), or cefprozil (> 500 mg). The primary outcome was a hospital encounter (emergency room visit or hospital admission) with a condition listed as a possible side-effect of cephalosporins. Secondary outcomes were antibiotic treatment failure and all-cause mortality. All measures were assessed in the 30 days after cephalosporin initiation.

Results

Patients who received a higher than recommended dose of a cephalosporin antibiotic were similar in multiple indicators of baseline health to patients who received a reduced dose. Overall, 6% of patients presented to hospital with a possible cephalosporin side-effect, 13% failed antibiotic treatment, and 3% died. Compared with a reduced dose, receiving a higher dose of antibiotic was not associated with a different rate of side-effects (adjusted odds ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.84 to 1.20), treatment failure (1.01; 0.88 to 1.15), or death (0.99; 0.76 to 1.29).

Conclusions

In this study we failed to demonstrate any association between the dose of cephalosporin antibiotic administered to elderly patients with CKD and the risk of side-effects leading to hospitalization, treatment failure, or mortality.

Staphylococcal and streptococcal impetigo — adult and pediatric dosing and topical options are listed as follows: dicloxacillin 250 mg qid po; cephalexin 250 mg qid po with pediatric 25–50 mg/kg/d in 3–4 divided doses po; clindamycin 300–400 mg qid po with pediatric 20 mg/kg/d in 3 divided doses po; and amoxicillin‑clavulanate 875/125 mg bid po with pediatric 25 mg/kg/d of the amoxicillin component in 2 divided doses po. Topical retapamulin ointment and mupirocin ointment are applied to lesions bid for patients with limited number of lesions. For erythromycin, pediatric dosing is 40 mg/kg/d in 3–4 divided doses po, and some strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes may be resistant.

Second-line antimicrobial agents — when first-line medications are not available or cannot be prescribed — include β-lactams and fluoroquinolones, and "Randomized trial evidence suggests that the effectiveness of 3-day cefpodoxime or TMP-SMX is comparable at 89.4% vs 100%". However, "Generally, cephalosporins have a lower cure rate than TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones", and "β-lactams, like cephalexin, can also be used if first-line antibiotics are inappropriate for any reason". Although "3-day fluoroquinolone regimens (eg, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) are highly efficacious, they are not first-line agents because of increasing resistance, higher expense, and serious adverse events as described in a 2016 Food and Drug Administration warning". Fosfomycin pharmacokinetics are noted as "resulting in urine levels that persist for 30 to 40 hours", and "When there is greater than 20% local E. coli resistance to TMP-SMX, an alternative treatment should be given".

### Cefazolin and enterobacteriaceae: rationale for revised susceptibility testing breakpoints [^1177WKdw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints for cefazolin against Enterobacteriaceae that were published in January 2010 have been revised by the Subcommittee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing, based on the examination of recent data about in vitro activity, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic characteristics and published clinical outcome studies. The new breakpoints, to be formally published in January 2011, have increased the minimum inhibitory concentration interpretive criteria by one 2-fold dilution, linked to an adult dosing schedule of 2 g every 8 h intravenously. Disk diffusion zone diameter correlates, shown to be impossible to define with the January 2010 interpretive criteria, have been able to be set for the new interpretive criteria. Diagnostic laboratories will continue to need to test cephalothin to predict susceptibility to the oral cephalosporins cefadroxil, cefpodoxime, cephalexin, and loracarbef.

### Effect of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole vs cephalexin alone on clinical cure of uncomplicated cellulitis: a randomized clinical trial [^1112uFJm]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Emergency department visits for skin infections in the United States have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For cellulitis without purulent drainage, β-hemolytic streptococci are presumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial regimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared with treatments lacking MRSA activity.

Objective

To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole yields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin alone.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, double-blind, randomized superiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 years with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from April 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound performed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was August 2012.

Interventions

Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (n = 248 participants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (n = 248 participants).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome determined a priori in the per-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (> 25%), swelling, or tenderness (days 3–4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 8–10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 14–21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than 10%.

Results

Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol analysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15–78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had diabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 (85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to 5.7%; p = 0.50). In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure occurred in 189 (76.2%) of 248 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 171 (69.0%) of 248 in the cephalexin group (difference, 7.3%; 95% CI, -1.0% to 15.5%; p = 0.07). Between-group adverse event rates and secondary outcomes through 7 to 9 weeks, including overnight hospitalization, recurrent skin infections, and similar infection in household contacts, did not differ significantly.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with uncomplicated cellulitis, the use of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to cephalexin alone did not result in higher rates of clinical resolution of cellulitis in the per-protocol analysis. However, because imprecision around the findings in the modified intention-to-treat analysis included a clinically important difference favoring cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, further research may be needed.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^112oRUTg]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

American Dental Association guideline — antibiotic decision pathway and selections for immunocompetent adult patients when definitive, conservative dental treatment (DCDT) is immediately available: "Symptomatic irreversible pulpitis with or without symptomatic apical periodontitis" is managed with "NO ANTIBIOTICS AS ADJUNCTS TO DCDT". For "Pulp necrosis and localized acute apical abscess", the pathway asks "Does the patient have systemic involvement?"; without systemic involvement it states "NO ANTIBIOTICS AS ADJUNCTS TO DCDT", and with systemic involvement it states "YES ANTIBIOTICS AS ADJUNCTS TO DCDT". When antibiotics are indicated, for patients without a penicillin allergy use "Oral amoxicillin (500 milligrams, 3 times per day, 3–7 d)" or "Oral penicillin V potassium (500 mg, 4 times per d, 3–7 d)", and if first-line treatment fails "broaden antibiotic therapy to complement with oral metronidazole (500 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d) or discontinue first-line treatment and prescribe oral amoxicillin and clavulanate (500/125 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d)". For penicillin-allergic patients, the pathway asks about a "history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, or hives with penicillin, ampicillin, or amoxicillin"; without such history use "Oral cephalexin (500 mg, 4 times per d, 3–7 d)", and with such history use "Oral azithromycin (loading dose of 500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg for an additional 4 d) or oral clindamycin (300 mg, 4 times per d, 3–7 d)".

### Frequency of dosing of cephalexin for oral step-down therapy of pediatric osteoarticular infections caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus [^113R34ep]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Osteoarticular infections are one of the more common invasive bacterial infections encountered in children. There exist significant practice variations in both the diagnosis and treatment of such infections. However, the practice of transitioning from parenteral therapy to oral antibiotics has been well validated by several studies. For methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), cephalexin is often recommended. Prospective, controlled data regarding optimal dosing of cephalexin in pediatric osteomyelitis are not available. We sought to review our retrospective, uncontrolled data on four times daily (QID) versus three times daily (TID) dosing of cephalexin for pediatric osteoarticular infections. Children ≥ 1 month to < 18 years of age admitted to Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego with a diagnosis of osteomyelitis or septic arthritis between January 1, 2002, and November 30, 2007, were identified and previously reported. Only patients with culture-positive MSSA infections are included in this report. Demographic and clinical data were manually extracted from the electronic medical record. Fifty-nine patients were treated with cephalexin and had records available for review through our electronic medical record. Thirty-eight patients (64.4%) were treated QID, and 21 patients (35.6%) were treated TID. Clinical cure was achieved in all patients with only one adverse event occurring in the QID group. In this retrospective chart review of children with osteoarticular infections caused by MSSA treated with cephalexin, similar clinical outcomes were found with QID versus TID dosing.

### Cephalexin [^116b3jBB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Prolonged Prothrombin Time

Cephalosporins may be associated with prolonged prothrombin time. Those at risk include patients with renal or hepatic impairment, or poor nutritional state, as well as patients receiving a protracted course of antibacterial therapy, and patients receiving anticoagulant therapy. Monitor prothrombin time in patients at risk and manage as indicated.

5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing cephalexin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Prolonged use of cephalexin may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.

### Oral cephalexin population pharmacokinetics and target attainment analysis in infants 7–60 Days old [^116KGCv2]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There are limited data to guide oral antibiotic dosing in neonates and young infants, particularly for intravenous (IV) to oral transition. Cephalexin is a promising oral treatment for neonatal pathogens, including Enterobacterales and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). However, maturational changes in gastrointestinal absorption and kidney function during early infancy complicate extrapolation of dosing from older populations. We evaluated cephalexin pharmacokinetics (PK) and simulated dosing strategies to achieve pharmacodynamic (PD) targets in infants ≤ 60 days old.

Methods

This prospective, single-center study enrolled infants 0–60 days receiving cephalexin either as part of routine clinical care or as a single 25 mg/kg study dose. Plasma concentrations were analyzed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. Simulations assessed the probability of target attainment (PTA) for free time above MIC (fT > MIC) for ≥ 50% and ≥ 70% of the dosing interval across MICs 1–16 mg/L, assuming 10% protein binding. We also simulated the cumulative fractional response (CFR) using typical MIC distributions for Enterobacterales and MSSA.

Results

The analysis included 144 samples from 33 infants with median post-natal age 31 days (range 9–56) and median gestational age 37 weeks (range 29–41). A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and lag time best described the data. Weight influenced apparent volume of distribution and apparent clearance. Additionally, we identified a maturational effect on absorption rate using post-natal age and on apparent clearance using post-menstrual age. For Enterobacterales, 25 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours achieved > 90% CFR for a 50% fT > MIC target. For MSSA, 25 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours was sufficient. Higher or more frequent dosing was required to meet the more stringent 70% fT > MIC target.

Conclusions

Oral cephalexin can achieve necessary PD targets in infants 7–60 days old. These findings support the use of model-informed dosing strategies to guide safe and effective oral antibiotic use in early infancy, including for IV-to-oral transition.

### Probenecid effects on cephalexin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy volunteers [^111TDoif]. The Journal of Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We evaluated the effects of probenecid on the Pharmaco Kinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of oral cephalexin in healthy volunteers.

Methods

Cephalexin 1000 mg was administered orally to 11 healthy volunteers following a standardized meal, with and without probenecid 500 mg orally, on two separate days one week apart. Total plasma concentrations of cephalexin and probenecid over a 12 h period were measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Standard pharmacokinetic measures and contemporary PK/PD targets were compared.

Results

Probenecid increased the mean (95% CI) cephalexin area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-∞) 1.73-fold (1.61–1.85, p < 0.0001), peak concentration 1.37-fold (1.16–1.58, p < 0.01), time to peak concentration 1.45-fold (1.1–1.8, p < 0.01), and half-life 1.33-fold (1.03–1.62, p < 0.05). The effects resulted in clinically meaningful increases in the probability of PK/PD target attainment (PTA). As an example, the PTA of total concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus isolates (MIC ≤ 8 mg/L) for 70% of a 6 h dose interval approached 100% for cephalexin + probenecid while for cephalexin alone it was < 15%.

Conclusions

Probenecid prolonged and flattened the plasma concentration-time curve, enhancing the probability of attaining PK/PD targets. Co-administration of probenecid may expand the clinical benefits of oral cephalexin.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114Wk6bV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in pregnancy — duration and regimen considerations are summarized as follows: A Cochrane review included 13 studies enrolling 1622 women comparing single-dose to short-course (4–7 days) antimicrobials, and in one included moderate-quality study of nitrofurantoin, 714 women received 7 days or single-dose therapy; seven days was more effective than a single dose in preventing low birth weight (relative risk [RR], 1.65 95% CI, 1.06–2.57), with no differences in pyelonephritis or preterm delivery. The review concludes that current recommendations of 4 to 7-day duration of treatment for ASB during pregnancy are reasonable but based on low-quality evidence. The optimal duration of therapy will be antimicrobial-specific; nitrofurantoin and β-lactam antimicrobials (usually ampicillin or cephalexin) are preferred because of safety in pregnant women, but these agents are less effective as short-course therapy for acute cystitis. A single dose of fosfomycin is effective for clearance of bacteria in urine, but clinical evaluation in pregnancy is limited and outcomes such as pyelonephritis and preterm labor are not yet well studied. Research needs include studies evaluating the optimal duration for different regimens, including fosfomycin, and impacts on neonatal outcomes.

### Topical retapamulin ointment (1%, wt / wt) twice daily for 5 days versus oral cephalexin twice daily for 10 days in the treatment of secondarily infected dermatitis: results of a randomized controlled trial [^117Y3Kw4]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

New antibacterial agents with activity against pathogenic strains resistant to established antibiotics are needed to treat patients with secondarily infected dermatitis (SID).

Objective

We sought to determine the clinical safety and efficacy of topical retapamulin ointment 1% versus oral cephalexin for the treatment of SID.

Methods

Patients with SID were randomly assigned to retapamulin ointment 1% (twice daily [bid]) for 5 days, or oral cephalexin (500 mg bid) for 10 days. The primary efficacy end point was clinical response at follow-up. Secondary outcomes included microbiologic response at follow-up, safety, and compliance.

Results

Retapamulin was as effective as cephalexin (clinical success rates at follow-up: 85.9% and 89.7%, respectively). Microbiologic success rates at follow-up were 87.2% for retapamulin and 91.8% for cephalexin. Retapamulin was well tolerated and the topical formulation was preferred over the oral drug.

Limitations

An imbalance existed in the number of patients with the clinical outcome "unable to determine" (15 retapamulin, 2 cephalexin), mainly because of their failure to attend the study visit. If those who failed to attend visits (who did not withdraw as a result of drug-related events) are removed from the analysis, the clinical success rates are 89.9% for retapamulin and 89.7% for cephalexin.

Conclusions

Retapamulin ointment 1% (bid) for 5 days was as effective as oral cephalexin (bid) for 10 days in treatment of patients with SID, and was well tolerated.

Randomisation and masking

Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either antibiotic prophylaxis (experimental) or no prophylaxis (control). Randomisation was done centrally by an internet-based system that used permuted random blocks of variable length (two, four, and six). A statistician that was not otherwise involved with the study produced the final allocation schedule, including stratification by three variables: previous frequency of UTIs (less than four episodes per year vs at least four episodes per year), a diagnosis of neurological dysfunction of the lower urinary tract, and sex. Clinical trial unit staff and central laboratory staff who were assessing outcomes were masked to allocation. By necessity, participants, treating clinicians, and local research staff were masked to block size but not to allocation. For those allocated to prophylaxis, the clinician started the patient on a study drug for UTI prophylaxis that was suitable to the individual. The drugs given were 50 mg nitrofurantoin, 100 mg trimethoprim, or 250 mg cefalexin. These drugs were prescribed to be taken once daily and were supplied by the standard NHS mechanisms and manufacturers licensed by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency.

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^115EfgMh]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

At baseline, the groups did not differ in frequency of antimicrobial resistance of urinary isolates to eight oral antibiotics that are commonly used for UTI treatment. During the 12-month trial, resistance appeared more common in isolates that were cultured from urine submitted during symptomatic UTIs by participants in the prophylaxis group than those in the control group (figure 2). In urine samples submitted during asymptomatic periods between months 9 and 12 of the trial, resistance to nitrofurantoin (12 [24%] of 51 participants with at least one isolate from the prophylaxis group vs six [9%] of 64 participants with at least one isolate from the control group; p = 0.038), trimethoprim (34 [67%] of 51 participants vs 21 [33%] of 64 participants; p = 0.0003), and co-trimoxazole (26 [53%] of 49 participants vs 15 [24%] of 62 participants; p = 0.002) was significantly more frequent in the prophylaxis group than the control group. Over baseline and subsequent 3-monthly intervals during the 12-month trial period, resistance to amoxicillin (38 [52%] of 73 participants, 25 [74%] of 34 participants, 31 [82%] of 38 participants, 32 [74%] of 43 participants, and 37 [76%] of 49 participants; p = 0.004), cephalexin (11 [14%] of 78 participants, ten [25%] of 40 participants, 13 [32%] of 41 participants, 17 [38%] of 45 participants, and 16 [31%] of 51 participants; p = 0.005), co-trimoxazole (18 [25%] of 73 participants, 23 [59%] of 39 participants, 14 [37%] of 38 participants, 21 [48%] of 44 participants, 26 [53%] of 49 participants; p = 0.006), and trimethoprim (32 [42%] of 77 participants, 31 [79%] of 39 participants, 25 [63%] of 40 participants, 27 [63%] of 43 participants, 34 [67%] of 51 participants; p = 0.016) also significantly increased in isolates from urine specimens that were submitted during asymptomatic periods by participants in the prophylaxis group. There was no evidence of increasing resistance over time in the control group. Resistance of urinary isolates that were submitted during asymptomatic periods appeared to decrease at 18 months. There was no evidence that E coli isolated from perianal swabs of participants in the prophylaxis group had significantly more frequent resistance against any of the eight antibiotics tested than did participants in the control group at 6–12 months of the trial.

### Outcome assessment in cellulitis clinical trials: is telephone follow up sufficient? [^113Kcirx]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration has scrutinized clinical trial methodology in cellulitis, partly because the definition and timing of cure are debatable. We analysed the validity of telephone self-report as a proxy for in-person follow up in a cellulitis treatment trial comparing cephalexin alone with cephalexin-plus-trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Our results demonstrate poor agreement between these two methods of outcome determination and have implications for future cellulitis clinical trial design and clinical management.

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^1176YnZH]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommended regimen for uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the pharynx:

Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM as a single dose for persons weighing < 150 kg (300 lb)

For persons weighing ≥ 150 kg (300 lb), 1 g of IM ceftriaxone should be administered.
If chlamydia coinfection is identified when pharyngeal gonorrhea testing is performed, providers should treat for chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days. During pregnancy, azithromycin 1 g as a single dose is recommended to treat chlamydia.
No reliable alternative treatments are available for pharyngeal gonorrhea. For persons with a history of a beta-lactam allergy, a thorough assessment of the reaction is recommended. *
For persons with an anaphylactic or other severe reaction (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome) to ceftriaxone, consult an infectious disease specialist for an alternative treatment recommendation.

Abbreviation: IM = intramuscular.

* CDC. Sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines. MMWR Recomm Rep 2015;64(No. RR-3).

In cases where gonococcal expedited partner therapy (provision of prescriptions or medications for the patient to take to a sex partner without the health care provider first examining the partner) is permissible by state law and the partner is unable or unlikely to seek timely treatment, the partner may be treated with a single 800 mg oral dose of cefixime, provided that concurrent chlamydial infection in the patient has been excluded. Otherwise, the partner may be treated with a single oral 800 mg cefixime dose plus oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days.

In cases of suspected cephalosporin treatment failure, clinicians should obtain relevant clinical specimens for culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, consult an infectious disease specialist or STD clinical expert for guidance in clinical management, and report the case to CDC through state and local public health authorities within 24 hours. Health departments should prioritize notification and culture evaluation for the patient's sex partner(s) from the preceding 60 days for those with suspected cephalosporin treatment failure or persons whose gonococcal isolates demonstrate reduced susceptibility to cephalosporins.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116QtZHg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis treatment — antibiotic selection and duration — states that therapy for typical cases should include an antibiotic active against streptococci; many patients can start oral therapy, and suitable options include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin. In uncomplicated cellulitis, a 5-day course of antimicrobial therapy is as effective as a 10-day course if clinical improvement has occurred by 5 days; in hospitalized cellulitis/abscess, the average duration was 2 weeks, only about one-third received specific gram-positive therapy, two-thirds received very-broad-spectrum treatment, and the failure rate of 12% was not different regardless of spectrum of treatment.

### Oral cephalexin for acne vulgaris: clinical experience with 93 patients [^114FDQVE]. Pediatric Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

For patients who fail traditional acne therapy or experience side effects, other treatments are needed. Cephalexin has been noted to be efficacious in some instances. This study aimed to assess the therapeutic efficacy of cephalexin for acne. A retrospective chart review of 93 acne patients treated with cephalexin was performed. Data collection included patient demographics, other acne therapies, clinical response, and side effects. Of the 98 courses of cephalexin, 4% of patients cleared, 45% were much improved, 29% were somewhat improved, 16% experienced no change, and 6% worsened at first follow-up visit. The median treatment length was 6 months. Eighty-four percent of patients had previously used a systemic antibiotic(s) for acne. Seven percent experienced adverse effects. This is a small retrospective analysis without a comparison group and is limited by the number of patients and nonstandardized treatment lengths and charting procedures. Cephalexin is a promising alternative treatment for acne, with 78% of patients exhibiting at least some clinical improvement.

### Over prescription of antibiotics for adult pharyngitis is prevalent in developing countries but can be reduced using mcIsaac modification of Centor scores: a cross-sectional study [^115xmsaM]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

First-line antibiotics included penicillin (oral penicillin V 500 mg every 8 hours for 10 days; benzyl penicillin 0.6–1.2 million units IM once; oral ampicillin 500 mg every 6 hours for 10 days; oral amoxicillin 500 mg every 8 hours for 10 days). Appropriate alternative second-line agents included cephalexin (500 mg every 12 hours for 10 days) and other first-generation cephalosporins, cefaclor (500 mg every 8 hours orally for 10 days), a second-generation cephalosporin and erythromycin for penicillin-allergic patients (250 mg p.o. every 6 hours or 500 mg every 12 or 6 hours for 10 days).

Third-line agents were considered inappropriate, because they are too broad-spectrum, or do not have adequate activity. Broad-spectrum agents included amoxicillin-clavulanate (500–875 mg orally every 12 hours for 10 days), second-generation macrolides such as clarithromycin (250 mg orally every 12 hours for 5 days), azithromycin (500 mg orally on day 1; 250 mg on days 2–5 for 5 days) and roxithromycin (150 mg orally every 12 hours or 300 mg once daily for 10 days), broader-spectrum second-generation cephalosporins like cefuroxime (250 mg or 500 mg every 12 hours for 5–10 days) and third-generation cephalosporins like cefixime (400 mg orally daily for 5 days). Use of erythromycin for non-penicillin allergic patients was also considered inappropriate. Finally, antibiotics not recommended for Gram-negative pathogens were also considered to be inappropriate or third-line agents; these included fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin); sulfonamides such as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and tetracyclines (e.g. doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline, and oxytetracycline).

Study outcomes and statistics

The primary outcome was the prevalence of GABHS infection in the adult pharyngitis patients from a low socioeconomic setting. Secondary outcomes included 1) number of prescriptions used for adult pharyngitis; 2) appropriateness of prescribed antibiotics; and 3) diagnostic accuracy of the Modified Centor criteria.

By comparing patients' culture results, we could determine the prevalence of infection. To determine whether patients received appropriate or inappropriate prescriptions, culture results were compared with antibiotic prescriptions. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive value of the McIsaac score approach was determined by ratios of false positives, true positives, false negatives and true negatives.

### Efficacy of cephalexin two vs. three times daily vs. cefadroxil once daily for streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis [^114KHMjC]. Clinical Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare the bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of oral cephalexin twice vs. three times daily vs. cefadroxil once daily as therapy for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) tonsillopharyngitis. A prospective open-label, observational cohort study was conducted over 18 months (January 2000-June 2001). Children enrolled had an acute onset of symptoms and signs of a tonsillopharyngeal illness and a laboratory-documented GABHS infection. Follow-up examination and laboratory testing occurred 21 ± 4 days following enrollment. Two hundred seventy-one patients were enrolled (intent to treat group): 63 received cephalexin twice daily, 124 received cephalexin three times daily, and 84 received cefadroxil once daily. Fifty-three children did not return for the follow-up visit, leaving 218 patients in the per-protocol group: 54 cephalexin twice-daily treated, 94 cephalexin 3-times daily treated, and 70 cefadroxil once-daily treated. In the per-protocol group, bacteriologic cure for those treated with cephalexin twice daily was 87%, for cephalexin 3 times daily, it was 81% and for cefadroxil once daily it was 81% (p = 0.61). The clinical cure rate for cephalexin twice-daily treatment was 91%; for three-times daily, it was 86%; and for cefadroxil once daily, it was 84% (p = 0.56). Because treatment allocation was not randomized, logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for treatment group differences. Younger age of patient was significantly associated with bacteriologic (p = 0.04) and clinical (p = 0.01) failure independent of treatment group but in the adjusted logistic model no differences were found among the 3 treatment regimens. Cephalexin dosed twice daily or three times daily and cefadroxil dosed once daily appear equivalent in bacteriologic and clinical cure of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis.

### Patterns of use and appropriateness of antibiotics prescribed to patients receiving haemodialysis: an observational study [^116LmeTu]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Appropriateness of antibiotics prescribed

Overall, 95.3% (224/235) of the antibiotic regimens could be assessed for appropriateness of prescribing. Of these, 75.4% (169/224) were appropriate and 24.6% (55/224) were inappropriate (Table 4). The rate of inappropriately prescribed antibiotic regimens was 16.2 regimens/100 PM. Of the appropriate regimens, 93 were compliant with TG: Antibiotics, 42 with local guidelines, one with the Renal Drug Handbook. Guidelines were not available for 33 antibiotic regimens, but were deemed appropriate by all assessors using the classification provided in Table 1. In the community setting, 34.9% (15/43) of the antibiotics regimens were classified as inappropriate compared to 22.1% (40/181) in the hospital setting. Additionally, 29.4% (30/102) of oral and 20.5% (25/122) of IV antibiotic regimens were classified as inappropriate. Antibiotic regimens were commonly classified as inappropriate due to incorrect dose or frequency selected (Table 4). For the majority, the dose of the antibiotic was either too high or the dosing interval too short.

Table 4
The appropriateness of the antibiotic regimens prescribed

All data shown as number of antibiotic regimens and percentage. Reasons for inadequate classification are not mutually exclusive

IV - intravenous

The most common inappropriately prescribed oral antibiotics were amoxycillin/clavulanic acid and cephalexin (Table 3). For amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, often the dose prescribed was too high or dosing interval too long. In comparison, the main reason for cephalexin regimens being classified as inappropriate was due to dosing interval being too short. Additionally, all trimethoprim regimens were classified as inappropriate as the dose (300 mg) prescribed was too high given guidelines recommend 150 mg daily.

Both cephazolin and meropenem were the most common inappropriately prescribed IV antibiotics (Table 3) often due to the dosing interval being too short. Almost all the vancomycin regimens prescribed were classified as appropriate, with only three regimens classified as inappropriate due to dosing frequency with no reference to TDM. Of the three inappropriately prescribed vancomycin regimens, TDM was not available for two of the regimens.

### Ampicillin [^116FGYGj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Adults and children weighing over 20 kg:

For genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract infections other than gonorrhea in men and women, the usual dose is 500 mg qid in equally spaced doses; severe or chronic infections may require larger doses. For the treatment of gonorrhea in both men and women, a single oral dose of 3.5 grams of ampicillin administered simultaneously with 1 gram of probenecid is recommended. Physicians are cautioned to use no less than the above recommended dosage for the treatment of gonorrhea. Follow-up cultures should be obtained from the original site(s) of infection 7 to 14 days after therapy. In women, it is also desirable to obtain culture test-of-cure from both the endocervical and anal canals. Prolonged intensive therapy is needed for complications such as prostatitis and epididymitis.

For respiratory tract infections, the usual dose is 250 mg qid in equally spaced doses.

Pediatric patients weighing 20 kg or less:

For genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract infections, the usual dose is 100 mg/kg/day total, qid in equally divided and spaced doses. For respiratory tract infections, the usual dose is 50 mg/kg/day total, in equally divided and spaced doses three to four times daily. Doses for children should not exceed doses recommended for adults.

All Patients, Irrespective of Age and Weight:

Larger doses may be required for severe or chronic infections. Although ampicillin is resistant to degradation by gastric acid, it should be administered at least one-half hour before or two hours after meals for maximal absorption. Except for the single dose regimen for gonorrhea referred to above, therapy should be continued for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours after the patient becomes asymptomatic or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained. In infections caused by hemolytic strains of streptococci, a minimum of 10 days' treatment is recommended to guard against the risk of rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis (see PRECAUTIONS–Laboratory Tests). In the treatment of chronic urinary or gastrointestinal infections, frequent bacteriologic and clinical appraisal is necessary during therapy and may be necessary for several months afterwards. Stubborn infections may require treatment for several weeks. Smaller doses than those indicated above should not be used.

Uncomplicated Gonococcal Infection of the Cervix, Urethra, or Rectum

Recommended Regimen for Uncomplicated Gonococcal Infection of the Cervix, Urethra, or Rectum Among Adults and Adolescents
Ceftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose for persons weighing < 150 kg
If chlamydial infection has not been excluded, treat for chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days.
* For persons weighing ≥ 150 kg, 1 g ceftriaxone should be administered.

Although clinical data confirm that a single injection of ceftriaxone 250 mg is > 99% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 97.6%–99.7%) effective in curing anogenital gonorrhea of circulating isolates (MIC = 0.03 µ g/mL), a higher dose is likely necessary for isolates with elevated MICs. Effective treatment of uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea with ceftriaxone requires concentrations higher than the strain MIC for approximately 24 hours; although individual variability exists in the pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone, a 500-mg dose of ceftriaxone is expected to achieve in approximately 50 hours MIC > 0.03 µ g/mL. The pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone might be different in the pharynx with longer times higher than the strain MIC likely needed to prevent selection of mutant strains in the pharynx.

Single-dose injectable cephalosporin regimens, other than ceftriaxone, that are safe and have been effective against uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal gonococcal infections in the past include ceftizoxime (500 mg IM), cefoxitin (2 g IM with probenecid 1 g orally), and cefotaxime (500 mg IM). None of these injectable cephalosporins offer any advantage over ceftriaxone 250 mg for urogenital infection, and efficacy for pharyngeal infection is less certain. Because the ceftriaxone dose has been increased and the pharmacokinetics of other cephalosporins have not been evaluated, these dosing regimens might be at a disadvantage over ceftriaxone 500 mg.

Alternative Regimens if Ceftriaxone Is Not Available
Gentamicin 240 mg IM in a single dose
plus
Azithromycin 2 g orally in a single dose
or
Cefixime* 800 mg orally in a single dose
* If chlamydial infection has not been excluded, providers should treat for chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days.

### Clinical trial: comparative effectiveness of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus cephalexin alone for treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis: a randomized controlled trial [^1148wif9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) is the most common organism isolated from purulent skin infections. Antibiotics are usually not beneficial for skin abscess, and national guidelines do not recommend CA-MRSA coverage for cellulitis, except purulent cellulitis, which is uncommon. Despite this, antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are prescribed commonly and increasingly for skin infections, perhaps due, in part, to lack of experimental evidence among cellulitis patients. We test the hypothesis that antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are beneficial in the treatment of cellulitis.

Methods

We performed a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from 2007 to 2011. We enrolled patients with cellulitis, no abscesses, symptoms for < 1 week, and no diabetes, immunosuppression, peripheral vascular disease, or hospitalization (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00676130). All participants received cephalexin. Additionally, each was randomized to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or placebo. We provided 14 days of antibiotics and instructed participants to continue therapy for ≥ 1 week, then stop 3 days after they felt the infection to be cured. Our main outcome measure was the risk difference for treatment success, determined in person at 2 weeks, with telephone and medical record confirmation at 1 month.

Results

We enrolled 153 participants, and 146 had outcome data for intent-to-treat analysis. Median age was 29, range 3–74. Of intervention participants, 62/73 (85%) were cured versus 60/73 controls (82%), a risk difference of 2.7% (95% confidence interval, -9.3% to 15%; p = 0.66). No covariates predicted treatment response, including nasal MRSA colonization and purulence at enrollment.

Conclusions

Among patients diagnosed with cellulitis without abscess, the addition of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to cephalexin did not improve outcomes overall or by subgroup.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral cephalexin in children with osteoarticular infections [^113gdiN5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoarticular infections lead to significant morbidity in children. Cephalexin has in vitro activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, a predominant pathogen in osteoarticular infection. However, cephalexin pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) are poorly described in children. This study described cephalexin PK in children treated for osteoarticular infection and assessed the proportion of children achieving surrogate PK/PD target for efficacy in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus infection.

Methods

Children with osteoarticular infection, 1 to 18 years of age, were eligible for this study if they were receiving oral cephalexin per standard of care. PK plasma samples were collected at specified times after multiple doses. PK parameters were estimated using noncompartmental analysis. PK/PD target for efficacy was calculated using the child's PK parameters, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the isolate when available and previously described MIC of 2 and 4 mg/L.

Results

Twelve children were enrolled and PK profiles were obtained from 11 of them. Median age was 7 years, and median cephalexin dose was 40 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours. Median apparent oral clearance, apparent oral volume of distribution and elimination half-life (T½) were 0.29 L/h/kg, 0.44 L/kg and 1.1 h, respectively. Time above MIC (T > MIC) was greater than 40% of the dosing interval in 100%, 90% and 80% of the children when MICs were 0.25, 2 and 4 mg/L, respectively.

Conclusions

Oral cephalexin achieved optimal plasma exposure and was well tolerated in children with osteoarticular infection. Correlation between osteoarticular infection clinical outcome and PK/PD parameters needs further evaluation.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^111f9mKR]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The importance of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties for correct dosing of antibiotics

Craig et al. refined the concept of the importance of the time above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for beta-lactam antibiotics, which refers to the duration of time that serum levels of the antibiotic remain above the MIC at the site of infection. They suggested that for penicillins, this parameter or index should reach at least 50% of the dosing interval to ensure treatment effectiveness. For antibiotics like fluoroquinolones, the optimal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index is the area under the curve above the MIC (AUC/MIC ratio).

In a recent randomised clinical trial concerning phenoxymethylpenicillin treatment of streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis it was shown that a short course of higher doses of penicillin V, taken four times daily for five days, was non-inferior in clinical outcome to the standard dose taken thrice daily for 10 days. This fits with the above concept that penicillin V due to its relatively short serum elimination half-life should be dosed at least every 6 h to secure a time > MIC of at least 50%. Optimising the bacterial kill also shortens the duration of treatment needed for effect. The optimised dosing regimen concurrently reduces selection of resistance.

The diversity of PK/PD targets emphasizes the uncertainties in the literature data, even though most physicians are well aware that a beta-lactam concentration over several times the MIC is required throughout the dosing interval (as already reported by Wong et al. in 2014). However, few of our respondents answered this question, showing that the concept of dosage adjustment based on PK/PD indices is poorly known (as already described in the ONTAI study). In 2018, the French Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics and the French Society of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine suggested that targeting a free plasma beta-lactam concentration over four times the MIC of the causative bacteria (or the EUCAST epidemiological cut-off, when the MIC of the isolated strain is not available) for 100% of the dosing interval would maximize the bacteriological and clinical responses in critical care patients, whereas the European guidelines recommend a PK/PD index of between two and five times the MIC.

### Palbociclib (Ibrance) [^112DT6Sb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1	Recommended Dose and Schedule

The recommended dose of IBRANCE is a 125 mg tablet taken orally once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment to comprise a complete cycle of 28 days. IBRANCE tablet may be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Administer the recommended dose of an aromatase inhibitor when given with IBRANCE. Please refer to the Full Prescribing Information for the aromatase inhibitor being used.

When given with IBRANCE, the recommended dose of fulvestrant is 500 mg administered on Days 1, 15, 29, and once monthly thereafter. Please refer to the Full Prescribing Information of fulvestrant.

Refer to the Full Prescribing Information for inavolisib and fulvestrant for dosing information.

Advise patients to take their dose of IBRANCE at approximately the same time each day.

If the patient vomits or misses a dose, an additional dose should not be taken. The next prescribed dose should be taken at the usual time. IBRANCE tablets should be swallowed whole (do not chew, crush, or split them prior to swallowing). Tablets should not be ingested if they are broken, cracked, or otherwise not intact.

Pre/perimenopausal women treated with the combination IBRANCE plus an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant therapy or IBRANCE plus inavolisib and fulvestrant should also be treated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists according to current clinical practice standards.

For men treated with combination IBRANCE plus aromatase inhibitor or IBRANCE plus inavolisib and fulvestrant therapy, consider treatment with an LHRH agonist according to current clinical practice standards.

### Beta-lactam antibiotic dosing during continuous renal replacement therapy: how can we optimize therapy? [^116Bi8hx]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Correct antibiotic treatment is of utmost importance to treat infections in critically ill patients, not only in terms of spectrum and timing but also in terms of dosing. However, this is a real challenge for the clinician because the pathophysiology (such as shock, augmented renal clearance, and multiple organ dysfunction) has a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of hydrophilic antibiotics. The presence of extra-corporal circuits, such as continuous renal replacement therapy, may further complicate this difficult exercise. Standard dosing may result in inadequate concentrations, but unadjusted dosing regimens may lead to toxicity. Recent studies confirm the variability in concentrations, and the wide variation in dialysis techniques used certainly contributes to these findings. Well-designed clinical studies are needed to provide the data from which robust dosing guidance can be developed. In the meantime, non-adjusted dosing in the first 1 to 2 days of antibiotic therapy during continuous renal replacement therapy followed by dose reduction later on seems to be a prudent approach.

### Increased β-lactams dosing regimens improve clinical outcome in critically ill patients with augmented renal clearance treated for a first episode of hospital or ventilator-acquired pneumonia: a before and after study [^1149DoGs]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Our antibiotic therapy protocol was thus in accordance with previous studies which suggested that higher than licensed dosing regimens would be necessary in patients with ARC. Piperacillin-tazobactam has been the most studied antibiotic in this context, where previous studies demonstrated that standard intermittent dosing regimens were unlikely to achieve optimal antibiotic exposure. Although other studies suggested a significant improvement of PK/PD target attainment rates when extended or continuous infusions are used, patients with CL CR ≥ 150–170 ml/min remained at risk for empirical underexposure. In this context, higher than licensed doses of piperacillin-tazobactam (20 g/2.5 g/day by continuous infusion) allowed attaining the empirical PK/PD target in 100% patients with CL CR ≥ 150 ml/min, without excessive dosing.

Data on other β-lactams in patients with ARC are scarce. For ceftriaxone, we previously demonstrated high rates of empirical target underdosing in patients with CL CR ≥ 150 ml/min. In this context, Monte Carlo simulations suggested a dose of 2 g twice a day to achieve a 100% fT > MIC when targeting a theoretical MIC at the upper limit of the susceptibility range. Dosing simulations for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid also supported the use of increased dosing regimens (2 g four times daily) for ARC patients when using a target MIC of 8 mg/l and a pharmacodynamic target of 50% fT > MIC, with little accumulation of clavulanic acid. Considering cefazolin, only an ancillary pilot study suggested a higher rate of underdosing in ARC patients, especially when PK/PD targets were adjusted to the inoculum effect.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Syphilis — Neurosyphilis, otic, or ocular disease preferred therapy is aqueous crystalline penicillin G, 18–24 million U per day, administered as 3–4 million U IV every 4 hours (q4h) or by continuous IV infusion for 10–14 days (AII) with optional benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million U IM weekly for 1 to 3 doses after completion of IV therapy (CIII). Alternative therapy is procaine penicillin G 2.4 million U IM daily plus probenecid 500 mg PO four times a day (QID) for 10–14 days (BII) with optional benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million U IM weekly for up to 3 doses after completion of above (CIII); persons allergic to sulfa-containing medications should not be given probenecid, thus the procaine penicillin regimen is not recommended (AIII). For penicillin-allergic patients, desensitization to penicillin is the preferred approach; if not feasible, ceftriaxone 2 g IM or IV daily for 10–14 days (BII).

Varicella treatment dosing — For children with no or moderate immune suppression and mild varicella disease, acyclovir 20 mg/kg body weight/dose by mouth (maximum 800 mg/dose) four times a day for 7–10 days and until no new lesions for 48 hours. For children with severe immune suppression or severe varicella disease, acyclovir 10 mg/kg body weight or 500 mg/m2/dose IV every 8 hours for 7–10 days and until no new lesions for 48 hours. For patients unresponsive to acyclovir, foscarnet 40–60 mg/kg body weight/dose IV every 8 hours for 7–10 days or until no new lesions have appeared for 48 hours. In children aged ≥ 12 years, some experts base IV acyclovir dosing on body surface area 500 mg/m2 body surface area/dose IV every 8 hours instead of body weight. Valacyclovir is approved for adults and adolescents with zoster at 1 g/dose by mouth three times a day for 7 days; the same dose has been used for varicella infections, and in children a dose of 20 to 25 mg/kg body weight administered 2 to 3 times a day can be used; 500-mg capsules can be compounded to give valacyclovir 20 mg/kg body weight/dose (maximum dose 1 g) three times a day. Famciclovir is approved for adults and adolescents with zoster at 500 mg/dose by mouth three times a day for 7 days; a sprinkle formulation is available for children, and a schedule for weight-adjusted dosing is available to inform dosing of small children.

### Acetazolamide extended-release [^113kKbox]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:

Glaucoma

The recommended dosage is 1 capsule (500 mg) two times a day. Usually 1 capsule is administered in the morning and 1 capsule in the evening. It may be necessary to adjust the dose, but it has usually been found that dosage in excess of 2 capsules (1 g) does not produce an increased effect. The dosage should be adjusted with careful individual attention both to symptomatology and intraocular tension. In all cases, continuous supervision by a physician is advisable.

In those unusual instances where adequate control is not obtained by the twice-a-day administration of acetazolamide extended-release capsules, the desired control may be established by means of acetazolamide (tablets or parenteral). Use tablets or parenteral in accordance with the more frequent dosage schedules recommended for these dosage forms, such as 250 mg every four hours, or an initial dose of 500 mg followed by 250 mg or 125 mg every four hours, depending on the case in question.

Acute Mountain Sickness

Dosage is 500 mg to 1000 mg daily, in divided doses using tablets or extended-release capsules as appropriate. In circumstances of rapid ascent, such as in rescue or military operations, the higher dose level of 1000 mg is recommended. It is preferable to initiate dosing 24 to 48 hours before ascent and to continue for 48 hours while at high altitude, or longer as necessary to control symptoms.

### Effect of chronic probenecid therapy on cefazolin serum concentrations [^114o2Qsu]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To prospectively assess the effectiveness of probenecid at maintaining therapeutic serum concentrations of cefazolin at steady-state by comparing cefazolin serum concentrations produced by intravenous cefazolin 2000 mg every 8 hours with concentrations produced by once-daily administration of intravenous cefazolin 2000 mg plus oral probenecid 500 mg 4 times daily.

Methods

Patients in this prospective, nonrandomized, unblinded study were identified after an order was written for intravenous cefazolin 2000 mg every 8 hours or once daily plus oral probenecid 500 mg 4 times daily in the emergency department. For both study arms, a peak cefazolin serum concentration was obtained 1 hour after the infusion was started and 23 hours later, prior to the next scheduled dose. Doses of cefazolin for days 2–4 were then administered as ordered. On day 5, peak and trough serum concentrations were drawn 1 hour after the infusion started and 23 hours later, respectively.

Results

A total of 26 patients were prospectively assessed from April 2000 to October 2001. In patients who received cefazolin once daily, the average serum peak and trough concentrations on day 1 were 146.53 and 2.02 mg/L, respectively. Peak and trough concentrations on day 5 were 148.30 and 2.67 mg/L, respectively. In patients who received cefazolin every 8 hours, peak and trough concentrations were 122.15 and 18.65 mg/L on day 1 and, on day 5, 136.51 and 16.98 mg/L, respectively.

Conclusions

Probenecid 500 mg given orally 4 times daily was effective in maintaining therapeutic serum concentrations of cefazolin at steady-state when given with intravenous cefazolin 2000 mg once daily.

### Comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for implantable peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) in the management of chronic pain: from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^1152ZW1V]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) biological complications include wound infection and other events; PNS has lower infection rates than spinal cord stimulation and deep brain stimulation, with common organisms being Staphylococcus aureus and Staph epidermis and less common Candida albicans and Streptococcus species. In a study where almost all patients received perioperative antibiotics, there was no difference in surgical site infection rates between those given prophylactic postoperative antibiotics and those not; in this study, 99% of patients were given preoperative intravenous antibiotics (cefazolin, vancomycin, or clindamycin), and postoperative regimens included cephalexin therapy (250 to 500 mg dosed bid, tid, or qid), clindamycin (150 to 300 mg bid), ciprofloxacin (300 mg bid), or cefadroxil (1,000 mg bid) for median antibiotic duration of 7 days. The design of percutaneous leads was associated with infection rate, with the risk of infection with non-coiled leads about 25 times greater than with coiled leads; wound infections could also result from poor surgical technique or insufficient dissection for anchors/connectors. Other complications include skin erosion, hematoma, seroma, and nerve injury; reports include 2 patients with lead migration to the skin requiring open removal and seroma at the implanted pulse generator site as the most common complication in sacral nerve stimulation that resolved spontaneously.

### Cefoxitin [^114HnK3N]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The intent of this Pharmacy Bulk Package is for the preparation of solutions for intravenous infusion only.

TREATMENT

Adults

The usual adult dosage range is 1 gram to 2 grams every six to eight hours. Dosage should be determined by susceptibility of the causative organisms, severity of infection, and the condition of the patient (see Table 3 for dosage guidelines).

If C. trachomatis is a suspected pathogen, appropriate anti-chlamydial coverage should be added, because cefoxitin sodium has no activity against this organism.

Cefoxitin for Injection may be used in patients with reduced renal function with the following dosage adjustments:

In adults with renal insufficiency, an initial loading dose of 1 gram to 2 grams may be given. After a loading dose, the recommendations for maintenance dosage (Table 4) may be used as a guide.

When only the serum creatinine level is available, the following formula (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) may be used to convert this value into creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function.

Males: [Weight (kg) × (140 − age)]/[72 × serum creatinine (mg/100 mL)]

Females: 0.85 × above value

In patients undergoing hemodialysis, the loading dose of 1 gram to 2 grams should be given after each hemodialysis, and the maintenance dose should be given as indicated in Table 4.

Antibiotic therapy for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections should be maintained for at least 10 days to guard against the risk of rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis. In staphylococcal and other infections involving a collection of pus, surgical drainage should be carried out where indicated.

Pediatric Patients

The recommended dosage in pediatric patients three months of age and older is 80 to 160 mg/kg of body weight per day divided into four to six equal doses. The higher dosages should be used for more severe or serious infections. The total daily dosage should not exceed 12 grams.

At this time no recommendation is made for pediatric patients from birth to three months of age (see PRECAUTIONS).

In pediatric patients with renal insufficiency, the dosage and frequency of dosage should be modified consistent with the recommendations for adults (see Table 4).

### Intradiscal pharmacokinetics of oral antibiotics to treat chronic lower back pain [^114fdBAU]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2023). Medium credibility.

This analysis suggested that oral Q12h doses of amoxicillin of up to 1000 mg are unlikely to reach antibacterial herniated disc tissue exposure. The 500 mg or 750 mg amoxicillin Q8h mean exposure may be effective for 50% of C. acnes strains, and the 1000 mg Q8h mean exposure may be effective for 90% of C. acnes strains. These were the mean exposures. Given that oral amoxicillin pharmacokinetics are variable, some disc tissues will at times contain no detectable amoxicillin, and that disc tissues evaluated to date may not reflect concentrations in the core of the nucleus pulposus, it is possible that all oral amoxicillin CLBP studies to date have been underdosed, and that the variability in terms of clinical effect is due to the wide variability in amoxicillin exposure at the site of infection. Disc amoxicillin is essentially eliminated during a single dose interval and it is not known if there is any accumulation in tissue concentration with multiple daily doses for up to 100 days. A wide range of amoxicillin exposures to disc tissue can be expected throughout the duration of up to 100 days of Q8h regimens, with a total of up to 300 doses. More than 1400 patients with CLBP were administered oral amoxicillin, with no apparent assessment of systemic or intradiscal pharmacokinetics (Table 1).

Antibiotic dose regimens should be selected based on population pharmacokinetics to provide a high probability of achieving the pharmacodynamic target and, therefore, a low risk of treatment failure (< 10%) due to inadequate antibiotic exposure. Population pharmacokinetic analysis of oral amoxicillin based on serum concentration suggests that 500 mg of oral amoxicillin Q12h would be sufficient if amoxicillin was readily available in herniated disc tissue. As amoxicillin poorly penetrates disc tissue, standard-dose regimens are inadequate for effective antimicrobial coverage in disc tissue. To date, the dose regimens tested in clinical trials to treat CLBP may have all suffered from a substantial proportion of treatment failures owing to inadequate exposure to disc tissue. Notably, no studies have explored dose escalation in terms of dose or dose interval, for example, > 1 g of amoxicillin or administration four times a day.

The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacokinetic Assessments

PK sampling (0.18–0.4 mL of blood per patient) was performed at prespecified time points (ie, 1, 3, 3.5, 5 and 8 hours for cohorts 1 and 2 and 3, 5 and 8 hours for cohorts 3 and 4), with flexibility in the PK sampling schedule allowed for cohorts 1 and 2 (Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2). In the multiple-dose phase of the study, blood samples were taken between the 6th and 12th doses of cefiderocol. Individual plasma concentrations are summarized for each cohort in both dosing phases using descriptive statistics, including geometric mean and geometric coefficient of variation. The unbound concentrations were calculated based on the unbound fraction of 0.422 derived from previous studies.

Statistics

Continuous variables are summarized by using the number of nonmissing observations (N), arithmetic mean (mean), standard deviation, median and range (minimum–maximum) values. Categorical variables are summarized by using the frequency count and the percentage of patients in each category. Analysis populations are shown in Text, Supplemental Digital Content 3.

### Optimal antibiotics at hospital discharge for children with urinary tract infection [^115fZRu5]. Hospital Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Antibiotic stewardship at hospital discharge is an area of need. We assessed the rate of optimal antibiotic prescriptions at hospital discharge, on the basis of urine culture and susceptibility data, for children diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI).

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of patients ≤ 18 years of age who were admitted to a general pediatrics service at a freestanding children's hospital during 2017 with a diagnosis of UTI and received an antibiotic prescription at discharge. For the primary analysis, optimal antibiotic at hospital discharge was determined by evaluating if the cultured urinary pathogen was susceptible to the prescribed antibiotic and if the antibiotic was the narrowest-spectrum option available. Secondary objectives included assessment of antibiotic dosing accuracy and description of antibiotic treatment duration.

Results

A total of 78 cases were included. Sixty-eight (83%) cases were caused by cefazolin-susceptible Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species. Thirty-one (40%) cases had a discharge antibiotic prescription that was determined to be optimal. Of the 47 (60%) cases that were suboptimal, 44 (94%) were considered to be excessively broad spectrum. In 3 (6%) cases, the causative organism was nonsusceptible to the prescribed antibiotic. Ten (13%) discharge antibiotic prescriptions had inaccurate dosing and/or frequency.

Conclusions

Missed opportunities for narrow-spectrum antibiotic selection at hospital discharge for pediatric UTIs frequently occurred. In particular, higher-generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin were often prescribed for cephalexin-susceptible cases. Antibiotic stewardship attention, specifically at hospital discharge for pediatric UTIs, is likely to have a high impact.

Background question V — target exposures for β-lactam therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) are not fixed but minimum thresholds are suggested. There is insufficient evidence to recommend a single concentration or exposure to target when performing β-lactam TDM; however, when TDM is performed, we suggest minimum plasma exposures of at least 50%–70% fT > MIC for β-lactams administered as SI and EI, and for CI we suggest 100% fT > MIC with concentrations at least four times the MIC.

### Treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease: an official ATS / ERS / ESCMID / IDSA clinical practice guideline [^1167qkDk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease — selected dosing guidelines list daily and thrice weekly dosing plus organ impairment guidance. Azithromycin is dosed 250–500 mg per day with thrice weekly 500 mg per day. Clarithromycin is 500 mg twice per day and thrice weekly 500 mg twice per day; for renal impairment, Reduce dose by 50% if CrCl < 30 mL/min. Ethambutol is 15 mg/kg per day or 25 mg/kg per day thrice weekly, with renal guidance to Increase dosing interval (eg, 15–25 mg/kg, 3 times per week). Rifabutin is 150–300 mg per day (150 mg per day with clarithromycin) or thrice weekly 300 mg per day, and in renal impairment Reduce dose by 50% if CrCl < 30 mL/min. Rifampicin (rifampin) is 10 mg/kg (450 mg or 600 mg) per day with thrice weekly 600 mg per day and hepatic Caution. Parenteral amikacin (IV) is 10–15 mg/kg per day; adjusted according to drug level monitoring or thrice weekly 15–25 mg/kg per day; adjusted according to drug level monitoring, and renal dosing advises to Reduce dose or increase dosing interval (eg, 15 mg/kg, 2–3 times per week). Cefoxitin (IV) is 2–4 g 2–3 times daily (maximum daily dose is 12 g/day) with renal guidance to Reduce dose or increase dosing interval. For inhalation, amikacin liposome inhalation suspension is 590 mg per day. Availability and dosing caveats include Clofazimine availability varies by country. In the United States, an investigational new drug application is required and Most experts recommend once daily dosing of linezolid and tigecycline due to the high rate of drug-related adverse reactions associated with twice daily dosing. For amikacin therapeutic drug monitoring, targets are Trough < 5 mg/L with peaks 35–45 μg/mL for daily dosing and 65–80 μg/mL for intermittent dosing.

CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION may be used in patients with reduced renal function with the following dosage adjustments:

In adults with renal insufficiency, an initial loading dose of 1 gram to 2 grams may be given. After a loading dose, the recommendations for maintenance dosage (Table 2) may be used as a guide.

When only the serum creatinine level is available, the following formula (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) may be used to convert this value into creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function.

Males: [Weight (kg) × (140 − age)]/[72 × serum creatinine (mg/100 mL)]

Females: 0.85 × above value

In patients undergoing hemodialysis, the loading dose of 1 gram to 2 grams should be given after each hemodialysis, and the maintenance dose should be given as indicated in Table 2.

Antibiotic therapy for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections should be maintained for at least 10 days to guard against the risk of rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis.

In staphylococcal and other infections involving a collection of pus, surgical drainage should be carried out where indicated.

Pediatric Patients:

The recommended dosage in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older is 80 to 160 mg/kg of body weight per day divided into four to six equal doses. The higher dosages should be used for more severe or serious infections. The total daily dosage should not exceed 12 grams. At this time no recommendation is made for pediatric patients from birth to 3 months of age (see PRECAUTIONS).

In pediatric patients with renal insufficiency, the dosage and frequency of dosage should be modified consistent with the recommendations for adults (see Table 2).

### Oral and intravenous amoxicillin dosing recommendations in neonates: a pooled population pharmacokinetic study [^1135yzmf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

We evaluated target attainment of the currently recommended international dosing regimens and demonstrated that a twice-daily oral regimen is superior to a 3- or 4-times daily regimen in terms of exposure for all neonatal age categories. This can be explained by the delayed absorption that leads to a gradual increase in plasma concentration. A twice-daily schedule is very suitable as it can easily be integrated into feeding schedules and reduces the risk of missed administrations. For neonates with a GA ≥ 34 weeks in the first week of life, the recommended dosing schedule for oral administration is identical to that of intravenous administration. Higher daily dosages are, however, recommended in term neonates for infections that occur beyond day 7 after birth (PNA, 7–28 days) compared with the first week of life (PNA, 0–7 days), irrespective of the route of administration.
