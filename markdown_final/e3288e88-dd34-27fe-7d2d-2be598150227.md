## Question

Causes of Thrombocytosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of thrombocytosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining thrombocytosis and the overarching etiologic framework. Then, I should verify the major categories of causes, distinguishing reactive from clonal and hereditary. Next, I will examine specific etiologies within each category, including infections, iron deficiency, inflammation, malignancy, drugs, asplenia, and inherited forms. After that, I need to check the molecular drivers in clonal disease and the diagnostic approach, including when to pursue bone marrow and genetics. Finally, I will consider special populations, thrombotic risk nuances, and synthesize a practical hierarchy of causes with key takeaways, ensuring I anchor each point to appropriate references throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and framework so I don't jump to conclusions. Thrombocytosis is typically defined as a platelet count greater than 450×10⁹/L, and it is broadly classified into reactive (secondary) thrombocytosis, clonal (primary) thrombocytosis such as essential thrombocythemia and related myeloproliferative neoplasms, and hereditary thrombocytosis, with reactive causes being far more common in general practice and pediatrics, which I should keep in mind as I proceed.

> I will now examine reactive causes, starting with infection and inflammation, because these are the most prevalent drivers of secondary thrombocytosis. Infections, both bacterial and viral, commonly elevate platelets via IL-6–mediated thrombopoietin stimulation and as part of the acute phase response; this is well documented in hospitalized cohorts and in pediatrics, where extreme thrombocytosis is overwhelmingly secondary to infection or inflammation rather than clonal disease [^112k81Zq] [^112MuYup] [^117W5qbk].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of iron deficiency, since it is a classic and sometimes underappreciated cause. Iron deficiency anemia drives reactive thrombocytosis in roughly one-third of cases, and the platelet elevation can be striking, occasionally exceeding 1000×10⁹/L; importantly, iron deficiency–associated thrombocytosis correlates with increased thrombotic risk, and iron repletion reverses both the thrombocytosis and the prothrombotic phenotype, which is a key management implication I need to emphasize [^116dgroe] [^116TddQZ] [^116Dsjse].

> Next, I should review malignancy-associated thrombocytosis, because this is both common and prognostically meaningful. Solid tumors frequently cause paraneoplastic thrombocytosis via IL-6–driven thrombopoietin stimulation, and thrombocytosis at diagnosis is associated with worse outcomes; large epidemiologic datasets show that new-onset thrombocytosis in primary care increases the short-term risk of cancer, particularly lung and colorectal, so I need to ensure appropriate cancer surveillance when thrombocytosis is unexplained or persistent [^116yS7mA] [^115JYHNa] [^113EJMdb].

> Let me consider tissue injury and postoperative states, since platelets behave as acute phase reactants. After surgery, trauma, or critical illness, reactive thrombocytosis is common and typically resolves with recovery; in trauma cohorts, thrombocytosis emerged around two weeks and normalized within roughly five weeks, and in ICU populations, thrombocytosis has been associated with lower mortality, though I should be cautious not to overinterpret observational associations as causal [^114JfLcy] [^113tg3zQ].

> I need to check drug-induced thrombocytosis as well, even though it is less common. Agents such as low-molecular-weight heparin, all-trans retinoic acid, certain antibiotics, clozapine, epinephrine, and vinca alkaloids have been implicated, but causality is often weak and confounded by the underlying illness; nonetheless, a careful medication review is essential when evaluating new thrombocytosis [^117WiVSY] [^1159zpGM].

> But wait, what if the thrombocytosis reflects altered platelet distribution or destruction rather than production. Asplenia or hyposplenism, whether surgical or functional, removes the splenic platelet reservoir and leads to persistent thrombocytosis; I should confirm this by looking for Howell-Jolly bodies or pitted erythrocytes on smear, and remember that isolated congenital asplenia is an overlooked cause that can masquerade as unexplained thrombocytosis [^1166mbw3] [^114jAcbW].

> Now, I will examine clonal causes, where the pathophysiology and risk profile differ materially. Essential thrombocythemia is a Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal megakaryocytic proliferation with driver mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL in about 80–90% of patients; diagnosis requires sustained thrombocytosis, exclusion of other myeloid neoplasms, and, in many cases, bone marrow showing increased mature-appearing megakaryocytes, with risk stratification guiding cytoreductive therapy to mitigate thrombosis and symptoms [^116yS7mA] [^112ocnEk] [^114xXRMy].

> Hold on, I should verify the molecular landscape and its clinical implications. JAK2 V617F is present in roughly 60% of ET, CALR mutations in 20–25%, and MPL in 3–4%, with triple-negative disease in about 10–15%; additional mutations such as ASXL1, TET2, DNMT3A, SF3B1, and TP53 modify prognosis and transformation risk, and JAK2-mutated ET carries higher thrombotic risk, which influences aspirin and cytoreduction decisions [^112k81Zq] [^1131VoXA] [^111dyEHL].

> Let me consider hereditary thrombocytosis, because missing this in young patients or those with a family history would be a mistake. Mutations in THPO, MPL, and JAK2 have been described in familial thrombocytosis, often with Mendelian inheritance and polyclonal hematopoiesis; in suspected cases, I should exclude acquired clonal disorders and pursue targeted genetic testing, recognizing that some hereditary forms remain genetically undefined [^1141UaUZ] [^115oeen5].

> I should double-check the diagnostic approach so I don't omit key steps. After confirming persistent thrombocytosis, I need to evaluate for reactive causes with iron studies, inflammatory markers, infection screens, and medication review; if no secondary cause is found, I should proceed to molecular testing for JAK2, CALR, and MPL, and consider bone marrow aspirate and biopsy to distinguish ET from prefibrotic myelofibrosis or other myeloid neoplasms, using WHO/ELN criteria and integrating cytogenetics or next-generation sequencing as indicated [^1131VoXA] [^114RezYt] [^117FrQx7].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with pediatrics. In children, extreme thrombocytosis is almost always reactive, most often due to infection, and thrombotic complications are rare unless additional risk factors like central venous lines are present; thus, routine cytoreduction or antiplatelet therapy is generally not indicated, and management should focus on treating the underlying cause with close follow-up [^112MuYup] [^117W5qbk] [^1128Rs92].

> I will now examine pregnancy and the peripartum period, where thrombocytosis can occur and may signal pathology. Thrombocytosis in pregnancy warrants careful evaluation for reactive causes and, when persistent or extreme, consideration of clonal disease; in the postpartum setting, thrombocytosis has been flagged as a red flag in headache evaluations, reminding me to maintain vigilance for thrombotic or hypertensive complications [^113QQM2W].

> Let me reconsider the relationship between platelet count and thrombotic risk, because I initially thought higher counts uniformly meant higher thrombosis; wait, that is too simplistic. In ET, extreme thrombocytosis may paradoxically associate with bleeding via acquired von Willebrand syndrome, and some cohorts show no independent association between platelet count and thrombosis when other risk factors are considered; thus, I should avoid using platelet count alone to drive cytoreduction decisions and instead integrate mutation status, age, and vascular history [^112k81Zq] [^114FueTC] [^115Hssgy].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical hierarchy of causes to guide bedside thinking. Reactive thrombocytosis dominates in outpatient and inpatient settings, with infection, iron deficiency, inflammation, malignancy, tissue injury, and asplenia accounting for most cases; clonal thrombocytosis from ET or other MPNs is less common but clinically consequential and requires molecular and marrow evaluation; hereditary thrombocytosis is rare and should be considered in young patients or those with a family history, prompting targeted genetic testing after excluding acquired causes [^112k81Zq] [^1131VoXA] [^1141UaUZ].

Thrombocytosis is defined as a platelet count > 450×10⁹/L and is classified as **primary (clonal)** or **secondary (reactive)**. Primary causes are myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) such as essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and primary myelofibrosis, driven by JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutations [^112k81Zq] [^1131VoXA]. Secondary causes are more common and include infection, inflammation, iron deficiency, malignancy, splenectomy or hyposplenism, and certain drugs [^112ocnEk] [^116yS7mA] [^117WiVSY]. Reactive thrombocytosis is usually mild to moderate and resolves with treatment of the underlying cause, whereas clonal thrombocytosis carries a higher thrombotic risk and may require cytoreductive therapy [^112k81Zq] [^1131VoXA].

## Classification of thrombocytosis

Thrombocytosis is broadly classified into **two main categories**:

| **Category** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Primary (clonal) thrombocytosis | Clonal proliferation of megakaryocytes due to intrinsic bone marrow disorders, most commonly myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) [^112k81Zq] [^1131VoXA]. |
| Secondary (reactive) thrombocytosis | Elevated platelet count resulting from external stimuli such as infection, inflammation, iron deficiency, malignancy, or splenectomy [^116yS7mA] [^116dgroe] [^1166mbw3]. |

---

## Primary (clonal) causes of thrombocytosis

Primary thrombocytosis arises from **clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders**, predominantly MPNs:

- **Essential thrombocythemia (ET)**: A chronic MPN characterized by clonal megakaryocyte proliferation and sustained thrombocytosis, often driven by JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutations [^112k81Zq] [^1131VoXA].

- **Polycythemia vera (PV)**: Typically presents with erythrocytosis, but thrombocytosis is common and may be the initial manifestation [^116UaRBV].

- **Primary myelofibrosis (PMF)**: Often associated with thrombocytosis in early disease, though thrombocytopenia may develop as fibrosis progresses [^notfound].

- **Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)**: Less commonly associated with thrombocytosis, but elevated platelet counts can occur [^notfound].

- **Hereditary thrombocytosis**: Rare familial forms due to mutations in THPO, MPL, or JAK2 genes, often with autosomal dominant inheritance [^1141UaUZ] [^115oeen5].

---

## Secondary (reactive) causes of thrombocytosis

Secondary thrombocytosis is more common than primary and reflects a **response to external stimuli**:

- **Infection**: Bacterial, viral, or fungal infections are common triggers via cytokine-mediated stimulation of megakaryopoiesis [^116yS7mA] [^112wT7MR].

- **Inflammation**: Chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease) elevate platelets through IL-6–driven thrombopoietin production [^116yS7mA].

- **Iron deficiency anemia**: Occurs in ~32.6% of IDA cases and correlates with increased thrombotic risk; platelets normalize with iron repletion [^116dgroe] [^116TddQZ].

- **Malignancy**: Solid tumors (lung, gastrointestinal, ovarian) frequently cause paraneoplastic thrombocytosis via IL-6–mediated mechanisms [^116yS7mA] [^113EJMdb].

- **Splenectomy or hyposplenism**: Loss of splenic sequestration increases circulating platelets; look for Howell-Jolly bodies on smear [^1166mbw3] [^114jAcbW].

- **Drugs**: Corticosteroids, epinephrine, and some antibiotics can acutely raise platelet counts [^117WiVSY] [^1159zpGM].

---

## Clinical significance and management implications

- **Reactive thrombocytosis**: Usually mild to moderate (< 800×10⁹/L), resolves with treatment of the underlying cause, and rarely requires antiplatelet therapy unless additional risk factors are present [^1128Rs92] [^114qxXds].

- **Clonal thrombocytosis**: Higher thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk; management includes risk-stratified cytoreduction (hydroxyurea, interferon-alpha) and low-dose aspirin for most patients [^112k81Zq] [^1131VoXA].

- **Extreme thrombocytosis (> 1000×10⁹/L)**: More often clonal and may cause acquired von Willebrand syndrome; cytoreduction is generally indicated in clonal cases [^112k81Zq] [^1131VoXA].

---

Thrombocytosis reflects either clonal megakaryocyte proliferation or a reactive response to external stimuli; **accurate classification and etiologic diagnosis** are essential to guide risk assessment and therapy.

### Why does my patient have thrombocytosis? [^115dVSvN]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is a common clinical problem frequently encountered during routine evaluation. The diagnostic workup entails a step-by-step approach, which allows for an accurate assessment of the underlying cause. A thorough clinical history and physical examination may help differentiate thrombocytosis secondary to a reactive process versus an underlying clonal proliferation process. Once essential thrombocytosis is evident, relevant laboratory evaluation for an ongoing myeloproliferative disorder is paramount. Various treatment modalities have been proven to be beneficial. With further scientific investigation underway, molecular therapies may soon be cornerstones of therapy in essential thrombocytosis.

The purpose of this article is to provide the reader with a firm knowledge of the major causes of thrombocytopenia and their treatments, and to form a broad differential diagnosis, so that it will be clearer when to consider a rare etiology. The various etiologies are presented by known disease entities, grouped by age, and described as they would occur and be considered in a realistic clinical setting. A brief categorization of causes of thrombocytopenia by mechanism, notably abnormal platelet production, platelet destruction, or sequestration, is included. With each disease process, the pathophysiology as it is currently known is described and discussed.

### Management of MPN beyond JAK2 [^111qoYsh]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis has a large number of potential underlying causes, but the dominant group of hematological conditions for consideration in this setting are the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). In this chapter, we consider several key linked questions relating to the management of thrombocytosis in MPNs and discuss several issues. First, we discuss the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis, which myeloid disorders to consider, and practical approaches to the discrimination of each individual MPN from other causes. Second, there have been several major advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of these conditions and we discuss how these findings are likely to be practically applied in the future. Third, we consider whether there is evidence that thrombocytosis contributes to the complications known to be associated with MPN: thrombosis, hemorrhage and transformation to leukemia and myelofibrosis. Last, we review current ideas for risk stratification and management of essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera as the 2 entities within the MPN family that are most frequently associated with thrombocytosis.

### Approach to patients with essential thrombocythaemia and very high platelet counts: what is the evidence for treatment? [^1138BuPS]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment of essential thrombocythaemia (ET) is directed at decreasing the risk of complications of the disease, including arterial and venous thrombosis and bleeding episodes. Established risk factors for vascular events in patients with ET include advanced age (> 60 years) and prior history of thrombosis or haemorrhage. The role, if any, of other potential risk factors, including cardiovascular risk factors, leucocytosis, high haematocrit, and JAK2 V617F has been analysed in multiple studies. The impact of thrombocytosis on the risk of vascular events has also been investigated. Many clinicians consider an elevated platelet count to be a risk factor for thrombosis or, when extreme, bleeding and utilize this as a criterion to start cytoreductive therapy. However, the relationship between thrombocytosis and vascular events is controversial and solid evidence to support the use of cytoreductive therapy in ET patients who have no other risk factors is lacking. In this review, we discuss current treatment recommendations for patients with ET, the biology underlying vascular events and risk factors thereof. We then review the evidence on the management of patients with ET and extreme thrombocytosis.

### Primary thrombocytosis in children [^1131ih5H]. Haematologica (2014). Low credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms are uncommon disorders in children, for which we have limited understanding of the pathogenesis and optimal management. JAK2 and MPL mutations, while common drivers of myeloproliferative neoplasms in adult patients, are not clearly linked to pediatric disease. Management and clinical outcomes in adults have been well delineated with defined recommendations for risk stratification and treatment. This is not the case for pediatric patients, for whom there is neither a standard approach to workup nor any consensus regarding management. This review will discuss thrombocytosis in children, including causes of thrombocytosis in children, the limited knowledge we have regarding pediatric primary thrombocytosis, and our thoughts on potential risk stratification and management, and future questions to be answered by laboratory research and collaborative clinical study.

### What's in a number? Examining the prognostic and predictive importance of platelet count in patients with essential thrombocythemia [^114FueTC]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2020). Medium credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal overproduction of platelets and an increased risk of thrombohemorrhagic complications. Patients are risk stratified by driver mutation, age, and thrombotic history and treated to reduce the risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic events. The significance of platelet number as a risk factor or treatment goal is unclear. Despite the preponderance of data failing to demonstrate an association, there exists a pervasive belief that higher platelet counts correlate with an increased thrombotic risk. In fact, the association between thrombocytosis and bleeding is more clearly supported. Variability in regional consensus guidelines contributes to the uncertainty. This article reviews the data that shed light on the importance of platelet count in patients with ET.

### Thrombocytosis and thrombosis [^114YVDNR]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this review is to discuss current diagnostic approaches to, and classification of, patients presenting with thrombocytosis, in light of novel information derived from the discovery of specific molecular abnormalities in chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD), which represent the most common cause of primary thrombocytosis. The JAK2V617F and the MPLW515L/K mutations have been found in patients with essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and primary myelofibrosis, and less frequently in other myeloproliferative disorders complicated by thrombocytosis. However, neither mutation is disease specific nor is it universally present in patients with elevated platelet counts due to a CMPD; therefore, distinguishing between reactive and primary forms of thrombocytosis, as well as among the different clinical entities that constitute the CMPD, still requires a multifaceted diagnostic approach that includes as a key step the accurate evaluation of bone marrow histology. The role of elevated platelet counts in thrombosis, which represent the predominant complication of CMPD, significantly affecting prognosis and quality of life as well as, paradoxically, in the pathogenesis of the hemorrhagic manifestations, will be discussed. Established and novel potential risk factors for thrombosis, including the clinical relevance of the JAK2V617F mutation, and current management strategies for thrombocytosis are also briefly discussed.

### Thrombocytosis: perioperative considerations for patients undergoing cardiac surgery [^1137Z7TF]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytosis is an uncommon yet important laboratory abnormality with significant considerations for patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The etiology of thrombocytosis can be categorized by those related to reactive processes; acquired platelet disorders (ie, myeloproliferative neoplasms, hematologic malignancies); or inherited platelet disorders (ie, hereditary thrombocythemia). A foundational understanding of the normal physiologic function of platelets and the abnormalities associated with each of these disorders is critical when considering implications and optimization to prevent perioperative complications. This review systematically outlines the platelet disorders that cause thrombocytosis with an emphasis on how the disorder affects normal physiologic processes, summarizes the literature related to the disorder, and the describes the implications and recommendations for patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

### Guideline for investigation and management of adults and children presenting with a thrombocytosis [^113g54EP]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for essential thrombocythemia, more specifically with respect to patients undergoing surgery, BSH 2010 guidelines recommend to treat surgical blood loss and postoperative infection according to the root cause as they may result in worsening thrombocytosis.

### A review and assessment of drug-induced thrombocytosis [^117WiVSY]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this article is to review the current literature on drug-induced thrombocytosis with the goal of critically assessing causality and providing a comprehensive review of the topic. Thrombopoietic growth factors, such as thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (romiplostim and eltrombopag) and erythropoietin are not included in our review.

Data Sources

The literature search included published articles limited to the English language and humans in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases. MEDLINE/PubMed (1966 to September 2018) was searched using the MeSH terms thrombocytosis/chemically-induced and thrombocytosis/etiology. EMBASE (1980 to September 2018) was searched using the EMTAGS thrombocytosis/side effect. Web of Science (1970 to September 2018) was searched using the search term thrombocytosis. References of all relevant articles were reviewed for additional citations and information.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Review articles, clinical trials, background data, case series, and case reports of drug-induced thrombocytosis were collected, and case reports were assessed for causality using a modified Naranjo nomogram.

Data Synthesis

Drug-induced thrombocytosis, a form of reactive thrombocytosis cannot be easily differentiated from more common etiologies of reactive thrombocytosis. In all, 43 case reports of drug-induced thrombocytosis from a wide variety of drugs and drug classes were reviewed using a modified Naranjo probability scale that included criteria specific for thrombocytosis.

Conclusions

Drug-induced thrombocytosis is a relatively rare adverse drug reaction. The strongest evidence of causality supports low-molecular-weight heparins and neonatal drug withdrawal. Weaker evidence exists for all-trans retinoic acid, antibiotics, clozapine, epinephrine, gemcitabine, and vinca alkaloids.

### What to do when you suspect an inherited platelet disorder [^116N4hpM]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2011). Low credibility.

Inherited platelet disorders (IPDs) comprise a heterogenous group of diseases that include defects in platelet function and disordered megakaryopoiesis. Some IPDs overlap as both defects in function and thrombopoiesis, resulting in both altered aggregation and/or secretion and thrombocytopenia. This review examines the key features of the presentation of IPDs in children and adults and presents a diagnostic algorithm for the evaluation of these patients. In addition, recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of platelet disorders are addressed, with attention given to some of the novel genetic associations. Finally, treatment options and future therapies are briefly discussed.

### Classification and molecular biology of polycythemias (erythrocytoses) and thrombocytosis [^115FS2K1]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

In this article, polycythemic disorders are classified based on the current understanding of biology of erythropoieses and divided into primary and secondary polycythemias. Special emphasis is given to recently uncovered molecular bases of newly described congenital polycythemic disorders. This clarification of the pathophysiology of some of the congenital polycythemic states has obvious utility for more accurate diagnosis and rational prognostic determination. The molecular basis of congenital thrombocytoses is only beginning to be uncovered. In contrast, the molecular bases of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia remain unknown, thus their diagnostic criteria are imprecise and their treatment remains largely empirical. The central premise of this article is that deciphering the molecular basis of human diseases leads to improved understanding of hematopoiesis, precise diagnosis, and the potential for development of a specific therapy.

### Genetic origins and clinical phenotype of familial and acquired erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis [^114yaJm9]. American Journal of Hematology (2009). Low credibility.

Familial and acquired erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis are characterized by myeloid lineage hyperproliferation, which is either single or multi-lineage in origin. The single lineage disorders exhibit Mendelian inheritance with polyclonal hematopoiesis and often arise from a single genetic defect. In contrast, the multi-lineage disorders exhibit complex patterns of inheritance with multi-genetic origins and clonal hematopoiesis. They have the potential to acquire JAK2 somatic mutations, but this is not the primary event. Identification of the disease-causing genes will enable better classification of familial and acquired erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis. Furthermore, it will provide an insight into the mechanisms regulating myeloid cell proliferation.

### Examination of the relationship between antimicrobials and thrombocytosis [^1159zpGM]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether there is a relationship between antimicrobial therapy and the development of thrombocytosis.

Data Sources

Literature was accessed through EMBASE (1977-June 2012) and MEDLINE (1977-June 2012) using the terms thrombocytosis and antimicrobial. In addition, reference citations from publications identified were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language publications identified were evaluated. For case reports, the Naranjo probability scale was used to calculate the likelihood of the drug causing the reaction.

Data Synthesis

Thrombocytosis occurring during antimicrobial therapy is well documented, with several case reports and clinical trial observations. However, a direct causal relationship is not yet supported by the available literature. Platelets are well known to be an acute phase reactant, with an elevated count occurring after acute conditions such as blood loss, inflammation, or infection. Thrombocytosis during antimicrobial therapy may be the result of an infectious process and not an adverse drug event.

Conclusions

Based on the current available literature, a definitive link cannot be established between antimicrobial therapy and occurrence of thrombocytosis.

### Diagnostic workflow for hereditary erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis [^1141UaUZ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

In the patient presenting with an elevated blood count who does not have an acquired clonal disorder causing a myeloproliferative neoplasm, hereditary erythrocytosis or hereditary thrombocytosis needs to be considered as a possible explanation. A young patient and/or those with a family history of myeloproliferative neoplasm should specifically raise this possibility. Among the causes of hereditary erythrocytosis are mutations in the genes in the oxygen sensing pathway and high-affinity hemoglobins. Hereditary thrombocytosis has been shown to be accounted for by mutations in THPO, MPL, and JAK2 genes. In those who have a possible hereditary erythrocytosis or thrombocytosis, the investigative pathway includes specific investigation to rule out the more common acquired clonal disorders, and, if indicated, other secondary causes, measurement of specific cytokines as indicated, and search for specific identified molecular lesions that have been shown to cause these hereditary disorders. There remain individuals who appear to have a hereditary disorder in whom a genetic lesion cannot currently be identified.

### Recognition of thrombotic risk of thrombocytosis in iron deficiency [^11318giR]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Rates of thrombocytosis and thrombosis among patients with iron-deficiency anemia. Rates of thrombocytosis and thrombosis in a recent large clinical database study of over six million patients, supported by extensive chart review to exclude alternative confounding causes of thrombocytosis and confirm thrombotic events.

The development of a high quality animal model to lend support to the longstanding observation of iron deficiency mediated-thrombocytosis leading to a significantly higher risk of thrombosis is an important advance. Without stratifying for iron deficiency or its successful abatement by intravenous iron, the observation of a marked increment in thromboses in erythropoiesis stimulating agent-treated patients with cancer and chemotherapy-induced anemia and anemia associated with both non-dialysis and dialysis- dependent chronic kidney disease led to the near proscription of the use of a treatment which unqualifiedly leads to improvements in energy, activity and quality of life in a cohort with debilitating chronic illness. Despite a litany of prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled studies failing to show harm with the use of erythropoiesis- stimulating agents, especially in cancer and chemotherapy-induced anemia, extreme caution with their use remains the order of the day.

A now growing body of inferential evidence supports the use of intravenous iron as the preferred route of administration in most of the described conditions. This new animal model provides evidence that intravenous iron replenishment may have additional advantages in mitigating the thrombogenic potential of iron deficiency. It also suggests that intravenous iron might preferentially provide an important adjunctive therapy to mitigate the hypercoagulability associated with iron-deficiency states comorbid with multiple disorders in humans, such as cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, after bariatric surgery, abnormal uterine bleeding and pregnancy. Given that iron-deficiency anemia affects approximately 20% of the human population at any given point in time, even a modestly increased thrombotic risk imparted by iron deficiency has profound public health implications. Additionally, synergism of multiple thrombotic risk factors is well-documented, raising the specter of a potentially even greater thrombotic impact of this common problem given its frequent comorbidities. Thankfully, additional avenues of investigation to better understand these risks are open, as this animal model also suggests that critical biomarkers can now be explored and can then be correlated with objective in vivo events. Such biomarkers could also include the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1 and HIF-2, whose target genes include erythropoietin, the transferrin receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor. These targets are also associated with increased thrombogenesis.

### Thrombosis with erythropoietic stimulating agents-does iron-deficient erythropoiesis play a role? [^117Npo84]. Seminars in Dialysis (2008). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is common in iron deficiency and resolves following iron repletion. Increased platelet number, whether from iron deficiency or from other causes, may increase the risk of thrombovascular events. One mechanism thought to mediate iron deficiency-induced thrombocytosis is increased erythropoietin production. Similarly, erythropoietic stimulating agents (ESA) have long been known to increase platelet number and frequently lead to functional or absolute iron deficiency. This state of relative or absolute iron deficiency may be the mechanism whereby ESA increase the platelet count. If correct, co-administration of iron should prevent or diminish ESA-driven thrombocytosis. Data from the DRIVE trial in hemodialysis patients do, in fact, suggest that this is the case. Platelet counts in patients receiving IV iron decreased, while they remained unchanged in patients not given iron (mean change -29,000/microl vs. -0/microl; p = 0.017). Other supporting data have been observed in IV iron trials in oncology patients. The harm from higher hemoglobin targets and higher ESA doses may be mediated in part through induction of iron deficiency and thrombocytosis. The major anemia trials of ESAs have not reported platelet data, but should examine the relationship of platelet count, iron deficiency, IV iron administration, and cardiovascular events in greater detail.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder (CMPD) characterized predominately by thrombocytosis and abnormal megakaryocyte proliferation. The current diagnostic criteria require a combination of clinical, histologic, and cytogenetic data. The diagnosis relies largely on exclusion of other causes of thrombocytosis.

Objective

Describe historical, clinical, and laboratory features of ET in order to understand, clarify, and more accurately diagnose this entity.

Data Sources

Review contemporary and historical literature on ET and other causes of thrombocytosis.

Conclusions

ET is a relatively indolent and often asymptomatic CMPD that is characterized primarily by a sustained elevation in platelets ≥ 600 × 10³/µL (≥ 600 × 10⁹/L), proliferating enlarged and hyperlobated megakaryocytes, and minimal to absent bone marrow fibrosis. Significant changes and revisions to the diagnostic requirements and criteria for ET have occurred during the last 30 years. Recently, a mutation in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene has been found in a significant number of cases of ET and other CMPDs. In up to 57% of ET cases, a mutation in the JAK2 gene can be detected. In the absence of a JAK2 mutation and features of another CMPD, the diagnosis of ET remains a diagnosis of exclusion after other causes of thrombocytosis have been excluded.

### Thrombocytosis [^111E9wqA]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

Major progress in understanding the pathogenesis in patients with thrombocytosis has been made by identifying mutations in the key regulators of thrombopoietin: the thrombopoietin receptor MPL and JAK2. Together, these mutations can be found in 50% to 60% of patients with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis and in 10% to 20% of hereditary thrombocytosis. A decrease in expression of the Mpl protein can cause thrombocytosis even in the absence of mutations in the coding sequence, due to a shift in the balance between stimulation of signaling in megakaryopoiesis and removal of thrombopoietin by receptor mediated internalization in platelets. When present in a heterozygous state the JAK2-V617F mutation preferentially stimulates megakaryopoiesis and in most cases manifests as essential thrombocythemia (ET), whereas homozygous JAK2-V617F reduces megakaryopoiesis in favor of increased erythropoiesis, resulting in polycythemia vera and/or myelofibrosis. In 30% to 40% of patients with ET or primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and in 80% to 90% of pedigrees with hereditary thrombocytosis the disease-causing gene remains unknown. Ongoing genetic and genomic screens have identified genes that, when mutated, can cause thrombocytosis in mouse models. A more complete picture of the pathways that regulate megakaryopoisis and platelet production will be important for finding new ways of controlling platelet production in patients with thrombocytosis.

### Paraneoplastic thrombocytosis: the secrets of tumor self-promotion [^113EJMdb]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Paraneoplastic thrombocytosis is associated with many solid tumors and often correlates with reduced survival. Recent studies suggest that a pathogenic feed back loop may be operative between platelets and tumor cells, with reciprocal interactions between tumor growth/metastasis and thrombocytosis/platelet activation. Specific molecular pathways have been identified in which tumors can stimulate platelet production and activation; activated platelets can, in turn, promote tumor growth and metastasis. Taken together, these findings provide exciting new potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

### Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia… [^112GtMyG]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia are chronic myeloproliferative diseases. The main goal of treatment in patients with these conditions is to prevent thrombo-hemorrhagic complications. Tefferi and colleagues reviewed the medical literature to summarize the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. Polycythemia vera can be diagnosed when a patient has all three major criteria or the first two major criteria plus any two of the minor criteria and by keeping the platelet count less than 400 × 10.

### How to approach thrombocytopenia [^113h8nQU]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic finding with variable clinical expression. A low platelet count may be the initial manifestation of infections such as HIV and hepatitis C virus or it may reflect the activity of life-threatening disorders such as the thrombotic microangiopathies. A correct identification of the causes of thrombocytopenia is crucial for the appropriate management of these patients. In this review, we present a systematic evaluation of adults with thrombocytopenia. The approach is clearly different between outpatients, who are frequently asymptomatic and in whom we can sometimes indulge in sophisticated and relatively lengthy investigations, and the dramatic presentation of acute thrombocytopenia in the emergency department or in the intensive care unit, which requires immediate intervention and for which only a few diagnostic tests are available. A brief discussion of the most common etiologies seen in both settings is provided.

### Isolated congenital asplenia: an overlooked cause of thrombocytosis [^114jAcbW]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

2 DISCUSSION

Thrombocytosis is a common finding in routine blood exams and a common cause of referral to the hematologist for further investigation. From a physiopathological point of view, thrombocytosis can be categorized into primary (i.e. depending on the true hematological disease), secondary (i.e. reactive), and spurious (Table 1). As reactive thrombocytosis is more frequent than primary thrombocytosis, it is widely accepted in common clinical practice to search, at first, for causes of secondary thrombocytosis. Thus, blood tests and any other complementary examinations to search for reactive causes (e.g. iron deficiency, infection, inflammatory disease, and hemolysis) should be performed. In addition, a detailed medical history should be obtained, with particular emphasis on the present and past illness and recent surgical intervention (thrombocytosis secondary to malignancy, postoperative thrombocytosis). In addition, a comprehensive and updated list of current medications (including prescription medications, herbals, and over‐the‐counter drugs) should be noted (thrombocytosis caused by administration of corticosteroids, adrenaline, and thrombopoietin mimicking drugs).

### Essential thrombocythemia: challenges in clinical practice and future prospects [^115GFHZe]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) was first described in 1934, and subsequently, progress has been made in better understanding the molecular pathogenesis and which patients may have greatest risk of progression or vascular events. However, it has been more than a decade since a new therapy has been approved for ET. We are beginning to understand more comprehensively both the heterogeneity of this disease, which is largely driven by driver mutation status, as well as the effect of disease-related symptoms, such as fatigue, on patients. In this review we provide a practical overview of diagnosis and management of ET with focus on challenging patient scenarios and some consideration of what comprehensive care might entail. Finally, we also discuss newer therapies and how these might be assessed.

### Primary and secondary thrombocytosis in childhood [^1128Rs92]. British Journal of Haematology (2005). Low credibility.

This review summarizes current data on the pathomechanisms and clinical aspects of primary and secondary thrombocytosis in childhood. Primary thrombocytosis is extremely rare in childhood, mostly diagnosed at the beginning of the second decade of life. As in adults, the criteria of the Polycythemia Vera Group are appropriate to diagnose primary thrombocytosis. The pathomechansims of non-familial forms are complex and include spontaneous formation of megakaryopoietic progenitors and increased sensitivity to thrombopoietin (Tpo). Familial forms can be caused by mutations in Tpo or Tpo receptor (c-mpl) genes. These mutations result in overexpression of Tpo, sustained intracellular signalling or disturbed regulation of circulating Tpo. Treatment of primary thrombocytosis is not recommended if platelet counts are < 1500/nl and bleeding or thrombosis did not occur in patient's history. In severe cases, decision on treatment should weigh potential risks of treatment options (hydroxyurea, anagrelide) against expected benefits for preventing thrombosis or haemorrhage. Secondary thrombocytosis is frequent in children, in particular in the first decade of life. Hepatic Tpo production is stimulated in acute response reaction to a variety of disorders. Thrombosis prophylaxis is not required, even at platelet counts > 1000/nl, except for cases with additional prothrombotic risk factors.

### How we diagnose and treat essential thrombocythaemia [^115xfPuR]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

The approach to the diagnosis and management of essential thrombocythaemia (ET) is steadily changing, influenced by advances in molecular biology, data from clinical trials and retrospective analyses of patient cohorts. In the past decade options for clinical management largely remain unchanged, but who we treat, and with what target in mind, is evolving. A further area of change is recognition of symptoms that may be associated with ET, as well as other myeloproliferative neoplasms, and that potential options for their management are becoming available. Judicious and careful diagnosis is increasingly a fundamental key to successful management followed by cytoreductive therapy in a subset of patients. In this review we demonstrate our management strategies for ET using a case-based format.

### Advances in understanding the pathogenesis of familial thrombocythaemia [^115oeen5]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Familial thrombocytosis can be divided into two broad categories. The first includes inherited syndromes that affect only the megakaryocytic lineage with Mendelian inheritance, high penetrance and polyclonal haematopoiesis. The second category includes inherited predisposition to true Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and is characterized by low penetrance, clonal haematopoiesis and presence of somatic mutations such as JAK2 V617F. It must be underlined that these two categories represent two well separate entities, with different patterns of proliferation and different transmission modalities. This review will focus on the molecular pathogenesis of hereditary thrombocytosis, underlining those clinical pictures that are specifically associated with mutations in the genes of thrombopoietin or in its receptor. Moreover, we propose an approach for the diagnosis and therapy of these syndromes.

### Essential thrombocythemia [^112k81Zq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on essential thrombocythemia:

- **Definition**: ET is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal proliferation of megakaryocytes leading to sustained thrombocytosis (platelets ≥ 450×10⁹/L). The disease most often results from driver mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL and manifests with increased thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk, vasomotor symptoms, and, less frequently, progression to myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia.
- **Pathophysiology**: ET results from constitutive activation of cytokine signaling, most frequently through the JAK2V617F mutation, found in about 60% of patients, or through CALR or MPL mutations, found in about 20–25% and 3–4%, respectively. These driver mutations stimulate uncontrolled megakaryocytic proliferation and platelet production. Additional mutations in genes such as ASXL1, TET2, DNMT3A, SF3B1, or TP53 can influence disease behavior and risk of progression. Abnormal interactions between activated platelets and the vascular endothelium contribute to thrombotic events, while very high platelet counts may cause acquired von Willebrand syndrome and bleeding.
- **Epidemiology**: ET has an incidence of about 1.5–2 cases per 100,000 persons each year and is most common in older adults, though up to one fifth of patients are diagnosed before the age of 40. Women are slightly more often affected than men. It accounts for about one third of all myeloproliferative neoplasms. About 10–15% of patients lack detectable mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL and are referred to as triple-negative.
- **Risk factors**: The primary risk factors for ET include age and genetic predisposition.
- **Disease course**: The disease often remains stable for many years but can be interrupted by vascular complications. Thrombosis is the most frequent cause of morbidity, occurring in about 15–20% of patients, especially in those > 60 years or carrying a JAK2 mutation. Hemorrhagic events may occur, particularly in the setting of extreme thrombocytosis. Progression to post-ET myelofibrosis occurs in about 5–10% of cases, and transformation to acute leukemia in less than 2% over ten years. Median survival is about 18–20 years overall and exceeds 30 years in younger individuals. Prognostic models such as the triple A system, which considers age, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts, or mutationally enhanced models that include adverse mutations, help stratify outcomes. Triple-negative disease generally has the most favorable prognosis.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Life expectancy in ET is somewhat reduced compared with the general population but remains substantially better than in other myeloproliferative neoplasms such as polycythemia vera or myelofibrosis. Median survival is approximately 18 years but can exceed 35 years in younger patients. Adverse prognostic factors include advanced age, leukocytosis, abnormal karyotype, and mutations in SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, or TP53. Patients with CALR type 2 mutations or triple-negative status have the lowest risk of thrombosis and longest survival, whereas those with CALR type 1 or MPL mutations are more prone to fibrotic transformation. The major therapeutic focus remains prevention of thrombosis and close monitoring for disease progression.

### Recognition of thrombotic risk of thrombocytosis in iron deficiency [^111ZDgo5]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite the overwhelming preponderance of published evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of intravenous iron, reluctance to its use among practitioners prevails due to heightened concerns of danger fomented, at least in part, by misinformation and misinterpretation of the incidence and clinical nature of serious adverse events occurring in recipients of this treatment. The convincing evidence brought forth from these well-performed in vitro experiments and animal models provides information not only on a long-sought physiological mechanism for a commonly observed clinical event but more importantly on the need to heighten the awareness of a readily prescribed treatment modality which mitigates its occurrence.

Current understanding of ITP's primary and secondary forms and the effect of diverse defects in immune self tolerance that result in the development of antiplatelet antibodies is described. This overview is followed by a narrative list of other articles in this issue on topics ranging from a comprehensive review of the role of antiplatelet antibodies in platelet destruction and production to a review of classic treatment modalities and newer approaches to initial treatment.

### Thrombocytosis in the NICU [^114qxXds]. Neurocritical Care (2008). Low credibility.

An elevated platelet count may occur during care of neurology/neurosurgical patients and is usually due to reactive or secondary thrombocytosis (ST) caused by inflammation or infection. Primary (clonal) thrombocythemia or essential thrombocythemia associated with myeloproliferative disorders is usually known before or during early patient assessment. Rarely, paraneoplastic causes of thrombocytosis may be discovered. Although no single test differentiates primary from secondary etiologies, laboratory tests that show increased acute phase responses, such as C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and interleukin-6, may be useful in diagnosing ST. Thrombosis due to ST is rare in any platelet count. ST, however, should be considered within the overall risk assessment for thromboembolism in any patient. If treatment is initiated, low-dose aspirin is sufficient.

### Outcomes of patients with preoperative thrombocytosis after hip fracture surgery [^112f6sq6]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As the population ages and the incidence of hip fractures increases, it is prudent to understand preoperative markers that predispose patients to adverse postoperative events. The incidence of thrombocytosis in this surgical hip fracture population was 1.2%, which is within the 0.4 to 1.7% range of rates in arthroplasty patients. This study found that preoperative thrombocytosis was associated with increased rates of 30-day mortality, unplanned revision surgery, readmission, VTE, and infections after hip fracture surgery.

While the etiology of thrombocytosis was unknown, reactive thrombocytosis is the leading cause of thrombocytosis in the general medical population and usually occurs as a result of an acute phase response to infection or tissue damage. Prior studies found that infected patients may present with thrombocytosis even in the absence of other more obvious signs of infection such as an elevated white blood cell count or fever. In agreement with the literature in other patient populations, our findings suggest that thrombocytosis may be a clinical indicator of postoperative infection risk in hip fracture patients. After excluding all patients with preoperative infections and controlling for patient characteristics and comorbidities including white blood cell count, preoperative thrombocytosis was associated with increased odds of having any postoperative infection (OR 1.42 [95% CI 1.13 to 1.79], P = 0.003).

### Neonatal thrombocytosis following G-CSF treatment [^113UVCzN]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is defined as an elevation of the platelet count to more than 500,000/mm³. Primary thrombocytosis rarely occurs in the pediatric age group and is usually caused by a clonal bone marrow disorder. The more common phenomenon is secondary thrombocytosis which is a reactive process. Table 1 lists the main causes of secondary thrombocytosis. Complications of severe thrombocytosis include bleeding and thromboses. Unless additional risk factors are present, secondary thrombocytosis is not associated with a significant risk of thromboembolic events, regardless of the degree of elevation of the platelet count. The aim of this case report is to add a new possible cause of neonatal thrombocytosis.

### Inherited thrombocytopenias: history, advances and perspectives [^114fGXu6]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Over the last 100 years the role of platelets in hemostatic events and their production by megakaryocytes have gradually been defined. Progressively, thrombocytopenia was recognized as a cause of bleeding, first through an acquired immune disorder; then, since 1948, when Bernard-Soulier syndrome was first described, inherited thrombocytopenia became a fascinating example of Mendelian disease. The platelet count is often severely decreased and platelet size variable; associated platelet function defects frequently aggravate bleeding. Macrothrombocytopenia with variable proportions of enlarged platelets is common. The number of circulating platelets will depend on platelet production, consumption and lifespan. The bulk of macrothrombocytopenias arise from defects in megakaryopoiesis with causal variants in transcription factor genes giving rise to altered stem cell differentiation and changes in early megakaryocyte development and maturation. Genes encoding surface receptors, cytoskeletal and signaling proteins also feature prominently and Sanger sequencing associated with careful phenotyping has allowed their early classification. It quickly became apparent that many inherited thrombocytopenias are syndromic while others are linked to an increased risk of hematologic malignancies. In the last decade, the application of next-generation sequencing, including whole exome sequencing, and the use of gene platforms for rapid testing have greatly accelerated the discovery of causal genes and extended the list of variants in more common disorders. Genes linked to an increased platelet turnover and apoptosis have also been identified. The current challenges are now to use next-generation sequencing in first-step screening and to define bleeding risk and treatment better.

### Iron and platelets: a subtle, under-recognized relationship [^114RQcfE]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

The role of iron in the formation and functioning of erythrocytes, and to a lesser degree of white blood cells, is well established, but the relationship between iron and platelets is less documented. Physiologically, iron plays an important role in hematopoiesis, including thrombopoiesis; iron levels direct, together with genetic factors, the lineage commitment of megakaryocytic/erythroid progenitors toward either megakaryocyte or erythroid progenitors. Megakaryocytic iron contributes to cellular machinery, especially energy production in platelet mitochondria. Thrombocytosis, possibly favoring vascular thrombosis, is a classical feature observed with abnormally low total body iron stores (mainly due to blood losses or decreased duodenal iron intake), but thrombocytopenia can also occur in severe iron deficiency anemia. Iron sequestration, as seen in inflammatory conditions, can be associated with early thrombocytopenia due to platelet consumption and followed by reactive replenishment of the platelet pool with possibility of thrombocytosis. Iron overload of genetic origin (hemochromatosis), despite expected mitochondrial damage related to ferroptosis, has not been reported to cause thrombocytopenia (except in case of high degree of hepatic fibrosis), and iron-related alteration of platelet function is still a matter of debate. In acquired iron overload (of transfusional and/or dyserythropoiesis origin), quantitative or qualitative platelet changes are difficult to attribute to iron alone due to the interference of the underlying hematological conditions; likewise, hematological improvement, including increased blood platelet counts, observed under iron oral chelation is likely to reflect mechanisms other than the sole beneficial impact of iron depletion.

### Outcomes of patients with preoperative thrombocytosis after hip fracture surgery [^1159St3p]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This research provides the initial report of the risks associated with preoperative thrombocytosis in the orthopaedic trauma literature. The incidence of thrombocytosis in the surgical hip fracture population was 1.2% and was associated with increased rates of mortality compared with patients with normal platelet counts. Our findings suggest that hip fracture patients with preoperative thrombocytosis have an increased risk of readmission, unplanned revision surgery, VTE, and postoperative infections after controlling for patient characteristics and comorbidities. A patient with thrombocytosis may benefit from close postoperative surveillance, consideration of possible concomitant infectious conditions, and careful follow-up. Future prospective studies are needed to verify causation and investigate how to mitigate adverse outcomes in hip fracture patients with preoperative thrombocytosis.

### Thrombocytopenia in cancer patients [^1173Koum]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a frequent complication of cancer and its treatment. The causes of thrombocytopenia in cancer patients can be diverse and multifactorial. Systemic chemotherapy is the most frequent cause of thrombocytopenia. The degree and duration thrombocytopenia depends upon whether the chemotherapeutic treatment is myeloablative, as used in stem cell transplants, or non-myeloablative, as typically used in solid non-hematologic malignancies. Additional causes of significant thrombocytopenia include tumor involvement of bone marrow and spleen; microangiopathic disorders such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or hemolytic uremia syndrome. Lymphoproliferative malignancies can also be associated with secondary immune thrombocytopenia. Due to the broad differential diagnosis associated with cancer related thrombocytopenia, a careful diagnostic evaluation is indicated. The goal of treatment should be to maintain a safe platelet count to allow effective treatment of the underlying malignancy, prevent bleeding complications and to minimize the use of platelet product transfusion.

### How I treat polycythemia vera [^116UaRBV]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Since its discovery, polycythemia vera (PV) has challenged clinicians responsible for its diagnosis and management and scientists investigating its pathogenesis. As a clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) disorder, PV is a neoplasm but its driver mutations result in overproduction of morphologically and functionally normal blood cells. PV arises in an HSC but it can present initially as isolated erythrocytosis, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, or any combination of these together with splenomegaly or myelofibrosis, and it can take years for a true panmyelopathy to appear. PV shares the same JAK2 mutation as essential thrombocytosis and primary myelofibrosis, but erythrocytosis only occurs in PV. However, unlike secondary causes of erythrocytosis, in PV, the plasma volume is frequently expanded, masking the erythrocytosis and making diagnosis difficult if this essential fact is ignored. PV is not a monolithic disorder: female patients deregulate fewer genes and clinically behave differently than their male counterparts, while some PV patients are genetically predisposed to an aggressive clinical course. Nevertheless, based on what we have learned over the past century, most PV patients can lead long and productive lives. In this review, using clinical examples, I describe how I diagnose and manage PV in an evidence-based manner without relying on chemotherapy.

### Pediatric extreme thrombocytosis: etiology, management, and outcomes [^112MuYup]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Extreme thrombocytosis (EXT) is defined as a platelet count > 1000×10⁹/L. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the etiology, management, and outcome of pediatric patients with EXT, focusing on thrombotic complications.

Study Design

We conducted a retrospective study at a large tertiary center, examining cases of pediatric EXT identified from electronic medical records over a 5-year period. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory data were reviewed. Additionally, the underlying etiology was documented for each case, and follow-up information was analyzed, including platelet count trends and thrombotic events within three months post-EXT.

Results

Among 204 patients with EXT, 98% were secondary thrombocytosis, predominantly attributed to infections and inflammatory conditions. EXT prevailed among infants (median age 1.3 years), with 67% aged 3 years or younger. Thrombotic events occurred in 10 cases (4.9%), primarily related to central venous lines or other risk factors rather than elevated platelet counts alone. Aspirin prophylaxis was uncommon, administered in 14% of patients, mainly in those with existing comorbidities.

Conclusions

Secondary EXT in pediatric patients is commonly associated with infections and persists for up to 2 months in many cases. While EXT alone may not significantly increase thrombotic risk, it may contribute to risk in patients with additional predisposing factors, such as central venous line. Further prospective studies are warranted to clarify thrombotic risk in children with EXT and evaluate the potential benefit of antithrombotic prophylaxis.

### An unusual case of extreme thrombocytosis caused by iron deficiency [^116Dsjse]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency is a common cause of reactive thrombocytosis resulting in usually mild to moderately increased but sometimes even in extreme thrombocytosis (ie, > 1000×10⁹/L). We report a case of a 34-year-old woman who developed an increased platelet count of 1953×10⁹/L. Upon admission, cytoreductive therapy was initiated until an underlying chronic myeloproliferative neoplasia was ruled out. The patient had undergone bariatric surgery 5 years previously, and surprisingly, a diagnosis of reactive thrombocytosis due to iron deficiency secondary to iron malabsorption was made. It is concluded that the degree of extreme thrombocytosis may be even fourfold to fivefold increased in patients with severe iron deficiency. Our finding emphasises the importance of regular control of possible need for iron supplementation following bariatric surgery.

### Reevaluating thrombocytosis as a risk factor in free flap surgery: does timing matter? [^114WErkU]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thrombocytosis, defined as a platelet count > 400,000, has been implicated as a risk factor in free flap failure. Despite proposed mechanisms of pedicle thrombosis, recent studies have suggested that thrombocytosis has no effect on free tissue transfer viability. Risk factors that may compromise successful free tissue transfer should be understood and elucidated, with particular attention to thrombocytosis and its conflicting evidence in the literature. We hypothesize that thrombocytosis has no bearing on free flap success or the rates of pedicle thrombosis.

Methods

Our institution performed a retrospective chart review on all patients who underwent free flap reconstruction over the past 6 years. Patient demographics, medical history, type and location of free tissue transfer, preoperative platelets, postoperative platelets, and flap outcomes and complications (wound dehiscence, infection, hematoma, seroma, and need for blood transfusion) were recorded. Independent t test, Mann-Whitney U tests, χ² test, and Fisher exact tests were used to determine P values to compare flap outcomes in patients with thrombocytosis (platelet count > 400,000) and those with platelet counts less than 400,000.

Results

In our 502-patient cohort, 71 were found to have a platelet count > 400,000 (35 preoperatively and 36 postoperatively) and 431 patients had platelet counts < 400,000. There were 42 reconstructive failures (flap success rate of 91.6%) and 111 returns to the operating room (OR). For patients with postoperative thrombocytosis, 24 flaps returned to the OR (44.4%), whereas in patients without thrombocytosis, 87 flaps returned to the OR (19.4%; P < 0.001). In patients with postoperative thrombocytosis, 10 OR returns were due to pedicle venous thrombosis (18.5%), in comparison to 10 returns for venous thrombosis in those with normal platelets (2.2%; P < 0.001). There was a small difference in free flap success rates between those with postoperative thrombocytosis and normal platelets, 88.7% versus 92.11%; however, this was not statistically significant (P = 0.71). The thrombocytosis group had a higher incidence of overall postoperative complications (P = 0.002).

Conclusions

Thrombocytosis has historically been cited as a risk factor for free flap reconstruction failure with recent conflicting evidence in the literature. In patients with postoperative thrombocytosis, we found an increased risk of venous thrombosis; however, this did not result in increased flap failure. There was an increase in postoperative complications, which corresponds with National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data reported in the literature. We suspect that thrombocytosis is not a harbinger of free flap failure but rather a marker for overall inflammation, which may confer a higher rate of venous thrombosis requiring reoperation and postoperative complications.

### Analysis of platelet count and new cancer diagnosis over a 10-year period [^116yS7mA]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Patients with cancer often have an abnormally high platelet count at the time of diagnosis (thrombocytosis), defined as a platelet count greater than 450 × 10⁹/L (to convert to ×10³ per microliter, divide by 1.0). A normal platelet count falls between 150 and 450 × 10⁹/L and varies with the age and sex of the individual. Several conditions that commonly cause an elevated platelet count include acute blood loss, infection, and inflammation. Solid tumor cancers can sometimes lead to an elevated platelet count to the extent that an undiagnosed cancer is often considered in the diagnostic workup of a patient with thrombocytosis. Cancer is believed to induce platelet formation through the release of interleukin 6, a proinflammatory cytokine that stimulates the production of thrombopoietin hormone. Elevated levels of thrombopoietin have a direct effect on increased platelet production. Excess levels of thrombopoietin in the blood stimulate megakaryocyte cell division in the bone marrow, which in turn leads to platelet formation.

An elevated platelet count has been shown to be associated with short-term risk of cancer in the general population. Prospective studies evaluating platelet count and survival among patients with newly diagnosed cancer have also noted a high proportion of patients who presented with thrombocytosis. The excess risk associated with an elevated platelet count varies by cancer site but has been most studied for lung, colon, and gastric cancers. The full range of cancers associated with a high platelet count and whether risks associated with platelet counts within the high-normal range exist remain unclear. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the association between a high platelet count and cancer is transient or prolonged. Based on results of previous studies, a high platelet count may be a risk factor for developing cancer or, alternatively, a marker indicative of an undetected cancer. It is also not clear whether an increasing platelet count is a better indicator of a new cancer than is a high but steady platelet count.

We identified a cohort of adult residents in Ontario, Canada, who had 1 or more routine blood tests performed for a complete blood count (CBC) including platelet counts and subsequently received a diagnosis of cancer to assess the range of cancers associated with a high platelet count. We also examined whether an increasing platelet count is associated with an increased cancer risk.

The last four years have seen an explosion in our understanding of the myeloproliferative neoplasms. Important and often unexpected insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for these disorders have been accompanied by the development of new diagnostic tests and by an improved understanding of the relationship between the different disease entities. This review will focus on recent developments in the pathogenesis and management of essential thrombocythemia with a particular emphasis on its phenotypic overlap with polycythemia vera and primary myelofibrosis.

### Iron deficiency alters megakaryopoiesis and platelet phenotype independent of thrombopoietin [^111wF6yR]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is a common cause of reactive thrombocytosis, however, the exact pathways have not been revealed. Here we aimed to study the mechanisms behind iron deficiency-induced thrombocytosis. Within few weeks, iron-depleted diet caused iron deficiency in young Sprague-Dawley rats, as reflected by a drop in hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, hepatic iron content and hepcidin mRNA in the liver. Thrombocytosis established in parallel. Moreover, platelets produced in iron deficient animals displayed a higher mean platelet volume and increased aggregation. Bone marrow studies revealed subtle alterations that are suggestive of expansion of megakaryocyte progenitors, an increase in megakaryocyte ploidy and accelerated megakaryocyte differentiation. Iron deficiency did not alter the production of hematopoietic growth factors such as thrombopoietin, interleukin 6 or interleukin 11. Megakaryocytic cell lines grown in iron-depleted conditions exhibited reduced proliferation but increased ploidy and cell size. Our data suggest that iron deficiency increases megakaryopoietic differentiation and alters platelet phenotype without changes in megakaryocyte growth factors, specifically TPO. Iron deficiency-induced thrombocytosis may have evolved to maintain or increase the coagulation capacity in conditions with chronic bleeding.

### Step up to the platelet: role of platelets in inflammation and infection [^112wT7MR]. Thrombosis Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Platelets are anucleated cells derived from megakaryocytes that are primarily responsible for hemostasis. However, in recent years, these cytoplasts have become increasingly recognized as immune cells, able to detect, interact with, and kill pathogens. As platelets are involved in both immunity and coagulation, they have a central role in immunothrombosis, a physiological process in which immune cells induce the formation of microthrombi to both prevent the spread of pathogens, and to help facilitate clearance. In this review, we will highlight the role of platelets as key players in the inflammatory and innate immune response against bacterial and viral infection, including direct and indirect interactions with pathogens and other immune cells.

### Personalized management of essential thrombocythemia-application of recent evidence to clinical practice [^116zsuqa]. Leukemia (2013). Low credibility.

Concluding remarks

The main objectives of the current perspective are to underscore the prognostic relevance of distinguishing WHO-defined ET from early/prefibrotic MF and to increase awareness regarding the relatively high risk of residual thrombosis in certain group of patients with WHO-defined ET. We believe that these issues constitute actionable challenges and need to be ultimately evaluated in prospective controlled studies. Our recommendations outlined in Figure 1 are neither binding nor absolute. They are simply there to assist those who seek our opinion.

### How useful is thrombocytosis in predicting an underlying cancer in primary care? a systematic review [^113JpkGG]. Family Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Although the association between raised platelet count (thrombocytosis) and cancer has been reported in primary and secondary care studies, UK GPs are unaware of it, and it is insufficiently evidenced for laboratories to identify and warn of it. This systematic review aimed to identify and collate evidence from studies that have investigated thrombocytosis as an early marker of cancer in primary care.

Methods

EMBASE (OvidSP), Medline (Ovid), Web of Science and The Cochrane Library were searched for relevant studies. Eligible studies had reported estimates of the association between thrombocytosis and cancer, in adults aged ≥ 40 in a primary care setting. Raw data from included studies were used to calculate positive predictive values and likelihood ratios (LRs) for cancer.

Results

Nine case-control studies were identified. Study quality was judged to be high. Included studies reported on the following cancer sites: colorectal, lung, ovary, bladder, kidney, pancreas, oesophago-gastric, uterus and breast. LRs indicated that thrombocytosis was a predictor of cancer in all sites except breast. In a consulting population, thrombocytosis is most highly predictive of lung and colorectal cancer.

Conclusions

These results suggest that patients with thrombocytosis in primary care have an increased risk of cancer, and that some, but not all, cancers have raised platelets as an early marker. This finding is expected to be of use in primary care, for GPs receiving blood test results unexpectedly showing high platelet counts. Further research is needed to identify the cancers that are most strongly associated with thrombocytosis.

### Unmet need in essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera [^1154WVvq]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Consensus guidelines have helped to standardize the care of patients with essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera, focusing on reducing the risk of thrombosis, mitigating symptoms, and avoiding therapies that may accelerate disease progression. However, many unmet needs still exist ranging from the roll of antiplatelet therapy in ET to medications that reduce disease progression. Retrospective studies suggest an improvement in myelofibrosis-free survival for treatment with interferons; new agents are looking to also enact disease modification.

Classic inherited thrombocytopenias

We begin with a series of named inherited thrombocytopenias whose characterization has marked the history of inherited platelet disorders. In many of these syndromes, thrombocytopenia, defined as a platelet count < 150×10⁹/L, is accompanied by platelet function defects that aggravate bleeding. In early studies genotyping mostly involved candidate gene sequencing and linkage studies.

### Extreme thrombocytosis is associated with critical illness and young age, but not increased thrombotic risk, in hospitalized pediatric patients [^117W5qbk]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Extreme thrombocytosis (EXT, platelet count > 1000 × 10³/μL) is an uncommon but potentially clinically significant finding. Primary EXT in the setting of myeloproliferative disorders is linked to thrombotic and/or bleeding complications more frequently than secondary EXT, which typically occurs in reaction to infection, inflammation, or iron deficiency. However, comorbidities have been reported in adults with secondary EXT. Clinical implications of EXT in children are not well defined, as prior studies targeted small and/or specialized pediatric populations.

Objectives

Our objectives were to determine etiologies and sequelae of EXT in a hospitalized general pediatric patient population.

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively analyzed EXT cases from a single-center pediatric cohort of ~80 000 patients over 8 years.

Results

Virtually all cases (99.8%) were secondary in nature, and most were multifactorial. Many cases of EXT occurred in children under 2 years old (47%) and/or during critical illness (55%). No thrombotic or bleeding events directly resulted from EXT, confirming a paucity of clinical complications associated with EXT in pediatric patients. There were indications that neonatal hematopoiesis and individual genetic variation influenced some cases, in addition to certain diagnoses (eg, sickle cell anemia) and clinical contexts (eg, asplenia).

Conclusion

Our findings confirm that thrombotic events related to EXT are rare in pediatric patients, which can inform the use of empiric anti-platelet therapy.

### How I treat essential thrombocythemia [^111LPFSa]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is an indolent myeloproliferative neoplasm that may be complicated by vascular events, including both thrombosis and bleeding. This disorder may also transform into more aggressive myeloid neoplasms, in particular into myelofibrosis. The identification of somatic mutations of JAK2, CALR, or MPL, found in about 90% of patients, has considerably improved the diagnostic approach to this disorder. Genomic profiling also holds the potential to improve prognostication and, more generally, clinical decision-making because the different driver mutations are associated with distinct clinical features. Prevention of vascular events has been so far the main objective of therapy, and continues to be extremely important in the management of patients with ET. Low-dose aspirin and cytoreductive drugs can be administered to this purpose, with cytoreductive treatment being primarily given to patients at high risk of vascular complications. Currently used cytoreductive drugs include hydroxyurea, mainly used in older patients, and interferon α, primarily given to younger patients. There is a need for disease-modifying drugs that can eradicate clonal hematopoiesis and/or prevent progression to more aggressive myeloid neoplasms, especially in younger patients. In this article, we use a case-based discussion format to illustrate our approach to diagnosis and treatment of ET.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^113C8ws9]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Should we treat iron deficiency without anaemia?

A normal haemoglobin level does not exclude iron deficiency. In fact, the WHO recognises that 'mild' anaemia (haemoglobin 110–119/129 g.l −1) is a misnomer, as iron deficiency is already advanced by the time anaemia is detected, and has consequences even when anaemia is not clinically apparent 18.

Non‐anaemic patients with reduced or absent iron stores may have symptoms such as fatigue or reduced exercise tolerance, as iron is required for optimal mitochondrial function, and is essential for respiration and energy production 40, 74. Current guidelines do not recommend routine iron screening in the absence of anaemia. However, the benefits of oral or i.v. iron replacement for non‐anaemic iron deficiency‐associated fatigue have been demonstrated in menstruating women, runners and blood donors 75, 76, 77, 78.

In congestive heart failure, a frequent comorbidity among surgical patients, non‐anaemic iron deficiency was independently associated with compromised physical performance and quality of life, and an increase in all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality; treatment of non‐anaemic iron deficiency with i.v. iron may improve functional status within four weeks, and reduces hospitalisations for cardiovascular reasons and mortality 79, 80. In addition, improvements are maintained after 24 and 52 weeks 79, 80, 81.

In observational studies of patients undergoing abdominal or cardiac surgery, pre‐operative non‐anaemic iron deficiency was associated with poor outcomes, including: increased rates of postoperative infection; transfusion; fatigue; and prolonged hospital stay 82, 83, 84. Although it is presently unknown whether pre‐operative correction of non‐anaemic iron deficiency may offset the excess of risk of postoperative complications, some guidelines recommend peri‐operative iron supplementation for patients with non‐anaemic iron deficiency 14, 85.

Secondary thrombocytosis can also be seen after major surgery, as platelets behave as an acute phase reactant. Iron deficiency has also been shown to induce secondary thrombocytosis in several clinical settings. Correction of iron deficiency usually lowers platelet count and platelet activation in patients with chronic kidney disease, cancer or inflammatory bowel disease‐associated secondary thrombocytosis, and may contribute to reduced risk of thrombo embolic events 86, 87, 88, 89.

### A critical review of anagrelide therapy in essential thrombocythemia and related disorders [^112ihog9]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2005). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is a common clinical problem and it represents either a primary myeloid disorder (a clonal process) or a reactive phenomenon. While reactive thrombocytosis is often inconsequential, clonal thrombocytosis may require cytoreductive therapy to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications. In this regard, a controlled clinical trial has previously demonstrated the efficacy of hydroxyurea in reducing the risk of thrombosis in high-risk patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Despite the absence of similar evidence for clinical benefit, the platelet-lowering agent anagrelide has been widely used in both ET and polycythemia vera (PV) and recent reports of serious side-effects suggest that such practice might be detrimental to patients. In the current review we provide basic drug information as well as a critical assessment of anagrelide treatment in ET and related disorders.

### Thrombocytosis after trauma: incidence, aetiology, and clinical significance [^114JfLcy]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Our aim was to assess the occurrence, aetiology, and clinical significance of a platelet count greater than 600 × 10³/mm³ in trauma patients.

Methods

All trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) during a 13-month period were prospectively studied. Platelet counts were performed daily. We recorded the patient's age, sex, nature of trauma, severity of illness scores, episodes of infections in the ICU, acute lung injury, bleeding, and thromboembolic events. Patients with thrombocytosis were also followed during their hospital stay and 1 month after hospital discharge.

Results

A total of 176 patients were included. Thrombocytosis developed in 36 patients (20.4%) at a mean (sd) time of 14.0 (4.0) days and the platelet count normalized 35.0 (13.0) days after admission to the ICU. All patients with thrombocytosis had one or more possible predisposing conditions before the occurrence of thrombocytosis: nosocomial infection occurred in 30 patients (83%), acute lung injury in 17 (47%), bleeding in 27 (75%), and administration of cathecholamines in 24 (67%). Three venous thromboembolic complications occurred in the ICU (1.7%) and one during follow-up. Only one patient presented thrombocytosis at the time of diagnosis. Despite the fact that patients with thrombocytosis had a greater severity of illness, the ICU mortality was comparable among patients with and without thrombocytosis (8 vs 14%, P = 0.34).

Conclusions

Reactive thrombocytosis is a common finding after severe trauma and was found to be associated with a better survival than predicted by severity of illness score. Unless additional risk factors are present, reactive thrombocytosis is not associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events.

### Applied genomics in MPN presentation [^111dyEHL]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are grouped together as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) because of shared clinical, pathologic, and molecular features. The 2005 discovery of the driver mutation JAK2V617F, found in more than 70% of individuals with MPNs and 98% of those with PV, has transformed the diagnosis and management of MPNs. Although PV is the most common phenotype associated with JAK2V617F, roughly 60% of individuals with ET or PMF also have the mutation, and JAK2V617F is now recognized as a common lesion in clonal hematopoiesis (CH). JAK2V617F+ CH and MPN are indolent disorders that evolve over time, with transitions to different disease phases, transformation to bone marrow failure or leukemia, and high thrombosis rates. Genomic assessment has taken center stage as an important tool to define disease phenotype, disease burden, prognosis, and even thrombosis risk of MPNs. Genomics has also unveiled the causes and factors that modify the risk of acquiring and expanding CH and MPNs and points to new pathways for targeted therapies to treat and ultimately prevent them. Genomic assessment of patients with MPNs, like other cancers, enables the clinician to capitalize on large population data sets to inform the individual patient of risk, identify treatment, and improve outcomes.

### Recognition of thrombotic risk of thrombocytosis in iron deficiency [^116TddQZ]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Further corroborating evidence pointing to iron-restricted erythropoiesis resulting in reactive thrombocytosis and thrombosis was derived from a recently published study describing the rate, predictors, and thrombotic complications of thrombocytosis in patients with irondeficiency anemia. Utilizing queries of an institutional database containing clinical information on more than six million patients over a 40-year time period (1979–2019), supported by extensive manual chart reviews, thrombocytosis was observed in 32.6% of patients with iron-deficiency anemia, in whom 15.8% developed thrombotic complications. In contrast, thromboses occurred in 7.8% of those with iron deficiency but without thrombocytosis (Figure 1).

The etiological explanation for why iron-restricted erythropoiesis increases hypercoagulability has remained somewhat obscure. In this issue of Haematologica, Jimenez and colleagues describe an animal model of iron deficiency, using Sprague-Dawley rats, which could offer unique opportunities to explore multiple pathophysiological mechanisms for thrombocytosis and venous thrombogenesis. Furthermore, using sensitive histological and sophisticated high-frequency ultrasound techniques, the investigators were able to track the development and progression of thrombus formation. They were then able to correlate those changes with the generation of ex vivo biomarkers of platelet activation and indicators of global hemostasis. The potential use of this rat model to detect important targets that could be exploited therapeutically to mitigate the association of iron deficiency with thrombocytosis and thromboembolism is promising and encouraging.

In their elegant description of iron deficiency-induced augmentation of coagulability on thromboelastography and hemostasis following rat tail resection, prominent correlates of increased platelet adhesion and aggregation were clearly described. Using in vitro assays of platelet aggregation, the authors were able to postulate that not only is platelet activation an ongoing process in inflammatory conditions but in iron deficiency as well. Importantly, given the frequent comorbidity of iron deficiency with a number of clinical conditions with known thrombotic risk such as inflammatory bowel disease and cancer, this animal model clearly demonstrates that iron deficiency alone increases thrombotic tendency, consistent with the findings of aforementioned human studies. Perhaps even more importantly, treatment with ferric carboxymaltose (an intravenous iron formulation) reversed the prothrombotic changes in the rats, including thrombocytosis, changes in platelet function, and iron deficiency- associated increases in thrombus size in both venous and arterial models of thrombosis.

### Tumor cell-released kynurenine biases MEP differentiation into megakaryocytes in individuals with cancer by activating AhR-RUNX1 [^111R552q]. Nature Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Main

Thrombocytosis and erythrocytopenia are common consequences of abnormal hematopoiesis in individuals with advanced cancer. Enhanced megakaryopoiesis increases platelet (PLT) numbers, which potentially induces thrombogenesis and tumor cell metastasis in individuals with cancer –. Simultaneously, erythrocytopenia occurs, which causes anemia and exacerbates tumor hypoxia. Both anemia and thrombogenesis mark poor prognosis in various types of cancers. Despite the important roles of erythrocytopenia and thrombocytosis in tumor progression, metastasis and treatment resistance, the molecular mechanisms of erythrocytopenia and thrombocytosis formation remain largely unclear. Notably, PLTs and erythrocytes are differentiated from the common megakaryocytic–erythroid progenitor cells (MEPs). Many transcription factors, such as GATA binding protein 1 (GATA1), GATA2, Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1 (TAL1), friend leukemia integration 1 (FLI1), MYB and Krueppel-like factor 1 (KLF1), are involved in megakaryocytic–erythroid differentiation –. RUNX1 and GATA1 are pivotal for megakaryocytic and erythroid differentiation, respectively. Despite physiological regulation, little is known about how tumor-derived factors disrupt normal MEP differentiation and cause erythrocytopenia and thrombocytosis.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a member of the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors, plays an essential role in a wide variety of cells, including hematopoietic progenitor cells. Notably, defects in PLT number and function have been observed in Ahr -null mice; however, the AhR inhibitor stemregenin 1 (SR1) may promote erythropoiesis from human embryonic stem cells, suggesting that AhR possibly regulates megakaryocytic–erythroid differentiation. As a cytoplasmic transcription factor, AhR can be activated by exogenous xenobiotics, such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p -dioxin, and endogenous metabolites, including kynurenine (Kyn). Our previous studies have demonstrated that both tumor cells and immune cells mobilize the tryptophan–Kyn–AhR circuitry to dampen antitumor immunity, and high levels of Kyn are present in the peripheral blood of individuals with cancer. Based on these lines of information, we hypothesized that in individuals with cancer, Kyn is mobilized to trigger thrombocytosis and erythrocytopenia by activating AhR.

### Platelets and infections in the resource-limited countries with a focus on malaria and viral haemorrhagic fevers [^1146pw1v]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Infections continue to cause a high incidence of mortality and morbidity in resource-poor nations. Although antimicrobial therapy has aided mostly in dealing with the pathogenic micro-organisms themselves, the collateral damage caused by the infections continue to cause many deaths. Intensive care support and manipulation of the hosts' abnormal response to the infection have helped to improve mortality in well-resourced countries. But, in those areas with limited resources, this is not yet the case and simpler methods of diagnosis and interventions are required. Thrombocytopenia is one of the most common manifestations in all these infections and may be used as an easily available prognostic indicator and marker for the severity of the infections. In this review, the relevance of platelets in infections in general, and specifically to tropical infections, malaria, and viral haemorrhagic fevers in the emerging countries is discussed. Better understanding of the pathophysiology and the role of platelets in particular in such conditions is likely to translate into better patient care and thus reduce morbidity and mortality.

### Isolated congenital asplenia: an overlooked cause of thrombocytosis [^1166mbw3]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

After exclusion of all causes of reactive thrombocytosis, a new platelet count should be repeated to confirm the persistence of unexplained thrombocytosis. Thus, investigations to search for hematological disorders should be performed. Molecular markers for the most common myeloid neoplasms associated with thrombocytosis can be searched on peripheral blood: BCR‐ABL rearrangement for chronic myeloid leukemia and JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutations for Philadelphia‐negative myeloproliferative neoplasms. Subsequently, according to the clinical suspicion, a bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy, together with cytogenetic and other molecular analysis (including a myeloid next‐generation sequencing panel), should be carried out. Bone marrow biopsy is particularly useful to exclude triple‐negative myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Hyposplenism, defined as an abnormally low rate of activity of the spleen, is one of the most overlooked causes of thrombocytosis. Irrespective of the underlying cause, hyposplenism is suggested by typical morphological abnormalities of circulating red blood cells, including acanthocytes, spiculated spherocytes, stomatocytes, target cells, pitted erythrocytes, and Howell‐Jolly bodies. Pitted red cells are erythrocytes whose membrane appears to contain the so‐called "pits". It has been shown by electron microscopy that these "pits" are large vacuoles attached to or beneath the plasma membrane. Within these vacuoles, there is waste material (e.g. ferritin, hemoglobin, and residual material of mitochondria and membranes) that confers a low optical density. Normal splenic function is characterized by pitted red cells less than 4% of total erythrocytes. A pitted erythrocyte count > 4% has been suggested as the gold standard for a diagnosis of hyposplenism. Howell‐Jolly bodies that consist of basophilic DNA remnants within erythrocytes, also strongly support a diagnosis of hyposplenism if elevated, but are considered a less sensitive morphological feature than pitted red cells. Finally, radio‐isotopic methods (e.g. 99mTc‐labeled heat‐altered autologous erythrocyte scintigraphy) allow a splenic morpho‐functional assessment by studying the uptake and clearance of an injected radiolabeled tracer. However, given their high costs, their use in clinical practice is limited. This underlies the remarkable importance of morphological examination of peripheral blood smear when assessing a patient with a new‐onset thrombocytosis. New MRI techniques have increased the detection of splenic diseases so that, nowadays, MRI is an excellent tool for diagnosis and characterization of both focal and diffuse splenic abnormalities.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: a hematological emergency [^116T1RzJ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is a hematological emergency and diagnostic challenge. The critical determinant of outcome is timely diagnosis and treatment.

Objectives

Describe the pathophysiology, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Discussion

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has a varied presentation and a tendency to mimic several disorders. However, it may be at least provisionally diagnosed in the patient with thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia without alternate cause. The mainstay of treatment is immediate plasma exchange to be repeated until platelet count is stabilized. Adjuvant therapies include corticosteroids, rituximab, and cyclosporine.

Conclusion

It is essential for the emergency physician to be aware of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura's range of presentations, diagnostic criteria, and treatment.

### Dysregulated iron metabolism in polycythemia vera: etiology and consequences [^112UkWJS]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (MF) are the classical BCR-ABL negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). These blood cancers represent a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders with constitutively activated physiologic signal-transduction pathways. PV is characterized by erythrocytosis, bone marrow erythroid and megakaryocytic hyperplasia, fatigue, aquagenic pruritus, microvascular symptoms, and symptomatic splenomegaly. Complications of PV include a significantly increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis (41%) and the potential for evolution to MF (10–20%) and MPN-blast phase (3–10%), significantly reducing survival. Most patients with PV present with iron deficiency at diagnosis, even prior to the onset of therapeutic phlebotomy, the mainstay of treatment. Iron deficiency is often exacerbated by repeated phlebotomies, a desired effect thought to limit the accelerated erythropoiesis by restricting a necessary component of hemoglobin synthesis. This can lead to symptoms such as cognitive impairment and fatigue, even in the absence of anemia. Recent studies demonstrate that available therapies might improve PV-related symptoms in part by reversing iron deficiency. The genesis of iron deficiency in PV and its effect on disease manifestations and natural history have been explored to a limited extent. In this review, we focus on what is known about iron metabolism and erythropoiesis in PV. In addition, we build on recent advances in understanding the regulation of iron metabolism to enhance our understanding of PV pathophysiology and ultimately propose alternative therapeutic options.

### Proposals and rationale for revision of the World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis: recommendations from an ad hoc international expert panel [^111GiDB3]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

The Janus kinase 2 mutation, JAK2617V > F, is myeloid neoplasm-specific; its presence excludes secondary polycythemia, thrombocytosis, or bone marrow fibrosis from other causes. Furthermore, JAK2617V > F or a JAK2 exon 12 mutation is present in virtually all patients with polycythemia vera (PV), whereas JAK2617V > F also occurs in approximately half of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) or primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Therefore, JAK2 mutation screening holds the promise of a decisive diagnostic test in PV while being complementary to histology for the diagnosis of ET and PMF; the combination of molecular testing and histologic review should also facilitate diagnosis of ET associated with borderline thrombocytosis. Accordingly, revision of the current World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria for PV, ET, and PMF is warranted; JAK2 mutation analysis should be listed as a major criterion for PV diagnosis, and the platelet count threshold for ET diagnosis can be lowered from 600 to 450 × 10⁹/L. The current document was prepared by an international expert panel of pathologists and clinical investigators in myeloproliferative disorders; it was subsequently presented to members of the Clinical Advisory Committee for the revision of the WHO Classification of Myeloid Neoplasms, who endorsed the document and recommended its adoption by the WHO.

### Best practice in primary care pathology: review 3 [^1149L6GH]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

This best practice review examines four series of common primary care questions in laboratory medicine: (i) "minor" blood platelet count and haemoglobin abnormalities; (ii) diagnosis and monitoring of anaemia caused by iron deficiency; (iii) secondary hyperlipidaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia; and (iv) glycated haemoglobin and microalbumin use in diabetes. The review is presented in question-answer format, referenced for each question series. The recommendations represent a précis of guidance found using a standardised literature search of national and international guidance notes, consensus statements, health policy documents and evidence-based medicine reviews, supplemented by Medline Embase searches to identify relevant primary research documents. They are not standards, but form a guide to be set in the clinical context. Most of the recommendations are based on consensus rather than evidence.

### Risk of bleeding in patients with essential thrombocythemia and extreme thrombocytosis [^114dnMw4]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The risk of bleeding is unclear in ExT patients specifically. Consequently, there are no treatment guidelines on the management of bleeding risk in ExT patients, including (1) when to start cytoreduction, (2) when to stop aspirin, and (3) how to incorporate AVWS testing. Risk factors associated with bleeding in ExT patients are also unknown, making it difficult to know whether there are specific subpopulations of ExT patients who may benefit from cytoreductive therapy.

Thus, we first aimed to characterize the risk of bleeding in patients with ET with ExT. We further sought to analyze risk factors that contribute to bleeding and investigate thrombosis, progression, and survival outcomes in patients with ET with ExT.

### One thousand patients with essential thrombocythemia: the florence-CRIMM experience [^112ocnEk]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Essential thrombocythemia (ET), first described by Epstein and Goedel in 1934, is one of the classic Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), along with polycythemia vera (PV), prefibrotic and overtly fibrotic stage primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and MPN unclassifiable (MPN-U)/not otherwise specified (MPN-NOS) according to the latest International consensus (ICC) and World Health Organization (WHO) classification systems. Furthermore, ET may develop a fibrotic phenotype over time, referred to as post-ET myelofibrosis (MF).

ET is mainly characterized by the proliferation of abnormal megakaryocytes in the bone marrow (BM), resulting in an increased number of circulating platelets. Clinical manifestations include vasomotor symptoms such as erythromelalgia, migraine, and paresthesia, constitutional symptoms, and complications from thrombosis, both arterial and venous, and bleeding; mild (< 5 cm from left costal margin) splenomegaly can be seen in about 15–20% of the cases, while hepatomegaly is rare.

Rates of complications are relatively high. Of note, the incidence of thrombotic complications ranges from 9% to 84% at diagnosis and from 7% to 32% during long-term follow-up in various settings and using different definitions of events. For bleeding, the respective rates range from 4% to 63% and from 8% to 14%. However, approximately 40% to 50% of patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis, and thrombocytosis is an incidental finding on routine blood testing. Overall, ET has the most favorable prognosis among MPN but presents considerable clinical heterogeneity, and a minority of patients who develop progression to MF or acute myeloid leukemia (AML), referred to as blast-phase (BP) MPN, have a much poorer outcome.

Diagnosis of ET is made on the basis of patterns of histopathology in the BM, which is typically normocellular for patients' age and has an increased number of mostly mature-appearing megakaryocytes, either sparse and constituting loose clusters and reticulin fibrosis < grade 1; demonstration of clonality and/or the absence of a clear secondary cause of thrombocytosis, and exclusion of other hematologic disorders with thrombocytosis, are required diagnostic criteria. Among conditions associated with secondary/reactive thrombocytosis, the most frequent are infections, iron deficiency, chronic inflammation, drugs and splenectomy.

### Essential thrombocythaemia and its neurological complications [^112g1vTf]. Practical Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Essential thrombocythaemia is one of the chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms and is characterised by a sustained platelet count ≥ 450 × 10⁹/l. The clinical course is often indolent but a significant number of patients have thrombotic and haemorrhagic complications. A patient with neurological complications is described, and the pathogenesis and clinical features of this disease are reviewed, including its neurological sequelae and management, along with an outline for the investigation of patients with thrombocytosis.

### Essential thrombocythemia: 2024 update on diagnosis, risk stratification, and management [^1131VoXA]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Overview

Essential thrombocythemia is a Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutation-prevalent myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal thrombocytosis; clinical course is often indolent but might be interrupted by thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications, microcirculatory symptoms (e.g., headaches, lightheadedness, and acral paresthesias), and, less frequently, by disease transformation into myelofibrosis (MF) or acute myeloid leukemia.

Diagnosis

In addition to thrombocytosis (platelets ≥ 450×10⁹/L), formal diagnosis requires the exclusion of other myeloid neoplasms, including prefibrotic MF, polycythemia vera, chronic myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis. Bone marrow morphology typically shows increased number of mature-appearing megakaryocytes distributed in loose clusters.

Genetics

Approximately 80% of patients express myeloproliferative neoplasm driver mutations (JAK2, CALR, MPL), in a mutually exclusive manner; in addition, about 50% harbor other mutations, the most frequent being TET2 (9%-11%), ASXL1 (7%-20%), DNMT3A (7%), and SF3B1 (5%). Abnormal karyotype is seen in < 10% of patients and includes +9/20q-/13q-.

Survival and Prognosis

Life expectancy is less than that of the control population. Median survival is approximately 18years but exceeds > 35years in younger patients. The triple A survival risk model, based on Age, Absolute neutrophil count, and Absolute lymphocyte count, effectively delineates high-, intermediate-1-, intermediate-2-, and low-risk disease with corresponding median survivals of 8, 14, 21, and 47years.

Risk Factors For Thrombosis

Four risk categories are considered: very low (age ≤ 60years, no thrombosis history, JAK2 wild-type), low (same as very low but JAK2 mutation present), intermediate (same as low but age > 60years), and high (thrombosis history or age > 60years with JAK2 mutation).

Mutations and Prognosis

MPL and CALR-1 mutations have been associated with increased risk of MF transformation; spliceosome with inferior overall and MF-free survival; TP53 with leukemic transformation, and JAK2V617F with thrombosis. Leukemic transformation rate at 10years is < 1% but might be higher in JAK2-mutated patients with extreme thrombocytosis and those with abnormal karyotype.

Treatment

The main goal of therapy is to prevent thrombosis. In this regard, once-daily low-dose aspirin is advised for all patients and twice daily for low-risk disease. Cytoreductive therapy is advised for high-risk and optional for intermediate-risk disease. First-line cytoreductive drugs of choice are hydroxyurea and pegylated interferon-α and second-line busulfan.

Additional Content

The current review includes specific treatment strategies in the context of extreme thrombocytosis, pregnancy, splanchnic vein thrombosis, perioperative care, and post-essential thrombocythemia MF, as well as new investigational drugs.

### Treatment of inherited thrombocytopenias [^111iCQ4h]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

The changing view of inherited thrombocytopenias

Until twenty years ago, IT were considered extremely rare, and were almost always characterized by a severe hemorrhagic diathesis. In 2012, their prevalence was estimated to be around 2.7 in 100,000, similar to that of severe hemophilia A and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia. In the last 10 years, many new forms of IT have been discovered, and therefore the rate calculated 10 years ago very probably underestimates the real prevalence of these diseases. IT are, therefore, although rare, not so rare as originally thought.

Today, we also know that most of the affected subjects have a moderate, mild or even absent spontaneous bleeding diathesis, although bleeding may occur during hemostatic challenges, such as surgery, childbirth, or taking medications that further hinder hemostasis. From this point of view, the clinical phenotype is, therefore, less serious than previously thought. However, an unpleasant surprise has emerged from the analysis of large case series: many IT predispose to the development of additional diseases, including hematological malignancies, bone marrow aplasia, and severe non-hematological illnesses, which strongly influences the prognosis of affected subjects (Table 1). Altogether, the prevalence of IT predisposing to other diseases is near 50% of the known forms (Figure 1). The most feared risk for subjects with IT is, therefore, no longer that of bleeding, but of developing potentially fatal diseases (Figure 2). This has become even truer in recent years due to the identification of treatments capable of increasing the number of platelets and/or reducing the bleeding risk in many IT (Table 2).

### Personalized management of essential thrombocythemia-application of recent evidence to clinical practice [^114SfPTB]. Leukemia (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are operationally classified as BCR-ABL1 -negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). All three are believed to originate from a genetically transformed stem cell, which leads to clonal myeloproliferation. Neither the disease-initiating nor leukemia-promoting events in BCR-ABL1 -negative MPN are known, although the majority of the patients harbor JAK2 V617F or other secondary somatic mutations. In terms of diagnosis, the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system for hematopoietic tumors considers clonal erythrocytosis as being specific to PV, and uses bone marrow morphology to distinguish between ET and PMF.

This neoplasm is not reportable. Name Thrombocytosis Reportability This neoplasm is not reportable Alternate Names Chronic thrombocytosis Reactive thrombocytosis Secondary thrombocytosis Thrombocythemia, NOS. Definition Thrombocytosis and thrombocythemia are conditions in which the blood has a higher than normal number of platelets. Thrombocytosis is caused when another disease or condition causes a high platelet count. This condition is often called secondary or reactive thrombocytosis. Thrombocythemia is when the cause of a high platelet count isn't known. The condition sometimes is called primary or essential thrombocythemia. Thrombocytosis or thrombocythemia by themselves are not reportable. If they are referred to as primary/essential thrombocytosis or primary/essential thrombocythemia, then this is reportable.

### Clinical significance of postoperative thrombocytosis after vats lobectomy for NSCLC [^1117Hsvw]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Third, our results highlighted that postoperative transient thrombocytosis is a phenomenon related to an inflammatory reactive condition, that can be easily managed by the physician without influencing the patient recovery after thoracic surgery. Treatment with low-dose acetylsalicylic acid is generally used to prevent thrombotic events in essential thrombocytosis, but we considered its use in reactive thrombocytosis with prophylactic intent. Mohamud et al. did not treat postoperative thrombocytosis but observed a higher rate of complications in the thrombocytosis group. In our study, the platelet count returned to normal within 30-day postoperative, along with inflammatory biomarkers descent. The relationship between thrombocytosis and atelectasis/residual pleural effusion should be better investigated, as it could offer some perspective about platelet role in the mechanisms of postoperative recovery and of injury-induced inflammatory response.

Thrombocytosis should be differentiated according to its onset and duration: a transient postoperative thrombocytosis is more likely to be an inflammatory phenomenon without significant influence on the patient's prognosis, while persistent preoperative or pre-treatment thrombocytosis is commonly related to a worse oncological prognosis, as it relates with advanced stages of NSCLC. In the postoperative period, a finding of thrombocytosis should not scare the surgeon with a certainty of a worse prognosis, but it should be considered in the context of the patient's clinical evolution.

The main limitations of our study were the retrospective nature, the absence of randomization, the small cohort of patients and the relatively short follow-up (median 15 months). For these reasons our findings must be investigated with further larger and prospective studies.

### Thrombocytosis in intensive care [^113tg3zQ]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

We conducted a retrospective study of platelet count in 226 patients admitted for critical care over a 5-month period, to explore the incidence of thrombocytosis and its relation to admission category, duration of ICU stay and outcome. Our findings indicate that thrombocytosis is not rare in ICU patients. At least one platelet count greater than 450×10⁹ litre⁻¹ was found in 21.7% of patients and was associated with lower ICU mortality (P = 0.003), lower hospital mortality (P = 0.006), but longer duration of ICU stay (P < 0.0001). Thrombocytosis may serve as an independent predictor of favourable outcome in ICU patients.

### Spontaneous resolution of extreme thrombocytosis in 2 children [^114BiGYv]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Essential thrombocytosis (ET) is rare in children, sometimes difficult to be distinguished from secondary thrombocytosis. This report concerns 2 children with extreme thrombocytosis of 4100 × 10⁹/L and 1644 × 10⁹/L with partial and complete remission at 3 months and 4 years from diagnosis, with a follow-up of 4 and 17 years, respectively, with no cytoreduction therapy. Diagnosis of ET was suggested according to accepted criteria. However, spontaneous remission of the thrombocytosis argues for the diagnosis of secondary thrombocytosis. These patients highlight the complexity of distinguishing childhood ET from secondary thrombocytosis and the need for cautious personalized decision on cytoreduction therapy.

### Thrombocytosis and leukocytosis interaction in vascular complications of essential thrombocythemia [^115Hssgy]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

To elucidate the role of thrombocytosis, alone or in combination with standard (age, previous cardiovascular events) and novel (leukocytosis, JAK2(V617F) mutational status) risk factors, in the cardiovascular events of essential thrombocythemia (ET), we analyzed a cohort of 1063 patients. We found that a platelet count at diagnosis greater than 1000 × 10⁹/L was associated with significantly lower rate of thrombosis in multivariable analysis and, if combined with leukocytes less than 11 × 10⁹/L, pointed to a "low-risk" category with a rate of thrombosis of 1.59% of patients/year. On the contrary, the highest risk category (thrombosis rate, 2.95% of patients/year) was constituted of patients with leukocytosis, lower platelet count, and a JAK2(V617F) mutated genotype in most cases (77% vs 26% in the low-risk group), independently from standard risk factors. These data challenge the theory that elevated platelet count increases thrombosis risk in ET and suggest prospective clinical trials to support this hypothesis.

### Clinical significance of reactive thrombocytosis in the course of acute pancreatitis [^114anHYZ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition to their well-known functions of hemostasis and thrombosis, platelets have been reported to play a proinflammatory role. The enhancement of inflammation by platelet activation has been previously described in models of systemic inflammation, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. In particular, the mean platelet volume (MPV), a parameter of platelet activation, has been shown to reflect the inflammatory burden and disease activity in inflammatory diseases, such as gastrointestinal diseases with inflammation and rheumatoid arthritis; metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity and starvation; infection; thyroid diseases; and cardiovascular diseases. Similarly, tissue damage and the release of inflammatory mediators resulting from the onset and progression of AP have been reported to result in platelet activation and influence MPV. These reactions consume platelets, but in less severe cases, the platelet count is maintained at a constant level by hyperplasia in the bone marrow. In more severe cases, platelet count is shown to be decreased and correlates negatively with CRP concentration. On the other hand, it is known that a pro-inflammatory state mediated by cytokines, particularly promotion of thrombus formation by IL-6, can lead to reactive platelet proliferation. Reactive thrombocytosis occurs secondary to systemic infections, inflammatory conditions, bleeding, iron deficiency anemia and tumors, and reactive thrombocytosis in SAP has been reported. However, there are few clinical reports of this process, which causes systemic inflammation, in AP. The prevalence, characteristics, timing and impact of thrombocytosis in AP are not well known. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of reactive thrombocytosis during hospitalization for AP.

Essential thrombocythemia (NCCN Version 2.2025) — monitoring and indications for cytoreductive therapy: Patients should be monitored for new thrombosis, acquired VWS, and/or disease-related major bleeding and evaluated for indications for cytoreductive therapy with monitoring of signs/symptoms of disease progression as clinically indicated. The pathway distinguishes Asymptomatic with no indications for cytoreductive therapy from Symptomatic with potential indications for cytoreductive therapy, which include New thrombosis, acquired VWS, and/or disease-related major bleeding; Splenomegaly; Progressive thrombocytosis and/or leukocytosis; Disease-related symptoms (eg, pruritus, night sweats, fatigue); and Vasomotor/ microvascular disturbances not responsive to aspirin (eg, headaches/chest pain, erythromelalgia). For patients meeting these indications, the algorithm states Initiate cytoreductive therapy and refers to High-risk ET (ET-2). Before starting therapy, Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be performed to rule out disease progression to MF prior to the initiation of cytoreductive therapy, and there are no evidence-based data to recommend a target WBC or platelet count for patients receiving cytoreductive therapy.

### Primary myelofibrosis and the myeloproliferative neoplasms: the role of individual variation [^114Tr8Tr]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

The classic myeloproliferative neoplasms — essential thrombocytosis, polycythemia vera, and primary myelofibrosis — are acquired, clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by an overproduction of mature blood cells, bone marrow hypercellularity, extramedullary hematopoiesis, a tendency for thrombosis, and, rarely, leukemic transformation. Despite being classified as neoplastic diseases, the myeloproliferative neoplasms are often characterized by longevity, with survival measured in decades, even in the absence of treatment. Primary myelofibrosis is the rarest of the myeloproliferative neoplasms, is the most obscure with regard to its pathophysiology, and carries the least favorable although highly variable natural history. The identification of molecular lesions specific to the myeloproliferative neoplasms, in particular JAK2 V617F, has broadened understanding of the common features within these disorders and has advanced diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tools. This article highlights the challenges inherent in the management of primary myelofibrosis and presents an opportunity to address the basis of individual variation within a rare and complex disorder.

### 1.5 million platelet count limit at essential thrombocythemia diagnosis: correlations and relevance to vascular events [^114FFkVj]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

In patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) with extreme thrombocytosis (ExT ≥ 1500 × 10⁹/L), cytoreductive therapy is recommended in the current National Comprehensive Cancer network and European LeukemiaNet treatment guidelines. A recent international physician survey disclosed marked inconsistencies regarding the management of low-risk ET with ExT ≥ 1500 × 10⁹/L, arising from concerns related to an increased risk of thrombosis and/or bleeding. The prothrombotic or prohemorrhagic impact of thrombocytosis was studied in a prospective multicenter cohort of 776 patients with ET from the randomized PT-1 trial, and no association between blood counts at diagnosis and future complications was found. However, platelet count outside of the normal range (> 450 × 10⁹/L) during follow-up was associated with an immediate risk of major hemorrhage but not thrombosis. Conversely, some studies in ET with ExT have implicated aspirin use as the culprit for associations with major hemorrhage, whereas other studies have suggested a lower incidence of arterial thrombosis in patients with ExT. In addition, interpretation of findings from prior reports is confounded by the variability in platelet count thresholds used to define ExT.

### Characterization of the rate, predictors, and thrombotic complications of thrombocytosis in iron deficiency anemia [^116dgroe]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Medium credibility.

The association of thrombocytosis with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is well-recognized, but data describing the rate, predictors, and risk of thrombotic complications associated with IDA-related thrombocytosis are limited. We queried an institutional patient data repository containing comprehensive chart data for over 6 million patients to identify IDA patients with and without thrombocytosis and thrombotic events over a 40-year time period (1979 to 2019). Demographics, hematological parameters, thrombosis history, and other medical history were collected. Fidelity of query data was assessed via detailed manual chart review of 700 patients, including confirmation of ferritin and hematologic parameters in addition to temporal and clinical association of thrombocytosis. Our queries identified 36327 cases of IDA of which 15022 had thrombocytosis. Following assessment for data integrity, we observed a thrombocytosis rate of 32.6% in patients with IDA. The rate of thrombosis was calculated to be 7.8% in patients with IDA and 15.8% in patients with IDA and thrombocytosis. Platelet mass index at time of peak thrombocytosis was significantly higher than at baseline and was strongly negatively correlated with hemoglobin at peak thrombocytosis. A multivariable model demonstrated a significant predictive relationship between decreasing hemoglobin and increasing platelet count at peak thrombocytosis. In conclusion, we observed reactive thrombocytosis in one-third of IDA patients, and a 2-fold thrombosis risk in patients with IDA and thrombocytosis compared with patients with IDA alone. Given the global burden of untreated and undertreated IDA, adequate IDA treatment may reduce thrombotic complications and associated morbidity and mortality.

### Profound anaemia and thrombocytosis due to hidradenitis suppurativa [^1171hNZb]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Summary

This case presents a woman in her late 50s with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) who presented for weight loss, syncope and dyspnoea. Labs revealed severe microcytic anaemia, thrombocytosis and leucocytosis. Despite initial uncertainties, further investigation pointed towards multifactorial anaemia suspected from iron deficiency and chronic inflammation associated with HS. Differential diagnoses included malignancy, heart failure, pulmonary embolism and gastrointestinal bleed-related anaemia, which were ruled out through comprehensive examinations. The treatment involved systemic steroids, doxycycline and adalimumab for HS, along with blood transfusions and iron supplementation for anaemia. Follow-up showed significant improvement in symptoms and laboratory results, affirming the efficacy of the treatment regimen. This discussion demonstrates the profound haematologic derangements that can occur in severe HS. Although the precise aetiology of anaemia in HS is sometimes ambiguous, managing both conditions concurrently is crucial, given their impact on patient outcomes and healthcare costs.

### Increased expression of HIF2 α during iron deficiency-associated megakaryocytic differentiation [^1166inY6]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Platelets play a fundamental role in hemostasis and thrombosis and an emerging role in inflammation and cancer biology. Platelet production occurs at a rate of 10¹¹ platelets daily and may increase up to 20‐fold in response to high demand 1. Reactive thrombocytosis occurs in response to infection, tissue damage as occurs during surgery, chronic inflammation, malignancy, and post splenectomy 2 and is by far more common than primary thrombocytosis. Another well‐known cause of reactive thrombocytosis is iron deficiency (ID) 3, 4, 5, 6. While the elevation of platelet count is usually mild to moderate in ID (~ 500 × 10⁹ L⁻¹), platelet counts reaching 1000 × 10⁹ L⁻¹ have been reported 3, 4.

The mechanism behind this phenomenon is not fully elucidated; however, animal models of ID―including a diet‐induced ID model established by our group―show that ID alone leads to increased platelet count 7, 8, 9. This is accompanied by changes in megakaryopoiesis, such as enhanced progenitor expansion, increased megakaryocyte (MEG) ploidy, and overall augmented MEG differentiation. Furthermore, platelets produced in ID had higher aggregability 9, suggesting that elevated platelet count in ID may not be entirely risk free. There are numerous case reports linking ID‐related thrombocytosis and thrombosis 10 and several case–control studies showing that ID is more common in patients with a cerebrovascular insult in comparison to controls 11, 12, 13.

Anemia is a common complication in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (6.5–73.7%) 14 and in cancer (30–90%) 15; in both cases, ID appears to be the predominant cause 14, 15, 16, 17. Thrombocytosis is not uncommon in either condition 18, 19, and both cancer and IBD patients have increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) 20, 21, 22, 23, for which, in the case of cancer, high platelet count is an independent risk factor 20, 21. Iron replacement therapy in patients with IBD and ID anemia normalizes platelet count and reduces platelet activity 24, 25. While it is unclear if this affects risk for thromboembolic events in the long term, anemic cancer patients have a diminished incidence of VTE if erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents are administered with intravenous iron 26 as opposed to no‐iron therapy. This suggests that ID‐related thrombocytosis may be of relevance in the clinical setting as well.

### Thrombosis-driven disease progression in JAK2-Mutant polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia: reassessing risk-based management [^114ZaMhc]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

This paper explores emerging therapies in polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, focusing on thrombosis as a driver of disease progression leading to myelofibrosis, blast phase, second cancers, and mortality. While the thrombosis rate in high-risk patients has declined, it remains persistently high in low-risk individuals, with most events being arterial. Inflammation driven by JAK2 V617F mutation plays a primary role in pathogenesis, and mounting evidence suggests arterial thrombosis itself can fuel a self-sustaining cycle of inflammation, thereby accelerating hematologic and systemic complications. Early intervention with cytoreductive and anti-inflammatory drugs may not only prevent incidental thrombosis but also disrupt this inflammatory circuit.
