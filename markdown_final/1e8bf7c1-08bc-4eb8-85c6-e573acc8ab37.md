## Question

Guidelines for the timing of kasai

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for guidelines on the optimal timing of Kasai portoenterostomy in biliary atresia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength of evidence linking age at surgery to bile drainage and transplant-free survival. Then, I should verify real-world timing benchmarks in the US and internationally. Next, I will examine how screening and diagnostic pathways affect timing. After that, I need to assess the impact of delays on histologic fibrosis and outcomes, including special circumstances like very early and very late surgery. Finally, I should outline quality metrics and concrete system actions to reliably achieve earlier KPE, while noting exceptions where primary transplant may be preferable.

> Let me first confirm the core prognostic relationship: earlier KPE improves the odds of clearing jaundice and long-term native liver survival, and the effect appears approximately linear with age. In a multi-institutional US cohort, each 10-day delay in KPE was associated with an 18.8% decrease in odds of normalizing direct bilirubin at 3 months, and KPE at or before 50 days conferred more than double the odds of bilirubin normalization versus after 50 days, which is a strong near-term surrogate of transplant-free survival that multiple consortia have validated as prognostically meaningful [^114Un5KJ].

> Hold on, I should verify whether current US practice is consistently meeting an early-window target; the answer is no. National NSQIP-P data from 2012–2021 show a median KPE age of 57 days, exceeding a 45–50 day benchmark and implying substantial room for system improvement, with associated readmissions and reoperations reflecting the fragility of these patients and potential sequelae of delay [^114Lqr9u]. I need to also consider socioeconomic and access factors; a complementary US analysis found delayed KPE beyond 60 days in the majority and identified disparities and higher costs with later KPE, reinforcing the urgency of earlier referral and centralized care pathways [^111Qozb5].

> Next, I should review international data to ensure this is not a US-only phenomenon. European ESPGHAN survey data show a mean KPE age of 61 days with 6% of infants already cirrhotic and deemed too advanced for surgery at referral, which underscores that missed early windows directly translate into worse surgical candidacy and outcomes across systems, not just in the US [^1117YHJD].

> I will now examine whether there is a dose–response deterioration in outcomes with advancing age bands. A large French population analysis demonstrated a progressive, sustained decline in native liver survival when KPE timing moved from ≤ 30 days to 31–45, 46–60, 61–75, and 76–90 days, indicating no safe "plateau" above which delay is harmless and providing a rational basis for aggressive early case finding and surgery [^116eh3B9]. Let me verify independent predictors in multivariable models; age ≥ 75 days increases the hazard of transplant or death, and early postoperative clearance of jaundice strongly stratifies transplant-free survival, reinforcing that both preoperative age and early postoperative bilirubin dynamics matter clinically [^11368CKk].

> But wait, what about the biological plausibility behind the age effect; is it fibrosis accumulation with time that reduces the chance of effective drainage after KPE? Histologic series document that fibrosis correlates with age and predicts inferior survival, with the lowest fibrosis burden in infants undergoing KPE before 30 days, which is consistent with age as a surrogate for histologic progression and technical/biologic limits to restoration of bile flow as fibrosis advances [^115gTyWC] [^117YLw6e]. I should double-check whether contemporary histologic studies still show this gradient; recent cohorts continue to report a high proportion of stage 3 fibrosis by about 60 days of age, consistent with rapid early progression that erodes surgical success as time elapses [^1179xVxC].

> Let me consider whether systematic screening can reliably shift KPE earlier and improve outcomes. Taiwan's universal stool color card program increased KPE before 60 days from 60% to 74.3% and improved 3‑month jaundice-free rates from 37.0% historically to 59.5%, demonstrating that earlier case identification translates into measurable outcome gains at the population level [^116Jitda]. I should confirm broader guidance; ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN emphasize measuring conjugated bilirubin in any infant with persistent jaundice and recommend stool color cards to aid earlier recognition and referral, which aligns with these observed gains [^1117YHJD].

> Hold on, I need to check how diagnostic workflows affect time-to-KPE and whether certain tests should be de-emphasized. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA) prolongs time to KPE roughly twofold and is much less diagnostic than direct operative cholangiography, so routine HIDA can be harmful by delaying definitive care in suspected BA, especially when local expertise can expedite cholangiography and biopsy safely [^117YLw6e]. Expedited laparoscopic cholangiogram with intraoperative or conCore biopsy is feasible and safe, allowing earlier confirmation or exclusion of BA and averting days to weeks of delay introduced by sequential percutaneous biopsies and ancillary imaging [^113dz5rz].

> Let me think about special circumstances and late presentation. KPE after 60 days is not automatically futile; some centers report meaningful jaundice clearance and native liver survival even when surgery is performed at or beyond 90 days, although the average success steadily declines with age, and two-year native liver survival around one-third in ≥ 90 day cohorts underscores the diminishing returns with late KPE [^113ZEBXS]. Hmm, wait a minute — an older single-center series even reported an 83% "success" rate when KPE was performed at ≥ 76 days; but I should be cautious, as the sample was only six late cases and the confidence intervals are wide, so I should not generalize that finding against the weight of larger datasets showing progressive deterioration with delay, and I will correct my inference accordingly [^113outZc] [^116eh3B9].

> I need to ensure we address when to consider primary liver transplantation instead of KPE. If preoperative assessment and histology suggest advanced fibrosis, portal hypertension, or a nodular liver with poor prognostic features, direct transplantation may be preferable, particularly when the probability of meaningful drainage is low and the KPE itself risks perioperative morbidity that may complicate eventual transplantation, which is consistent with transplant practice overviews and histology-informed risk models [^114bQcEz] [^112Z6piA] [^11557toE]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; even with adverse histology, some infants will clear jaundice after KPE, so this decision requires multidisciplinary judgment and family-centered counseling rather than a rigid rule [^11557toE].

> Let me reconsider whether "neonatal KPE" has incremental benefits beyond the general early-is-better message. A recent single-center cohort suggests KPE in the neonatal period may reduce early cholangitis and improve jaundice clearance and 1‑year native liver survival versus surgery at 31–60 days, but I should flag the limitations of retrospective, single-center data and note that system-level feasibility hinges on accelerating diagnostic recognition and OR access in the first month of life [^113P4qST]. The linear decrement in success per 10‑day delay in the US multicenter study supports pursuing the earliest feasible KPE even if truly neonatal surgery is not universally achievable across health systems [^114Un5KJ].

> Next, I should define pragmatic program quality benchmarks that reflect the evidence signal. A median age at KPE under 45–50 days, with more than 90% of infants receiving KPE by 60 days, aligns with the observed inflection in outcomes and the European and US datasets indicating current medians around 57–61 days are suboptimal and expose some infants to cirrhosis at referral, justifying health-system redesign to pull timing earlier [^114Lqr9u] [^1117YHJD]. I need to check whether centralization improves outcomes; UK centralization to designated supra-regional centers was associated with good early clearance rates and favorable survival, supporting hub-and-spoke models for timeliness and expertise [^116eXuKN].

> I should now outline implementation steps to reliably hit those targets. Universal newborn case finding with stool color cards and direct/conjugated bilirubin testing for jaundice persisting beyond 14 days can advance recognition, while direct referral to pediatric hepatology/surgery within 24–48 hours and an expedited pathway to operative cholangiogram and biopsy minimizes diagnostic lag; conversely, avoid routine HIDA scans, which delay KPE without adding decisive value in many cases [^116Jitda] [^1117YHJD] [^113dz5rz] [^117YLw6e]. Let me double-check that these steps align with observed bottlenecks; the US multicenter data show the median age at initiation of evaluation is around 35 days with variable lag to KPE across institutions, so compressing that interval is a key actionable lever [^114Un5KJ].

> I need to ensure we close the loop on postoperative risk and counseling, because early KPE does not eliminate later complications. Recurrent cholangitis is common and prognostically relevant; higher numbers of cholangitis episodes within two years after KPE correlate with greater likelihood of liver transplantation, which should inform anticipatory guidance and early escalation pathways even after successful drainage [^112TgkyE]. Let me verify that very early KPE may also reduce cholangitis burden; neonatal KPE observations suggest this trend, but higher quality multicenter data are still needed to confirm magnitude and generalizability [^113P4qST].

> Finally, I should translate this into frontline clinical actions. Any infant with jaundice persisting beyond 14 days needs immediate direct/conjugated bilirubin measurement and, if elevated, urgent referral to a pediatric hepatology center for surgical decision-making within days rather than weeks, with the operational goal of KPE by 45–50 days whenever feasible and certainly before 60 days in the vast majority of cases, given the demonstrated linear penalty for each 10‑day delay and the survival impact of early jaundice clearance [^1117YHJD] [^114Un5KJ]. I should confirm that late presenters still deserve individualized consideration; KPE up to about 90 days may still confer benefit for selected infants, but parallel transplant evaluation is prudent, and advanced cirrhosis or markedly adverse histology may tip the balance toward primary transplant to optimize outcomes [^113ZEBXS] [^114bQcEz] [^112Z6piA].

Kasai portoenterostomy should be performed as early as possible [^111YNyde], ideally **before 45 days of age** [^116eh3B9] and no later than 60 days [^116Jitda], to maximize native-liver survival [^11368CKk] and reduce the need for transplantation [^114bQcEz] [^114Un5KJ]. Early surgery is the **strongest modifiable predictor of outcome** [^115gTyWC], with each 10-day delay reducing the odds of jaundice clearance by 18.8% [^114Un5KJ]. Universal **stool color card screening** [^116Jitda] and **expedited diagnostic pathways** [^113dz5rz] [^117YLw6e] are recommended to enable timely intervention [^1117YHJD].

---

## Evidence supporting early kasai portoenterostomy

Multiple studies consistently show that **earlier KPE significantly improves outcomes**:

- **Early drainage**: Successful bile drainage (total bilirubin < 2 mg/dL within 3 months) [^11368CKk] is strongly associated with transplant-free survival.

- **Age effect**: Age at KPE is a major determinant of native liver survival [^116eh3B9]; earlier surgery yields better outcomes [^115gTyWC].

- **Delay harms**: Each 10-day delay reduces the odds of normalizing bilirubin at 3 months by 18.8% [^114Un5KJ].

- **≤ 50 days**: KPE at ≤ 50 days significantly increases the likelihood of bilirubin normalization compared to > 50 days [^114Un5KJ].

---

## Recommended timing of kasai portoenterostomy

Based on current evidence, **the following timing is recommended**:

| **Age at KPE** | **Recommended action** | **Expected outcomes** |
|-|-|-|
| ≤ 45 days | Strongly recommended [^116eh3B9] | Highest likelihood of successful bile drainage and native liver survival |
| 46–60 days | Recommended [^114Un5KJ] | Good outcomes, though slightly reduced compared to ≤ 45 days |
| 61–90 days | Considered [^11368CKk] | Outcomes progressively worsen with increasing age |
| > 90 days | Individualized decision [^113outZc] | Significantly reduced success; consider primary liver transplantation in advanced disease [^114bQcEz] |

## Factors influencing timing decisions

Several factors **influence KPE timing**:

- **Diagnostic delay**: Late recognition of cholestasis and delayed referral are major causes of late surgery [^1117YHJD] [^114Lqr9u].

- **Institutional variability**: Significant variation exists among centers [^114Un5KJ] in time from diagnosis to surgery.

- **Patient factors**: Severity of liver fibrosis, portal hypertension, and associated anomalies may necessitate earlier intervention [^115gTyWC] [^11557toE] [^11368CKk].

---

## Impact of delayed kasai portoenterostomy

Delayed KPE **significantly worsens outcomes** [^116eh3B9], reducing native-liver survival and increasing transplantation risk [^11368CKk]. It is also associated with higher rates of cholangitis, portal hypertension, and liver failure, as well as increased hospital costs and resource utilization [^111Qozb5].

---

## Strategies to optimize timing

To ensure timely KPE, **implement the following strategies**:

- **Universal screening**: Implement stool color card screening to detect BA early [^116Jitda] [^1117YHJD].

- **Expedited diagnosis**: Use rapid diagnostic pathways, including early laparoscopic cholangiogram and liver biopsy [^113dz5rz] [^117YLw6e].

- **Centralized care**: Refer to specialized centers with experience in BA management [^1117YHJD] [^116eXuKN] [^111YNyde].

- **Education**: Increase awareness among healthcare providers and parents about early signs of BA [^1117YHJD] [^114Lqr9u].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current clinical guidelines **emphasize early intervention**: ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN recommend early recognition of cholestasis, prompt referral, and early KPE [^1117YHJD], and the **AAP** emphasizes early diagnosis and timely surgical intervention.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Early KPE is **critical for optimal outcomes in BA** [^111YNyde]. Perform KPE as early as possible, ideally **before 45 days and no later than 60 days** [^116eh3B9] [^114Un5KJ]. Implement universal screening, expedited diagnostics, and centralized care to enable timely surgery [^116Jitda] [^113dz5rz] [^116eXuKN].

### Universal screening for biliary atresia using an infant stool color card in Taiwan [^116Jitda]. Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Biliary atresia is the most common cause of death from liver disease in children. Although the Kasai operation before 60 days of age can significantly improve prognosis, delay in referral and surgery remains a formidable problem worldwide because of difficulties in differentiating it from benign prolonged neonatal jaundice. We established a universal screening system using an infant stool color card to promote the early diagnosis and treatment of biliary atresia. After a pilot regional study in 2002–2003, a national stool color screening system was established by integrating the infant stool color card into the child health booklet given to every neonate in Taiwan since 2004. Within 24 hours of the discovery of an abnormal stool color, this event is reported to the registry center.

The annual incidence of biliary atresia per 10,000 live births in 2004 and 2005 was 1.85 (40/216,419) and 1.70 (35/205,854), respectively. The sensitivity of detecting biliary atresia using stool cards before 60 days of age was 72.5% in 2004, which improved to 97.1% in 2005. The national rate of the Kasai operation before 60 days of age increased from 60% in 2004 to 74.3% in 2005. The jaundice-free rate (< 2 mg/dL) at 3 months after the Kasai operation among infants with biliary atresia in 2004–2005 was 59.5% (44 of 74), significantly higher than the historical data of 37.0% in 1976–2000 before the stool card screening program (P = 0.002).

Universal screening using the stool color cards can enhance earlier referral, which may ultimately lead to timely performance of the Kasai operation.

### Real-world multi-institutional data from the Midwest Pediatric Surgery Consortium (MWPSC) to assess the effect of delayed Kasai procedure on biliary drainage in patients with biliary atresia [^114Un5KJ]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Early Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE) for infants with biliary atresia (BA) increases the chance of transplant-free survival (TFS). However, early timing of KPE is not consistently achieved in the United States. Clearance of jaundice at three months is predictive of TFS. Among a cohort of patients with BA, we investigated institutional variability in the initiation of hyperbilirubinemia evaluation and operative timing to identify factors associated with successful jaundice clearance.

- **Methods**: A multi-institutional, retrospective study was performed at eleven U.S. tertiary children's hospitals. Infants diagnosed with BA between 10/1/2015 and 10/1/2020 were identified. Age at initiation of diagnostic workup and age at KPE were collected. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with direct bilirubin normalization at three months following KPE.

- **Results**: In 161 infants, the median age at initiation of jaundice evaluation was 35 days (IQR 8–60). Among 148 patients who underwent KPE, the median age at surgery was 53 days (IQR 37.3–67.5). Each 10-day increase in age at KPE was associated with an 18.8% decrease in odds of normalizing bilirubin at three months (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66–0.99), with infants who underwent KPE at ≤ 50 days significantly more likely to normalize bilirubin (OR 2.6, CI 1.1–6.1) compared to KPE > 50 days. There was significant variation among institutions in the time from initiation of workup to KPE (range 0–24.5 days, p = 0.02) and the odds of patients normalizing direct bilirubin at three months (range 0.04–0.89, p < 0.05).

### Expedited laparoscopic cholangiogram and liver biopsy in the workup of biliary atresia [^113dz5rz]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Recent studies demonstrate that the success of Kasai portoenterostomy for biliary atresia (BA) is linearly related to the infant's age at the time of Kasai. This study sought to review the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic needle micropuncture cholangiogram with conCore liver biopsy (if needed) for the expedited exclusion of BA in patients with direct conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Expedited laparoscopic cholangiogram and liver biopsy were instituted at our facility for infants with direct hyperbilirubinemia for whom a clinical exam and laboratory workup failed to diagnose. A retrospective chart review was performed on infants under one year with hyperbilirubinemia from 2016 to 2021. Demographics, preoperative evaluation, procedure details, and complications were reviewed.

Two hundred ninety-seven infants with unspecified jaundice were identified, of which 86 (29%) required a liver biopsy. Forty-seven percutaneous liver biopsies were obtained, including 8 (17%) in whom BA could not be excluded. Laparoscopic cholangiogram was attempted in 47 infants following the basic workup; BA was diagnosed in 22 infants (47%), of which 3 were under 18 days old. Biliary patency was demonstrated laparoscopically in 22 out of 25 (88%); 3 (12%) required conversion to open cholangiogram. Infants with percutaneous liver biopsy had an average delay of 3 days (range: 2–36) to cholangiogram. Preoperative studies and liver biopsy alone did not reliably exclude the diagnosis of BA.

Laparoscopic cholangiogram with liver biopsy is a safe procedure resulting in the confirmation or exclusion of BA.

### The anatomic pattern of biliary atresia identified at time of Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy and early postoperative clearance of jaundice are significant predictors of transplant-free survival [^11368CKk]. Annals of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to describe the clinical and anatomic features of infants undergoing Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE) for biliary atresia (BA) and to examine associations between these parameters and outcomes.

Infants enrolled in the prospective Childhood Liver Disease Research and Education Network, who underwent KPE, were studied. Patients enrolled in a blinded interventional trial were excluded from survival analysis. Primary endpoints were successful surgical drainage (total bilirubin less than 2 mg/dL within the first 3 months), transplant-free survival (Kaplan-Meier), and time to transplant/death (Cox regression).

KPE was performed in 244 infants (54% female; mean age: 65 ± 29 days). Transplant-free survival was 53.7% and 46.7% at one and two years post-KPE. The risk of transplant/death was significantly lower in the 45.6% of patients who achieved successful bile drainage within three months post-KPE (HR: 0.08, P < 0.0001). Risk factors for early transplant/death included presence of biliary atresia splenic malformation complex (BASM), ascites > 20 mL (HR: 1.90, P = 0.0230), nodular liver appearance compared to firm (HR: 1.61, P = 0.008), and age at KPE ≥ 75 days (HR: 1.73, P < 0.002). Outcome was not associated with gestational age, gender, race, ethnicity, or extent of porta hepatis dissection.

The anatomic pattern of BA, presence of BASM, ascites, and nodular liver appearance were all significant predictors of transplant-free survival following KPE in infants.

### Development and post-Kasai procedure prognostic relevance of histological features for biliary atresia [^1138UGXr]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

All slides were reviewed by two senior pathologists, and differences of opinion were resolved by consensus. The observers were unaware of the clinical data. Inter-observer kappa values for different pathological parameters ranged from 0.674 to 0.836. Specifically, the kappa values for Ishak, Metavir, and BA-specific staging were 0.674, 0.812, and 0.787, respectively. The kappa values for portal inflammation, intrahepatic cholestasis, and ductal proliferation grades were 0.699, 0.747, and 0.836.

- **Follow-up evaluation**: Patients were followed monthly for the first 6 months after the Kasai procedure (KP) and every 3–12 months thereafter, with the last follow-up visit in June 2022. Follow-up methods included outpatient visits, telephone, and WeChat communication. Local patients maintained contact by phone and visited outpatient settings regularly for indicator reviews. Patients from other regions received timely follow-up examinations locally and sent examination photos through WeChat. At each visit, assessments were conducted on general conditions (e.g. body temperature, skin color, stool color), medical history (e.g. cholangitis, JC, NLS), and included physical examinations along with routine laboratory tests. Observed follow-up outcomes included cholangitis, JC, and NLS. Cholangitis was defined following Tokyo guidelines as a fever exceeding 38℃ or elevated inflammatory markers with evidence of cholestasis or abnormal liver function tests. Good JC was defined as total bilirubin (TB) postoperative levels below 20 µmol/L at 6 months post-surgery. Poor JC was defined as TB levels higher than 20 µmol/L at 6 months post-surgery, or at the time of death, or liver transplantation within 6 months post-surgery.

### Timing of cholecystectomy in severe pancreatitis (CHISPA): Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^111F55ci]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is an important cause of morbidity with growing incidence rates. Pancreatitis severity is classified according to Atlanta's revised criteria into mild, moderately severe, or severe. The etiology for acute pancreatitis is mostly of biliary origin, and as a result, performing cholecystectomy is part of the treatment to avoid recurrences.

In mild acute pancreatitis, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is recommended during the same hospital admission (also referred to as early cholecystectomy) due to evidence that reports it as a safe procedure associated with a reduction in complications relating to biliary disease. Modern guidelines for the management of mild acute pancreatitis recommend early cholecystectomy with a Grade 1A recommendation.

However, in approximately 20% of cases classified as moderately severe and severe acute pancreatitis, there is not a clear recommendation on the timing of cholecystectomy. The WSES guidelines (World Journal of Emergency Surgery) recommend delayed cholecystectomy in patients diagnosed with pancreatitis and peripancreatic collections until they are resolved, or when the patient is clinically and hemodynamically stable and inflammation subsides, with a Grade 2C recommendation (very weak recommendation; other alternatives may be equally reasonable). This recommendation was included based on a study that compared early versus delayed cholecystectomy in patients with moderately severe or severe pancreatitis and peripancreatic collections, finding a higher rate of complications in the early cholecystectomy group.

### Biliary atresia: Indications and timing of liver transplantation and optimization of pretransplant care [^114bQcEz]. Liver Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Biliary atresia (BA) is a progressive fibro-obliterative disorder of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts in infancy. The majority of affected children will eventually develop end-stage liver disease and require liver transplantation (LT). Indications for LT in BA include failed Kasai portoenterostomy, significant and recalcitrant malnutrition, recurrent cholangitis, and the progressive manifestations of portal hypertension. Extrahepatic complications of this disease, such as hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary hypertension, are also indications for LT.

Optimal pretransplant management of these potentially life-threatening complications and maximizing nutrition and growth require the expertise of a multidisciplinary team with experience caring for BA. The timing of transplant for BA requires careful consideration of the potential risk of transplant versus the survival benefit at any given stage of disease. Children with BA often experience long wait times for transplant unless exception points are granted to reflect the severity of disease. Family preparedness for this arduous process is therefore critical.

### The timing of minimally invasive surgery for prenatally diagnosed choledochal cysts [^114wTrn5]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Choledochal cyst (CC), or congenital biliary dilation, is a rare malformation with a skewed distribution and hereditary features, more common in East Asian females than in males. Early diagnosis and treatment are typically necessary due to the risks of bile duct malignancy and biliary obstruction that can lead to liver fibrosis with age. Laparoscopic cyst resection followed by Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy remains the most effective and radical surgical procedure to correct this disorder.

With advances in prenatal ultrasound, nearly 70% of CCs can now be identified during the prenatal period; however, most prenatally diagnosed CCs are asymptomatic during the neonatal or early infancy stage. Due to limited abdominal space during laparoscopic surgery and the neonate's weak tolerance for prolonged general anesthesia, radical procedures are usually postponed until the child reaches 3 to 6 months of age.

According to previous reports, postponing radical surgery in asymptomatic patients until they weigh more than 5.6 kg is linked to reduced postoperative complications. However, there are reports suggesting that CC can result in liver fibrosis in young infants, even during the neonatal period. Moreover, delaying surgery to 3–6 months after birth increases the risk of CC symptoms, with 24% to 62% of symptoms occurring within the first 3 months after birth. Evidence suggests that surgery post-symptom onset is associated with higher rates of late complications, such as anastomotic stricture.

### Number of cholangitis episodes as a prognostic marker to predict timing of liver transplantation in biliary atresia patients after Kasai portoenterostomy [^112TgkyE]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). High credibility.

To evaluate the association between cholangitis and liver transplantation (LT) in biliary atresia (BA) patients after Kasai portoenterostomy (KP), we compared the cholangitis rate and age at the first occurrence of cholangitis after KP between the LT and non-LT groups. In order to analyze the cumulative incidence of BA patients with at least 2 years of follow-up after KP, patients born after 2010 were excluded.

We further evaluated whether the number of cholangitis episodes could be used as a prognostic marker to predict further LT in BA patients after KP. The number of cholangitis episodes within 2 years after KP was analyzed and compared in both groups of BA patients.

- **Statistical analyses**: Frequencies were calculated by direct counting. Continuous data were compared using t-tests, with a 2-tailed P value of 0.05 considered significant. Categorical data were analyzed using the chi-square test. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to compare the accumulated incidence of cholangitis after KP between BA patients with and without LT. Additionally, the Cox proportional hazards regression model, adjusting for the variable of KP before 60 days of age, was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for risk factors of LT among BA patients after KP. The number of cholangitis episodes was expressed as mean with a 95% confidence interval (CI), and compared between the LT and non-LT groups using t-tests. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Taichung Veterans General Hospital.

### Is performing the Kasai portoenterostomy in the neonatal period associated with a better prognosis? A single-center, retrospective cohort study from China [^113P4qST]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

The timing of surgical intervention is of paramount importance in enhancing the prognostic outcomes for biliary atresia (BA) patients. However, there remains controversy regarding the optimal time for performing the Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE) procedure within 60 days after birth. The present study provided novel evidence to affirm that BA patients who underwent the KPE procedure during the neonatal period exhibited a lower incidence of early-onset cholangitis and a higher proportion of jaundice clearance or bile acid resolution than those who underwent surgery between 31 and 60 days after birth. Additionally, BA patients in the early KPE (EK) group had a higher incidence of one-year native liver survival (NLS) and more normalized biochemical indicators and liver hardness one year after KPE. These findings confirmed the safety and effectiveness of performing the KPE procedure within the neonatal period.

In our study, the surgical age of BA patients has gradually shortened in recent years, which might be attributed to the earlier diagnosis of BA in our hospital, facilitated by the application of matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) and advancements in ultrasonography technology. For infants with pathological jaundice, we perform ultrasound examinations to screen for BA. Lee et al. found that abnormal gallbladder morphology and greater triangular cord thickness were the most useful predictors of BA in the ultrasound examination, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity. In our center, we have found pre- and postprandial abnormalities in gallbladder morphology with high specificity for BA diagnosis. Additionally, MMP7 has shown high specificity for diagnosis.

### Kasai portoenterostomy delays: Is a HIDA scan worth the wait [^117YLw6e]? Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Biliary atresia (BA), an obstructive cholangiopathy, is the most common cause of end-stage liver disease and liver transplantation in children. Timely differentiation of BA from other causes of neonatal jaundice remains a challenge, yet is critical to improving outcomes.

- **Methods**: Clinical characteristics including demographics, age at jaundice presentation, age at hepatobiliary scintigraphy, age at surgery, severity of liver fibrosis, and native-liver survival were reviewed in infants with hyperbilirubinemia and suspected BA for this single center retrospective cohort study. The accuracy of hepatobiliary scintigraphy and the elapsed time from jaundice presentation to diagnostic intervention were investigated.

- **Results**: BA was suspected in 234 infants. BA was identified in 17% of infants with hepatobiliary scintigraphy and 72% of infants who underwent operative exploration without hepatobiliary scintigraphy. The elapsed time from jaundice presentation to Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE) for BA patients was 2.1 times longer if hepatobiliary scintigraphy was obtained (p = 0.084). The mean age at KPE for this cohort was 66.8 days (n = 54), with a significantly higher mean age at KPE (75.2 days) for infants who were later listed or underwent liver transplantation (p = 0.038). Histologically, the lowest liver fibrosis scores were seen in infants undergoing KPE at less than 30 days old and worsened significantly with increased age (p < 0.001).

Hepatobiliary scintigraphy compared to operative exploration for the diagnostic evaluation of infants with suspected BA introduces significant delays.

### Liver stiffness measurement predicts the difficulty of Kasai procedure in biliary atresia: a single center retrospective analysis of 199 patients [^111XMmNV]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The gold standard for determining the degree of liver fibrosis is a liver biopsy; however, it is an invasive examination. Before the operation, the degree of liver fibrosis in biliary atresia (BA) is assessed only by clinical presentation, such as operative age or blood test. There is no uniform standard for the specific cut-off value, and controversy remains about the correlation between operative age and prognosis. A multivariable analysis including 244 cases in a single center in China showed that the low 5-year native liver survival (NLS) rate of children with BA was associated with an operative age of over 90 days. Moreover, other studies suggested that when the operative age was over 60 days, postoperative NLS rates declined and liver transplantation rates increased. However, several studies suggested that there is no correlation between operative age and postoperative NLS. Studies have shown that 5-year and 10-year NLS rates of children whose operative ages were over 100 days can reach 40% and 45%, respectively. In this study, there was no correlation between operative age and outcomes in the two groups. Therefore, we speculated that operative age might not be an effective index for judging severe cirrhosis and is not a factor for the difficulty of the surgical procedure.

Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) is a noninvasive technique used to assess the degree of liver fibrosis. The basic principle of LSM involves a one-dimensional transient elastographic wave, which has a distinguishable traveling speed in different media and can be translated into various degrees of fibrosis.

Our study aimed to compare different histologic staging systems for biliary atresia (BA) that have hitherto been lacking by referring to classical staging systems. By comparing the various staging methods for BA, the selection of the best option for assessing prognosis can be used by the surgeon to design an appropriate treatment plan for BA patients.

### Biliary atresia in Uganda: Current ethical challenges and advancement of public policy [^114jjLbm]. World Journal of Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Biliary atresia is a progressive cholangiopathy in neonates, which often results in liver failure. In high-income countries, initial treatment requires prompt diagnosis followed by Kasai portoenterostomy. For those with a late diagnosis, or those in whom Kasai portoenterostomy fails, liver transplantation is the only lifesaving treatment. Unfortunately, in low- and middle-income countries, timely diagnosis is a challenge and liver transplantation is rarely accessible. Here, we discuss the ethical dilemmas surrounding the treatment of babies with biliary atresia in Uganda.

- **Risk of catastrophic health expenditure**: This can place a significant burden on families.
- **Ethical dilemmas of transplant tourism**: Includes concerns about fairness and exploitation.
- **Medical risks of maintaining the transplant**: The difficulties faced in a low-resourced health system.
- **Difficult decisions by the surgeon**: Surgeons face challenging ethical decisions when caring for these patients.

Four distinct models of the patient-physician relationship are applied to biliary atresia in Uganda. These models describe differences in patient and physician roles, as well as patient values and autonomy. Solid organ transplantation is a rapidly evolving segment of healthcare in Uganda, and ongoing policy advancements may shift ethical considerations in the future.

### Number of cholangitis episodes as a prognostic marker to predict timing of liver transplantation in biliary atresia patients after Kasai portoenterostomy [^111eT9Wg]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

- **Results**: From 1998 to 2011, 366 biliary atresia (BA) patients who were born after 1998 and underwent Kasai portoenterostomy (KP) during the study period were enrolled. Two hundred eighty-four BA patients (77.6%) underwent KP before 60 days of age. Ninety-six (26%) patients required liver transplantation (LT) during the study period. The mean and median ages for LT were 2.0 years (95% CI 1.6–2.5) and 1.1 years (interquartile range 0.6–2.1), respectively.

- **Survival analysis**: More patients (79.6%, 219/284) who underwent KP within 60 days of age survived with their native liver compared to those with KP performed at or after 60 days of age (62.1%, 51/82) (P = 0.007). At the end of the study, age was similar between the two groups, and the mortality rate did not significantly differ between them. However, the cause of mortality was different between the two groups. In the non-LT group, 25 out of 50 (50.0%) BA patients died of end-stage liver disease, and 22 out of 50 (44.0%) died of infection. In contrast, 6 out of 11 (54.5%) BA patients in the LT group died of infection, and 3 out of 11 (27.3%) died of transplantation-associated complications.

### Development and post-Kasai procedure prognostic relevance of histological features for biliary atresia [^1179xVxC]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

In the present study, different grades of liver fibrosis were observed in all 68 cases in the early stages of BA (62.5 ± 21.3 days). A significant 41.2% of cases progressed to BA-specific stage 3, Metavir stage 3, or Ishak stage 4 at KP, which accounted for the largest proportion of cases. Thus, it was confirmed that the rapid progression of liver fibrosis and the high grades of fibrosis occurred in the early stage of BA. In addition, portal inflammation, intrahepatic cholestasis, and ductal proliferation were observed in all cases of BA. With the progression of BA disease, the grades of portal inflammation and ductal proliferation increased significantly.

KP can relieve cholestasis and prolong the survival of patients with their liver. A pressing question for surgeons to answer is which type of patient is more likely to require a death/liver transplant after KP. Herein lies the strength of this study, which assessed the correlation between three fibrosis stages and other histopathological features with the prognosis after KP, allowing the selection of the optimal staging system. The effect of KP is usually judged by the postoperative complete JC percentage and NLS rate. It was observed that good or poor JC was significantly linked to liver fibrosis scores. The ROC curve analysis further revealed that the BA-specific stage had a greater AUC than the Ishak and Metavir stages, and thus a higher value for predicting JC. However, BA-specific staging was not found to be a possible predictor of JC in the multivariate regression analysis.

Even in patients who initially succeed in JC, the 2-year failure rate remains a concern.

### Development and post-Kasai procedure prognostic relevance of histological features for biliary atresia [^112Z6piA]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Biliary atresia (BA) is a severe neonatal disease characterized by biliary obliteration and progressive hepatic fibrosis. If untreated, BA will inevitably lead to death from end-stage liver disease by age 2 years. The Kasai procedure (KP) is the treatment of choice for restoring bile flow in patients with BA, and some patients have achieved long-term native liver survival (NLS) through this procedure.

The severity of liver fibrosis at the time of KP affects long-term prognosis. Currently, over 60% of BA patients require liver transplantation (LT) in the first year after KP, indicating that the existing evaluation system for liver fibrosis of BA patients is insufficient for patient triage for performing KP or seeking LT promptly. For some BA patients with severe fibrosis, early KP cannot reconstruct enough bile drainage. It may be much more beneficial to avoid the impact of KP and directly perform liver transplantation instead. The major challenge for surgeons is to identify and select BA patients with a good predicted prognosis for doing KP. This requires further research and a more valuable evaluation system.

The staging evaluation of liver fibrosis is a key step to improving the diagnosis and treatment of BA. Inflammatory damage to the intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts with sclerosis and obliteration is a common histopathological feature of BA. There are mature anatomical and clinical classifications of BA, but a successful and effective staging system has not been developed for several years. The Ishak and Metavir scores are based on the characteristics of…

### Timing of Kasai procedure for biliary atresia: An analysis of the Pediatric National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database [^114Lqr9u]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). High credibility.

Biliary atresia is a rare liver disease of unknown etiology affecting approximately 1 in 10,000 children. This disease initially presents as inflammatory obstruction of bile ducts leading to cholestasis and eventually fibrosis of hepatic tissue. Affected patients are ideally treated early with portoenterostomy (Kasai procedure) as age at surgery is an important prognostic factor for native liver survival and need for liver transplant. This study aimed to evaluate the age at which patients in the United States are receiving this procedure.

- **Methods**: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric database was used to identify patients between 2012 and 2021 who underwent a primary procedure of portoenterostomy. The age at time of surgery and perioperative analysis was performed. The data underwent simple descriptive statistics.

- **Results**: Eight hundred twenty-four patients were identified who underwent the Kasai procedure. Four hundred seventy-four (58.2%) were female, with the predominant race being White (49.5%). The median age at surgery was 57 days old (interquartile range 41–71). Readmission and reoperation rates within 30 days were 30% and 15.2%, respectively. There were no deaths within 30 days.

- **Conclusions**: Within the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, the median age of pediatric patients undergoing the Kasai procedure for biliary atresia in the United States exceeds the goal of 45 days. Further studies are needed to investigate factors that may affect time to diagnosis and time to Kasai procedure.

### Development and post-Kasai procedure prognostic relevance of histological features for biliary atresia [^11347rNX]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Statistical analysis

Results were presented as number (percentage), mean ± standard deviation (SD), or median (interquartile range [IQR]) depending on the variable data characteristics. Study group comparison was carried out using the Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test, Student's t-test, and Mann–Whitney-Wilcoxon-test. The kappa consistency test was calculated to measure the interobserver agreement. The correlation of grades in fibrosis with other parameters was tested using Spearman's test. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to calculate odds ratio (OR) estimates for outcomes. The cumulative incidence of events and event-free during the follow-up evaluation were calculated using Kaplan–Meier analysis and compared by log-rank testing. Univariate and multivariate hazard ratio (HR) estimates for outcomes were calculated using COX proportional hazard regression analysis. The predictive performance of the three different liver fibrosis staging methods on outcome was assessed by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. The area under the receiver ROC curve (AUC) was calculated. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All of the data management and statistical analysis were performed using SPSS 25.0 and GraphPad Prism 8.0.1.

### Sequential treatment strategy for biliary atresia: Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy-liver transplantation: a single-center retrospective comparative cohort study [^111nZ7ok]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 318 patients with biliary atresia (BA) who underwent liver transplantation (LT) at the Department of Pediatric Surgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, from January 2018 to January 2025. Eighteen patients were excluded due to loss to follow-up, missing clinical data, or early postoperative (less than three days) severe complications leading to death. In this study, one case of early postoperative mortality occurred due to graft non-function caused by hyperacute rejection after transplantation. Finally, 300 patients were included in the study. Among them, 225 patients received Kasai-LT sequential treatment, while 75 patients underwent primary LT.

- **Inclusion criteria**
- **Intraoperative cholangiography during Kasai procedure confirmed BA**: Patients received Kasai-LT sequential treatment.
- **Diagnosis of BA based on laboratory and imaging findings**: Patients received LT treatment, with postoperative pathological confirmation of BA.
- **Complete follow-up data**.

- **Exclusion criteria**
- **Missing clinical data**.
- **Patients lost to follow-up**.
- **Death due to early postoperative severe complications**.

The clinical data included:

- **Demographic data**: Gender, age, and weight.
- **Pre-LT data**: Pediatric end-stage liver disease (PELD) scores, aspartate aminotransferase/platelet ratio (APRI), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (γ-GT) level preoperatively.
- **Intraoperative LT data**: Operative time, intraoperative blood loss (BL), parts of donor liver for graft, graft types, surgical approaches, and use of vasoactive drugs in donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors.

### Seamless management of biliary atresia in England as well as Wales (1999–2002) [^116eXuKN]. Lancet (2004). Low credibility.

Before 1999, infants born in the UK with suspected biliary atresia were investigated in regional centres and, if confirmed, a Kasai operation was performed there. Since 1999, all infants with suspected biliary atresia in England as well as Wales, UK, have been referred to one of three designated centres where both the Kasai operation and liver transplantation (if necessary) could be done.

- **Methods**: We assessed clearance of jaundice (bilirubin < 20 micromol/L) as an early outcome in all cases of biliary atresia referred from one of the three centres. We then estimated survival using the Kaplan-Meier method with endpoints of liver transplantation or death.

- **Findings**: A total of 148 infants with biliary atresia were treated between January 1999 and June 2002. A primary portoenterostomy was performed in 142 (96%) infants, and a primary liver transplant in five (3%). One child died before any intervention. Early clearance of jaundice after portoenterostomy was achieved in 81 of 142 (57%) infants. Liver transplantation was carried out in 52 (37%) of those undergoing portoenterostomy. Thirteen (9%) infants died. Of the 135 children who survived, 84 (62%) still have their native liver and 51 (38%) had transplantation. The median follow-up of survivors was 2.13 years (range 0.5–4.1 years). The overall 4-year estimated actuarial survival was 89% (95% CI 82–94). The 4-year estimated actuarial survival with native liver was 51% (42–59%).

- **Interpretation**: Our early results suggest that surgical outcomes can be improved by centralisation of care to supra-regional centres.

### Long-term outcome of children with biliary atresia who were not transplanted after the Kasai operation: > 20-year experience at a children's hospital [^112u6PdL]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Sequential strategies combining the Kasai operation as a first-line treatment and liver transplantation as a second-line option, if necessary, have been accepted for patients with biliary atresia (BA). To understand the role of the Kasai operation in the treatment of BA, it is necessary to analyze the long-term outcome of the operation alone and to evaluate the present status of survivors retaining their native livers.

A retrospective chart review was carried out for a group of 80 patients who had undergone the Kasai operation between 1970 and 1986 at the Kanagawa Children's Medical Center. The 5-, 10-, and 20-year survival rates of patients with their native livers were 63%, 54%, and 44%, respectively. The survival rates varied significantly depending on the type of BA, age at initial Kasai operation, era of surgery, and surgical method. By age 20, nearly half of the adult survivors had already developed liver cirrhosis and its sequelae. Episodes of cholangitis and gastrointestinal bleeding occurred after 20 years of age in 37% and 17% of the adult patients, respectively, and 20% of the adult patients died of liver failure or underwent living-related partial liver transplantation in their 20s. Five female patients gave birth to a total of 9 children, and 1 male patient fathered a child.

Although increasing numbers of patients with BA survive 20 years or more after the Kasai operation, meticulous lifelong postoperative care should be continued for the survivors because of the possibility of hepatic deterioration.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for carotid artery stenosis, specifically concerning the timing of revascularization, the SVS 2022 guidelines recommend avoiding revascularization regardless of the extent of stenosis in patients who have suffered a disabling stroke. This applies to those with a modified Rankin score ≥ 3 and an area of infarction > 30% of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery territory, or in patients with altered consciousness. This approach minimizes the risk of postoperative parenchymal hemorrhage. Consider reevaluating these patients for revascularization later if neurologic recovery is satisfactory.

### Development and post-Kasai procedure prognostic relevance of histological features for biliary atresia [^115GfR8h]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Even BA patients with the BA-specific staging assessment of mild fibrosis may have poor outcomes. Despite the early age of surgery and the mild degree of liver fibrosis, this does not preclude the possibility of rapid postoperative liver fibrosis development, which is a risk factor for poor outcomes. Analyzing the pathological features and laboratory indicators of these patients revealed that severe BDP and iBALF were associated with poor prognoses. BDP is known to have prognostic value in BA, and an increase in BDP is linked to fibrosis progression in BA. The preoperative iBALF score predicted the poor outcome of bile drainage surgery in BA patients and may be a candidate for primary liver transplantation. The AUC of prognosis for BA-specific staging combined with iBALF and severe BDP was higher than BA-specific staging alone, suggesting that combining these features improves the assessment of BA prognosis. For patients with poor prognostic results, if Kasai surgery is performed, close follow-up and prompt symptomatic treatment are recommended after surgery.

This was a single-center retrospective study, involving patients collected over a narrow three-year window, which posed limitations in sample size and follow-up duration. Furthermore, histology specimens may be subject to handling, harvesting, and processing issues over the years, complicating relevant data collection for some patients. Wedge liver biopsy may have limitations and tissue sampling errors, affecting the accuracy of histological assessment.

### Sequential treatment strategy for biliary atresia: Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy-liver transplantation: a single-center retrospective comparative cohort study [^112HMmCN]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

The treatment of biliary atresia should follow the Kasai-LT sequential treatment to achieve better pre-transplantation general condition and reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. However, some patients may require early liver transplantation due to factors such as not undergoing the Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy procedure, poor efficacy from the procedure, or severe cholangitis. These patients should receive individualized treatment based on their specific conditions to prevent rapid disease progression and life-threatening complications. The principle of individualized treatment for biliary atresia serves as an important complement to the Kasai-LT sequential treatment.

### The Kasai portoenterostomy: When is it too late [^113outZc]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Kasai portoenterostomy is recommended as the primary initial therapy for extrahepatic biliary atresia if the procedure can be performed within 10 to 12 weeks of life. The optimal management for infants with delayed presentation of biliary atresia remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to determine the success rate and outcome for patients who underwent a "late" Kasai portoenterostomy.

- **Methods**: The authors conducted a retrospective review of the medical records of all patients with biliary atresia who underwent a Kasai portoenterostomy at their institution from 1986 to 1999 (n = 31). The authors analyzed success rates compared with age at the time of the Kasai procedure and the association with patient demographics. Surgical success was defined as the achievement of a total serum bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL. Long-term follow-up assessments included the need for liver transplantation and patient survival rate.

- **Results**: The demographics of this study cohort showed a predominance of African-Americans, 19 of 31 (61%), and girls, 23 of 31 (74%). Assessment of success compared with subject age at the time of the initial portoenterostomy showed that 52% (13 of 25) had a successful Kasai procedure at 0 to 75 days, compared with 83% success rate (5 of 6) at age 76 days or older (P = 0.359). Liver transplantation was performed in 16 of 31 patients (45%). The overall survival rate for the entire cohort is 23 of 31 (74%), whereas 12 of 31 (39%) are currently alive without a liver transplant.

These data suggest that there is no contraindication to perform…

### Awareness, referral, and age at Kasai surgery for biliary atresia in Europe: A survey of the quality-of-care task force of ESPGHAN [^1117YHJD]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

To identify infants with biliary atresia (BA), the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) and the North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) guidelines recommend measuring conjugated/direct bilirubin in infants with prolonged jaundice and using a stool colour card (SCC). The 'Quality of Care' Task Force of ESPGHAN conducted two surveys to assess case finding for BA and age at Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE).

- **Methods**: The first survey approached 26 European hepatology centres to report age at referral and age at KPE of all infants diagnosed with BA from 2015 to 2019. The second survey targeted paediatricians in France to assess awareness of and compliance with the recently introduced SCC.

- **Results**: Data from 785 patients with BA from 18 centres in 15 countries revealed a mean age at referral to a tertiary centre of 55 days (median 53, IQR 48–60) (n = 636). The mean age at KPE was 61 days (median 60; IQR 54–67) (n = 772). For 6% of patients, cirrhosis was too advanced for surgery. Of 392 paediatricians responding to the second survey, 53% felt familiar with the target diseases, 80% correctly identified cholestasis, and 59% always inquired about the infant's stool colour. If abnormal, 93% would order blood tests and 85% would call for advice. The SCC screening was considered helpful for case finding and improving knowledge of cholestatic diseases by 62% and 45% of paediatricians, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Referral of infants for KPE remains late, indicating low adherence to searching for cholestasis in icteric infants by age.

### Number of cholangitis episodes as a prognostic marker to predict timing of liver transplantation in biliary atresia patients after Kasai portoenterostomy [^112p1iqE]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Since the outcome of KP has greatly improved worldwide, BA patients are living increasingly longer after KP with a native liver. However, according to a study of a Japanese population, about 40% of BA patients still required LT within 5 years after KP. A few reports have shown that jaundice-free period, cholangitis, and age at the time of KP are associated with LT and late-presenting liver failure, referring to patients who survive with their native liver for more than 20 years. In the present study, BA patients who underwent KP before 60 days of age had a favorable outcome, which is consistent with the findings of previous reports.

A large cohort study from a North American multicenter consortium reported that 162 (62.1%) of 219 BA patients experienced cholangitis at least once after KP. Cholangitis has been reported to affect BA patients most commonly within 1–2 years after KP and is considered an important factor in accelerating the process of cirrhosis. A multivariate analysis of risk factors for LT in 77 BA patients after KP found that cholangitis occurred in 59% of patients. However, early cholangitis, defined as occurrence within 6 months after KP, was not an independent risk factor for LT. In the study, 67.7% of BA patients experienced cholangitis after KP, and over two-thirds of first-time cholangitis events occurred within 2 years in BA patients with and without LT, even though prophylactic steroids and antibiotics are used as standard therapy for BA patients after KP in Taiwan.

### Relevant factors for early liver transplantation after Kasai portoenterostomy [^113racRR]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

The age of undergoing Kasai portoenterostomy (KP) greater than 90 days, unclear jaundice status, and early cholangitis could reduce the native liver survival (NLS) time after the procedure and are related to early liver transplantation. Unclear jaundice status was identified as a risk factor for early liver transplantation. Consequently, improving the early diagnosis rate and operation rate for children with biliary atresia, standardizing the KP procedure and management, improving the clearance rate of jaundice, and reducing the incidence of cholangitis are critical. These measures can enhance the NLS rate and delay the timing of liver transplantation (LT).

However, for some children with biliary atresia, such as those with embryonic type, malformation, cytomegalovirus infection, and severe fibrosis, an early Kasai procedure may not achieve adequate bile drainage. In these cases, it might be more beneficial to avoid the Kasai operation's impact and proceed directly to liver transplantation. This approach requires further research and the development of a more valuable evaluation system.

### Impact of age at Kasai operation on its results in late childhood and adolescence: a rational basis for biliary atresia screening [^116eh3B9]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Increased age at surgery has a negative impact on the results of the Kasai operation for biliary atresia in infancy and early childhood. It remained unclear if an age threshold exists and if this effect persists with extended follow-up. In this study, we examined the relationship between increased age at surgery and its results in adolescence.

- **Methods**: All patients with biliary atresia who were living in France and born between 1986 and 2002 were included. The median follow-up in survivors was 7 years.

- **Results**: Included in the study were 743 patients with biliary atresia, 695 of whom underwent a Kasai operation; 2-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates with native liver were 57.1%, 37.9%, 32.4%, and 28.5%, respectively. The median age at the Kasai operation was 60 days and remained stable over the study period. Whatever the follow-up (2, 5, 10, or 15 years), survival rates with native liver decreased when age at surgery increased (≤ 30, 31–45, 46–60, 61–75, and 76–90 days). Accordingly, we estimated that if every patient with biliary atresia underwent the Kasai operation before 46 days of age, 5.7% of all liver transplantations performed annually in France in patients younger than 16 years could be spared.

- **Conclusions**: Increased age at surgery had a progressive and sustained deleterious effect on the results of the Kasai operation until adolescence. These findings indicate a rational basis for biliary atresia screening to reduce the need for liver transplantations in infancy and childhood.

### Number of cholangitis episodes as a prognostic marker to predict timing of liver transplantation in biliary atresia patients after Kasai portoenterostomy [^116M1CUp]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

The earlier BA patients developed cholangitis after KP, the more likely they were to require LT. However, our findings indicated LT was not related to age at the first cholangitis episode, and the cumulative incidence of cholangitis was not related to LT in the first two years after KP. By contrast, the number of cholangitis episodes within two years after KP appeared to be a prognostic marker to predict future LT. This information could improve patient care and lead to more targeted research about optimizing treatment protocols for BA patients after KP.

In biliary atresia, the progression of hepatic fibrosis before the Kasai portoenterostomy may explain why age is a major determinant of the survival of the native liver. Blinded fibrosis scoring of surgical liver biopsies demonstrated that age and fibrosis correlate. Biopsies with severe fibrosis predicted significantly worse survival.

### Early surgical outcomes and pathological scoring values of older infants (≥ 90 d old) with biliary atresia [^113ZEBXS]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

This study aimed to analyze the impact of age at Kasai operation on the short-term outcome of type III biliary atresia (BA) and to determine if pathological scoring can predict the effect of the Kasai procedure for older infants (≥ 90 days).

- **Methods**: During the period from 2004 through 2010, 452 infants with type III BA were reviewed. The relationship between age at Kasai operation, jaundice clearance rates, and two-year native liver survival rates was assessed retrospectively. Pathological slides were analyzed using a histological scoring system.

- **Results**: All patients were divided into three groups according to their age at operation:
	- **Group A**: aged 60 days or less (n = 146)
	- **Group B**: aged between 60 and 90 days (n = 222)
	- **Group C**: aged 90 days or over (n = 84)

	- The worst outcome for clearance of jaundice was found in Group A but not in Group C two weeks after the operation (P < 0.05). Jaundice clearance rates showed no difference among the three groups at either 3 months or 6 months post-operation. Additionally, in Group C, the pathological scores showed no difference between the jaundice clearance group and the jaundice persistence group 6 months after surgery. In Group C, the two-year survival rate of patients with native livers was 36.1%.

- **Conclusion**: Some patients over 90 days of age at surgery can still benefit from a Kasai procedure. The pathological scoring system does not predict jaundice clearance in patients over 90 days of age at surgery.

### Biliary atresia as a disease starting in utero: Implications for treatment, diagnosis, and pathogenesis [^112KrvPf]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Biliary atresia (BA) is the most common reason for pediatric liver transplant. BA's varied presentation, natural history, and treatment with the Kasai portoenterostomy have been well described; however, when BA starts relative to birth has not been clearly defined. In this review, we discuss laboratory, imaging, and clinical data which suggest that most, if not all, forms of BA may start before birth. This early onset has implications in terms of delivering treatments earlier and identifying possible factors underlying BA's etiology.

### Prompt distinction of Alagille syndrome and biliary atresia in infants: A comparative study [^1168hVRo]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

In this study, 9 ALGS patients (64.3%, 9/14) underwent biliary exploration due to suspected BA. Among them, Patient 3 underwent Kasai portoenterostomy based on a strong suspicion of BA; however, postoperative jaundice persisted without significant improvement. Subsequent genetic analysis revealed a pathogenic JAG1 mutation. During follow-up, the patient developed persistent pruritus and progressively exhibited the characteristic facial features of ALGS. At 7 years of age, the patient had not undergone liver transplantation, remained on ursodeoxycholic acid for systemic pruritus, and demonstrated height and weight measurements below 1–2 standard deviations for age. Based on the genetic findings and evolving clinical manifestations, the final diagnosis was revised to ALGS rather than BA. Patients 4 and 9 died of liver failure. Three patients (Patients 5, 7, and 14) underwent liver transplantation. Patient 11 developed cirrhosis at age 2 years and is being prepared for liver transplantation. The remaining seven patients are stable and regularly followed up.

All patients in the BA group underwent exploratory laparotomy. Among them, 19 patients received Kasai portoenterostomy. Of these, 6 patients eventually underwent liver transplantation due to progressive liver dysfunction and are currently under regular follow-up. Among the 9 patients who did not undergo the Kasai procedure, 3 received primary liver transplantation due to advanced liver cirrhosis (stage III–IV) at the time of diagnosis, which made them unsuitable candidates for the Kasai procedure.

### Biliary atresia [^111YNyde]. Lancet (2009). Low credibility.

Biliary atresia is a rare disease of infancy that has evolved over 30 years from being fatal to a disorder for which effective palliative surgery or curative liver transplantation, or both, are available. Good outcomes for infants depend on early referral and timely Kasai portoenterostomy; thus, a high index of suspicion is needed for investigating infants with persistent jaundice. In centers with extensive experience in treating this disorder, up to 60% of children will achieve biliary drainage after Kasai portoenterostomy and have serum bilirubin within the normal range within six months.

Eighty percent of children who attain satisfactory biliary drainage will reach adolescence with a good quality of life without undergoing liver transplantation. Although much is known about the management of biliary atresia, many aspects are poorly understood, including its pathogenesis. Several hypotheses exist, implicating genetic predisposition and dysregulation of immunity, but the cause is probably multifactorial, with obliterative extrahepatic cholangiopathy as the common endpoint. Researchers are focused on the identification of relevant genetic and immune factors, and understanding serum and hepatic factors that drive liver fibrosis after Kasai portoenterostomy. These factors might become therapeutic targets to halt the inevitable development of cirrhosis and the need for liver transplantation.

### Optimal timing for solids introduction - why are the guidelines always changing [^117BB4YT]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

There have been dramatic changes in the timing of the first exposure to solid foods for children over the last 40 years, ranging from exposure prior to 4 months of age for most infants in the 1960s, to guidelines recommending delaying solids until after 6 months of age introduced in the 1990s. Infant diet, specifically the age of weaning and age at introduction of allergenic foods, has long been thought to play a role in food allergy. However, controversy surrounding the relationship between the timing of introduction of foods and the development of food allergies has led to a plethora of inconsistent infant feeding guidelines both between and within countries.

The aims of this article were to discuss the history of changing guidelines for the optimal timing of the introduction of solids in general and allergenic solids in particular, and the evidence (or lack thereof) underpinning recommendations at each of these time points. We present the clinical equipoise with regard to recently revised guidelines published almost simultaneously in the UK, US, and Australia and argue that guideline modification about the timing of introduction, both for high-risk infants and the general population, will require a careful review of emerging literature to provide a true evidence base to inform public health practice such as infant feeding guidelines.

### Number of cholangitis episodes as a prognostic marker to predict timing of liver transplantation in biliary atresia patients after Kasai portoenterostomy [^114bDXiD]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

We further evaluated the relationship between the number of cholangitis episodes and liver transplantation (LT).

- **Cholangitis episodes in both groups**: The numbers of cholangitis episodes in both groups are shown in Fig. 3. There was no association between the number of cholangitis episodes and LT one year after Kasai portoenterostomy (KP), with a mean of 1.8 episodes (95% CI 1.5–2.0) in the non-LT group (n = 144) and 2.2 episodes (95% CI 1.7–2.6) in the LT group (n = 58), respectively, P = 0.063. However, the number of cholangitis episodes and LT were associated two years after the operation, with a mean of 2.2 episodes (95% CI 1.9–2.4) in the non-LT group (n = 132) and 3.5 episodes (95% CI 2.5–4.4) in the LT group (n = 38), P < 0.001.

- **Figure 3 comparison**: The number of cholangitis episodes did not differ between the non-liver transplantation (LT) group (n = 144), with a mean of 1.8 episodes (95% CI 1.5–2.0), and the LT group (n = 66), with a mean of 2.2 episodes (95% CI 1.8–2.7) one year after Kasai portoenterostomy (KP). However, a significant difference was observed two years after the operation, with a mean of 2.2 episodes (95% CI 1.9–2.4) in the non-LT group (n = 132) and 3.5 episodes (95% CI 2.5–4.4) in the LT group (n = 38), P < 0.001.

### Number of cholangitis episodes as a prognostic marker to predict timing of liver transplantation in biliary atresia patients after Kasai portoenterostomy [^113U5ZJr]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Biliary atresia (BA) is a potentially fatal disease in young infants, with an incidence ranging from approximately 1:3200 to 1:19,800 live births worldwide. Its pathogenesis involves progressive obliteration of biliary ducts. With early diagnosis and timely performance of Kasai portoenterostomy (KP), BA patients can have a significantly improved prognosis, and liver transplantation (LT) can be postponed. Since stool card screening is universally implemented in Taiwan, the positive prediction rate for BA diagnosis can reach 97% and the rate of patients undergoing KP before 60 days of age is increasing nationally. However, some studies have reported a considerable number of BA patients still requiring LT during childhood despite the timely performance of KP.

In addition, several risk factors, such as the jaundice-free period, occurrence of cholangitis, and age at the time of KP, are predictive of liver failure in BA patients after KP. Among these variables, cholangitis is one of the most commonly seen complications in BA patients after KP and affects more than 50% of patients despite the use of treatment strategies employing corticosteroids and prophylactic antibiotics after the operation. Moreover, studies have shown that early cholangitis may impact late-presenting liver failure, and cholangitis within 3 months after KP appears to associate with LT. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether the number of cholangitis episodes could be used as a prognostic marker for LT in BA patients after KP.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cholangiocarcinoma [^112QPfAv]. Gut (2023). High credibility.

- **Strength of recommendation**: Strong

- **Quality of evidence**: Moderate

- **Recommendation 34**: Liver transplantation for selected patients with perihilar CCA (pCCA) in the presence of chronic liver disease (most commonly primary sclerosing cholangitis), less than 3 cm in size, with no evidence of extrahepatic disease, results in long-term disease-free survival. This is an established indication in an increasing number of centres internationally. There is a need for evaluation of novel neoadjuvant chemoradiation strategies and assessment of long-term outcomes with national protocols and multicentre studies. Liver transplantation in the absence of background chronic liver disease remains an investigational treatment.

- **Strength of recommendation**: Moderate

- **Quality of evidence**: Strong

- **Recommendation 35**: Neoadjuvant therapy in uncontrolled studies appears to be effective in controlling disease and selecting patients who are most likely to benefit from transplantation.

- **Strength of recommendation**: Moderate

- **Quality of evidence**: Low

- **Recommendation 36**: Transplantation for intrahepatic CCA (iCCA) on a background of chronic liver disease precluding resection should be evaluated prospectively within a national protocol. LAG tumour size criteria are to be monitored and modified to improve recruitment for evaluation.

- **Strength of recommendation**: Strong

- **Quality of evidence**: Moderate

- **Recommendation 37**: Patients who have undergone surgical resection for CCA should be considered for 24 weeks of adjuvant chemotherapy (currently capecitabine).

### Hepatic ADC value correlates with cirrhotic severity of patients with biliary atresia [^116pqub9]. European Journal of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

At least 40% of survivors of biliary atresia have progressive cirrhosis even after undergoing Kasai operation. The values of hepatic apparent diffusion coefficient and apparent-diffusion-coefficient-related indices were applied to biliary atresia patients and correlated with cirrhotic severity scores of the model for end-stage liver disease or pediatric end-stage liver disease model, and Child-Turcotte and Child-Pugh systems.

- **Materials and methods**: Thirty-three biliary atresia patients (mean age = 1140 days, range = 61–4314 days) received magnetic resonance imaging examinations due to complications of biliary atresia from April 2008 to August 2009. Two non-breath-hold diffusion-weighted imaging sequences were performed with motion-probing gradients in three directions with two b values: 0/100 and 0/500 s/mm²; 1000 ms/61.1 ms, time to repeat/time to echo; number of excitations, 1.0; 8 mm section thickness; 40 cm × 40 cm field of view; 128 × 256 matrix in all biliary atresia patients and 18 control subjects. The Spearman rank correlation test was used to analyze the relationship among the scores of the model for end-stage liver disease or pediatric end-stage liver disease model, Child-Turcotte and Child-Pugh scores, and right hepatic apparent diffusion coefficients, apparent diffusion coefficient using a b factor of 500-albumin product, and alanine transaminase/apparent diffusion coefficient with b factor of 500 ratio.

- **Results**: The right hepatic apparent diffusion coefficient using a b factor of 100, apparent diffusion coefficient with b factor of 500, and product of apparent diffusion coefficient were analyzed.

### Development and post-Kasai procedure prognostic relevance of histological features for biliary atresia [^112tQrBu]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

A total of 68 infants met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were followed at our center during the study period. The clinical and laboratory characteristics of the patients at the time of the Kasai procedure (KP) are summarized below.

- **Baseline characteristics**: Female patients constituted 66.2% of the cases. The mean age at the time of surgical intervention was 62.5 ± 21.3 days, and the median follow-up time was 13 (5–20) months. Six (8.8%) patients were lost to follow-up evaluation. It was estimated that the 1-year native liver survival rate was 60.6%. By the end of follow-up, a total of 28 (41.2%) patients had undergone liver transplantation, and 5 (7.4%) patients had died of liver failure. Most death or liver transplantation events occurred within one year after the KP.

- **Liver biopsy characteristics**: The liver biopsy characteristics of the patient population are described with both Metavir and BA-specific staging showing the highest proportion of 28 (41.2%) cases at stage 3, while Ishak staging had the highest proportion of 28 (41.2%) cases at stage 4.

### Number of cholangitis episodes as a prognostic marker to predict timing of liver transplantation in biliary atresia patients after Kasai portoenterostomy [^1178tNWR]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

We used the catastrophic illness database of the NHIRD from the years 1998 to 2011 to conduct the analysis. BA patients were identified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis code, 751.61. Those born before 1998 were deliberately excluded to ensure that the selected sample was entirely comprised of newly diagnosed BA patients. Eighty-three BA patients without KP were excluded using the ICD-9-CM procedure code, 51.36. All the remaining 366 BA patients who underwent KP were followed up until the end of the study.

The indication for LT in Taiwan differs slightly from international pediatric practice guidelines, wherein it is usually reserved for end-stage cholestatic liver disease because living, related donors are the source for livers in Taiwan. LT is indicated for BA patients after KP with liver failure, portal hypertension, and failure to thrive. The validation of the performance of KP and LT was confirmed by Taiwan NHI codes, which hospitals use to apply for reimbursement.

- **Patient selection and study flowchart**: BA patients were divided into two groups, LT and non-LT, according to whether they received LT during the study period. Sex, age at KP, age at the end of the study, and mortality rates were compared between the two groups.

### Liver stiffness measurement predicts the difficulty of Kasai procedure in biliary atresia: a single center retrospective analysis of 199 patients [^116mSbN5]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The Kasai procedure is the standard initial treatment for infants with biliary atresia. The key to performing successful surgery is accurately removing the fibrous portal plate near the liver hilum. However, estimating surgical difficulty pre-operatively remains unclear. This study aims to design an algorithm predicting the difficulty of the Kasai procedure using liver stiffness measurement (LSM).

- **Methods**: One hundred ninety-nine patients were included from April 2012 to December 2016. All patients were surgically diagnosed with biliary atresia. Group A comprised patients with porta hepatis retraction (the angle between the plane of the fibrous porta plate and the plane of the medial liver closest to the plate was equal to or smaller than 90°), and Group B comprised patients without porta hepatis retraction (the angle between the plane of the fibrous porta plate and the plane of the medial liver closest to the plate was greater than 90°). Liver function measurements and LSM were measured for all patients within three days before surgery.

- **Results**: Our study included 19 cases in Group A (9 males, 10 females) and 180 cases in Group B (87 males, 93 females). LSM showed statistical differences between the two groups, 28.10 (14.90) kPa vs. 10.89 (7.10) kPa, P = 0.000. There was a significant relationship between LSM and operative age, TBA, AST, and GGT (P = 0.000, 0.003, 0.003, 0.012, correlation coefficient = 0.323, 0.213, 0.207, 0.179). The AUROC of LSM was 0.919. When the cutoff value was 15.15 kPa (OR = 3.989; P = 0.000), the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and diagnostic accuracy were noted.

### Risk assessment of liver transplantation after Kasai portoenterostomy in children and adults [^111ZLRdf]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2023). Low credibility.

Reports of liver transplantation (LT) after Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE) in adult patients with biliary atresia are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes and investigate the risk factors of LT after KPE in both pediatric and adult patients.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed a prospective database of patients with biliary atresia who underwent LT after KPE. Eighty-nine consecutive patients were included, and risk factors for in-hospital mortality after LT were assessed.

- **Results**: The median age of the patients was 2 years (range, 0–45 years). Forty-six patients (51.7%) had a history of upper abdominal surgery after KPE. The in-hospital mortality rate was 5.6% (5 patients). Of these, 80% of patients with mortality were aged ≥ 17 years, and all patients with mortality had a history of two or more upper abdominal surgeries. In the univariate and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses, age ≥ 17 years and the number of previous upper abdominal surgeries ≥ 2 were identified as possible risk factors.

- **Conclusions**: Our study suggests that older age and multiple previous upper abdominal surgeries are important risk factors for mortality after LT following KPE. We believe that these findings will serve as indications for safe LT in future patients.

### Biliary atresia liver histopathological determinants of early post-Kasai outcome [^11557toE]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). High credibility.

A retrospective chart review of liver histologies in Kasai biliary atresia (BA) patients operated on between January 2017 and July 2019 at our institution was conducted to identify histologic prognostic factors for biliary outcome.

- **Methods**: Patients with wedge liver biopsies and portal plate biopsies (n = 85) were categorized into unfavorable and favorable outcomes based on a 3-month serum total bilirubin level. A total bilirubin level of 34 μM correlates with worse 1-year survival. Age at surgery, histologic fibrosis, or inflammation do not predict the outcome. Potential adverse predictors include severe hepatocellular swelling, severe cholestasis, presence of ductal plate malformation (DPM) (n = 24), and portal plate bile duct size < 150 µm (n = 28). In multivariate analyses adjusting for age at Kasai procedure and postoperative cholangitis, bile duct size and severe hepatocellular swelling remain independent histologic prognosticators (OR 3.25, p = 0.039 and OR 3.26, p = 0.006 respectively), but not DPM.

- **Conclusion**: Advanced histologic findings of portal plate bile duct size of < 150 µm and severe hepatocellular damage predict poor post-Kasai jaundice clearance and short-term survival outcome, irrespective of Kasai timing.

- **Level of evidence**: Level III.

### Relevant factors for early liver transplantation after Kasai portoenterostomy [^114rU4sj]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

In this report, the biochemical indicators of liver function (ALT, AST, TBIL, DBIL, ALP, and GGT) of children undergoing early liver transplantation (LT) were higher than those with advanced LT. Pathological examination confirmed liver cirrhosis in all patients. Therefore, it is suggested that liver function deteriorates rapidly after Kasai portoenterostomy (KP) in patients undergoing early LT. Studies have found that factors affecting KP's prognosis include the age at operation, jaundice clearance, cholangitis, and liver pathological changes. There is a close relationship between KP prognosis and liver transplantation. Therefore, this study explores the risk factors of early LT after KP by analyzing the factors that may affect the prognosis of KP.

Biliary atresia is a progressive disease. The earlier it is diagnosed, the lighter the hepatic fibrosis and the infiltration of inflammatory cells around the bile ducts. Thus, the prognosis after surgical treatment is much better theoretically. The 20-year survival rate of the native liver in patients with an age at initial Kasai operation of less than 70 days was significantly higher than those more than 70 days (50.88% vs. 28.57%). Nio et al. classified 242 patients with type III biliary atresia into six groups based on their age at KP and demonstrated that the age at portoenterostomy and the jaundice clearance rate were significantly inversely correlated. Schreiber et al. found that the 10-year native liver survival rate of patients undergoing the Kasai operation at age ≤ 30 days was 49%, while it was only 15% in the > 90 days group.

### Development and post-Kasai procedure prognostic relevance of histological features for biliary atresia [^114iMjGL]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

There was a correlation between fibrosis grade and the histological features (Fig. 2 C). The portal inflammation grade correlated significantly with the BA-specific stage (r = 0.31; p < 0.01). Ductal proliferation showed significant correlation with three liver fibrosis staging systems: Ishak (r = 0.54; p < 0.0001), Metavir (r = 0.55; p < 0.0001), and BA-specific (r = 0.49; p < 0.0001). In contrast, intrahepatic cholestasis did not correlate with any of the three liver fibrosis staging systems.

- **Association of liver histology with jaundice clearance**: The overall trend of jaundice clearance (JC) decreased as the degree of liver fibrosis and pathological features increased (Fig. 3 A, B). Following a univariate analysis, Ishak/Metavir staging (OR 5.2, 95% CI 1.73–15.64, p = 0.002) and BA-specific staging (OR 6.29, 95% CI 2.08–19.02, p = 0.001) were identified as potential independent indicators of poor JC (Table 2). Notably, 73.3% of patients with poor JC were stage 3–4 according to BA-specific staging.

There was no significant association between JC and other histopathological features or various laboratory data. However, Metavir/Ishak staging (p = 0.953), BA-specific staging (p = 0.06), and age at the Kasai procedure (KP) (p = 0.211) had no significant effect on JC when multivariate analyses were performed (Table 2). The ROC curve analysis for predicting JC using the liver fibrosis staging systems revealed an AUC of 0.667 (95% CI: 0.526–0.807, p = 0.025) for Metavir, 0.683 (95% CI: 0.548–0.817, p = 0.014) for Ishak, and 0.720 (95% CI: 0.595–0.846, p = 0.003) for BA-specific (Fig. 3 C).

### Factors associated with timing and adverse outcomes in patients with biliary atresia undergoing Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy [^111Qozb5]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

To assess factors associated with the timing of hepatoportoenterostomy (HPE) and adverse perioperative outcomes in patients with biliary atresia in the US, we examined hospitalizations in infants aged less than 1 year using the National Inpatient Sample database for 2000–2011. We identified cases using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for biliary atresia and HPE. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association between select factors and age at HPE, as well as adverse perioperative outcomes.

Our analysis of 1,243 biliary atresia hospitalizations showed that only 37.7% of patients had HPE in the first 60 days of life. Patients who underwent HPE after 60 days of age were uninsured, more likely to be Black (aOR, 4.22; 95% CI, 1.49–11.95), less likely to be admitted to a teaching hospital (aOR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.10–0.79), and less likely to have a concomitant congenital malformation (aOR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25–0.98). Patients with delayed age at HPE incurred significantly higher hospital costs ($57,914 vs. $34,074; p = 0.026). Delayed age at HPE and weekend admission were independently associated with increased odds of adverse perioperative outcomes (aOR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01–3.02 and 3.98; 95% CI, 1.67–9.46, respectively).

Outcomes in patients with biliary atresia in the United States are suboptimal and result in higher costs. The specific factors associated with delayed care provide further evidence that universal health care and screening are needed for all infants.

### Biliary atresia/neonatal cholestasis: What is in the horizon [^115VewtZ]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Biliary atresia (BA) is a common cause of jaundice in infancy. There is increasing evidence that newborn screening with direct or conjugated bilirubin leads to earlier diagnosis. Although the Kasai portoenterostomy is the primary treatment, there are scientific advances in adjuvant therapies. As pediatric patients transition to adult care, multidisciplinary care is essential, given the complexity of this patient population.
