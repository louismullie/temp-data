## Question

What percentage of body weight is lost with orlistat?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what percentage of body weight is typically lost with orlistat. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the placebo-subtracted (true drug) effect at one year. Then, I should verify the total weight loss observed in trials that include lifestyle interventions. Next, I will check dose-response and time course. After that, I should confirm proportions achieving clinically meaningful thresholds like ≥ 5% and ≥ 10%. Finally, I need to consider population variability and real-world effectiveness before synthesizing a clear clinical bottom line.

> Let me first confirm the placebo-subtracted effect, because that best answers "how much weight is due to the medication itself" beyond lifestyle measures. Multiple meta-analyses and reviews converge on an additional 2–3 kg of weight loss at about 1 year with orlistat 120 mg three times daily versus placebo, which corresponds to roughly 2–3% of initial body weight on average, with JAMA reporting approximately 3% as a practical estimate at 1 year [^112DExf6] [^112SPp4Y] [^113wHne6] [^114rU8dV].

> Wait, let me verify the conversion to percent so I don't overstate it. If a typical trial participant weighs about 100 kg, an extra 2.3–3.0 kg corresponds to roughly 2.3–3.0% body weight; that aligns with the JAMA estimate of about 3% beyond lifestyle at one year, so the "pure drug effect" is best communicated as approximately 2.5–3.5% of baseline weight lost due to orlistat when added to diet and exercise, acknowledging trial-to-trial variability [^113wHne6] [^114rU8dV].

> Next, I should review absolute weight loss in full lifestyle-plus-drug arms to contextualize what patients see on the scale. In XENDOS, total loss at 1 year was about 10.6 kg with orlistat versus 6.2 kg with placebo, and at 4 years it was 5.8 kg versus 3.0 kg, indicating that total loss typically falls in the 5–10% range with roughly half attributable to concomitant lifestyle change rather than the drug itself, and a persistent but attenuated separation over time [^1134tCF5] [^115dCjyM].

> Hold on, I should verify dose-response because lower doses are marketed. Subgroup analyses show a clear dose-response, with orlistat 120 mg three times daily producing a significant benefit (about −2.3 kg placebo-subtracted at 12 months), whereas 60/30 mg dosing shows little to no significant effect, so the clinically effective regimen is 120 mg with meals three times daily [^112SPp4Y] [^116DT5e3].

> I will now examine the time course, because patients often ask when to expect results. Weight loss with orlistat tends to accrue over 6–12 months, with maximum separation from placebo around 1 year and partial attenuation thereafter; importantly, benefits persist in long-term studies, with approximately 2.1–2.2 kg placebo-subtracted differences maintained at 18–36 months in at least one trial and a durable separation in XENDOS through 4 years, reflecting sustained but modest pharmacologic support of weight control when adherence is maintained [^112SPp4Y] [^1134tCF5].

> Next, I should review how often patients achieve clinically meaningful thresholds. Odds of achieving at least 5% and 10% weight loss are increased with orlistat, with meta-analytic estimates around 2.7-fold for ≥ 5% and 2.4-fold for ≥ 10%, translating to roughly 35–73% and 20–30% of patients, respectively, depending on the population and study design; this underscores that while orlistat shifts the distribution favorably, a substantial minority fail to reach these milestones [^113wHne6] [^113bdb1M] [^113wHne6].

> I need to ensure I address population variability. In adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes, total losses are often in the 3–6% range with a placebo-subtracted effect again near 2–3%, with additional glycemic and lipid benefits that may be partly weight-loss independent; adolescents, in contrast, show small BMI reductions and modest weight effects, indicating lower efficacy in pediatric populations overall despite a statistical signal in some outcomes [^116c8YEd] [^116ie8Ao] [^116rMrXq] [^112QczWF].

> But wait, what about effectiveness outside trials, where adherence and diet composition vary. Real-world data from a large primary care cohort found no significant average weight loss with orlistat at 6 months, and persistence was low, highlighting that the modest pharmacologic effect can be negated by poor adherence, tolerability issues, and inconsistent dietary fat restriction, which are crucial to the mechanism of action [^116ryJMH].

> Let me reconsider the overall message to ensure clinical clarity. The most accurate way to answer "percentage of body weight lost with orlistat" is to separate the pure drug effect from the total observed change: at one year, orlistat 120 mg three times daily produces approximately 2.5–3.5% additional weight loss beyond lifestyle measures, while total losses in trials are commonly 5–10% with about half attributable to lifestyle interventions, the effect peaks by 6–12 months, attenuates but persists to 2–4 years, and only the 120 mg dose is consistently effective [^112DExf6] [^112SPp4Y] [^113wHne6] [^1134tCF5] [^114rU8dV].

> Clinical bottom line: For a motivated, adherent patient following a reduced-fat diet, the expected additional weight loss directly attributable to orlistat at one year is roughly 3% of initial body weight, with absolute trial totals around 5–10%, a higher likelihood of achieving ≥ 5% and ≥ 10% thresholds compared with placebo, and sustained but modest benefits over several years; however, effectiveness in routine practice depends heavily on adherence and tolerance of gastrointestinal side effects, so patient selection and dietary counseling are key [^113wHne6] [^111ZKAQB] [^112SPp4Y] [^1134tCF5] [^116ryJMH].

Orlistat produces a modest weight loss of **about 3% of initial body weight** [^113wHne6] over 1 year, with 35–73% of patients achieving ≥ 5% weight loss [^111ZKAQB] and 16–36% achieving ≥ 10% [^112DExf6]. The placebo-subtracted weight loss is 2.3–2.9 kg [^112DExf6], and long-term maintenance is limited by gastrointestinal side effects and adherence [^116DT5e3] [^112SPp4Y].

## Percentage of weight loss with orlistat

- **Mean percentage weight loss**: Orlistat produces a mean weight loss of approximately 3% [^113wHne6] of initial body weight over 1 year [^111ZKAQB].

- **Placebo-subtracted weight loss**: The placebo-subtracted weight loss with orlistat is approximately 2.3–2.9 kg [^112DExf6] over 1 year [^113bdb1M].

- **Clinically significant weight loss**: Orlistat increases the likelihood of achieving clinically significant weight loss (≥ 5% of initial body weight) [^112DExf6] compared to placebo [^111ZKAQB].

---

## Proportion of patients achieving clinically significant weight loss

Approximately 35–73% of patients treated with orlistat achieve **≥ 5% weight loss** [^113wHne6] over 1 year. Additionally, **16–36%** [^111ZKAQB] achieve ≥ 10% weight loss over 1 year [^113wHne6].

---

## Long-term weight loss maintenance

Long-term weight loss maintenance with orlistat is limited [^1126UCF6], with **significant weight regain** observed after therapy is discontinued [^112SPp4Y]. Adherence is often limited by **gastrointestinal side effects** [^112DExf6], which can impact long-term maintenance [^112SPp4Y].

- **Pharmacological interventions**: At 12 months, four pharmacological intervention studies, including eight comparisons, examined the effects of orlistat combined with lifestyle change compared with placebo and lifestyle change. The overall mean difference was −1.80 kg (95% confidence interval −2.54 to −1.06 kg; I² = 34%). Subgroup analyses by dose of orlistat (120 mg vs. 60/30 mg three times daily) showed a dose-response relation. Studies using 120 mg of orlistat displayed a mean difference of −2.34 kg (−3.03 to −1.65 kg, I² = 0%) compared with −0.70 kg (−1.92 to 0.52 kg; I² = 13%) in studies using a 60/30 mg dose. The treatment effect was significantly greater in the subgroup of studies using a 120 mg dose of orlistat (test for subgroup differences P = 0.02; I² = 81%).

Figure 4 illustrates the mean difference in weight change at 12 months after initial weight loss in pharmacological intervention studies. O120 represents orlistat 120 mg three times daily; O60 represents orlistat 60 mg three times daily; and O30 represents orlistat 30 mg three times daily. OO v OP compares groups who lost weight using orlistat 120 mg and a low energy diet for 1 year, followed by randomization to continued orlistat 120 mg treatment or a placebo condition. PO v PP compares groups who lost weight using a placebo and a low energy diet for 1 year, followed by randomization to continued orlistat 120 mg treatment or a placebo condition.

One study testing the 120 mg dose provided long-term follow-up at 18 and 36 months, with mean differences of −2.10 kg (95% confidence interval −4.09 to −0.11 kg) and −2.20 kg (−4.01 to −0.39 kg), respectively.

### Long term pharmacotherapy for obesity and overweight: Updated meta-analysis [^112DExf6]. BMJ (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to summarize the long-term efficacy of anti-obesity drugs in reducing weight and improving health status. The research was designed as an updated meta-analysis of randomized trials.

- **Data sources**: Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, the Science Meta-register of Controlled Trials, and reference lists of identified articles were utilized. All data sources were searched from December 2002, the end date of the last search, to December 2006.

- **Studies reviewed**: Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials of approved anti-obesity drugs used in adults (age over 18) for one year or longer were reviewed.

- **Results**: Thirty trials of one to four years' duration met the inclusion criteria: 16 trials on orlistat (n = 10,631 participants), ten on sibutramine (n = 2,623), and four on rimonabant (n = 6,365). Of these, 14 trials were newly identified, and 16 had been previously recognized. Attrition rates averaged 30–40%. Compared with placebo, orlistat reduced weight by 2.9 kg (95% confidence interval: 2.5 kg to 3.2 kg), sibutramine by 4.2 kg (3.6 kg to 4.7 kg), and rimonabant by 4.7 kg (4.1 kg to 5.3 kg). Patients receiving active drug treatment were significantly more likely to achieve 5% and 10% weight loss thresholds. Orlistat reduced the incidence of diabetes and improved concentrations of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, along with blood pressure and glycemic control in patients with diabetes, but increased rates of gastrointestinal side effects and slightly lowered concentrations of high-density lipoprotein. Sibutramine improved concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides.

### Long-term drug treatment for obesity: a systematic and clinical review [^113wHne6]. JAMA (2014). Low credibility.

Thirty-six percent of US adults are obese, and many cannot lose sufficient weight to improve health with lifestyle interventions alone.

- **Objective**: To conduct a systematic review of medications currently approved in the United States for obesity treatment in adults. The review also discusses the off-label use of medications studied for obesity and provides considerations for obesity medication use in clinical practice.

- **Evidence review**: A PubMed search from inception through September 2013 was performed to find meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized, placebo-controlled trials for currently approved obesity medications lasting at least 1 year. These studies needed to have a primary or secondary outcome of body weight change, include at least 50 participants per group, report at least 50% retention, and present results on an intention-to-treat basis. Studies of medications approved for other purposes but tested for obesity treatment were also reviewed.

- **Findings**: Obesity medications approved for long-term use, when prescribed with lifestyle interventions, produce additional weight loss relative to placebo ranging from approximately 3% of initial weight for orlistat and lorcaserin to 9% for top-dose (15/92 mg) phentermine plus topiramate-extended release at 1 year. The proportion of patients achieving clinically meaningful (at least 5%) weight loss ranges from 37% to 47% for lorcaserin, 35% to 73% for orlistat, and 67% to 70% for top-dose phentermine plus topiramate-extended release. All three medications produce greater improvements in many cardiometabolic risk factors than placebo.

### Clinical efficacy of orlistat therapy in overweight and obese patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes: A 1-year randomized controlled trial [^116c8YEd]. Diabetes Care (2002). Low credibility.

Objective: Weight loss improves glycemic control, lipid profiles, and blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes; however, successful long-term weight loss is difficult for these patients, particularly those treated with insulin. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of orlistat, a gastrointestinal lipase inhibitor, on weight loss, glycemic control, and cardiovascular risk factors in overweight or obese insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients.

- **Research design and methods**: This study was a 1-year multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of orlistat (120 mg three times a day) or placebo combined with a reduced-calorie diet in overweight or obese adults (BMI 28–40 kg/m²) with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin alone or combined with oral agents, but with suboptimal metabolic control (HbA₁c 7.5–12.0%). Outcome measurements included changes in body weight, glycemic control, blood pressure, and serum lipids.

- **Results**: After 1 year, the orlistat group lost significantly more weight (-3.89 ± 0.3% of baseline body weight, means ± SE) than the placebo group (-1.27 ± 0.3%). Orlistat treatment, compared with placebo, produced greater decreases in HbA₁c (-0.62 ± 0.08 vs. -0.27 ± 0.08%, P = 0.002) and fasting serum glucose (-1.63 ± 0.3 vs. -1.08 ± 0.3 mmol/l, P = 0.02), as well as reductions in the required doses of insulin and other diabetic medications. Orlistat also led to greater improvements than placebo in serum total cholesterol (P = 0.0002), LDL cholesterol concentrations (P = 0.001), and LDL/HDL ratio (P = 0.01).

### Effects of orlistat on obesity-related diseases - a six-month randomized trial [^114j7o2i]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of orlistat on body weight and concomitant diseases in patients with a body mass index (BMI) > 28 kg/m² and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia.

- **Methods**: This trial was a six-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of orlistat 120 mg taken three times daily, combined with a mildly reduced-calorie diet. A total of 1,004 obese patients (BMI 28–40 kg/m²) were included by 253 private endocrinologists and received orlistat (n = 499) or placebo (n = 505). Patients were stratified by concomitant disorder: type 2 diabetes (n = 193), hypertension (n = 614), and hypercholesterolemia (n = 197). Body weight, anthropometry, lipid and glycemic control parameters, and blood pressure were measured.

- **Results**: After six months, orlistat produced significantly greater weight loss than placebo in the type 2 diabetes (-4.2% vs. -1.4%), hypertension (-6.2% vs. -1.9%), and hypercholesterolemia (-5.5% vs. -2.3%) groups (p ≤ 0.05). Weight reduction of ≥ 5% at 12 weeks was associated with the highest weight loss in each group, and the greatest decreases in HbA1c, LDL-cholesterol, and diastolic blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension, respectively, at six months. The incidence of adverse events was similar for orlistat and placebo, except for certain generally well-tolerated side effects.

### Precision medicine in adult and pediatric obesity: A clinical perspective [^115TyUER]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

There are five US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications for the long-term management of obesity in adults: orlistat, phentermine/topiramate, lorcaserin, naltrexone/bupropion, and liraglutide. Phentermine is approved for short-term weight loss, and studies have also shown topiramate monotherapy and exenatide to be effective. In adolescents 16 years of age or younger, orlistat is the only US FDA-approved medication for weight loss. However, many of the medications used in adults are also used in pediatric weight management clinical settings. It is important to note that our understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to weight loss for many of these medications remains incompletely understood.

Review of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) leading to US FDA approval of the available obesity pharmacotherapies largely shows a similar pattern: overall mean weight loss with considerable response variability on an individual level. Person-specific characteristics likely contribute to the heterogeneity in weight loss response seen in these large-scale RCTs. At the time of writing, numerous studies have examined characteristics associated with weight loss response to obesity pharmacotherapies. A majority of these investigations involve orlistat and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) in individuals with overweight/obesity, or topiramate in individuals with seizure disorders with or without obesity. Studies evaluating hormonal, genotypic, and neuronal predictors of weight loss response are rare.

### Xenical in the prevention of diabetes in obese subjects (XENDOS) study: A randomized study of orlistat as an adjunct to lifestyle changes for the prevention of type 2 diabetes in obese patients [^1134tCF5]. Diabetes Care (2004). Low credibility.

It is well established that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is closely linked to the presence and duration of overweight and obesity. A reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes with lifestyle changes has previously been demonstrated. We hypothesized that adding a weight-reducing agent to lifestyle changes may lead to an even greater decrease in body weight, and thus the incidence of type 2 diabetes, in obese patients.

- **Research design and methods**: In a 4-year, double-blind, prospective study, we randomized 3,305 patients to lifestyle changes plus either orlistat 120 mg or placebo, three times daily. Participants had a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² and normal (79%) or impaired (21%) glucose tolerance (IGT). Primary endpoints were time to onset of type 2 diabetes and change in body weight. Analyses were by intention to treat.

- **Results**: Of orlistat-treated patients, 52% completed treatment compared with 34% of placebo recipients (P < 0.0001). After 4 years of treatment, the cumulative incidence of diabetes was 9.0% with placebo and 6.2% with orlistat, corresponding to a risk reduction of 37.3% (P = 0.0032). Exploratory analyses indicated that the preventive effect was explained by the difference in subjects with IGT. Mean weight loss after 4 years was significantly greater with orlistat (5.8 vs. 3.0 kg with placebo; P < 0.001) and similar between orlistat recipients with impaired (5.7 kg) or normal glucose tolerance (5.8 kg) at baseline. A second analysis, in which the baseline weights of subjects who dropped out of the study were carried forward, also demonstrated significant results.

### Orlistat maintains biliary lipid composition and hepatobiliary function in obese subjects undergoing moderate weight loss [^117Rp4in]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Orlistat, an intestinal lipase inhibitor, has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of obesity. The effects of orlistat on hepatobiliary function have not been previously defined. A 4-week study was performed involving modest weight loss in obese subjects to observe any short-term hepatobiliary responses that occur after initiating treatment with orlistat and a hypocaloric diet.

- **Methods**: A total of 23 obese (BMI 30–41 kg/m2) subjects were randomized to a double-blind treatment with 120 mg of orlistat or a placebo, taken three times a day, in conjunction with a hypocaloric diet (1200–1500 kcal/day). The study aimed to achieve similar modest weight loss in both groups to directly assess the effects of orlistat. Cholesterol saturation, bile composition, and gallbladder motility were measured.

- **Results**: At the end of the treatment period, mean weight loss of 3.8 kg was achieved in the orlistat group (vs. 2.3 kg with placebo, p = NS). Total bile acid concentration decreased significantly with placebo (-18.57 ± 6.99 mmol/L; 95% CI = -32.26 to -4.87), but not with orlistat. Biliary phospholipid concentration decreased significantly with placebo (-4.38 ± 1.91 mmol/L; 95% CI = -8.13 to -0.64), but not with orlistat. Mean changes from baseline in cholesterol saturation index and gallbladder motility were similar in both groups. Microscopy of bile failed to reveal cholesterol microcrystals before or after treatment in either group.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings indicate a primary initial effect of weight loss is a reduction in biliary function changes associated with the active component.

### Treatment effects on measures of body composition in the TODAY clinical trial [^116uDcvK]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment effects on indices of adiposity show that all changes in measures of adiposity with different treatments, as well as differences between treatment groups, even if statistically significant, were small. During the first six months of treatment, all measures of adiposity declined in the M+L group but increased slightly in the other groups. The changes in the M+L group were significantly lower than in the M+R group for four out of five measures (BMI, percent fat mass, abdominal height, and absolute fat mass) and lower than the M group for three measures (BMI, percent fat mass, and absolute fat mass); M was not significantly different from M+R.

By 24 months, all measures of adiposity had increased relative to baseline in all treatment groups, except for percent fat mass in M+L. All changes were significantly greater in M+R than in either M or M+L, and there were no statistically significant differences between M and M+L.

- **Table 1**: Body composition model-adjusted mean (SE) change from baseline and significant treatment group comparisons.

- **Figure 1**: LSmean change from baseline for BMI (A) and percent fat mass (B) at 6 and 24 months, by treatment. Treatment groups are denoted by M for metformin alone, M+R for metformin + rosiglitazone, and M+L for metformin + intensive lifestyle intervention. LSmeans and P values are outputs from an analysis modeling BMI and percent fat mass change from baseline (6–0 months and 24–0 months) as a function of baseline value, treatment, and period (0–6 or 0–24 months).

### Effects of a novel weight-loss combination product containing orlistat and acarbose on obesity: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^115bawmL]. Obesity (2022). High credibility.

This study investigates the effects of a novel weight-loss combination product containing orlistat and acarbose on obesity through a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Empros Pharma AB funded the trial and provided the clinical research organization (CRO) with the trial synopsis. The funder and the CRO collaborated in discussing the design of the trial, while the CRO was responsible for drafting the protocol, the statistical analysis plan, collecting data, and performing the statistical analyses. Following the database lock, the funder had access to the data. Both the funder and the authors interpreted the data and collectively authored the manuscript, ensuring comprehensive access to the trial data.

### The relationship between early weight loss and weight loss maintenance with naltrexone-bupropion therapy [^114wPCZn]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Low credibility.

The weight loss effects of orlistat, a gastric and pancreatic lipase inhibitor, were also evaluated over the long term. The 4-year double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled XENDOS trial randomized 3304 subjects with obesity to receive orlistat or placebo (each in addition to lifestyle changes). After 4 years, mean weight loss was 5.8 kg with orlistat and 3.0 kg with placebo (P < 0.001).

The strengths of our analysis are the large number of patients included and the well-defined and diverse methodologies and populations of the component studies. The limitations include the inherent drawbacks of post-hoc studies, missing data from the subsequent time points of the analysis, and the relatively low number of individuals who had ≥ 10% weight loss at week 16, which limited the statistical power of our analysis to detect differences between NB and placebo in the comparisons of ≥ 10% weight loss maintenance. This refers to the power of detecting group differences in some of the studies because of the small sample size. For example, the COR-DM study had only 29 subjects in the treatment group and four in the placebo group. With this sample size, the power of detecting an 8.3% difference between these two groups is less than 50%. Another limitation of this study is that the population analyzed consisted predominantly of Caucasians, with a limited representation of Black/African American patients and patients of other or unknown races. Racial disparities in obesity and obesity treatment outcomes have been identified and reviewed extensively; therefore, this racial imbalance in the analyzed population is significant.

### EASL-EASD-EASO clinical practice guidelines on the management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) [^115ejP7f]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, specifically with respect to weight loss, the EASD/EASL/EASO 2024 guidelines recommend advising moderate weight reduction in adult patients with compensated cirrhosis and obesity. An emphasis is placed on high protein intake and physical activity to maintain muscle mass and reduce the risk of sarcopenia.

### Do we need anti-obesity drugs [^116DPy9a]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

The increasing global prevalence of obesity urgently requires the implementation of efficient preventive and therapeutic measures. Weight loss and its maintenance should be considered one of the most important strategies to reduce the incidence of obesity-related comorbidities, such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Lifestyle modification focused on diet and physical activity represents the essential component of any kind of weight management. However, only an intensive lifestyle intervention can be efficient in terms of long-term weight loss.

Anti-obesity drugs affect different targets in the central nervous system or peripheral tissues and improve regulatory and metabolic disturbances that contribute to the development of obesity. Anti-obesity medications provide modest additional fat loss beyond that achieved by lifestyle modification alone, reduce visceral fat stores, improve program adherence, and enhance weight loss maintenance. They also diminish obesity-related health risks and improve quality of life. Anti-obesity drugs do play a role in weight management, as their replacement with placebo is often followed by weight regain.

Due to adverse events, several anti-obesity drugs were withdrawn from the market over the past few years, and currently, only orlistat remains available for long-term obesity management. Drug withdrawals, failure of clinical trials with several new anti-obesity compounds, as well as inappropriate demands of drug regulating agencies concerning the study protocol, have led to skepticism about the perspectives in the pharmacotherapy of obesity. However, recently developed anti-obesity treatments offer new hope for effective management.

### Impact of orlistat therapy on weight reduction in morbidly obese patients after implantation of the Swedish adjustable gastric band [^113jziQb]. Obesity Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Adjustable gastric banding (AGB) is frequently performed to treat morbid obesity. One problem that can occasionally develop following a restrictive procedure is the consumption of a high-calorie liquid diet, which may prohibit further weight loss. Orlistat, a newly developed intestinal lipase inhibitor, prevents the absorption of about one-third of ingested fat. It is unknown whether patients who are no longer losing weight after AGB, despite further band restriction, may lose weight with the addition of orlistat.

- **Methods**: 38 patients were selected who had stopped losing weight 3 months before the initiation of the study, 18 ± 6 months (mean ± SEM) after laparoscopic AGB. Subjects were divided into 2 groups, matched for age, sex, filling volume of the band, and body mass index (BMI) both at the time of surgery and the start of the study (18 ± 6 months after AGB).

- **Results**: Patients in group A received dietary counseling and orlistat 120 mg TID for 8 months, while patients in group B received only dietary counseling. During the following 8 months of study, subjects in group A lost 8 ± 3 kg in weight, whereas subjects in group B lost 3 ± 2 kg (p < 0.01, months 18 vs. 26 of study; p < 0.03, group A vs. B). In 15 patients from group A, the study was further extended for 9 months, but interestingly, weight remained stable independent of whether orlistat was continued (n = 8) or stopped (n = 7). Four subjects were excluded from the extension study because of additional malabsorptive bypass surgery. Subjects taking orlistat encountered only minor GI side-effects.

- **Conclusion**: Orlistat appears to…

### Comparative efficiency and safety of pharmacological approaches to the management of obesity [^111TGBSw]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Currently, only two drugs, sibutramine and orlistat, are prescribed for long-term administration. The most important trial evaluating the long-term efficacy of sibutramine was the Sibutramine Trial of Obesity Reduction and Maintenance (STORM), which lasted for 2 years. In contrast, the XENical in the Prevention of Diabetes in Obese Subjects (XENDOS) study assessed orlistat's efficacy over a 4-year period in preventing type 2 diabetes in obese subjects. A meta-analysis of randomized trials revealed that sibutramine resulted in a weight reduction of 4.2 kg and orlistat 2.9 kg compared to placebo.

Four out of seven studies comparing sibutramine and orlistat monotherapy demonstrated that sibutramine was significantly more efficacious for weight loss. The remaining three studies showed equivalent effects. Modest weight loss (5–10%) in response to anti-obesity drug treatment was associated with improvements in lipid and glycemic profiles. Specifically, sibutramine improved concentrations of HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, while orlistat reduced the incidence of diabetes and improved concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.

Norris et al. conducted a meta-analysis on the efficacy of orlistat and sibutramine in obese adults with type 2 diabetes, finding only modest reductions in glycated hemoglobin (0.4% with orlistat and 0.7% with sibutramine). The improvement in lipid profile in response to sibutramine and orlistat is greater than expected from weight loss alone.

### Pharmacotherapy for adults with overweight and obesity: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114rU8dV]. Lancet (2024). High credibility.

Pharmacotherapy provides an option for adults with overweight and obesity to reduce their body weight if lifestyle modifications fail. We summarised the latest evidence for the benefits and harms of weight-lowering drugs.

- **Methods**: This systematic review and network meta-analysis included searches of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) from inception to March 23, 2021, for randomised controlled trials of weight-lowering drugs in adults with overweight and obesity. We performed frequentist random-effect network meta-analyses to summarise the evidence and applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation frameworks to rate the certainty of evidence, calculate the absolute effects, categorise interventions, and present the findings. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD 42021245678.

- **Findings**: Our search identified 14,605 citations, of which 132 eligible trials enrolled 48,209 participants. All drugs lowered body weight compared with lifestyle modification alone; all subsequent numbers refer to comparisons with lifestyle modification. High to moderate certainty evidence established phentermine-topiramate as the most effective in lowering weight (odds ratio [OR] of ≥ 5% weight reduction 8.02, 95% CI 5.24 to 12.27; mean difference [MD] of percentage body weight change -7.98, 95% CI -9.27 to -6.69) followed by GLP-1 receptor agonists (OR 6.33, 95% CI 5.00 to 8.00; MD -5.79, 95% CI -6.34 to -5.25). Naltrexone-bupropion (OR 2.69, 95% CI 2.10 to 3.44), phentermine-topiramate (2.40, 1.68 to 3.44), GLP-1 receptor agonists (2·).

### Effect of orlistat-induced weight loss on blood pressure and heart rate in obese patients with hypertension [^112CxfRv]. Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

To investigate the effects of long-term weight management with orlistat on blood pressure in obese hypertensive patients, a meta-analysis was conducted. It included data from five multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled studies conducted in Europe and the United States.

Obese adults, with a body mass index (BMI) of 28–43 kg/m², who had uncontrolled diastolic hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), were eligible for inclusion. Following a 4-week placebo lead-in period, patients were randomized to receive orlistat 120 mg or placebo three times daily, along with a mildly reduced-calorie diet for 1 year.

The primary efficacy parameter was the change in body weight. Secondary efficacy parameters included blood pressure, heart rate, and systolic workload. A total of 628 patients were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. After 56 weeks, patients treated with orlistat had lost significantly more body weight than those receiving placebo (8.0% versus 4.0%).

Overall, weight loss of ≥ 10% was associated with significant reductions in blood pressure, heart rate, and systolic workload. In conclusion, orlistat promotes clinically meaningful weight loss associated with these reductions.

### Drug therapy in obesity: A review of current and emerging treatments [^111UWtkU]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Orlistat is a selective inhibitor of pancreatic lipase, which moderates the intestinal digestion and absorption of fat. It is approved for use by both the FDA and EMA. Orlistat should be taken with meals and is available both by prescription and over the counter in lower doses in the UK. It is indicated for patients with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 28 kg/m² in association with other risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidaemia. While people with obesity using orlistat lose an extra 2.9–3.4 kg over 12 months, gastrointestinal side effects, reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, and steatorrhea are common. A recent systematic review observed a mean weight loss of 3.1 kg associated with orlistat use. Additional metabolic benefits include reduced blood pressure (systolic, 1.15 mmHg; diastolic, 1.07 mmHg) and reduced circulating lipids (total cholesterol, 0.30 mmol/l; low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, 0.27 mmol/l; triglycerides, 0.09 mmol/l). One study found the cost of weight loss per kilogram associated with orlistat was US$546, with a cost of US$71,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) in Europe.

Phentermine is a sympathomimetic that stimulates noradrenaline release to suppress appetite, while topiramate is an anticonvulsant that augments the weight loss associated with phentermine use, though the mechanism of appetite suppression is unclear. It is an effective weight loss agent with studies observing 6.6–8.6.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, specifically concerning weight loss, the EASD/EASL/EASO 2024 guidelines recommend advising weight loss through dietary modifications and behavioral therapy to improve liver injury in adult patients with MASLD. Aim for a sustained reduction of ≥ 5% to reduce liver fat, 7–10% to improve liver inflammation, and ≥ 10% to improve fibrosis.

### Effect of orlistat on weight and body composition in obese adolescents: A randomized controlled trial [^116rMrXq]. JAMA (2005). High credibility.

The prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents is increasing rapidly. In this population, behavioral therapy alone has had limited success in providing meaningful, sustained weight reduction, and pharmacological treatment has not been extensively studied. To address this, the study's objective was to determine the efficacy and safety of orlistat in weight management of adolescents.

This multicenter, 54-week randomized, double-blind study, conducted from August 2000 to October 2002, included 539 obese adolescents (aged 12–16 years; body mass index [BMI] ≥ 2 units above the 95th percentile) at 32 centers in the United States and Canada. The interventions included administering a 120-mg dose of orlistat (n = 357) or placebo (n = 182) three times daily for one year, along with a mildly hypocaloric diet (30% fat calories), exercise, and behavioral therapy.

- **Main outcome measures**: Change in BMI; secondary measures included changes in waist and hip circumference, weight loss, lipid measurements, and glucose and insulin responses to oral glucose challenge.

The results showed a decrease in BMI in both treatment groups up to week 12, thereafter stabilizing with orlistat but increasing beyond baseline with placebo. At the end of the study, BMI had decreased by 0.55 with orlistat but increased by 0.31 with placebo (P = 0.001). Compared with 15.7% of the placebo group, 26.5% of participants taking orlistat had a 5% or higher decrease in BMI (P = 0.005); 4.5% and 13.3%, respectively, had a 10% or higher decrease in BMI (P = 0.002). At study end, weight had increased by 0.53 kg with orlistat and 3.14 kg with placebo (P < .001).

### Pharmacotherapy of obesity: An update on the available medications and drugs under investigation [^115dCjyM]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Orlistat (Xenical, Alli) was investigated in the XENical in the Prevention of Diabetes in Obese Subjects (XENDOS) study. This study enrolled men and women with obesity and without type 2 diabetes. Participants were assigned to take Orlistat 120 mg ter in die (TID) or a placebo TID for a period of four years. All patients followed a reduced-calorie diet (minus 800 calories/day) consisting of 30% fat and no more than 300 mg of cholesterol per day. They were also advised to walk 1 km per day.

The mean age of participants ranged from 43.0 to 43.7 years, with 55% being women. The baseline mean BMI was 37 kg/m². At the one-year mark, the mean total body weight loss was 10.6 kg in the intervention group (n = 1487) and 6.2 kg in the placebo group (n = 1295), with standard deviation not available. At four years, mean total body weight loss compared to baseline was 5.8 kg for the intervention group (n = 851) and 3.0 kg for the placebo group (n = 567), with standard deviation not available. Compliance with the drug administration from the first dose until treatment dissolution was 93% for both Orlistat and placebo patients, and the overall dropout rate was 8%.

The XENDOS trial did not include patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, several trials have investigated the efficacy of Orlistat, alone or in combination with metformin or insulin treatment, in patients with overweight or obesity and DM with suboptimal control. In these studies, participants taking Orlistat achieved a significantly greater percent in total body weight loss (range of mean percent weight loss 3.9–6.2) compared to patients on placebo (mean percent weight loss 1.3–4.3).

### The effects of orlistat on body weight and glycaemic control in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^116ie8Ao]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

To assess the long-term effects of orlistat on body weight, glycaemic control, and cardiovascular risk factors in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes, a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted. It featured a 4-week placebo plus diet lead-in period followed by a 48-week, double-blind treatment period. Overweight or obese adults, with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 28 kg/m², having HbA1c levels of 6.5–11% and clinical type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive orlistat (120 mg t.i.d., n = 189) or placebo (n = 180) in conjunction with a low-calorie diet. Participants had either been on sulphonylurea therapy for at least 2 months before the study or were not receiving any antidiabetic medication (with most being drug-naïve).

After one year, patients in the orlistat group lost significantly more weight compared to those in the placebo group (-5.4% vs. -3.6%; p = 0.006). Additionally, a significantly higher proportion of patients achieved a weight loss of ≥ 5% with orlistat compared to placebo (51.3% vs. 31.6%; p = 0.0001). Patients treated with orlistat showed significantly greater improvements than placebo-treated patients in HbA1c (-0.9% vs. -0.4%; p < 0.001), fasting glucose (-1.6 vs. -0.7 mmol/l; p = 0.004), and post-prandial glucose (-1.8 vs. -0.5 mmol/l; p = 0.003). Moreover, orlistat-treated patients experienced a significantly greater reduction in LDL cholesterol compared to placebo. Overall, orlistat had a safety profile similar to placebo, with the exception of a higher incidence of generally mild and transient gastrointestinal events, which are known to be associated with its mode of action.

### Effects of orlistat on body mass index and serum lipids in overweight and obese adolescents: a meta-analysis [^112QczWF]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

We performed a meta-analysis to compare the effects of orlistat on body mass index and serum lipids in overweight and obese adolescents.

- **Methods**: The meta-analysis was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to 1 August 2024. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. The outcome measures included body mass index (BMI) and serum lipids, such as total cholesterol (TC), total triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). The review of publications followed the guidelines set forth in the Cochrane Handbook and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).

- **Results**: This study has been registered with INPLASY (number INPLASY202480052). A total of 696 patients were included in five randomized controlled trials. The orlistat group showed a reduction in BMI compared to placebo in the short term (MD = -0.73, 95% CI: -1.44 to -0.02, p = 0.04, I² = 73%) but appeared to have little effect in the long term (MD = -1.72, 95% CI: -3.55 to 0.12, p = 0.07, I² = 84%). Notably, orlistat significantly improved blood lipid levels in children for TC (MD = -8.11, 95% CI: -10.88 to -5.33, p < 0.05, I² = 0%), TG (MD = -3.22, 95% CI: -5.58 to -0.86, p < 0.05, I² = 0%), LDL (MD = -6.06, 95% CI: -8.75 to -3.37, p < 0.05, I² = 0%), and HDL (MD = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.13–1.61, p < 0.05, I² = 31%).

- **Conclusions**: Orlistat has been linked to altering lipid levels in obese or overweight children. However, the evidence regarding its efficacy in reducing BMI is inconclusive.

### Orlistat 120 mg improves glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients with or without concurrent weight loss [^1134Zwqj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Both obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Published data suggest that orlistat 120 mg, a lipase inhibitor used to treat obesity, may improve glycaemic parameters through weight loss-independent effects.

- **Aim**: To investigate the effect of orlistat 120 mg on weight loss and assess whether changes in glycaemic parameters — fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) — are independent of weight loss.

- **Methods**: This retrospective analysis of pooled data from seven multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies involved overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes (aged 18–70 years). Patients were required to have a body mass index of 27–43 kg/m², HbA1c of 6.5% or greater, and have been stable on oral agents for at least 3 months. Subjects received orlistat 120 mg tid or placebo for 6 or 12 months.

- **Results**: A total of 2550 overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled and randomized to treatment with orlistat 120 mg tid (n = 1279) or placebo (n = 1271). For the whole population, patients treated with orlistat 120 mg had significantly greater mean decreases in FPG compared with placebo-treated patients (-1.39 mmol/l vs. -0.47 mmol/l; p < 0.0001). In addition, orlistat 120 mg provided significantly larger mean decreases in HbA1c compared with placebo (-0.74% vs. -0.31%; p < 0.0001). For patients with minimal weight loss (≤ 1% of baseline body weight), orlistat 120 mg still provided a significantly greater decrease in the least squares mean value for both FPG (-0.83 mmol/l vs. ± 0.02 mmol/l; p = 0.0052).

### Effects of a novel weight-loss combination product containing orlistat and acarbose on obesity: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^112qGYEd]. Obesity (2022). High credibility.

Participants were recruited between May and August 2020, and the final participant visit was in March 2021. Of the 156 randomized participants, 149 constituted the modified ITT population and were assessed for the primary endpoint. Additionally, 135 completed the 28-week trial period. The PP population was composed of 122 participants across treatment groups. In total, 111 women and 45 men were randomized in the trial. There were no important differences between the three groups at baseline.

- **Trial profile**: Figure 1 outlines the trial profile. Abbreviations used include GI for gastrointestinal, ITT for intention-to-treat, and MR-OA for modified release - orlistat acarbose.

- **Primary outcomes**: As illustrated in Figure 2A, participants treated with both doses of EMP16 for 26 weeks lost more weight than those treated with placebo (p < 0.0001). Mean relative weight loss in the ITT population was −5.53% and −6.25% after 26 weeks of treatment with both EMP16–120/40 and EMP16–150/50, respectively, as compared with −0.83% in the placebo group at week 26. More participants in the active treatment groups lost at least 5% and 10% of their baseline body weight at week 26. Similar weight losses were seen in the PP population or using the more conservative imputation method.

### Long term maintenance of weight loss with non-surgical interventions in obese adults: Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^1126UCF6]. BMJ (2014). High credibility.

The main strength of this review is its comprehensive and rigorous search and meta-analytic synthesis of available evidence from randomized trials of non-surgical interventions for weight loss maintenance. However, our findings are applicable only to the contexts in which the studies have been conducted. Most included studies were conducted in the US and Scandinavia. Research in different countries and cultural settings would enhance generalizability.

Although energy prescriptions were poorly described in some weight loss maintenance intervention arms, participants seemed to receive advice to follow a regimen that continued to create an energy deficit, which was perhaps an unrealistic expectation for the long term. This distinction between weight loss and weight loss maintenance is important.

All but three trials in this review provided a standardized weight loss treatment before allocating participants to different weight loss maintenance arms. While this practice might be sensible in terms of trial management, it could limit the generalizability of the findings to those who respond well to the initial weight loss treatment. It does not provide an evidence base for weight loss maintenance that considers the many ways individuals initially lose weight.

This systematic review adds to our knowledge of weight loss maintenance by providing a comprehensive evaluation of the evidence base to identify what works in helping patients keep weight off after initial weight loss. Previous studies have not provided such a thorough examination.

### Long term maintenance of weight loss with non-surgical interventions in obese adults: Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^116DT5e3]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

This comprehensive systematic review of interventions for the maintenance of non-surgical weight loss suggests that it is possible to reduce weight regain through behavioral and pharmacological means. Lifestyle interventions targeting both dietary intake and physical activity are effective in reducing weight regain after initial weight loss in obese adults within 12 months of losing weight. There is some evidence that these effects can be further sustained at 24 months, though there is limited evidence beyond 24 months. The strength of the evidence is, however, limited; there was moderate heterogeneity and some evidence for potential risks of bias in terms of allocation concealment, outcome assessment, and publication bias. All but 23 trials reported results only for those participants who completed the interventions, so results should be interpreted with caution.

Orlistat added to a lifestyle intervention seemed to be more effective than the placebo and lifestyle intervention. Heterogeneity of effects was explained by a dose-response effect, with a dose of 120 mg three times a day reaching an effect estimate of −2.34 kg, and treatment with lower doses had a non-significant effect estimate of −0.70 kg. There was also evidence for sustainable effectiveness with orlistat 120 mg three times daily over 36 months. All orlistat studies reported significant increases in adverse effects in the form of an increased number of gastrointestinal events in participants taking orlistat compared with placebo, with some studies also reporting slight decreases in vitamin concentrations.

### Drug treatment of the overweight patient [^11411A97]. Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Three medications with approval for long-term use in the treatment of obesity are currently available in the United States. Sibutramine (U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] approved in 1997), orlistat (FDA approved in 1999), and rimonabant (available in Europe and given FDA approvable status in 2006 and expected to be marketed in 2007) represent modern approaches to medications used adjunctively for weight management.

As demonstrated in large clinical trials of 2 to 4 years' duration, these medications significantly increase weight loss compared with placebo; weight loss with these drugs reaches a nadir between 20 and 28 weeks, averaging 8%-10%, with the placebo contributing 4%-6% of that. Weight maintenance is demonstrated as long as adherence to medication continues.

All medications have side effects that need to be considered. For sibutramine, there is a rise in blood pressure and heart rate that may require discontinuation of the drug in a small percentage of patients. For orlistat, steatorrhea produces the principal gastrointestinal side effects. Rimonabant appears to have a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Nausea and gastrointestinal symptoms are the chief tolerability issues, but they are usually self-limited. In addition, there are several drugs and drug combinations in phase 2 or phase 3 trials that will be reported on in the coming years.

### Orlistat in the treatment of NASH: a case series [^115pwA3k]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is now recognized as a common chronic liver disorder. Up to 16% of affected patients may progress to cirrhosis. The incidence and prevalence of this disease are noted to be increasing, in parallel with the nationwide increase in obesity and diabetes. Treatment options for these patients remain quite limited; however, weight reduction has been advocated. There is little data to support this practice, as most patients are unable to comply with the proper dietary modifications. We report three obese patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis treated for 6–12 months with a weight reduction medication, orlistat, who lost between 22–42 lb and had significant clinical and histopathological improvement on follow-up.

### Effects of weight-loss medications on cardiometabolic risk profiles: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^11479p1F]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis to evaluate the overall and comparative effects of weight-loss medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration for long-term use on cardiometabolic risk profiles of obese adults.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic literature review through February 28, 2017, to identify randomized clinical trials of the effects of FDA-approved weight-loss medications (i.e. orlistat, lorcaserin, naltrexone-bupropion, phentermine-topiramate, and liraglutide) administered to obese adults for one year or more, compared with placebo or another active agent. Outcomes of interest included changes in fasting blood glucose (FBG) and hemoglobin A1c, cholesterol profile (low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoproteins), blood pressure (BP; systolic/diastolic), and waist circumference (WC). We performed pair-wise and network meta-analyses with outcomes reported as weighted and standardized mean differences. Quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

- **Results**: In a meta-analysis of 28 randomized controlled trials (29,018 participants; median body mass index, 36.1 kg/m²), we associated weight-loss medications with a modest decrease in FBG (weighted mean difference, 4.0 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval, -4.4 to -3.6 mg/dL) and WC (weighted mean difference, reduction of 3.3 cm; 95% confidence interval, -3.5 to -3.1 cm), without clinically meaningful changes in systolic/diastolic BP or cholesterol profile compared to placebo.

### Effect of orlistat on weight regain and cardiovascular risk factors following a very-low-energy diet in abdominally obese patients: a 3-year randomized, placebo-controlled study [^115m5yAb]. Diabetes Care (2007). High credibility.

To investigate the efficacy of orlistat in maintaining weight loss over 3 years following a major weight reduction induced by a very-low-energy diet (VLED) in obese patients with metabolic risk factors, such as dyslipidemia, impaired fasting glucose, and diet-treated type 2 diabetes, a study was conducted.

Initially, weight loss was induced by an 8-week VLED (600–800 kcal/day) in 383 patients with a mean BMI of 37.5 kg/m² (range 30.0–45.2). Patients who lost 5% or more of their body weight (309 of 383) were then randomized to receive lifestyle counseling for 3 years combined with either orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. or matching placebo capsules. The primary endpoints were the maintenance of a 5% or greater weight loss after 3 years, and the differences in the development of type 2 diabetes between the orlistat and placebo groups were analyzed.

The VLED induced a mean weight loss of 14.4 ± 2.0 kg among the subsequently randomized patients. After 3 years, the mean weight gain was lower with orlistat than with placebo (4.6 ± 8.6 vs. 7.0 ± 7.1 kg; P ≤ 0.05). The maintenance of 5% or greater weight loss also favored orlistat (67% vs. 56%; P = 0.037). Waist circumference was significantly more reduced in the orlistat group (P < 0.05), but no other differences in the risk factors were observed between the two groups. The incidence of new cases of type 2 diabetes was significantly reduced in the orlistat group, with 8 cases out of 153 subjects, versus 17 cases out of 156 subjects in the placebo group (P = 0.041).

In conclusion, the addition of orlistat to lifestyle management effectively supports the maintenance of weight loss and reduces the incidence of type 2 diabetes in the studied population.

### Weight loss, HbA1c reduction, and tolerability of cetilistat in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial in obese diabetics: Comparison with orlistat (Xenical) [^115PJ4ek]. Obesity (2010). High credibility.

The objective of this multicenter, randomized, double-blind study was to determine the efficacy and safety of cetilistat and orlistat relative to placebo in obese patients with type 2 diabetes on metformin. Following a 2-week run-in, patients were randomized to placebo, cetilistat (40, 80, or 120 mg three times daily), or orlistat 120 mg t.i.d., for 12 weeks.

The primary endpoint was the absolute change in body weight from baseline. Secondary endpoints included other measures of obesity and glycemic control.

- **Results**: Similar reductions in body weight were observed in patients receiving cetilistat 80 or 120 mg t.i.d. or orlistat 120 mg t.i.d.; these reductions were significant compared to placebo (3.85 kg, P = 0.01; 4.32 kg, P = 0.0002; 3.78 kg, P = 0.008). In the 40 mg t.i.d. and placebo groups, reductions were 2.94 kg (P = 0.958) and 2.86 kg, respectively. Statistically significant reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were noted.

Cetilistat was well tolerated and showed fewer discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) than in the placebo and orlistat groups. Discontinuation in the orlistat group was significantly worse than in the 120 mg cetilistat and placebo groups and was entirely due to gastrointestinal (GI) AEs. Treatment with cetilistat 80 or 120 mg t.i.d. or with orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. significantly reduced body weight and improved glycemic control relative to placebo in obese diabetic patients. Cetilistat was well tolerated, with the number of discontinuations due to AEs being similar to placebo.

### Effects of a novel weight-loss combination product containing orlistat and acarbose on obesity: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^116VhGW2]. Obesity (2022). High credibility.

In this trial, treatment with EMP16 for 26 weeks led to a continuous and clinically relevant weight loss. More than 50% of the participants in both active treatment groups lost at least 5% of their baseline weight, and more than 20% lost at least 10%, compared with 14% and 2% of participants, respectively, in the placebo group. Other anthropometric measurements such as BMI, waist circumference, sagittal abdominal diameter, and percentage of body fat showed similar treatment effects, albeit with larger effects for the higher EMP16–150/50 dose. Patient-reported quality of life showed improvements in both intervention groups, notably in physical functioning, general health, and the overall health transition score. Blood pressure, glucose metabolism markers, and blood lipids were not notably affected, and no treatment differences were observed in the ratings of satiety and craving. However, minor improvements in meal patterns in relation to sweet food and breakfast were seen in the EMP16–150/50 intervention group. EMP16 was generally well tolerated, and no safety concerns were noted.

This trial corroborates the findings from the previous pilot trial with EMP16, which demonstrated that both the efficacy and tolerability of orlistat and acarbose were increased by employing a modified-release intervention. Orlistat and acarbose treatments in their conventional dosage forms typically provide an approximate relative weight loss of 2% to 3% and less than 0.5%, respectively, whereas the observed mean placebo-adjusted weight losses in the EMP16 arms were approximately 5%.

### Obesity in the elderly diabetic patient: Is weight loss beneficial? No [^117XDUxb]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Initiation of pharmacotherapy for weight management, in addition to lifestyle interventions, may help achieve and maintain even greater body weight loss and hence can further contribute to reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes in obese individuals. The Xenical in the Prevention of Diabetes in Obese Subjects (XENDOS) study evaluated orlistat versus placebo plus lifestyle intervention in obese patients with either normal glucose tolerance or impaired glucose tolerance. After a 4-year treatment period, the addition of orlistat to lifestyle changes produced greater weight loss in this obese population compared with lifestyle changes alone. Furthermore, orlistat treatment resulted in a risk reduction of 37% for the development of type 2 diabetes, which was significant in patients with baseline impaired glucose tolerance.

Bariatric surgery represents the next step in weight management strategies after failure to achieve or maintain weight loss with lifestyle interventions and anti-obesity drugs. Following the proposed guidelines, surgical interventions have been shown to effectively treat obesity, leading to prevention or remission of obesity-related complications. The Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study, a large prospective study, evaluated the long-term effects of bariatric surgery for morbid obesity. In this cohort, the surgically treated group had significantly greater weight reduction and markedly lower 2- and 10-year incidence rates of type 2 diabetes than the conventionally treated control group. These results highlight the primary preventive effect of weight loss on obesity-related complications.

### Effectiveness and persistence of anti-obesity medications (liraglutide 3 mg, lorcaserin, and orlistat) in a real-world primary care setting [^116ryJMH]. Family Practice (2023). High credibility.

Obesity is a chronic disease with rising prevalence. Guidelines suggest medications for obesity management if lifestyle interventions do not lead to substantial weight loss. Randomized control trials have shown the efficacy of anti-obesity medications in inducing weight loss, but real-world data are lacking. Therefore, our study aims to evaluate anti-obesity medications' effectiveness in reducing weight and improving cardiometabolic parameters and to assess their persistence in a real-world setting.

- **Methods**: A historical cohort study using routinely collected data from Clalit Health Services (CHS). We retrieved data on all CHS members aged ≥ 20 years who initiated anti-obesity medication (orlistat, liraglutide 3 mg, and lorcaserin) between 2018 and 2020. We assessed average weight loss and the percentage of patients that had lost ≥ 5% and ≥ 10% of their body weight at 3, 6, and 9 months and compared the effectiveness of these three medications.

- **Results**: We included 5,306 CHS members in our study; most (77.8%) were female, aged 40–59 years (52.4%). Treatment with liraglutide 3 mg and lorcaserin was associated with subsequent weight reduction. The average weight loss at 6 months was 5.6 kg (4.95–6.25, 95% confidence interval [CI]) with liraglutide 3 mg and 1.7 kg (1.2–2.2, 95% CI) with lorcaserin. There was no evidence that treatment with orlistat was associated with subsequent weight loss (-0.18 kg [-0.8 to 0.4, 95% CI]). At 6 months, 38% of the patients with orlistat, 43% with lorcaserin, and 51% with liraglutide 3 mg persisted with their treatments (P < 0.001).

### Pharmacotherapy for obesity: Moving towards efficacy improvement [^113bdb1M]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). High credibility.

Approved AOMs and their efficacy: What is available at the time of writing?

- **Peripheral action: Orlistat**: Orlistat is an inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases that is approved worldwide for chronic weight management. It decreases lipid absorption and promotes a negative caloric balance by partially blocking dietary triglyceride hydrolysis into absorbable monoglycerides and free fatty acids.

- **RCTs and meta-analyses**: RCTs with orlistat show 5–10% weight loss in patients with obesity, proving superior to placebo in doses ranging from 30 to 240 mg. In a trial including a one-year evaluation period, 9.1% of patients treated with orlistat experienced a ≥ 20% reduction in initial body weight compared to 6.1% of patients treated with a placebo.

	- A meta-analysis showed a placebo-subtracted weight loss of 2.3 kg with at least one year of treatment with orlistat. A more recent meta-analysis, including 16 RCTs assessing the effects of orlistat compared with a placebo, showed similar results, with 2.6 kg of placebo-subtracted weight loss after one year. The odds ratios for achieving a reduction of at least 5% of body weight were 2.70, and 2.42 for losing at least 10% of body weight.

- **Longest double-blind RCT**: The longest double-blind RCT assessing the effects of orlistat was the four-year XENDOS trial. It showed the efficacy of orlistat on significant weight loss and prevention of T2DM in patients with obesity (n = 3,304). Regarding metabolic health beyond weight loss, in the XENDOS trial, orlistat was associated with a reduced risk of developing T2DM as well as a reduction in LDL cholesterol. Orlistat reduced the risk of developing T2DM by 37.3%.

### The effect of antiobesity drugs on waist circumference: a mixed treatment comparison [^116RS82S]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to use meta-analytic techniques to quantitatively evaluate the efficacy of orlistat and lorcaserin in the treatment of people who are overweight and obese.

- **Methods**: We identified publications from searches of electronic databases and extracted data from studies that compared orlistat or lorcaserin to lifestyle advice (standard care), placebo, sibutramine, rimonabant, or metformin. We collected information on waist circumference change or withdrawals due to adverse events (AEs). A mixed treatment comparison (MTC) meta-analysis was performed on the data extracted.

- **Results**: Orlistat was found to be significantly better than placebo and standard care in reducing waist circumference at 6 and 12 months. Orlistat reduced waist circumference by -6.96 cm [95% credible interval (CrI): -8.93, -4.96 cm] compared to standard care at 6 months. The results suggested that lorcaserin reduced waist circumference by a greater amount than all other interventions at 12 months. For example, lorcaserin led to a greater reduction of -2.45 cm (95% CrI: -4.99, 0.08 cm) in comparison to placebo, although these differences were not statistically significant. Although data were very limited, metformin reduced waist circumference by a greater amount (-2.11 cm, 95% CI: -1.00, -3.22 cm) than orlistat at 6 months. On average, 6.5% of patients on orlistat and 5.4% of those on lorcaserin discontinued their treatment due to AEs at 12 months.

- **Conclusions**: Orlistat should be considered as an addition to lifestyle interventions in the treatment of obesity. Lorcaserin has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

### X-PERT: Weight reduction with orlistat in obese subjects receiving a mildly or moderately reduced-energy diet: Early response to treatment predicts weight maintenance [^111S9F2R]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of two different levels of energy deficit on weight loss in obese patients treated with orlistat.

- **Methods**: Patients (n = 430) were randomized in a 1-year, multicenter, open-label, parallel-group study conducted at 23 hospital centers and university medical departments worldwide. Obese outpatients (body mass index 30–43 kg/m²) aged 18–70 years, with a body weight of ≥ 90 kg and a waist circumference of ≥ 88 cm (women) or ≥ 102 cm (men), were treated with orlistat 120 mg three times daily plus a diet that provided an energy deficit of either 500 or 1,000 kcal/day for 1 year. Orlistat treatment was discontinued in patients who did not achieve ≥ 5% weight loss after assessment at 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome measure was change in body weight from baseline at week 52.

- **Results**: The reported mean difference in energy intake between the two groups (500–1,000 kcal/day deficit) at weeks 24 and 52 was actually 111 and 95 kcal/day, respectively. Of the 430 patients involved in the study, 295 achieved ≥ 5% weight loss at both 3 and 6 months. In this population, at week 52, weight loss from baseline was similar for patients randomized to either the 500 or the 1,000 kcal/day deficit diet (-11.4 kg vs. -11.8 kg, respectively; p = 0.778). After 12 months of treatment with orlistat, 84% (n = 118/141) and 85% (n = 131/154) of patients in the 500 and 1,000 kcal/day deficit groups, respectively, achieved ≥ 5% weight loss, and 50% (n = 70/141) and 53% (n = 82/154) of patients, respectively, achieved ≥ 10% weight loss.

### Orlistat in the treatment of overweight or obese Chinese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [^114EDpHi]. Diabetic Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Orlistat promotes weight loss in overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes receiving hypoglycemic treatment, but has not been investigated in patients with newly diagnosed and previously untreated type 2 diabetes. We evaluated the efficacy of 24 weeks' treatment with orlistat, combined with a mildly reduced-calorie diet, on weight loss and glycaemic control in overweight and obese patients with newly diagnosed and previously untreated type 2 diabetes.

- **Methods**: A total of 249 Chinese patients (body mass index 25–40 kg/m²) with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes were randomized to placebo (n = 124) or orlistat 120 mg (n = 125) three times daily; all patients followed a mildly reduced-calorie diet. Patients had HbA1c 6.5–8.5% (mean 7.3%) and had never received any glucose-lowering medication.

- **Results**: Orlistat-treated patients achieved significantly greater weight loss at the study end than placebo-treated patients (-5.4 vs. -2.4 kg; P < 0.0001), significantly more patients achieved weight loss of ≥ 5% (60.5% vs. 26.8%; P < 0.0001) and ≥ 10% of their body weight (20.2% vs. 4.9%; P = 0.0002). A significantly greater decrease in HbA1c from baseline was obtained with orlistat than placebo (-1.0% vs. -0.6%; P = 0.0008). Orlistat-treated patients achieved a significantly greater decrease in fasting plasma glucose (-1.3 vs. -0.5 mmol/l; P = 0.0003) and in the 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (-4.1 vs. -1.4 mmol/l; P < 0.0001) than placebo recipients. Additionally, more orlistat-treated patients than placebo-treated patients improved from diabetic status to normal or impaired glucose tolerance (44.3% vs. 32.5%; P < 0.05).

### Cardiovascular risk and obesity [^112y2hsc]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Low credibility.

Orlistat, or tetrahydrolipstatin, is a pancreatic and gastric selective lipase inhibitor, approved as an anti-obesity drug. It is prescribed orally at therapeutic doses of 120 mg three times daily (tid) with meals, administered with a well-balanced diet. Its activity is dose-dependent, with approximately 30% inhibition of dietary fat absorption, and the major route of elimination is fecal excretion. Orlistat is approved in the US, Europe, and other countries, such as Brazil.

Data from published clinical trials with orlistat for the treatment of obesity include a 4-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study in 3,305 Swedish people with obesity (XENDOS study), where orlistat reduced weight by 2.7 kg on average. In another study, a 24-week prospective, randomized, single-blind study between orlistat (120 mg three times a day) and placebo in 80 adults with obesity, orlistat showed a reduction in weight (4.65 kg vs. 2.5 kg in placebo), BMI (1.91 kg/m² vs. 0.64 kg/m²), waist circumference (4.84 cm vs. 2.00 cm), cholesterol, and LDL levels when compared to placebo. Additionally, in a meta-analysis of 11 placebo-controlled trials of 1 year in 6,021 people with overweight or obesity, orlistat reduced weight by 2.9%, and the number of patients achieving 5% and 10% weight-loss success was 21% and 12% greater with orlistat than with placebo. In this meta-analysis, orlistat also reduced blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and fasting glucose in patients with diabetes.

The efficacy of orlistat has been demonstrated in a diverse group of people with obesity.

### Association of pharmacological treatments for obesity with weight loss and adverse events: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ZKAQB]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

The importance of this study lies in addressing the limited data available on the comparative effectiveness of approved pharmacological treatments for obesity. Five medications have been approved for obesity management, highlighting the need for an evaluation of their comparative impacts.

The objective of the research was to compare weight loss and adverse events among different drug treatments for obesity through a systematic review and network meta-analysis. Data were sourced from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Central from their inception to March 23, 2016, in addition to clinical trial registries.

Study selection focused on randomized clinical trials conducted among overweight and obese adults. These studies involved U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved long-term weight loss agents — namely orlistat, lorcaserin, naltrexone-bupropion, phentermine-topiramate, and liraglutide — administered for at least one year and compared with either another active agent or placebo.

Data extraction and synthesis involved two investigators who independently identified and abstracted data based on a predefined protocol. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was utilized to evaluate the relative ranking of agents using surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. The quality of evidence was evaluated with GRADE criteria.

Main outcomes and measures included proportions of patients achieving at least 5% and 10% weight loss, the magnitude of weight decrease, and therapy discontinuation due to adverse events at the one-year mark.

Results from twenty-eight randomized clinical trials involving 29,018 patients (median age, 46 years; 74% women; median baseline body weight, 100.5 kg; median baseline body mass index, 36.1) revealed that a median 23% of placebo participants experienced at least a 5% weight loss, compared to 75% of participants taking phentermine-topiramate.

### Current and emerging medications for overweight or obesity in people with comorbidities [^111WSSmS]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

As of the second quarter of 2015, the pharmacological options for overweight and obesity treatment approved in the United States include phentermine, orlistat, phentermine/topiramate extended-release (ER) combination therapy, lorcaserin, naltrexone/bupropion, and the recently approved liraglutide 3.0 mg. Currently, orlistat, naltrexone/bupropion, and liraglutide 3.0 mg are approved in Europe.

Sibutramine was withdrawn from both the United States and Europe due to concerns regarding cardiovascular risk, and marketing approval for rimonabant in Europe was withdrawn because of concerns regarding depression/suicidality. The European marketing authorization application for phentermine/topiramate ER has been rejected twice, and the corresponding application for lorcaserin was withdrawn.

The 1-year weight loss efficacy data and 1-year weight loss maintenance data for medications approved in the United States are shown in various tables. These data are presented as described in the medication's US Prescribing Information or individual trials, with last observation carried forward (LOCF) if available.

### Weight loss as a treatment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^112USeYM]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver condition that can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD is associated with obesity and other features of metabolic syndrome, including insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and dyslipidemia. Due to the absence of other effective treatments, weight loss through lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, has been promoted as the standard treatment.

However, there is very little empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of weight loss for NAFLD. This article reviews the literature on the effects of weight loss achieved through lifestyle modification or medications on NAFLD. At the time of writing, no randomized controlled trials of weight loss interventions on hepatic pathology have been conducted. Only three published trials (N = 89 subjects) include a comparison group. These studies suggest improvement in liver enzymes and/or hepatic pathology; however, direct between-group comparisons are lacking.

Four small, nonrandomized studies (N = 59 subjects) have evaluated the effect of weight loss achieved with medications (four with orlistat, one with sibutramine) on NAFLD. These studies suggest some improvement in liver enzymes and histopathology. Additionally, a brief review of observational studies on the association between NAFLD pathology or liver enzymes and diet composition suggests a possible role for the manipulation of macronutrients and/or micronutrients in the treatment of NAFLD.

In summary, there is little empirical evidence to support the role of weight loss as an effective treatment for NAFLD.

### A review of therapeutic options for managing the metabolic aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome [^112M6RVY]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Orlistat is both a gastric and pancreatic lipase inhibitor that reduces the absorption of prandial dietary fat by minimizing the hydrolysis of triglycerides. It is recognized in obesity treatment with proven, though low, efficacy. A study that evaluated and compared the effects of treatment with orlistat versus metformin on the biochemical and hormonal factors in women with PCOS found that treatment with orlistat showed a significant reduction in weight as well as androgen levels compared with metformin.

A randomized open-labeled parallel study compared the change in insulin resistance (IR) and its biological variability after treatment with orlistat, metformin, and pioglitazone in obese patients with PCOS. Orlistat significantly reduced both IR and its biological variability compared with metformin and pioglitazone. Additionally, in a study where women with PCOS treated with orlistat were compared with those receiving metformin and lifestyle intervention, there was an improvement in lipid profiles, weight, BMI, and waist circumference. Orlistat also reduced androgen levels, parameters of IR, and total cholesterol.

Moreover, orlistat modestly reduces blood pressure and plays a role in the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in this high-risk population, possibly due to its effect on weight reduction. However, orlistat, at the recommended dose of 120 mg up to three times a day taken with food, has significant side effects including fatty stool, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and flatulence. It may also cause fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies.

While orlistat might have desirable effects in the management of obesity, its relevance in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome remains under question, especially considering its side effects.

### Effects of a novel weight-loss combination product containing orlistat and acarbose on obesity: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^113XkuhC]. Obesity (2022). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a novel, oral, modified-release formulation of the lipase inhibitor orlistat and the glucosidase/amylase inhibitor acarbose (denoted EMP16) on relative body weight after 26 weeks compared with placebo.

The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial had a 26-week treatment period, with dose escalation up to 6 weeks. Participants, adults between ages 18 and 75 years, with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 28 kg/m² with risk factors, were randomly assigned to EMP16 120-mg orlistat/40-mg acarbose (EMP16–120/40), EMP16–150/50, or placebo. The primary end point was relative weight loss from baseline to week 26, assessed in participants with at least one post-baseline weight measurement.

Of 156 randomized participants, 149 constituted the intention-to-treat population. The mean (95% CI) estimated treatment difference to placebo in relative weight loss after 26 weeks in the intention-to-treat population was −4.70% (−6.16% to −3.24%; p < 0.0001) with EMP16–120/40 and −5.42% (−6.60% to −4.24%; p < 0.0001) with EMP16–150/50.

This trial indicates that orlistat and acarbose can be successfully combined in a modified-release formulation to provide efficacious weight loss with no unexpected safety issues. EMP16 may be a promising candidate among other medications for improved weight management.

### Orlistat in clozapine- or olanzapine-treated patients with overweight or obesity: A 16-week open-label extension phase and both phases of a randomized controlled trial [^114aRvAN]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). High credibility.

To explore the long-term effects of orlistat in adult clozapine- or olanzapine-treated patients with DSM-IV-diagnosed schizophrenia and overweight or obesity who tolerate orlistat, the study was conducted. Orlistat or placebo was added to clozapine or olanzapine in stable doses in a 16-week randomized controlled trial. Open-label orlistat was added to the antipsychotics during a 16-week extension phase for those completing the double-blind phase. No low-calorie diet or participation in behavioral programs was required. Body weight, as the primary outcome, and some metabolic parameters were measured prospectively. Analyses were performed for those completing both phases, differing from the population reported earlier. The study was conducted from 2004 through 2005.

During the open-label phase, the 44 patients experienced a mean ± SD body weight loss of -1.29 ± 3.04 kg, P = 0.007. During both phases, men (but not women) showed a weight loss of -2.39 ± 5.45 kg, P = 0.023. Some subgroups showed desirable changes in several metabolic parameters. Prolonged (32 weeks) orlistat treatment yielded no additional benefits compared to short (16 weeks) treatment.

In clozapine- or olanzapine-treated overweight or obese patients able to take orlistat on a long-term basis, the drug, with no concomitant hypocaloric diet or behavioral interventions, caused moderate weight loss only in men. However, some metabolic benefits may be achieved independently of weight changes. In patients who do not respond to orlistat within the first 16 weeks, continuation treatment may provide no additional benefit.

### Safety and effects of anti-obesity medications on weight loss, cardiometabolic, and psychological outcomes in people living with overweight or obesity: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114XWd63]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Since 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has requested the withdrawal of the weight-loss medication lorcaserin due to its increased risk of cancer. Recently, the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved five categories of weight-loss medications, including tirzepatide (a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor co-agonist), semaglutide and liraglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonists), orlistat, and two combination therapies (naltrexone/bupropion and phentermine/topiramate). These pharmacotherapeutic agents operate via distinct mechanisms. Following the recent FDA approval of the novel weight-loss medication tirzepatide in December 2023, interest in comparing the effects and safety profiles of these medications has rapidly increased. Currently, a comprehensive meta-analysis evaluating the effects of the five categories of weight-loss medications is lacking. This study investigated the effects of these medications across four dimensions: weight loss, cardiometabolic health, psychological outcomes, and adverse events in different individuals living with overweight or obesity. The study aimed to provide evidence-based guidance for pharmacological treatment and enhance personalized weight management in clinical practice.

### Orlistat 60 mg reduces visceral adipose tissue: A 24-week randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial [^111Djh2Q]. Obesity (2011). Low credibility.

It is well established that abdominal obesity or upper body fat distribution is associated with increased risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disease. The purpose of the present study was to determine if a 24-week weight loss program with orlistat 60 mg in overweight subjects would produce a greater change in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) as measured by computed tomography (CT) scan, compared to placebo. The effects of orlistat 60 mg on changes in total fat mass (EchoMRI-AH and BIA), ectopic fat (CT), and glycemic variables were assessed.

One hundred thirty-one subjects were randomized into a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which 123 subjects received at least one post-baseline efficacy measurement (intent-to-treat population). Both orlistat- and placebo-treated subjects significantly decreased their VAT at 24 weeks, with a significantly greater loss of VAT by orlistat-treated subjects (-15.7% vs. -9.4%, P < 0.05). In addition, orlistat-treated subjects had significantly greater weight loss (-5.93 kg vs. -3.94 kg, P < 0.05) and total fat mass loss (-4.65 kg vs. -3.01 kg, P < 0.05), and they trended to a greater loss of intermuscular adipose tissue and content of liver fat compared with placebo-treated subjects.

This is the first study to demonstrate that orlistat 60 mg significantly reduces VAT in addition to total body fat compared to placebo-treated subjects following a 24-week weight loss program. These results suggest that orlistat 60 mg may be an effective weight loss tool to reduce metabolic risk factors associated with abdominal obesity.

### Anti-obesity therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention: Potential expected roles of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [^111vwzPo]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Low credibility.

Anti-obesity medications such as orlistat, phentermine-topiramate, and naltrexone-bupropion have induced a weight loss of no more than 10%, which is insufficient to prevent the risk of ORCVDs. None of these drugs have demonstrated a clear effect in improving cardiovascular outcomes and reducing mortality risk, partly because they only have an anorexic effect. To compensate for its moderate weight loss effect, anti-obesity drugs used to prevent ORCVDs are also expected to benefit the cardiovascular system through non-anorexic mechanisms.

Additionally, the duration of the weight loss effect is an important issue. With lifestyle modification alone, the weight loss effect is limited to approximately one year, after which weight increases due to endocrine mechanisms involved in body weight regulation. Taken together, the possible requisites of anti-obesity drugs for ORCVDs prevention are the degree of weight loss, the effect of maintaining body weight, and the unique effect of cardiovascular protection.

### Comparative efficiency and safety of pharmacological approaches to the management of obesity [^112PJ9zm]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of cetilistat, a novel inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases, were determined in both obese nondiabetic and diabetic patients. Similar weight reductions were observed in patients treated with cetilistat and orlistat. Weight reductions, ranging from −3.3 kg to –4.3 kg, achieved with different doses of cetilistat (60 mg t.i.d., 120 mg t.i.d., 240 mg t.i.d.) over a 12-week period, were statistically significant compared with placebo. Treatment with cetilistat resulted in significant reductions in total and LDL cholesterol levels in obese patients and improved glycemic control in obese patients with diabetes. Cetilistat treatment was well tolerated and exhibited fewer side effects compared with orlistat. The significantly reduced frequency of gastrointestinal adverse events following cetilistat administration could be attributable to structural differences between the two molecules and their interaction with fat micelles in the intestine.

### Improvement of glycaemic control with rebound following orlistat initiation and cessation associated with minimal weight change [^115cyCub]. Diabetic Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

A 57-year-old Caucasian woman with Type 2 diabetes, treated for seven years with diet and oral combination hypoglycaemic therapy, was referred because of the progressive deterioration of glycaemic control. She was obese (77 kg, BMI = 39.9), hypertensive, and hypercholesterolaemic with marked osmotic symptoms (HbA1c 12.2%). Therefore, she was started on insulin (Human Mixtard 30 b.d.) with metformin therapy. Dietary counselling, recommendations to increase physical activity, and supervised self-injection technique with titration of her insulin were also provided. She was routinely followed up to assess her progress.

Two years later, her glycaemic control remained suboptimal. Her average HbA1c was 10.4% despite an increasingly high dose of insulin (94 units/day), although it improved when metformin was increased to 1 g t.d.s. (HbA1c = 9.3%). Her BMI progressively rose from 39.9 to 42.1 (77 to 82.5 kg) despite dietary advice. Following intensive dietary counselling, a trial of orlistat (three months) was commenced, which reduced her body weight by 1.5 kg (2% reduction, BMI 41.3); however, her HbA1c improved by 0.5% (from 9.3 to 8.8%). Six months after orlistat was stopped, her HbA1c rose to 10.5% and weight increased to 81.8 kg (BMI 41.8). Despite the orlistat treatment broaching NICE guidelines, should it have been continued?
