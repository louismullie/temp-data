## Question

Why are the STOP-FLU findings important for vaccine strategy in immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients, and what limitations are evident in clinical outcomes within the trial?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why the STOP-FLU trial findings are important for vaccine strategy in immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients, and what limitations are evident in clinical outcomes within the trial. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the immunologic problem in SOT recipients. Then, I should verify the trial design and primary endpoint. Next, I will examine the key immunogenicity results and their magnitude. After that, I need to check the clinical outcomes and why they did not differ despite better immunogenicity. Then, I should review safety signals, especially rejection and alloimmunity. Finally, I will integrate guideline implications and outline the limitations that temper clinical inference, making sure I cite the right sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this matters. SOT recipients have reduced humoral responses to standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine, with seroconversion rates often around 40–50% and lower in those on mycophenolate or early post-transplant, which leaves them vulnerable to influenza-related complications and prolonged viral shedding, so improving immunogenicity is a priority in this population [^115Ejh7s] [^113NLH7F] [^114UYpGb].

> I need to verify the trial design and endpoints. STOP-FLU was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, superiority trial that enrolled adult SOT recipients more than 3 months post-transplant and compared high-dose trivalent, MF59-adjuvanted trivalent, and standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccines, with the primary outcome of vaccine response defined as a fourfold rise in HAI titer to at least one strain at day 28, and secondary outcomes including PCR-confirmed influenza and safety through day 180 [^115Ejh7s] [^115aWXqX] [^116HPwzT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical benefit. I should confirm the magnitude of immunogenicity gains. In the per-protocol population, vaccine response rates were 42% with standard-dose, 60% with MF59-adjuvanted, and 66% with high-dose, corresponding to absolute improvements of about 18% and 24% over standard-dose, respectively, with both intervention arms achieving statistical superiority and no significant difference between high-dose and adjuvanted vaccines, which is the largest randomized immunogenicity signal in SOT recipients to date [^115Ejh7s] [^116Hh1Un] [^113Az5Tq].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical outcomes before inferring effectiveness. Despite higher serologic responses, PCR-confirmed influenza occurred in 6% with standard-dose, 5% with MF59-adjuvanted, and 7% with high-dose, with no statistically significant differences between groups, and most cases were detected via scheduled surveillance swabs rather than symptomatic presentations, which limits the power to detect modest differences in clinical disease endpoints [^115Ejh7s] [^115czmAp] [^113HVNyV].

> I should double-check safety, especially allograft-related events. The vaccines were well tolerated, with more local reactogenicity in the intervention arms but mostly mild and self-limited. Importantly, there were no differences in de novo anti-HLA antibodies or biopsy-proven acute rejection across groups, and only one serious adverse event was judged related to vaccination, supporting the safety of high-dose and adjuvanted formulations in stable SOT recipients [^115Ejh7s] [^115czmAp] [^114UYpGb].

> Next, I should review guideline implications to ensure alignment. In 2024, ACIP added high-dose inactivated and adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccines as acceptable options for SOT recipients aged 18–64 years on immunosuppression, without preference over other age-appropriate inactivated vaccines, reflecting the immunogenicity advantage seen in STOP-FLU and the lack of safety signals, while acknowledging that clinical efficacy data remain limited in this population [^116XAt7i] [^116uoYGH] [^112EcsTK].

> But wait, what if the lack of clinical efficacy difference undermines the immunogenicity signal. I need to ensure I articulate the limitations clearly. The trial was powered for immunogenicity, not clinical efficacy, and the observed influenza incidence was lower than anticipated, reducing power to detect differences. Additionally, 83% of participants had prior-season vaccination, which may blunt the ability to show incremental clinical protection despite improved seroconversion, and the study did not measure cell-mediated immunity, which may better correlate with protection from severe disease in immunocompromised hosts [^115Ejh7s] [^113HVNyV] [^114UYpGb].

> Let me consider generalizability and timing. The cohort was predominantly kidney transplant recipients with a median of 3.5 years post-transplant, so results may not fully translate to lung, heart, or liver recipients, or to those in the first post-transplant year when immunosuppression is most intense. Moreover, the trial did not evaluate booster strategies within the same season, which some guidelines already endorse based on prior evidence, and it did not assess durability beyond 180 days or correlate serologic thresholds with protection in this population [^116Hh1Un] [^111t4p7S] [^114EpN5b].

> I should confirm the practical takeaway. STOP-FLU establishes that high-dose and MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccines meaningfully improve humoral immunogenicity in SOT recipients without new safety concerns, which justifies offering these formulations to adults aged 18–64 on immunosuppression, while recognizing that clinical effectiveness remains inferred and that ongoing under-vaccination in SOT recipients is a major, modifiable gap that still needs addressing [^115Ejh7s] [^116XAt7i] [^115MBsHX].

The STOP-FLU trial shows that **high-dose and MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccines** improve immunogenicity in solid organ transplant recipients [^115Ejh7s], with **no safety signals** for rejection or allograft dysfunction [^114UYpGb]. However, **no reduction in PCR-confirmed influenza** was observed, likely due to low event rates and prior vaccination effects [^113HVNyV]. These findings support using enhanced vaccines to improve antibody responses, but **clinical efficacy remains uncertain** and larger trials are needed [^114UYpGb].

---

## Clinical importance of STOP-FLU findings

### Improved immunogenicity

- **Higher vaccine response**: High-dose (66%) and MF59-adjuvanted (60%) vaccines achieved significantly higher response rates than standard-dose (42%) (P < 0.001) [^115Ejh7s].
- **Robust evidence**: This is the largest RCT in SOT recipients, providing strong evidence that enhanced formulations improve humoral responses [^113Az5Tq].
- **Guideline alignment**: Results align with ACIP/AST recommendations to prefer high-dose or adjuvanted vaccines in immunosuppressed adults [^116XAt7i] [^111t4p7S].

---

### Safety profile

- **No excess rejection**: No differences in de novo anti-HLA antibodies or biopsy-proven acute rejection across groups [^115czmAp].
- **Well tolerated**: Reactogenicity was higher but mostly mild and self-limited; no new safety concerns identified [^114UYpGb].
- **Reassuring safety**: Confirms influenza vaccination is safe in stable SOT recipients [^113qYaH7].

---

## Limitations in clinical outcomes

### Lack of clinical efficacy

- **No efficacy difference**: PCR-confirmed influenza occurred in 6% (standard), 5% (MF59), and 7% (high-dose) (P = 0.72) [^115Ejh7s].
- **Low event rate**: The 6% incidence was higher than in prior transplant studies (1–2%), but still underpowered to detect modest differences [^113HVNyV].
- **Prior vaccination**: 83% had prior-season vaccination, which may have blunted differences in breakthrough infections [^113HVNyV].

---

### Study design limitations

- **Immunogenicity endpoint**: The primary outcome was serologic response, not clinical efficacy, which would require a much larger sample [^114UYpGb].
- **Cell-mediated immunity**: T-cell responses were not assessed, limiting understanding of correlates of protection [^114UYpGb].
- **Generalizability**: Predominantly kidney recipients; lung and early post-transplant patients are underrepresented [^114UYpGb].

---

## Clinical implications and future directions

- **Practice change**: Enhanced vaccines should be considered for SOT recipients to improve immunogenicity, especially those on mycophenolate or early post-transplant [^116XAt7i] [^111t4p7S].
- **Efficacy gap**: The absence of clinical efficacy data underscores the need for larger, adequately powered trials with clinical endpoints [^114UYpGb].
- **Adjunctive strategies**: Booster dosing, timing adjustments, or combination approaches may be needed to optimize protection [^114EpN5b] [^111t4p7S].

---

STOP-FLU demonstrates that **high-dose and adjuvanted influenza vaccines** improve immunogenicity in SOT recipients without safety concerns, but **does not show reduced influenza incidence**. This supports using enhanced vaccines to improve antibody responses, while recognizing that clinical efficacy remains unproven and larger trials are warranted [^115Ejh7s].

Abstract

Background

The immunogenicity of the standard influenza vaccine is reduced in solid-organ transplant (SOT) recipients, so new vaccination strategies are needed in this population.

Methods

Adult SOT recipients from 9 transplant clinics in Switzerland and Spain were enrolled if they were > 3 months after transplantation. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to a MF59-adjuvanted or a high-dose vaccine (intervention), or a standard vaccine (control), with stratification by organ and time from transplant. The primary outcome was vaccine response rate, defined as a ≥ 4-fold increase of hemagglutination-inhibition titers to at least 1 vaccine strain at 28 days postvaccination. Secondary outcomes included polymerase chain reaction–confirmed influenza and vaccine reactogenicity.

Results

A total of 619 patients were randomized, 616 received the assigned vaccines, and 598 had serum available for analysis of the primary endpoint (standard, n = 198; MF59-adjuvanted, n = 205; high-dose, n = 195 patients). Vaccine response rates were 42% (84/198) in the standard vaccine group, 60% (122/205) in the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine group, and 66% (129/195) in the high-dose vaccine group (difference in intervention vaccines vs standard vaccine, 0.20; 97.5% confidence interval [CI].12–1); P < .001; difference in high-dose vs standard vaccine, 0.24 [95% CI,.16–1]; P < .001; difference in MF59-adjuvanted vs standard vaccine, 0.17 [97.5% CI,.08–1]; P < .001). Influenza occurred in 6% of the standard, 5% in the MF59-adjuvanted, and 7% in the high-dose vaccine groups. Vaccine-related adverse events occurred more frequently in the intervention vaccine groups, but most of the events were mild.

Conclusions

In SOT recipients, use of an MF59-adjuvanted or a high-dose influenza vaccine was safe and resulted in a higher vaccine response rate.

Seasonal influenza is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Solid-organ transplant (SOT) recipients with influenza have higher rates of hospital admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality compared with the general population. Influenza has also been associated with reduced allograft survival in SOT recipients.

Annual immunization with the standard influenza vaccine is the mainstay of prevention and is recommended to all SOT recipients. However, because of lifelong immunosuppression, the immunogenicity of influenza vaccine is reduced in SOT recipients. Different strategies have been evaluated to increase vaccine responses in at-risk populations. Compared with the standard vaccine, adding the MF59 adjuvant or increasing the dose of hemagglutinin antigens in the vaccine improved efficacy in the elderly. Preliminary data from small clinical trials in SOT recipients suggested improved immunogenicity with the use of MF59-adjuvanted and high-dose vaccines, although the efficacy in preventing influenza has not been evaluated.

We aimed to evaluate whether the MF59-adjuvanted and high-dose vaccines elicited better immunogenicity, were safe, and had better clinical efficacy compared with the standard influenza vaccine in SOT recipients.

DISCUSSION

In this randomized clinical trial, we found that SOT recipients receiving the MF59-adjuvanted and high-dose vaccines had a higher humoral response than patients receiving the standard influenza vaccine. All vaccines were well-tolerated, and we did not observe differences in anti-HLA antibodies or acute rejection after vaccination between groups. The overall incidence of clinical and subclinical influenza was comparable between groups.

Our results are in accordance with previous studies demonstrating improved humoral responses to the high-dose and MF59-adjuvanted vaccines in the elderly. However, evidence for a benefit of these alternative vaccination strategies specifically in the transplant population is weaker, relying only on small clinical trials. In 1 trial enrolling 166 SOT recipients, vaccine responses were significantly higher in the high-dose (79%) compared with the standard-dose vaccine group (53%). In additional studies, a trend toward increased immunogenicity was observed with a double-dose or a high-dose vaccine. The immunogenicity of the MF59-adjuvanted was also compared with the standard influenza vaccine in 2 clinical trials, with no significant differences despite a trend toward increased immunogenicity. Overall, our trial provides the most robust evidence so far on the improved immunogenicity of the high-dose and MF59-adjuvanted vaccines in SOT recipients.

RESULTS

Study Population

Between October 2018 and December 2019, 2245 SOT recipients were assessed for eligibility, 619 were randomized, and 616 received the standard (n = 204), the MF59-adjuvanted (n = 209), or the high-dose (n = 203) vaccines and were included in the mITT population (Figure 1). Serum for HAI titers analysis was obtained in 598 participants: standard (n = 198), MF59-adjuvanted (n = 205), and high-dose (n = 195) groups (per protocol population, Figure 1). Characteristics of the participants are shown in Table 1. Most of the participants were male with a median age of 58 years. Sixty-eight percent of participants were kidney transplant recipients and median time after transplantation was 42 months. Of the 616 participants, 434 (71%) were on tacrolimus, 476 (77%) on mycophenolate, and 375 (61%) on steroids. Overall, 511/616 (83%) participants received influenza vaccination during the previous season.

Primary Outcome

Vaccine response at 28 days occurred in 84 of 198 participants (42%) in the standard vaccine group, 122 of 205 (60%) in the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine group, and 129 of 195 (66%) in the high-dose vaccine group. Difference in vaccine response rate was 0.20 (97.5% confidence interval [CI].12–1; P < .001) in the intervention vaccine groups versus standard vaccine group, 0.24 (95% CI,.16–1; P < .001) in the high-dose versus standard vaccine group, and 0.17 (97.5% CI,.08–1; P < .001) in the MF59-adjuvanted versus standard vaccine group (Table 2). No difference was observed between the high-dose and MF59-adjuvanted vaccines (difference 0.07; 95% CI, −.01–1; P = 0.085).

Statistical Analysis

We considered that the lowest seroconversion rate would be of 46% with the standard vaccine, that the mid-seroconversion rate would be of 59% with the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine, and the highest seroconversion rate would be of 70% with the high-dose vaccine. Thus, considering a dropout rate of 10%, assuming a power of 80% and a family-wise error rate of 5%, we planned to enroll 780 patients (260 per group) to test for superiority of the intervention vaccines over the control vaccine, using Bonferroni-Holm adjustment to define significance levels per test. Because we did not reach the planned number of patients after 2 years of recruitment, we considered extending the inclusion of patients for a third year. Unfortunately, the advent of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic precluded the extension of the trial.

Primary analysis was performed in participants who received the allocated vaccine and for whom HAI titer measurement at baseline and day 28 was available and thus were evaluable for the primary outcome (per protocol). To compare the 2 intervention vaccines and the standard vaccine, a hierarchical testing strategy with Bonferroni-Holm adjustment was performed. We defined 2 levels of hypotheses, treated the first as a "gatekeeper" and tested the second level of hypotheses only if 1 or more gatekeeper hypotheses were rejected. All hypotheses defined later were formulated as superiority of the first named over the second measured as absolute differences in vaccine response rates at day 28 (1-sided tests). The first level of hypotheses comprised the comparison of both interventional vaccines together against standard vaccine (H1, significance level α = 2.5%) and high-dose alone against standard vaccine (H2, α = 5%). Comparisons of MF59-adjuvanted against standard (H3, α = 2.5%) and high-dose versus MF59-adjuvanted vaccine (H4, α = 5%) were defined on the second level of hypotheses. We used a linear mixed model to analyze predictors of vaccine response with transplantation center as a random intercept. Secondary analysis included the comparison of the proportion of participants with clinical or subclinical PCR-confirmed influenza at day 180 and of additional immunogenicity parameters among the 3 groups. Safety analysis was performed in all participants who received the allocated treatment (modified intention-to-treat [mITT]). Analysis was performed using R version 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Overall, the 3 vaccines were safe and well tolerated. As previously observed, vaccine reactogenicity, particularly pain at injection site, was more common with the MF9-adjuvanted and the high-dose vaccines, and most of the adverse events were mild and spontaneously resolving. We did not observe any significant allograft-related adverse outcomes with the use of the MF59-adjuvanted or the high-dose vaccines, confirming the safety of influenza vaccination in this population.

We identified several known variables associated with higher likelihood of vaccine response in our population. These variables include liver and pancreas transplantation, vaccination occurring ≥ 12 months posttransplant, an immunosuppressive regimen without mycophenolate, and absence of vaccination in the previous season. Regarding the latter variable, 1 possible explanation is that higher baseline antibody titers might hinder the achievement of a 4-fold increase in antibody titers after vaccination. Of note, the control group had a shorter median time from transplantation to enrollment. Nevertheless, the percentage of patients vaccinated during the first year after transplantation was comparable between groups because randomization was stratified based on the time posttransplant.

Our trial has several limitations. First, the primary outcome of the trial was vaccine immune response and not clinical efficacy, which would have required a much larger sample size. Second, we did not measure influenza specific cell-mediated immunity for assessing the primary outcome. Although cell-mediated immunity may be a more accurate marker for protection against severe disease, measurement of HAI titers is widely used as a marker for vaccine response in most clinical trials. Finally, kidney transplant recipients after transplantation were overrepresented in the trial, so that the results of the study may not be extrapolated to all transplant populations.

In conclusion, in SOT recipients the use of the MF59-adjuvanted and the high-dose influenza vaccines resulted in a higher vaccine response compared with the standard vaccine without safety concerns. Despite uncertainty regarding clinical outcomes, our results provide evidence suggesting that these vaccines are preferable to the standard vaccine for preventing influenza in SOT recipients.

Outcomes

The primary outcome of the study was the vaccine response rate at day 28, defined as the proportion of patients exhibiting seroconversion for at least 1 viral strain (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, or B) contained in the trivalent vaccines at day 28 after vaccination. Seroconversion was defined as an at least 4-fold increase of HAI titer from baseline. Secondary immunogenicity outcomes were GMTs of HAI titers, seroprotection rates, seroconversion rates, and seroconversion factors for each vaccine strain at days 28 and 180. Seroprotection was defined as an HAI titer of 1:40 or greater, and seroconversion factor was defined as the fold increase in anti-HAI titers for each viral strain before and after vaccination, according to the standard definition of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products. A seroconversion factor of 2.5 or greater is required. The secondary clinical outcome was the proportion of participants with clinical or subclinical influenza confirmed by PCR by day 180. Safety outcomes included vaccine reactogenicity, defined as the proportion of participants with local or systemic solicited adverse events by day 7, and the proportion of participants with de novo anti-HLA antibodies, biopsy-proven acute rejection, and death by day 180 after vaccination.

We asked study participants to systematically perform nasopharyngeal swabs during the influenza seasons. We observed a higher incidence of breakthrough influenza (6%), with most infections detected through systematic screening. This is an important difference with previous trials performed in the transplant population in which the low incidence of influenza (1.0%–1.8%) precluded any analysis of the clinical efficacy. Despite higher antibody titers observed in the intervention vaccines arms, we did not observe differences in the incidence of influenza. This can be explained by the fact that a large proportion (83%) of the patients included in the trial have received previous influenza vaccination, so that some of these patients may have some degree of baseline protection against disease, in particular for severe complications of influenza, but not for mild upper respiratory tract infection. Also, although this is 1 of the largest trials performed in transplant recipients, a larger sample size might have been necessary to detect a small effect of the intervention on breakthrough influenza, as observed with the high-dose vaccine in the elderly. Finally, it is unlikely that the lack of improved efficacy of intervention vaccines is explained by the additional protection against B strain (Yamagata lineage) that was included only in the quadrivalent standard vaccine because influenza B/Yamagata strains were not detected in Switzerland and Spain during the study period. This is in line with the observed decrease in the incidence of influenza B/Yamagata in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Related to that, both MF59-adjuvanted and high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccines are now available and approved in people aged 65 years or older.

METHODS

Study Design

The Swiss/Spanish Trial in Solid Organ Transplantation on Prevention of Influenza (STOP-FLU) was a double-blind, multicenter, randomized, superiority clinical trial of standard-dose nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine versus MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine versus high-dose influenza vaccine in SOT recipients. The protocol and statistical analysis plan are presented in the Supplementary Material.

Study participants were enrolled between October and December during 2 consecutive influenza seasons (2018–2019 and 2019–2020) at the outpatient transplant clinics of 6 participating centers during the first and second season (Basel, Bern, Geneva, Lausanne, Lugano, and Zurich in Switzerland) and at 3 additional centers during the second season (Chur and St. Gallen in Switzerland and Seville in Spain). The study protocol was approved by local ethics committees at each participating center (protocol numbers 2017–01922 in Switzerland and 2019-001974-27 in Spain) and was registered at(NCT03699839).

Participants

We included adult (≥ 18 years old) SOT recipients who underwent transplantation at least 3 months before enrollment. Exclusion criteria were hypersensitivity to any component of the study vaccines, previous life-threatening reaction to influenza vaccine, ongoing therapy for rejection, current treatment with immunoglobulins or eculizumab, rituximab therapy within 6 months, ABO-incompatible transplantation, pregnancy/breastfeeding, and inability to comply with the study protocol. Patients who were vaccinated during the current vaccination campaign were also excluded. Patients enrolled during the first year were excluded from participating again during the second year of recruitment. All participants provided written, informed consent.

### Alternative strategies of posttransplant influenza vaccination in adult solid organ transplant recipients [^113EWtFW]. American Journal of Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at increased risk of influenza disease and associated complications. The mainstay of prevention is the annual standard-dose influenza vaccine, as studies showed decreased influenza-related morbidity and mortality in vaccinated SOT recipients compared to those unvaccinated. Nonetheless, the immune response in this high-risk population is suboptimal compared to healthy individuals. Over the past two decades, several vaccination strategies have been investigated to overcome this inadequate immune response in SOT recipients. Howbeit, the best vaccination strategy and optimal timing of influenza vaccination remain unclear. This review will provide a detailed summary of studies of various influenza vaccination strategies in adult SOT recipients, discussing immunogenicity results, and addressing their limitations and knowledge gaps.

### Influenza in immunosuppressed populations: a review of infection frequency, morbidity, mortality, and vaccine responses [^112CbaKe]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2009). Medium credibility.

Patients that are immunosuppressed might be at risk of serious influenza-associated complications. As a result, multiple guidelines recommend influenza vaccination for patients infected with HIV, who have received solid-organ transplants, who have received haemopoietic stem-cell transplants, and patients on haemodialysis. However, immunosuppression might also limit vaccine responses. To better inform policy, we reviewed the published work relevant to incidence, outcomes, and prevention of influenza infection in these patients, and in patients being treated chemotherapy and with systemic corticosteroids. Available data suggest that most immunosuppressed populations are indeed at higher risk of influenza-associated complications, have a general trend toward impaired humoral vaccine responses (although these data are mixed), and can be safely vaccinated — although longitudinal data are largely lacking. Randomised clinical trial data were limited to one study of HIV-infected patients with high vaccine efficacy. Better trial data would inform vaccination recommendations on the basis of efficacy and cost in these at-risk populations.

Secondary Outcomes

Other immunogenicity parameters are illustrated in Table 3 and in Supplementary Figure 1. GMT titers and seroconversion rates for each viral strain were generally higher in the intervention vaccine groups at day 28 (seroconversion rates ranging from 25% to 57% depending on the vaccine strain) compared with the standard vaccine group (13% to 35%). Seroprotection rates at day 28 were also higher in the intervention vaccine groups. Prespecified predictors of vaccine response are shown in Supplementary Table 3.

Microbiologically confirmed influenza occurred in 35/598 (6%) participants, without differences between groups (Table 4). Of the 35 episodes of influenza, 23 (66%) were diagnosed only through surveillance testing. All 9 episodes diagnosed during routine clinical practice were treated with oseltamivir. Among those, 2 participants had bacterial pneumonia and were admitted to the hospital (1 in the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine group and 1 in the high-dose vaccine group). None of the participants was admitted to the intensive care unit or died because of influenza.

Safety

All 3 vaccines were safe and well tolerated. During the first 7 days after vaccination, solicited adverse events occurred in 121/204 participants (59%) in the standard vaccine group, 177/209 (84%) in the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine group, and 175/203 (86%) in the high-dose vaccine group (Table 5). Most of the solicited adverse events were mild and self-limited (Supplementary Table 4). Serious adverse events occurred in 48/204 (24%) participants in the standard, 28/209 (13%) in the MF59-adjuvanted, and 34/203 (17%) in the high-dose vaccine groups. Only 1 of those serious adverse events was correlated with vaccination (panniculitis 3 days after high-dose vaccination). Rates of de novo anti-HLA antibodies and biopsy proven acute rejection were low among all vaccine groups (Table 5). Two patients died during follow-up of a cause not related with vaccination or influenza (1 suicide and 1 sudden death).

### Immunogenicity of high-dose versus MF59-adjuvanted versus standard influenza vaccine in solid organ transplant recipients: the Swiss / Spanish trial in solid organ transplantation on prevention of influenza (STOP-FLU trial) [^116t65nM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Serum samples were collected at baseline and days 28 and 180 after vaccination for immunogenicity and anti–human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies analysis. Study participants were asked to record and grade solicited local and systemic adverse events (detailed in Supplementary Table 2) as well as body temperature on a diary card within 7 days after vaccination.

During the influenza season, patients were instructed to refer to their transplant center in case of symptoms suggestive of influenza-like illness (cough, fever, and/or sudden onset of illness) to perform an influenza-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test in the nasopharyngeal swab. In addition, each study participant was instructed by a study nurse to collect 5 nasopharyngeal swabs (flocked swabs with viral transport media) at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 after the onset of the influenza season and to fill in a questionnaire asking for symptoms of influenza at the time of each swab. Patients performed the swab themselves and couriered it to the trial central laboratory (Diagnostic Laboratory at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland). Patients were followed up to 180 days after vaccination.

Immunogenicity was assessed by the measurement of hemagglutinin-inhibition (HAI) titers using the hemagglutinin-inhibition assay performed in the same batch at the Department of Biomedicine of the University of Basel, following the standardized World Health Organization methods. Briefly, serum was incubated with standardized amounts of influenza antigens followed by addition of a suspension of 0.5% red blood cells. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) were determined by doubling dilutions of antibody starting from an initial dilution of 1:8 to a final dilution of 1:1024. Samples with a negative result were assigned a titer of 1:4. Internal positive (same highly positive serum) and negative controls were used.

Influenza-specific PCR tests were performed as part of routine clinical practice at the treating center in case of symptomatic infection. Influenza-specific PCR on surveillance nasopharyngeal swabs were performed at the diagnostic laboratory at the University Hospital Basel according to established protocols with RNA extraction on an Abbott robotic system (m2000sp, Switzerland) followed by PCR against Influenza A and B with a kit from Altona Diagnostics (Hamburg, Germany) on an ABI7500 light cycler (ThermoFisher, Switzerland). Anti-HLA antibodies were measured by solid-phase assay on beads (LABScreen mixed; OneLambda, ThermoFischer, Switzerland) and the titer was determined by the mean fluorescence index of each specific bead, according to standard procedures.

Randomization and Masking

Eligible patients were centrally randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 1 intramuscular injection of the standard dose nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine (standard vaccine group), the MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine (MF59-adjuvanted vaccine group), or the high-dose influenza vaccine (high-dose vaccine group). A block randomization with varying block sizes was applied using the electronic Data Capture System SecuTrial. Randomization was stratified by type of organ (kidney vs others) and time after transplantation (up to 12 months vs more than 12 months). Because of delayed availability of the high-dose vaccine during the 2019–2020 season, block randomization was modified to allow initial allocation of participants to the standard and the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine only, with subsequent compensation when the high-dose vaccine became available. According to the allocated intervention, participants received one intramuscular injection in the deltoid of the nondominant arm of the vaccine by a nurse not involved in the trial. Because of slight differences in the suspension color between vaccines, participants were not allowed to look at the syringe during injection.

Procedures

Participants randomized in the standard vaccine group received VaxigripTetra (Sanofi-Pasteur MSD, France), those randomized in the MF59-adjuvated vaccine group received Fluad (PaxVax Berna GmbH, Switzerland), and those randomized in the high-dose vaccine group received Fluzone-HD (Sanofi-Pasteur, France). All are commercially available, inactivated, split-virion influenza vaccines. VaxigripTetra is a quadrivalent nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine containing 15 µg of hemagglutinin antigen per strain. Fluad is a trivalent influenza vaccine containing 15 µg of hemagglutinin antigen per strain and the adjuvant MF59. Fluzone-HD is a trivalent nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine containing 60 µg of hemagglutinin antigen per strain. The influenza strains contained in the vaccines are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The quadrivalent vaccine (VaxigripTetra) contained an additional B strain (Yamagata lineage) for both seasons.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2025–2026: technical report [^112EcsTK]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Immunization of immunocompromised and solid organ transplant recipients — Guidelines for the immunization of immunocompromised children and adults have been published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the CDC, and the CDC has published additional recommendations for influenza immunization of adult solid organ transplant recipients. In June 2024, the CDC ACIP recommended high-dose inactivated (HD-IIV3) and adjuvanted inactivated (aIIV3) influenza vaccines as acceptable options for influenza vaccination of solid organ transplant recipients aged 18 through 64 years who are on immunosuppressive medication regimens, without a preference over other age-appropriate IIV3s or RIV3, and studies in pediatric solid organ transplant recipients are ongoing.

### Influenza vaccine strategies for solid organ transplant recipients [^115BtX5j]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this study was to highlight recent evidence on important aspects of influenza vaccination in solid organ transplant recipients.

Recent Findings

Influenza vaccine is the most evaluated vaccine in transplant recipients. The immunogenicity of the vaccine is suboptimal after transplantation. Newer formulations such as inactivated unadjuvanted high-dose influenza vaccine and the administration of a booster dose within the same season have shown to increase response rates. Intradermal vaccination and adjuvanted vaccines did not show clear benefit over standard influenza vaccines. Recent studies in transplant recipients do not suggest a higher risk for allograft rejection, neither after vaccination with a standard influenza vaccine nor after the administration of nonstandard formulation (high-dose, adjuvanted vaccines), routes (intradermally) or a booster dose. Nevertheless, influenza vaccine coverage in transplant recipients is still unsatisfactory low, potentially due to misinterpretation of risks and benefits.

Summary

Annual influenza vaccination is well tolerated and is an important part of long-term care of solid organ transplant recipients.

### Immune responses following 3rd and 4th doses of heterologous and homologous COVID-19 vaccines in kidney transplant recipients [^112iscAE]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations of our study include the cross-sectional, non-randomised design including patients from a single centre which may not be representative of the wider population of KTR. Of specific relevance is our use of a steroid sparing immunosuppression protocol, with steroids only being introduced to treat rejection, should it occur. Therefore, patients receiving triple immunosuppression are a surrogate for those who have experienced rejection in our population. As tacrolimus monotherapy use was associated with seroconversion post vaccination, it maybe that our data underestimate serological responses in other solid organ transplant populations. Furthermore, data on other clinical factors such as renal function, body mass index, immunosuppression levels, are not available for this study, and may further influence immunological responses to vaccines in this population. In addition, T cell responses following V4 were only measured in a subset of patients. We are also unable to make any conclusions regarding vaccine efficacy against infection or disease, however anti-S IgG is acknowledged to be a surrogate for clinically relevant outcomes.

Consistent with this immunogenicity data, real world vaccine efficacy has been shown to be inferior in immunocompromised people, who have been at highest risk of breakthrough infections and severe disease, in the pre-Omicron era. So, what does this mean for the strategic forward planning to protect transplant recipients? The data shown in this study suggest that a proportion of transplant recipients who have not responded to the first 4 vaccines, are unlikely to develop meaningful protection with a fifth. Whilst for other immunocompromised people, mostly those on B-cell directed therapies, robust SARS-CoV-2 T-cell responses have been demonstrated in the absence of antibodies, for solid organ transplant patients who are commonly maintained on both B-cell and T-cell inhibiting agents, this will not necessarily be the case. With treatment options also limited in this group, related to relative contraindications and drug interactions, alternative strategies are required to provide protection to this vulnerable group. Modulating immunosuppression regimens at time of vaccination has been shown to be effective in patients being treated for inflammatory conditions, however this strategy may be of greater risk and consequences in transplant recipients at risk of rejection. Novel vaccine platforms such as those designed to induce mucosal immunity, or altered antigen sequences, targeting current variants or incorporating conserved epitopes beyond the spike region may also be of benefit. However, pre-exposure prophylaxis with passive immunity from neutralising monoclonal antibodies whilst they remain effective against the current dominant variant, is likely to currently be the best option in those with impaired responses.

### Two doses of inactivated influenza vaccine improve immune response in solid organ transplant recipients: results of TRANSGRIPE 1–2, a randomized controlled clinical trial [^114EpN5b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Influenza vaccine effectiveness is not optimal in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR). We hypothesized that a booster dose might increase it.

Methods

TRANSGRIPE 1–2 is a phase 3, randomized, controlled, multicenter, open-label clinical trial. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1 stratified by study site, type of organ, and time since transplantation) to receive 1 dose (control group) or 2 doses (booster group) of the influenza vaccine 5 weeks apart.

Results

A total of 499 SOTR were enrolled. Although seroconversion at 10 weeks did not meet significance in the modified intention-to-treat population, seroconversion rates were significantly higher in the booster arm for the per-protocol population (53.8% vs 37.6% for influenza A(H1N1)pdm; 48.1% vs 32.3% for influenza A(H3N2); and 90.7% vs 75% for influenza B; P < .05). Furthermore, seroprotection at 10 weeks was higher in the booster group: 54% vs 43.2% for A(H1N1)pdm; 56.9% vs 45.5% for A(H3N2); and 83.4% vs 71.8% for influenza B (P < .05). The number needed to treat to seroprotect 1 patient was < 10. The clinical efficacy (99.2% vs 98.8%) and serious adverse events (6.4% vs 7.5%) were similar for both groups.

Conclusions

In SOTR, a booster strategy 5 weeks after standard influenza vaccination is safe and effective and induces an increased antibody response compared with standard influenza vaccination consisting of a single dose.

### Efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccination in solid organ transplant recipients: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^11478Sg8]. American Journal of Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The impact of COVID-19 vaccination on clinical outcomes in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients remains unclear. This systematic review and network meta-analysis sought to assess the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccination in SOT recipients. We searched 6 databases from inception to March 1, 2024 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies evaluating different COVID-19 vaccination strategies in SOT recipients. Based on patient-important outcomes, we performed frequentist random-effects pairwise meta-analyses and network meta-analyses, separating RCTs and nonrandomized evidence, and used the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to assess our certainty in the evidence. We included 6 RCTs (N = 814) and 43 observational studies (N = 125 199). Overall, there is a paucity of randomized evidence evaluating COVID-19 vaccines in SOT recipients. The nonrandomized evidence evaluating COVID-19 vaccination strategies patient-important outcomes, including COVID-19 infection, mortality, hospitalization, ICU admission, and rejection, demonstrated low to very low certainty due to the included studies' risk of bias. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians and SOT recipients worked with minimal, very low-quality evidence in relation to COVID-19 vaccines in this population. In the instance of future public health emergencies, clinicians and researchers should collaborate closely with patient partners to ensure there is sufficient evidence in the transplant population on patient-important outcomes.

### Influenza, including the novel H1N1, in organ transplant patients [^113NLH7F]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article will review the epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention and management of influenza in solid organ transplant recipients.

Recent Findings

A number of recent studies have documented that influenza vaccination is both well tolerated and generally effective in producing an immunologic response in most solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. Antiviral use is associated with improved clinical outcomes, but prolonged shedding may require a longer course of therapy than what is currently approved by the FDA. Antiviral resistance emerges rarely in transplant patients and should be considered in all patients with an inadequate clinical and/or virologic response.

Summary

Influenza is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in lung transplant recipients. Molecular diagnostics are preferred over other diagnostic modalities, if available. Influenza vaccination is well tolerated and provides protective benefit in most SOT recipients; in those with contraindications to vaccination or in whom responses are predicted to be poor, antivirals may be considered. Antiviral therapy is associated with improved outcomes in transplant patients and treatment should be continued until clinically and virologic response have been documented. Resistance, particularly with patients infected with the pandemic influenza A/H1N1, should be considered and treated with an antiviral with predicted activity.

### Safety and efficacy of influenza vaccination in renal transplant recipients [^111gRRfa]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

This Practice Point commentary discusses Scharpé et al.'s single-center, nonrandomized, prospective trial of influenza vaccination in renal transplant recipients. In total, 165 transplant recipients and 41 healthy volunteers were vaccinated with a standard inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (containing strains of the A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B viruses). No rejection episodes or other adverse events were reported in either group. Influenza-specific antibody titers increased in renal transplant recipients following vaccination, as measured by comparison of pre-vaccination and post-vaccination seroprotection and seroresponse rates. This commentary discusses the limitations of the trial, and urges caution in extending the conclusions drawn by Scharpé et al. regarding the safety of the trivalent, non-adjuvant-containing influenza vaccine to newer adjuvant-assisted vaccines. Annual vaccination for influenza by use of the trivalent vaccine strategy without adjuvant should, however, be standard of care for all stable renal transplant recipients who do not have clinical contraindications.

### Influenza vaccines in the setting of solid-organ transplantation: are they safe? [^113qYaH7]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Influenza is a major cause of morbidity and sometimes mortality in immunocompromised patients, including solid-organ transplant (SOT) recipients. Current guidelines call for influenza immunization of SOT recipients from 3 months posttransplant onward; the stated reason for delaying immunization in the early posttransplant period is an efficacy rather than a safety issue. Despite concerns about possible rejection raised in small case series and studies of alloimmune responses in immunized patients, virtually all larger clinical studies have shown no increased risk of rejection or allograft dysfunction after influenza vaccination.

Recent Findings

Further evidence, mostly supporting the safety of influenza vaccine, has been published during the past 2 years. For example, one study using a large database of 51,730 adult Medicare primary renal transplant recipients showed that influenza vaccination was actually associated with a lower risk of graft loss and death. It appears that actual influenza infection itself, rather than the vaccine, carries a risk of allograft dysfunction.

Summary

At this time, influenza vaccine after SOT is considered clinically safe, and current evidence supports the guidelines' recommendations to immunize. The issue of optimal timing for efficacy still remains to be resolved. In addition, educational tools for increasing the acceptance of influenza vaccine in healthcare workers and family members are described.

Live vaccine and timing of vaccine in kidney transplant recipients — There is no particular reason for a 6-month lag between transplant and vaccination, and in the United States most individuals are on their baseline maintenance immunosuppression therapy by 3 months posttransplant. Recipients also should avoid intimate contact with individuals who have received live vaccines, including contact after children have received oral polio vaccine for 3 weeks, and immunosuppressed individuals are advised to avoid contact for 7 days with individuals who have received live virus nasal sprays for influenza. We concur with the recommendation for flu vaccine, but common practice in the United States is to wait 3–6 months after transplant before it is administered.

### Navigating the unknown: the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and solid organ transplantation [^111SR68d]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on solid organ transplantation and the most recent data pertinent to disease course and outcomes in this patient population.

Recent Findings

The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted solid organ transplantation with decreased transplant rates in 2020 but improved in 2021, albeit not entirely to prepandemic levels. Mortality rates of COVID-19 in this patient population continued to be higher, although have improved with more available therapeutic options and vaccination. Immunosuppressed patients were found to require additional vaccine doses given blunted response and continue to be more vulnerable to the infection. Data on immunosuppression alteration when patients have COVID-19 are not available and is an area of ongoing research. Significant interaction with the metabolism of immunosuppression limits the use of some of the new antiviral therapies in patients with organ transplants. Finally, many logistical challenges continue to face the transplantation discipline, especially with pretransplant vaccine hesitancy, however acceptance of organs from donor who had COVID-19 recent infection or died from the infection is increasing.

Summary

Immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients continue to be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection with a blunted response to the available vaccines and will likely remain more susceptible to infection.

### How immunocompromised hosts were left behind in the quest to control the COVID-19 pandemic [^112F12jG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Estimates indicate 3%–6% of the US and European population are affected by immunosuppressive conditions. For countries with a high prevalence of untreated and undiagnosed HIV, this figure may even higher. The spectrum of immunosuppressive conditions beyond transplantation and hematologic and nonhematologic malignancies that may increase risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity is broad. An expanding proportion of the population at risk includes those with autoimmune conditions, genetic and chromosomal conditions with inherent host defense alterations, recipients of novel cellular and monoclonal antibody therapies, and untreated or poorly controlled HIV.

Virtually all initial trials evaluating novel vaccines, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 excluded immunosuppressed individuals from participation (Figure 1). If not excluded, this population accounted for a small fraction of enrolled participants, precluding meaningful subgroup analysis. The rationale for this decision in the vaccine program was historically poor response rates of vaccines in immunocompromised patients, theoretical concerns for vaccine-enhanced disease complications (eg, organ rejection), and worry that expected higher baseline rate of severe adverse events in clinical trials in immunocompromised patients might impact efficacy or even licensure issues, among others (Table 1). For mAbs and antiviral drugs in this population, concerns also included altered pharmacokinetics, especially with the wide range of medications taken by immunocompromised patients, uncertainty about doses or if regimens required for mAbs and antivirals might differ substantially from immunocompetent persons, and theoretical complications (eg, organ rejection), among others. These concerns, coupled with the need for rapid clinical trial accrual to address an ongoing pandemic and the uncertain infection rate for predicting sample size, led to the exclusion of all but the most mildly immunocompromised persons into the pivotal trials of vaccines, mAbs, and antivirals in both government and industry sponsored trials, not only in 2020 but up to the present time.

### A systematic review of safety and immunogenicity of influenza vaccination strategies in solid organ transplant recipients [^114R2cpt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Immunogenicity from seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) remains suboptimal in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs). We conducted a systematic review that compared the safety and immunogenicity of nonstandard influenza vaccination strategies with single-dose IIV in SOTRs. Booster doses and possibly high-dose (HD) influenza vaccination strategies seem to hold promise for improving vaccination immunogenicity in SOTRs. Administration of intradermal and MF59-adjuvanted trivalent IIV (IIV3) did not improve vaccine immunogenicity compared with single-dose intramuscular IIV. Alternative vaccine strategies were generally well tolerated; SOTRs who received HD, intradermal or adjuvanted IIV3 had a higher frequency of infection site reactions, while systemic adverse events were more frequent in SOTRs who received HD IIV3. Allograft rejection rates were similar in both groups. SOTRs should continue to receive standard-dose IIV annually in accordance with current recommendations, pending future studies to determine the optimal timing, frequency, and dosage of IIV using the booster-dose strategy.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2023–2024 [^111BBx2X]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics — immunocompromised and transplant-related timing for influenza vaccination — advises for malignant neoplasms that "vaccine should be administered ≥ 2 weeks before cytotoxic chemotherapy when clinically possible". For children who "have received anti-B cell therapies in the previous 6 months, IIV should be deferred until there is evidence of B cell recovery". For "hematopoietic stem cell recipients, IIV can be given starting 4 to 6 months after transplantation". For "solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, IIV can be given beginning at 3 months after receipt of an SOT, although it may be considered ≥ 1 month after receipt of an SOT during the influenza season".

### The natural history of influenza infection in the severely immunocompromised vs nonimmunocompromised hosts [^112o85VR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Medical advances have led to an increase in the world's population of immunosuppressed individuals. The most severely immunocompromised patients are those who have been diagnosed with a hematologic malignancy, solid organ tumor, or who have other conditions that require immunosuppressive therapies and/or solid organ or stem cell transplants.

Materials and Methods

Medically attended patients with a positive clinical diagnosis of influenza were recruited prospectively and clinically evaluated. Nasal washes and serum were collected. Evaluation of viral shedding, nasal and serum cytokines, clinical illness, and clinical outcomes were performed to compare severely immunocompromised individuals to nonimmunocompromised individuals with influenza infection.

Results

Immunocompromised patients with influenza had more severe disease/complications, longer viral shedding, and more antiviral resistance while demonstrating less clinical symptoms and signs on clinical assessment.

Conclusions

Immunocompromised patients are at risk for more severe or complicated influenza induced disease, which may be difficult to prevent with existing vaccines and antiviral treatments. Specific issues to consider when managing a severely immunocompromised host include the development of asymptomatic shedding, multi-drug resistance during prolonged antiviral therapy, and the potential high risk of pulmonary involvement.

### A double-blind, randomized trial of high-dose vs standard-dose influenza vaccine in adult solid-organ transplant recipients [^116abW2o]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The annual standard-dose (SD) influenza vaccine has suboptimal immunogenicity in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs). Influenza vaccine that contains higher doses of antigens may lead to greater immunogenicity in this population.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial to compare the safety and immunogenicity of the 2016–2017 high-dose (HD; FluzoneHD, Sanofi) vs SD (Fluviral, GSK) influenza vaccine in adult SOTRs. Preimmunization and 4-week postimmunization sera underwent strain-specific hemagglutination inhibition assay.

Results

We enrolled 172 patients who received study vaccine, and 161 (84 HD; 77 SD) were eligible for analysis. Seroconversion to at least 1 of 3 vaccine antigens was present in 78.6% vs 55.8% in HD vs SD vaccine groups (P < .001), respectively. Seroconversions to A/ H1N1, A/H3N2, and B strains were 40.5% vs 20.5%, 57.1% vs 32.5%, and 58.3% vs 41.6% in HD vs SD vaccine groups (P = 0.006, P = 0.002, P = 0.028, respectively). Post-immunization geometric mean titers of A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B strains were significantly higher in the HD group (P = 0.007, P = 0.002, P = 0.033). Independent factors associated with seroconversion to at least 1 vaccine strain were the use of HD vaccine (odds ratio [OR], 3.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.56–6.67) and use of mycophenolate doses < 2 g daily (OR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.12–6.76).

Conclusions

HD vaccine demonstrated significantly better immunogenicity than SD vaccine in adult transplant recipients and may be the preferred influenza vaccine for this population.

### Oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu) [^1124WNZd]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Immunocompromised Subjects

A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted for seasonal prophylaxis of influenza in 475 immunocompromised subjects (including 18 pediatric subjects 1 year to 12 years of age) who had received solid organ (n = 388; liver, kidney, liver and kidney) or hematopoietic stem cell transplants (n = 87). Median time since transplant for solid organ transplant recipients was 1,105 days for the placebo group and 1,379 days for the TAMIFLU group. Median time since transplant for hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients was 424 days for the placebo group and 367 days for the TAMIFLU group. Approximately 40% of subjects received influenza vaccine prior to entering the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of confirmed clinical influenza, defined as oral temperature higher than 99.0°F (37.2°C) plus cough and/or coryza, all recorded within 24 hours, plus either a positive virus culture or a four-fold increase in virus antibody titers from baseline. Subjects received treatment with TAMIFLU 75 mg or placebo once daily by mouth for 12 weeks. The incidence of confirmed clinical influenza was 3% (7/238) in the placebo group compared with 2% (5/237) in the TAMIFLU group; this difference was not statistically significant. A secondary analysis was performed using the same clinical symptoms and RT-PCR for laboratory confirmation of influenza infection. Among subjects who were not already shedding virus at baseline, the incidence of RT-PCR-confirmed clinical influenza infection was 3% (7/231) in the placebo group and < 1% (1/232) in the TAMIFLU group.

### Influenza vaccines in immunosuppressed adults with cancer [^114YxzNP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of the Cochrane review published in 2013, Issue 10. Immunosuppressed cancer patients are at increased risk of serious influenza-related complications. Guidelines, therefore, recommend influenza vaccination for these patients. However, data on vaccine effectiveness in this population are lacking, and the value of vaccination in this population remains unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in immunosuppressed adults with malignancies. The primary review outcome is all-cause mortality, preferably at the end of the influenza season. Influenza-like illness (ILI, a clinical definition), confirmed influenza, pneumonia, any hospitalisations, influenza-related mortality and immunogenicity were defined as secondary outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS databases up to May 2017. We searched the following conference proceedings: ICAAC, ECCMID, IDSA (infectious disease conferences), ASH, ASBMT, EBMT (haematological), and ASCO (oncological) between the years 2006 to 2017. In addition, we scanned the references of all identified studies and pertinent reviews. We searched the websites of the manufacturers of influenza vaccine. Finally, we searched for ongoing or unpublished trials in clinical trial registry databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), prospective and retrospective cohort studies and case-control studies were considered, comparing inactivated influenza vaccines versus placebo, no vaccination or a different vaccine, in adults (16 years and over) with cancer. We considered solid malignancies treated with chemotherapy, haematological cancer patients treated or not treated with chemotherapy, cancer patients post-autologous (up to six months after transplantation) or allogeneic (at any time) haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from included studies adhering to Cochrane methodology. Meta-analysis could not be performed because of different outcome and denominator definitions in the included studies.

Main Results

We identified six studies with a total of 2275 participants: five studies comparing vaccination with no vaccination, and one comparing adjuvanted vaccine with non-adjuvanted vaccine. Three studies were RCTs, one was a prospective observational cohort study and two were retrospective cohort studies. For the comparison of vaccination with no vaccination we included two RCTs and three observational studies, including 2202 participants. One study reported results in person-years while the others reported results per person. The five studies were performed between 1993 and 2015 and included adults with haematological diseases (three studies), patients following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) (two studies) and solid malignancies (three studies). One RCT and two observational studies reported all-cause mortality; the RCT showed similar mortality rates in both arms (odds ratio (OR) 1.25 (95% CI 0.43 to 3.62; 1 study, 78 participants, low-certainty evidence)); and the observational studies demonstrated a significant association between vaccine receipt and lower risk of death, adjusted hazard ratio 0.88 (95% CI 0.78 to 1; 1 study, 1577 participants, very low-certainty evidence) in one study and OR 0.42 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.75; 1 study, 806 participants, very low-certainty evidence) in the other. One RCT reported a reduction in ILI with vaccination, while no difference was observed in one observational study. Confirmed influenza rates were lower with vaccination in one RCT and the three observational studies, the difference reaching statistical significance in one. Pneumonia was observed significantly less frequently with vaccination in one observational study, but no difference was detected in another or in the RCT. One RCT showed a reduction in hospitalisations following vaccination, while an observational study found no difference. No life-threatening or persistent adverse effects from vaccination were reported. The strength of evidence was limited by the low number of included studies and by their low methodological quality and the certainty of the evidence for the mortality outcome according to GRADE was low to very low. For the comparison of adjuvanted vaccine with non-adjuvanted vaccine, we identified one RCT, including 73 patients. No differences were found for the primary and all secondary outcomes assessed. Mortality risk ratio was 0.54 (95% CI 0.05 to 5.73; low-certainty evidence) in the adjuvanted vaccine group. The quality of evidence was low due to the small sample size and the large confidence intervals for all outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Observational data suggest lower mortality and infection-related outcomes with influenza vaccination. The strength of evidence is limited by the small number of studies and low grade of evidence. It seems that the evidence, although weak, shows that the benefits overweigh the potential risks when vaccinating adults with cancer against influenza. However, additional placebo or no-treatment controlled RCTs of influenza vaccination among adults with cancer is ethically questionable. There is no conclusive evidence regarding the use of adjuvanted versus non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine in this population.

### Immunisations in solid-organ transplant recipients [^115HeFM6]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Solid-organ transplant recipients are at increased risk of various infectious diseases, some of which are vaccine preventable mmunisations are among the most efficient interventions available. Solid-organ tranplant recipients would greatly benefit from effective immunisations, provided the recommendations are based on a careful risk-benefit analysis in which the effectiveness of the vaccine is weighed against possible adverse reactions, including graft rejection. In this review, we summarise the data from studies on relevant immunisations in solid-organ transplant recipients. The major issues are the immunogenicity and safety of immunisations, the factors associated with poor immune response, and recommendations for immunisation schemes.

### Influenza vaccines in immunosuppressed adults with cancer [^112szyvR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Immunosuppressed cancer patients are at increased risk of serious influenza-related complications. Guidelines, therefore, recommend influenza vaccination for these patients. However, data on vaccine effectiveness in this population is lacking, and the value of vaccination in this population remains unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in immunosuppressed adults with malignancies. The primary review outcome is all-cause mortality, preferably at the end of the influenza season. Influenza-like illness (ILI, a clinical definition), confirmed influenza, pneumonia, any hospitalization and influenza-related mortality were defined as secondary outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS databases up to August 2013. We searched the following conference proceedings: ICAAC, ECCMID, IDSA (infectious disease conferences), ASH, ASBMT, EBMT (hematological), and ASCO (oncological) between the years 2006 to 2010. In addition, we scanned the references of all identified studies and pertinent reviews. We searched the websites of the manufacturers of influenza vaccine. Finally, we searched for ongoing or unpublished trials in clinical trial registry databases using the website.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective and retrospective cohort studies and case-control studies were considered, comparing inactivated influenza vaccines versus placebo, no vaccination or a different vaccine, in adults (16 years and over) with cancer. We considered solid malignancies treated with chemotherapy, haematological cancer patients treated or not treated with chemotherapy, cancer patients post-autologous (up to six months after transplantation) or allogeneic (at any time) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from included studies adhering to Cochrane methodology. Meta-analysis could not be performed because of different outcome and denominator definitions in the included studies.

Main Results

We identified four studies: one RCT and three observational studies, including 2124 participants. One study reported results in person-years while the other three reported per person. The studies were performed between 1993 and 2012 and included adults with haematological diseases (two studies), patients following bone marrow transplantation (one study) and solid malignancies (three studies). Only two observational studies reported all-cause mortality; one showing an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.88 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.99) for death with vaccination and the other reporting an odds ratio (OR) of 0.43 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.71). The RCT reported a statistically significant reduction in ILI with vaccination, while no difference was observed in one observational study. Confirmed influenza rates were lower with vaccination in the three observational studies, the difference reaching statistical significance in one. Pneumonia was observed significantly less frequently with vaccination in one observational study, but no difference was detected in another or in the RCT. The RCT showed a reduction in hospitalizations following vaccination, while an observational study found no difference. No life-threatening or persistent adverse effects from vaccination were reported. The strength of evidence is limited by the low number of included studies and by their low methodological quality (high risk of bias).

Authors' Conclusions

Observational data suggests a lower mortality with influenza vaccination. Infection-related outcomes were lower or similar with influenza vaccination. The strength of evidence is limited by the small number of studies and by the fact that only one was a RCT. Influenza vaccination is safe and the evidence, although weak, is in favour of vaccinating adults with cancer receiving chemotherapy.

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) guidelines for the care of heart transplant recipients [^111t6SJr]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Patient management during a pandemic — COVID-19 vaccination guidance for solid organ transplant (SOT) populations includes the ISHLT and other organizations' considerations: pretransplant vaccination of all SOT candidates as a priority whenever feasible; continued SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in SOT recipients and priority for vaccination of their household members and caregivers; continuation of a stable immunosuppression regimen at the time of vaccination to avoid the risk of organ rejection until more comprehensive data are available; and continued adherence of all transplant recipients to masking and social distancing regardless of vaccination status. The guideline notes that antibody response to COVID-19 vaccines are not as robust in transplant recipients as in non-transplant patients and reports a randomized clinical trial in which a third dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine in transplant recipients who had already received two doses showed enhanced immune response against Covid-19. Based on current evidence, the ISHLT states, "we recommend providing a third dose of mRNA vaccine for SOT recipients that have previously completed a 2-dose mRNA vaccine series if local regulations allow", and that "The use of a third dose should, until further evidence is available, be based on individual patients' unique situation and must depend on local availability of vaccines and local regulations".

### Cell-mediated immune responses after influenza vaccination of solid organ transplant recipients: secondary outcomes analyses of a randomized controlled trial [^113M29GZ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite annual immunization, solid organ transplant (SOT) patients remain at increased risk for severe influenza infection because of suboptimal vaccine immunogenicity. We aimed to compare the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses of the high-dose (HD) and the standard-dose (SD) trivalent inactivated vaccine.

Methods

We collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells pre- and postimmunization from 60 patients enrolled in a randomized trial of HD versus SD vaccine (30 HD; 30 SD) during the 2016–2017 influenza season.

Results

The HD vaccine elicited significantly greater monofunctional and polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses against influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B. For example, median vaccine-elicited influenza-specific polyfunctional CD4+ T cells were higher in recipients of the HD than SD vaccine after stimulation with influenza A/H1N1 (1193 vs 0 per 10⁶ CD4+ T cells; P = 0.003), A/H3N2 (1154 vs 51; P = 0.008), and B (1102 vs 0; P = 0.001). Likewise, vaccine-elicited influenza-specific polyfunctional CD8+ T cells were higher in recipients of the HD than SD vaccine after stimulation with influenza B (367 vs 0; P = 0.002).

Conclusions

Our study provides novel evidence that HD vaccine elicits greater cellular responses compared with the SD vaccine in SOT recipients, which provides support to preferentially consider use of HD vaccination in the SOT setting.

### Evolving strategies to optimize immunization and protection of pediatric transplantation recipients [^113XLrgJ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Indications for pediatric solid organ (SOT) and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have expanded concurrently with a repertoire of new biologics and transplant-related immunosuppression regimens, leading to a growing population of immunocompromised children who remain at risk for infections. Immunization of these children is fundamental in preventing and mitigating the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD), yet remains suboptimal. This review summarizes emerging pediatric data, including new vaccine formulations, guidance updates, and evolving immunization strategies aimed at optimizing vaccine-mediated protection in pediatric transplant recipients, while highlighting ongoing knowledge gaps.

Recent Findings

Despite published recommendations, immunization remains an underutilized prevention strategy resulting in pediatric SOT and HCT candidates and recipients remaining sub-optimally vaccinated and at risk for VPD. New immunizations, including recombinant hepatitis B, higher-valency pneumococcal conjugate, recombinant zoster, meningococcal b and polyvalent meningitis vaccines, and long-acting RSV monoclonal antibodies, show promise in providing enhanced immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy, but remain largely off-label or insufficiently studied in pediatric transplant recipients. Emerging evidence support the safety and immunogenicity of live attenuated viral vaccines (MMR, varicella) in selected pediatric SOT recipients and high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine in pediatric allogeneic HCT recipients. Inclusion of transplant recipients in vaccine clinical trials is essential, as is additional research to improve our understanding of mechanisms of vaccine immunogenicity and evaluation of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses that could best serve as surrogates of protective immunity in this population and inform individual vaccine recommendations.

Summary

Recent advances in immunizations offer new opportunities to prioritize vaccination both before and after SOT and HCT to enhance the protection against VPD in pediatric transplant recipients and improve their clinical outcomes. Future research should prioritize inclusion of pediatric transplant recipients in clinical trials and studies aimed at improving our understanding of vaccine safety, efficacy, and effectiveness in this population.

### Randomized controlled trial of high-dose intradermal versus standard-dose intramuscular influenza vaccine in organ transplant recipients [^116BGgc3]. American Journal of Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

The immunogenicity of standard intramuscular (IM) influenza vaccine is suboptimal in transplant recipients. Also, recent studies suggest that alloantibody may be upregulated due to vaccination. We evaluated a novel high-dose intradermal (ID) vaccine strategy. In conjunction, we assessed alloimmunity. Transplant recipients were randomized to receive IM or high-dose ID vaccine. Strain-specific serology and HLA alloantibody production was determined pre- and postimmunization. In 212 evaluable patients (105 IM, 107 ID), seroprotection to H1N1, H3N2 and B strains was 70.5%, 63.8% and 52.4% in the IM group, and 71.0%, 70.1%, 63.6% in the ID group (p = ns). Seroconversion to ≥ 1 antigen was 46.7% and 51.4% in the IM and ID groups respectively (p = 0.49). Response was more likely in those ≥ 6 months posttransplant (53.2% vs. 19.2%; p = 0.001). Use of mycophenolate mofetil was inversely associated with vaccine response in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.001). Certain organ subgroups had higher response rates for influenza B in the ID vaccine group. Differences in anti-HLA antibody production were detected in only 3/212(1.4%) patients with no clinical consequences. High-dose intradermal vaccine is an alternative to standard vaccine and has potential enhanced immunogenicity in certain subgroups. In this large cohort, we also show that seasonal influenza does not result in significant alloantibody production.

### Effect of influenza vaccination in solid organ transplant recipients: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^1118d8S6]. American Journal of Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Influenza vaccination is recommended for solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. Seasonal influenza vaccination was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization for all‐cause pneumonia. However, in this nationwide cohort study, seasonal vaccination coverage was < 50%. Therefore, annual influenza vaccination should be prioritized in SOT recipients.

1 INTRODUCTION

The influenza virus is a common cause of respiratory tract infections in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent populations. Influenza is a potentially serious infection in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients and may result in hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), or even death. Annual seasonal influenza vaccination is widely recommended and considered the main strategy for preventing influenza and its complications in immunocompromised patients, including SOT candidates and recipients.

The American Society of Transplantation recommends annual influenza vaccination for all SOT recipients. Nevertheless, SOT recipients are reportedly under‐immunized against influenza, and nearly half of SOT recipients were unvaccinated in both US and European settings. Therefore, a substantial proportion of this high‐risk group of patients is susceptible to influenza infection, despite the widespread availability of vaccines.

Even though the influenza vaccine is the most extensively studied vaccine in transplant recipients, its effectiveness remains controversial. Most studies indicate that antibody responses in SOT recipients are suboptimal after influenza vaccination and that these responses vary depending on the immunosuppressive drug regimen used, the time since transplantation, and the type of graft. There have been few randomized clinical trials involving SOT recipients. Data from multicenter observational studies on SOT recipients with laboratory‐confirmed influenza infection indicated that vaccination during the same influenza season was associated with a decrease in disease severity, assessed as pneumonia occurrence and ICU admission. Thus, recommendations for influenza vaccination in SOT recipients rely on immunogenicity data, observational studies, and efficacy results from non‐immunocompromised populations.

We investigated the effects of seasonal influenza vaccination. Our primary outcome was the incidence of all‐cause pneumonia admission. Secondary outcomes were the incidences of influenza‐related admission and ICU admission, as well as all‐cause mortality in SOT recipients. We conducted a large, nationwide, population‐based observational study using medical registers, and we linked information on vaccinations, hospital admissions, and deaths for all SOT recipients in Denmark to investigate these outcomes during nine consecutive influenza seasons.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE NEEDS

The immunocompromised population was disproportionately affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to a large degree because of the absence of the development of effective preventive and therapeutic strategies to these most vulnerable persons during the early phase of the pandemic. This omission led to considerable measured and unmeasured morbidity in affected people. Although the community of scientists, clinical researchers, and funding agencies have proven that vaccines, mAbs, and small molecules can be made and tested in record time, extending this progress to vulnerable and medically complex individuals from the start has been a major missed opportunity. This has occurred despite the expertise of scientists in designing protocols for randomized placebo-controlled vaccine trials in these patients.

The enormity of the task to rapidly initiate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, monoclonal, and drug therapy programs for the global population was overwhelming and fell short in including what now seems like a largely forgotten patient population and investigative community. Thus, it is paramount to plan for future pandemics by investing in specific clinical trial infrastructures for the immunocompromised population and to be prepared when the need arises (Figure 2). To accomplish this, dedicated funding from government sources, such as the NIH, will be required. Given the scope of the task, pooled funding from various institutes within the NIH may be necessary. Equally important is to enact a regulatory mandate to conduct parallel clinical trials in immunosuppressed patients, including children, early in the development process. Concurrent investments are needed to fund research aimed at understanding the impact of immunologic deficits on infection risk and vaccine response across the spectrum of immunosuppression, as well as developing specific strategies for overcoming these deficits (eg, dose and frequency of vaccination, timing of vaccination, adjuvants).

Key recommendations for developing robust infrastructure for immunocompromised inclusive clinical trials.

The proposed actions need to be implemented now to prevent a similar failure to act when the next pandemic strikes.

Immunizations are a relatively safe and cost-effective intervention to prevent morbidity and mortality associated with vaccine preventable infection (VPIs). As such, immunizations are a critical part of the care of pre and posttransplant patients and should be prioritized. New tools are needed to continue to disseminate and implement the most up-to-date vaccine recommendations for the SOT population. These tools will help both primary care providers and multi-disciplinary transplant team members taking care of transplant patients to stay abreast of evidence-based best practices regarding the immunization of the SOT patient.

We recommend giving all KTRs, who are at least 1-month posttransplant, influenza vaccination prior to the onset of the annual influenza season, regardless of status of immunosuppression (1C). Influenza vaccination needs to be provided on an annual basis in advance of the onset of the annual influenza season, and even while KTRs are receiving high levels of immunosuppression, the benefits of timely vaccination outweigh the risks of delaying vaccination.

### Influenza vaccination in the organ transplant recipient: review and summary recommendations [^114fq9c9]. American Journal of Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Influenza virus causes a spectrum of illness in transplant recipients with a high rate of lower respiratory disease. Seasonal influenza vaccination is an important public health measure recommended for transplant recipients and their close contacts. Vaccine has been shown to be safe and generally well tolerated in both adult and pediatric transplant recipients. However, responses to vaccine are variable and are dependent on various factors including time from transplantation and specific immunosuppressive medication. Seasonal influenza vaccine has demonstrated safety and no conclusive evidence exists for a link between vaccination and allograft dysfunction. Annually updated trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines have been available and routinely used for several decades, although newer influenza vaccination formulations including high-dose vaccine, adjuvanted vaccine, quadrivalent inactivated vaccine and vaccine by intradermal delivery system are now available or will be available in the near future. Safety and immunogenicity data of these new formulations in transplant recipients requires investigation. In this document, we review the current state of knowledge on influenza vaccines in transplant recipients and make recommendations on the use of vaccine in both adult and pediatric organ transplant recipients.

### Relationship between immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccines and development of breakthrough infection in solid organ transplant recipients: the CONTRAST cohort [^111XXh3C]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines as well as their clinical effectiveness have been shown to be lower in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients compared with the general population. Indeed, immune monitoring in this setting has been proposed by some experts in order to identify patients at higher risk of infection in which other preventive strategies (ie, preexposure monoclonal antibodies, booster doses associated with temporary reduction of immunosuppressive treatment) could be implemented.

However, several controversies surround the practice of antibody testing in SOT recipients, including the lack of an established antibody threshold associated with protection in patients on long-term immunosuppression and the potential role of cellular response. Indeed, studies investigating the relationship between the presence and level of antibody response with the rate and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in SOT recipients are limited.

To fill this gap, in the current prospective longitudinal study, we aimed to assess the rate and severity of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections (BIs) and their relationship with antibody response (AbR) in fully vaccinated SOT recipients.

### American Society of Transplantation recommendations for screening, monitoring and reporting of infectious complications in immunosuppression trials in recipients of organ transplantation [^112aGqud]. American Journal of Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

In recent years, major progress has been made in the development, investigation and clinical application of novel immunosuppressive drug therapies to prevent acute rejection. Critical to the ultimate clinical application of new drug therapies is the ongoing performance of large multi-center clinical trials. However, there has been a paucity of infectious disease monitoring built into these protocols. Given that infectious complications are a major source of morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients, the assessment of the magnitude of risk of infection associated with a given immunosuppressive strategy may be as important as the assessment of rejection. For the above reasons, screening, monitoring and reporting recommendations for common transplant-associated infections were developed for use in clinical trials evaluating immunosuppressive strategies. These recommendations have two major goals: (i) to provide clinically relevant definitions for tracking infectious complications occurring in participants in immunosuppressive trials and (ii) where appropriate, to recommend specific laboratory monitoring and surveillance methods.

### Standard-dose versus high-dose flu vaccine in solid organ… [^114MXKJM]. ClinicalTrials (2013). Low credibility.

Standard-dose Versus High-dose Flu Vaccine in Solid Organ Transplant. ClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Influenza infection in recipients of solid organ transplants recipients while on maintenance immunosuppressant therapy is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Although influenza vaccination is recommended in these high-risk patients, safety and immunogenicity of commercially available different strengths of influenza vaccine have not been established. The primary study objective is to determine the safety and immunogenicity of Fluzone and Fluzone High-Dose, with a secondary objective to determine the tolerability and efficacy of two different strengths of trivalent influenza vaccine. Both vaccines are commercially available for use in the general population. Fluzone is approved for use in 6 months of age and older, and Fluzone High-Dose is approved for use in 65 years of age and older.

This is an exploratory, open-label, parallel group, observer blinded, prospective study. All recipients of kidney, lung, heart transplants who attend for post-transplant follow-up, at least 30-days after transplantation at Inova Fairfax Hospital Transplant Center will be eligible for enrollment. Enrolled patients will be followed for three months following enrollment and randomization: day 0 and follow-up visits at weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12. A potential strategy to enhance immune responses to influenza vaccine in this patient population could be to use different strengths of TIV. One of the pathways that can improve the immunogenicity of inactivated vaccines is to increase the dose of influenza antigens contained in the vaccine.

Studies have demonstrated that increasing the dose of the influenza virus hemagglutinin for each of the commonly encountered viral strains beyond the conventional dose of 15 microgram for each strain is associated with dose-dependent increase in serum antibody titers. The purpose of this exploratory study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of these two commercially available different strengths of TIV in solid organ transplant recipients in the period after 30 days after transplant procedure. We will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of two different strengths of commercially available TIV in a single center, cluster randomization, investigator blinded, study by enrolling patients in the post-transplant clinic at Inova Fairfax Hospital from: August 1, 2013

### Comparison of two high-dose versus two standard-dose influenza vaccines in adult allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients [^113H5SGn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This multicenter, double-blinded, phase II, randomized, controlled trial of 124 adult HCT recipients demonstrated that 2 doses of HD-TIV given at least 4 weeks apart was more immunogenic for influenza A/H3N2 and B/Victoria compared to 2 doses of SD-QIV, with higher GMTs 1 month after the second dose. Furthermore, the GMTs for A/H3N2 and B/Victoria were higher 6 months after the second dose in the HD-TIV group compared to the SD-QIV, signifying that the relative benefit of HD-TIV to SD-QIV is durable throughout the length of an influenza season. In addition, the safety profiles were comparable for both systemic reactions or injection-site reactions between groups. Notably, most injection-site reactions resolved within 2 days of vaccination. The increased immunogenicity and similar safety profiles are important findings as adult HCT recipients are at considerable risk for severe influenza disease and influenza-related complications. Thus, determining the optimal influenza vaccine strategy is essential.

Our study provides further support that a high-dose influenza vaccine strategy provides better immunogenicity than standard dose influenza vaccine. Our prior phase I, single-center study of 44 adult HCT recipients (median time post-HCT: 7.9 months) reported that a single dose of HD-TIV produced a higher GMT (GMR = 6.9) and a higher percentage of individuals with protective titers to A/H3N2 (81% vs 36%) compared to a single dose of SD-TIV. Additionally, these results are consistent with a prior phase II trial of 161 adult solid organ transplant recipients, in which HD-TIV was associated with higher GMTs as compared to SD-TIV for all 3 antigen strains. These findings are further consistent with our pediatric HCT trial of 170 participants, in which we found that 2 doses of HD-TIV resulted in higher antibody responses to both influenza A antigens as compared to 2 doses of SD-QIV. Collectively, these data suggest HD-IIV is a practical strategy to overcome suboptimal immune responses in these vulnerable populations.

### High vs. standard dose influenza vaccine in lung allograft recipients… [^116KsTCy]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

Lung allograft recipients have a higher burden of influenza disease and greater associated morbidity and mortality compared with healthy controls. Induction and early maintenance immunosuppression is thought to impair immunogenicity to standard dose inactivated influenza vaccine. This early post-transplant period is when immunity is most desirable, since influenza disease during this time frame is associated with adverse consequences. Thus, strategies to reduce severe influenza disease in this highly susceptible population are critical. No trials in lung transplant recipients have evaluated two doses of HD-IIV within the same influenza season as a strategy to improve immunogenicity and durability of influenza prevention. Furthermore, no influenza vaccine trials have focused on enrollment of subjects at early post-transplant timepoints. Very few studies have been performed in solely lung allograft recipients.

Immunosuppression intensity is highest in lung patients, thereby limiting comparisons to recipients of heart, liver, and kidney transplants. Therefore, studies to assess both HD-IIV and two-dose strategies in the same influenza season in post-lung transplant recipients are greatly needed. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that lung allograft recipients who are 1–35 months post-transplant and receiving two doses of HD-quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine will have higher HAI geometric mean titers to influenza antigens compared to those receiving two doses of SD-QIV. To test this hypothesis and address the above critical knowledge gaps, we propose to conduct a phase II, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, controlled immunogenicity and safety trial comparing the administration of two doses of HD-QIV to two doses of SD-QIV in lung allograft recipients 1–35 months post-transplant.

The results of this clinical trial will address significant knowledge gaps regarding influenza vaccine strategies and immune responses in lung transplant recipients and will guide vaccine recommendations during the post-transplant period. Study Design: The proposed study is a phase II, multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled immunogenicity and safety trial comparing two doses of HD-QIV to two doses of SD-QIV in lung allograft recipients. Hypothesis 1: We hypothesize that lung allograft recipients 1–35 months post-transplant who receive two doses of HD-QIV will develop higher HAI GMTs to influenza antigens compared to lung allograft recipients receiving two doses of SD-QIV. Specific Aim 1: To compare the HAI GMTs to influenza antigens in lung allograft recipients after receiving either two doses of HD-QIV or two doses of SD-QIV.

Hypothesis 2: We hypothesize that administration of two doses of HD-QIV in lung transplant recipients will be well tolerated and the safety profile will be similar to two doses of SD-QIV with regard to solicited local and systemic side effects. Specific Aim 2: To compare the frequency and severity of solicited local and systemic adverse events in lung allograft recipients after receiving either two doses of HD-QIV or two doses of SD-QIV.
- Hypothesis 3: We hypothesize that baseline immunophenotypic markers of exhaustion, immune senescence, and immune activation at the pre-vaccine timepoint will correlate with post-vaccine HAI titers. Specific Aim 3: To define the relationship between baseline phenotypes of T- and B-cell subsets, T-cell activation and post-vaccination HAI titers among lung allograft recipients receiving either two doses of HD-QIV or two doses of SD-QIV.

### Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination among recipients of solid organ transplants [^116bnpM4]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS FACE A HIGH RISK FOR COVID-19

Solid organ transplantation is a well-established therapeutic option that reduces mortality and improves quality of life in patients with terminal organ failure and certain types of liver cancer. The Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation reported 144 302 solid organ transplants (SOTs) in 2021. In the United States, 42 888 SOTs were performed in 2022, including kidney (n = 25 499), liver (n = 9528), heart (n = 4111), lung (n = 2692), pancreas (n = 108), and intestine (n = 82) transplants.

Increasingly effective posttransplant immunosuppressive therapies that prevent organ rejection (eg, corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors [cyclosporine and tacrolimus], mTOR inhibitors [everolimus], azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil [MMF]) have advanced graft and patient survival rates, yet continue to place transplant recipients at high risk for infections. The incidence of infectious pathogens differs by organ type; however, viral, bacterial, and fungal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality among all SOT recipients (SOTRs). Immunosuppressive therapies are also generally associated with poor immune responses to vaccination in SOTRs. In particular, MMF is known to completely disturb responses to a number of different vaccines. For example, seroconversion rates following influenza vaccination among adult and pediatric SOTRs were low and not notably enhanced by certain alternative strategies, such as intradermal or adjuvant-containing vaccines (5%–64%). Nevertheless, some studies suggest that high-dose or booster influenza vaccination strategies may slightly improve seroconversion rates among SOTRs.

### A pilot randomized trial of adjuvanted influenza vaccine in adult allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients [^115j1DNG]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

The annual influenza vaccine is recommended for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients although studies have shown suboptimal immunogenicity. Influenza vaccine containing an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant (MF59) may lead to greater immunogenicity in HSCT recipients. We randomized adult allogeneic HSCT patients to receive the 2015–2016 influenza vaccine with or without MF59 adjuvant. Preimmunization and 4-week post-immunization sera underwent strain-specific hemagglutination inhibition assay. We randomized 73 patients and 67 (35 adjuvanted; 32 non-adjuvanted) had paired samples available at follow-up. Median age was 54 years (range 22–74) and time from transplant was 380 days (range 85–8107). Concurrent graft-versus-host disease was seen in 42/73 (57.5%). Geometric mean titers increased significantly after vaccination in both groups. Seroconversion to at least one of three influenza antigens was present in 62.9% vs 53.1% in adjuvanted vs non-adjuvanted vaccine (P = 0.42). Factors associated with lower seroconversion rates were use of calcineurin inhibitors (P < 0.001) and shorter duration from transplantation (P = 0.001). Seroconversion rates were greater in patients who got previous year influenza vaccination (82.6% vs 45.5%, P = 0.03). Adjuvanted vaccine demonstrated similar immunogenicity to non-adjuvanted vaccine in the HSCT population and may be an option for some patients.

### Oseltamivir (oseltamivir phosphate) [^117Tx5hB]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Among household contacts 1 year to 12 years of age not already shedding virus at baseline, the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was lower in the group who received oseltamivir phosphate prophylaxis [3% (3/95)] compared to the group who did not receive oseltamivir phosphate prophylaxis [17% (18/106)].

Immunocompromised Subjects

A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted for seasonal prophylaxis of influenza in 475 immunocompromised subjects (including 18 pediatric subjects 1 year to 12 years of age) who had received solid organ (n = 388; liver, kidney, liver and kidney) or hematopoietic stem cell transplants (n = 87). Median time since transplant for solid organ transplant recipients was 1,105 days for the placebo group and 1,379 days for the oseltamivir phosphate group. Median time since transplant for hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients was 424 days for the placebo group and 367 days for the oseltamivir phosphate group. Approximately 40% of subjects received influenza vaccine prior to entering the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of confirmed clinical influenza, defined as oral temperature higher than 99°F (37.2°C) plus cough and/or coryza, all recorded within 24 hours, plus either a positive virus culture or a four-fold increase in virus antibody titers from baseline. Subjects received treatment with oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg or placebo once daily by mouth for 12 weeks. The incidence of confirmed clinical influenza was 3% (7/238) in the placebo group compared with 2% (5/237) in the oseltamivir phosphate group; this difference was not statistically significant. A secondary analysis was performed using the same clinical symptoms and RT-PCR for laboratory confirmation of influenza infection. Among subjects who were not already shedding virus at baseline, the incidence of RT-PCR-confirmed clinical influenza infection was 3% (7/231) in the placebo group and < 1% (1/232) in the oseltamivir phosphate group.

### Influenza vaccination is efficacious and safe in renal transplant recipients [^117BfpLU]. American Journal of Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Whether influenza vaccination in solid-organ transplant recipients is efficacious remains a controversial issue. Furthermore, theoretical concerns have been raised regarding the safety of vaccination as it might trigger rejection of the allograft. The present prospective trial is aimed at investigating the antibody response and safety of influenza vaccination in renal transplant recipients (RTR). A total of 165 RTR and 41 healthy volunteers were vaccinated with a standard trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. Hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibodies were quantified before and 1 month after vaccination. Seroprotection (SP) and seroresponse (SR) were defined as a titer ≥ 40 and a 4-fold rise in HI titer, respectively. Similar SR rates were observed in both groups. Postvaccination SP rates in RTR amounted to 92.7%, 78.7% and 82.9% for A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B, respectively. High baseline SP rates, most probably reflecting frequent preimmunizations, explain partly the high postvaccination SP rates. SR rate was independently and inversely associated with baseline SP rate. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) usage was associated with a 2.6-5-fold lower SR. Nonetheless, these patients showed good postvaccination SP rates. A booster dose did not enhance SP or SR rates. Influenza vaccination neither affected allograft function nor caused rejection episodes. In conclusion, influenza vaccination is efficacious and safe in renal transplantation.

### Prophylactic measures in the solid-organ recipient before transplantation [^112y4jCG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Pretransplant screening affords an important opportunity to detect and treat preexisting active infection in the solid-organ transplant recipient. In this article, pretransplant strategies for preventing infections after solid-organ transplantation are reviewed. In addition to the search for active preexisting infection in the transplant candidate, immunization remains a cornerstone of preventive practice. Because there is a suboptimal response to vaccinations in patients who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, as well as in patients with end-stage organ dysfunction, standard immunization of the transplant candidate should be updated as early as possible in the course of the illness, including pneumococcal, influenza, and hepatitis B vaccines. Liver transplant candidates should receive hepatitis A vaccine, and children should receive Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugate vaccine. All nonimmune pretransplant patients should be considered candidates for the varicella vaccine. The management of special risk groups is discussed in detail.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2024–2025: policy statement [^114Lc5S5]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Influenza vaccination — coadministration and timing for immunocompromised children or those receiving specialized therapies: IIV (or RIV, if age-appropriate) may be administered simultaneously with or at any time before or after other inactivated (nonlive) or live vaccines or nirsevimab, and LAIV may be administered simultaneously with other live or inactivated (nonlive) vaccines, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines; if not administered simultaneously, ≥ 4 weeks should pass between the administration of LAIV and other nonoral live vaccines, and a 4-day grace period is permitted (ie, vaccine doses administered ≤ 4 days before the minimum interval or age are considered valid). For children with malignant neoplasms receiving chemotherapy, vaccine should be administered ≥ 2 weeks before cytotoxic chemotherapy, when clinically possible. For children who have received anti-B cell therapies (eg, rituximab, alemtuzumab), IIV should be deferred for 6 months after last dose, ideally once there is evidence of B cell recovery. Household contacts of immunocompromised individuals should receive influenza vaccine annually. Nonlive vaccines should be considered ≥ 6 months after CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor–T–cell infusion in patients who are in remission and do not require additional chemotherapy or hematopoietic cell transplantation; for children who will be starting anti-B cell therapies, IIV should optimally be provided at least 2 to 4 weeks before starting these therapies. For hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, IIV can be given starting 4 to 6 months after transplantation; for solid organ transplant recipients, IIV can be given starting 3 months after receipt of an SOT, although it may be considered ≥ 1 month after SOT during the influenza season.

### Effect of influenza vaccination in solid organ transplant recipients: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^111PsvPj]. American Journal of Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

We found that influenza vaccination was associated with an overall reduction in mortality during the same season. A single‐center retrospective study that included 187 pediatric kidney transplant recipients found that influenza vaccination was associated with a reduced risk of mortality during the first year after transplantation, but this finding was not reproduced over subsequent seasons, whereas studies in adult SOT recipients produced inconsistent results. To test for a healthy‐vaccinee bias, we compared the risk of hospitalization for vaccinated and unvaccinated SOT recipients during the non‐influenza season months and evaluated the association between influenza vaccination and incident cancer during follow‐up, because influenza vaccination should have no effect on the risk of cancer during influenza seasons. In the off‐season adjusted analyses, influenza vaccination was not associated with altered rates of admission for pneumonia or altered mortality rates. Similarly, although influenza vaccination was associated with an increased risk of cancer, this finding was not significant in the adjusted analysis. Thus, even though we have attempted to control for confounders, there must be some residual confounding (e.g. smoking status or pneumococcal vaccine coverage).

Our study has strengths and limitations. Several sources of confounding may have affected our estimates. First, outcomes in any given influenza season will be determined by differences in the circulating viruses and differences in the antigenic match of vaccine products and their efficacy. In particular, the 2014–2015 influenza vaccines were less effective against the influenza A/H3N2 virus, with an overall vaccine effectiveness of 19%. Two randomized studies showed that high doses of non‐adjuvant inactivated vaccines improved serological outcomes in SOT recipients compared to standard doses. The current study did not allow us to control the dose or valency of the administered influenza vaccines. However, one strength of our analysis is that we obtained pooled estimates across vaccine products and multiple influenza seasons, suggesting that influenza vaccines reduce the risk of adverse outcomes in SOT recipients, including pneumonia hospitalization, despite the considerable heterogeneity between seasons and administered vaccine doses.

Infection precautions and prophylaxis — practice variation and guidance — Protocols vary from center to center for the routine use of antibiotics and antiviral prophylaxis. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), together with the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and ASTCT, has published guidelines for preventing infections in patients undergoing allo- HSCT, regardless of recipient (adult or child), and the published guidelines do not make a definitive statement on antibacterial prophylaxis. A review of 31 centers with experience from approximately 3400 stem cell transplants found substantial heterogeneity, yet a majority of institutions use some form of antiviral prophylaxis. Patients with cancer are at high risk of severe influenza-related complications with a mortality rate 10 times higher than the general population, and a Cochrane review of six studies with a total of 2275 participants found weak evidence that influenza vaccination benefits outweigh risks in patients with cancer.

### Comparison of two high-dose versus two standard-dose influenza vaccines in adult allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients [^116nV5dC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients are at high risk for infection due to respiratory viruses, including influenza, particularly within the first 2 years post-HCT. Vaccination has been essential in the prevention of influenza-associated illness and reduction of influenza-related morbidity and mortality in adult HCT recipients. Prior studies of influenza vaccination in HCT recipients have noted poor immunogenicity compared to healthy controls, with seroconversion rates ranging from 13% to 59% after single-dose vaccination. Despite their poor responses, the current guidelines recommend annual influenza vaccination after 3–6 months post-transplant. Multiple influenza vaccine studies in HCT recipients have noted improved immunogenicity for those who are later post-transplant; with less data about vaccine responses less than six months post-transplant. Strategies to improve immunogenicity in HCT recipients are needed in order to establish optimal post-transplant vaccination regimens.

One alternative strategy is the administration of a high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine, which has been proven superior in an elderly population. A single-center, phase I safety and immunogenicity study comparing one dose of high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine (HD-TIV) to standard-dose trivalent influenza vaccine (SD-TIV) in adult HCT recipients with a median of 7.9 months post-transplant reported higher geometric mean titers (GMT) for the A/H3N2 influenza strain compared SD-TIV, with no major safety concerns noted. Another strategy is the administration of 2 standard doses of influenza vaccine in the same season, but prior studies of this strategy had small cohorts, with few participants in the early transplant period and did not compare 2 doses of HD to 2 doses of SD influenza vaccine. Therefore, we conducted a phase II, multicenter trial comparing 2 doses of HD-TIV to 2 doses of standard dose quadrivalent vaccine (SD-QIV) in adult HCT recipients.

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2024–25 influenza season [^116uoYGH]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

This report updates the 2023–24 recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) concerning the use of seasonal influenza vaccines in the United States (MMWR Recomm Rep 2022;72[No. RR-2]:1–24). Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months who do not have contraindications. Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV3s), trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3), and trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV3) are expected to be available. All persons should receive an age-appropriate influenza vaccine (i.e. one approved for their age), with the exception that solid organ transplant recipients aged 18 through 64 years who are receiving immunosuppressive medication regimens may receive either high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3) or adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV3) as acceptable options (without a preference over other age-appropriate IIV3s or RIV3). Except for vaccination for adults aged ≥ 65 years, ACIP makes no preferential recommendation for a specific vaccine when more than one licensed and recommended vaccine is available. ACIP recommends that adults aged ≥ 65 years preferentially receive any one of the following higher dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines: trivalent high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3), trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3), or trivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV3). If none of these three vaccines is available at an opportunity for vaccine administration, then any other age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be used.

Primary updates to this report include the following two topics: the composition of 2024–25 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines and updated recommendations for vaccination of adult solid organ transplant recipients. First, following a period of no confirmed detections of wild-type influenza B/Yamagata lineage viruses in global surveillance since March 2020, 2024–25 U.S. influenza vaccines will not include an influenza B/Yamagata component. All influenza vaccines available in the United States during the 2024–25 season will be trivalent vaccines containing hemagglutinin derived from 1) an influenza A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for cell culture-based and recombinant vaccines); 2) an influenza A/Thailand/8/2022 (H3N2)-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2)-like virus (for cell culture-based and recombinant vaccines); and 3) an influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus. Second, recommendations for vaccination of adult solid organ transplant recipients have been updated to include HD-IIV3 and aIIV3 as acceptable options for solid organ transplant recipients aged 18 through 64 years who are receiving immunosuppressive medication regimens (without a preference over other age-appropriate IIV3s or RIV3).

This report focuses on recommendations for the use of vaccines for the prevention and control of seasonal influenza during the 2024–25 influenza season in the United States. A brief summary of the recommendations and a link to the most recent Background Document containing additional information are available at. These recommendations apply to U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines. Updates and other information are available from CDC's influenza website.

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2025–26 influenza season [^111YEN7X]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

Children aged ≤ 18 years, pregnant women, and all adults should receive seasonal influenza vaccines only in single-dose formulations that are free of thimerosal as a preservative.
All persons should receive an age-appropriate influenza vaccine (i.e. one that is approved for their age), with the exception that solid organ transplant recipients aged 18 through 64 years who are receiving immunosuppressive medication regimens may receive either trivalent high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3) or trivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV3) as acceptable options (without a preference over other age-appropriate IIV3s or trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine [RIV3]).
Except for vaccination for adults aged ≥ 65 years, ACIP makes no preferential recommendation for a specific vaccine when more than one licensed and recommended vaccine is available. Among adults aged ≥ 65 years any one of the following higher dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines is preferentially recommended: HD-IIV3, RIV3, or aIIV3. If none of these three vaccines is available at an opportunity for vaccine administration, any other available age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be used.
LAIV3 is not recommended during pregnancy, for immunocompromised persons, for persons with certain medical conditions, or for persons who are receiving, have recently received, or are about to receive influenza antiviral medications (Table 2). LAIV3 should not be administered to persons aged < 2 or > 49 years.

### AGA clinical practice update on noncolorectal cancer screening and vaccinations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: expert review [^1121SPdb]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease — influenza and other seasonal vaccinations (Best Practice Advice 8) advises that all adult patients with IBD should receive an annual inactivated influenza vaccine; patients receiving anti-TNF monotherapy or who have undergone a solid organ transplant recipients can benefit from an HD influenza vaccine; adults 65 years of age and older should receive an HD, recombinant, or adjuvanted influenza vaccine; and live attenuated intranasal vaccines should be avoided. In addition, annual seasonal vaccinations such as influenza or COVID-19 boosters should be offered to patients regardless of their treatment regimen, even if they are receiving high doses (HDs) of corticosteroids, and vaccines should be provided irrespective of the biologic dosing schedule.

Purpose Of Review

Patients on chronic immunosuppressive treatments at baseline are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. These patients are at especially increased risk of morbidity and mortality during the coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. This review will focus on patients with diseases in which immunosuppression is a vital part of the treatment regimen, including those with solid organ transplants, rheumatologic disorders, sarcoidosis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We will summarize the current knowledge of immunosuppression in these diseases and the risk of contracting COVID-19. Furthermore, we will discuss if immunosuppression increases severity of COVID-19 presentation.

Recent Findings

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number patients receiving chronic immunosuppression have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our understanding of the immunology of SARS-CoV-2 is advancing at a rapid pace. Currently, a number of clinical trials are underway to investigate the role of immunosuppressive treatments in the management of this disease.

Summary

Currently, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that solid organ transplant recipients on chronic immunosuppression are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. Solid organ transplant recipients may be at increased risk for worse COVID-19 outcomes but the data are not consistent. There is evidence to suggest that patients with rheumatologic disorders or IBDs are not at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and do not necessarily experience worse clinical outcomes. Patients with sarcoidosis are not necessarily at increased risk of COVID-19, although there is limited data available to determine if immunosuppression worsens outcomes in this population.

### Evidence in a cluster randomized controlled trial of increased 2009 pandemic risk associated with 2008–2009 seasonal influenza vaccine receipt [^112AGoaa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Although the 2009 pandemic was relatively mild, such interactions and their mechanisms still remain critical to clarify. If real, a potential doubling of pandemic infection risk among prior seasonal vaccine recipients could be disastrous in the event of a more severe pandemic involving a higher per-case fatality risk.

Transplant vaccination — Inactivated vaccines are generally considered safe after bone marrow transplant (BMT) and include influenza, COVID-19, pneumococcal, HBV, tetanus, diphtheria, and the new recombinant zoster vaccine, whereas live vaccines — including varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) — should be avoided in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients while on immunosuppressants and may not be recommended immediately after BMT, with use based on the individual's clinical condition and time since transplantation.

### Immunogenicity and reactogenicity of high-or standard-dose influenza vaccine in a second consecutive influenza season [^116FoigW]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study demonstrated no safety concerns associated with the same vaccine dosing regimen in 2 consecutive influenza seasons. Additionally, 1 dose of either HD-TIV or SD-QIV in the subsequent year appears to be sufficient to achieve higher immunogenicity as compared with 2 doses of the same formulation in the initial year, as evidenced by meeting the WHO biological standards for vaccine response as well as achieving higher GMTs. However, whether the WHO thresholds are sufficient for protection in this high-risk population requires additional investigation, as does the potential impact of additional standard-dose influenza vaccine doses vs a high-dose vaccine in a single season. Inclusion of patients with ongoing immunosuppression, such as acute and chronic GVHD, is needed to further understand how to optimally protect this high-risk heterogenous population of pediatric patients after HCT.
