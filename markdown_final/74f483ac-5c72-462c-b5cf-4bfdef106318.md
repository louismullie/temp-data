Medicine for diverticulitis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the medical management of acute diverticulitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify disease severity and risk stratify the patient. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, especially the role of CT and labs. Next, I will consider outpatient versus inpatient management. After that, I need to decide whether antibiotics are indicated and, if so, which regimen and duration. Then, I will address supportive care and follow-up. Finally, I should review special populations, particularly older adults and immunocompromised patients, and close with recurrence prevention and a concise algorithm summary, making sure I double-check each claim against guidelines and key trials as I go.

> Let me first confirm the disease classification because everything downstream depends on it. Uncomplicated diverticulitis typically lacks abscess, fistula, obstruction, or free perforation, whereas complicated disease includes abscess, phlegmon, fistula, obstruction, or perforation, and this distinction drives both antibiotic use and procedural decisions, so I need to ensure I categorize correctly before proceeding [^111SveF3].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach. CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast is the imaging modality of choice to confirm the diagnosis, stage severity, and detect complications such as abscess or free air. I should also check for features that push me toward antibiotics, like fluid collections or longer segments of inflammation, and I should remember that older adults may present atypically, so a lower threshold for imaging is reasonable in that group [^116UmEyc] [^116zGVHW] [^113aWc5c]. I need to ensure I do not overinterpret CT signs of extraluminal air; in selected hemodynamically stable immunocompetent patients, observation without immediate surgery can be appropriate with close follow-up, so I should confirm stability and access to care before choosing that path [^112Yqgpq] [^1145VvcT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics before I risk-stratify the patient. I should confirm immunocompetence, comorbidity burden, frailty, and reliability for follow-up, because these factors influence both the need for antibiotics and the setting of care; in older or frail adults, I should maintain a lower threshold for antibiotics and inpatient observation given higher complication risk and atypical presentations [^116zGVHW] [^116UsKxZ] [^113aWc5c].

> Next, I should review the setting of care. For immunocompetent patients with mild symptoms, no sepsis, tolerating oral intake, and reliable follow-up, outpatient management is appropriate. I should arrange reassessment within 7 days and earlier if deterioration, and I need to ensure the patient understands red flags that warrant urgent reassessment [^111wzpRm] [^114q159b] [^114spdCt]. But wait, what if the patient is older or frail with systemic symptoms or unreliable follow-up? In that case, I should favor inpatient observation and a lower threshold for antibiotics, aligning with geriatric-focused guidance [^116UsKxZ] [^113aWc5c].

> I will now examine the antibiotic decision for uncomplicated disease, since this is where practice has shifted. Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses suggest that in immunocompetent patients with mild uncomplicated diverticulitis, antibiotics may not meaningfully change short-term complications, emergency surgery, or recurrence, so observation without antibiotics is reasonable with close follow-up. However, I should confirm that this applies to the specific patient in front of me and not overgeneralize to complicated disease or high-risk hosts [^112KL8LJ] [^115Nkrks] [^1177rGKK]. Let me double-check the nuance: guidelines endorse selective rather than routine antibiotics, and some expert updates advise antibiotics when CRP is greater than 140 mg/L, WBC exceeds 15 × 10⁹/L, there are comorbidities or frailty, refractory symptoms or vomiting, or CT shows a fluid collection or longer segment inflammation, so I should integrate these thresholds and context into the decision [^116zGVHW] [^111j4YAs].

> For complicated disease, I should confirm that antibiotics are mandatory. Abscess, phlegmon, fistula, obstruction, or perforation require antibiotics, and for abscesses larger than about 3–5 cm, image-guided percutaneous drainage plus antibiotics is preferred; for smaller abscesses under 4–5 cm, antibiotics alone can be tried initially with close monitoring, recognizing a nontrivial failure rate and the need to escalate if no improvement [^111ms8LD] [^111Q8UKn] [^111ms8LD]. Hold on, I should verify duration after source control; contemporary guidance supports short-course antibiotics, often around 4 days, once adequate source control is achieved, rather than prolonged therapy, to minimize resistance and adverse events [^115RM8tv].

> Let me think about antibiotic selection and duration when antibiotics are indicated. I need to ensure coverage of gram-negative rods and anaerobes. Common outpatient options include amoxicillin-clavulanate monotherapy or a fluoroquinolone combined with metronidazole, with typical durations of 4–7 days, extending only if the clinical response is suboptimal. I should tailor to local resistance patterns and patient-specific risk factors such as recent antibiotic exposure or ESBL risk [^117HwJxb] [^1139HyjM] [^114B1kKC]. Wait, I should verify inpatient regimens; in hospitalized patients, intravenous therapy with agents like ertapenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, or a cephalosporin with metronidazole is reasonable, again adjusted to severity, renal function, and local epidemiology, with step-down to oral therapy when clinically improved [^1139HyjM] [^115RM8tv].

> Next, I should review supportive care because it meaningfully affects recovery. During the acute phase of uncomplicated disease, a clear liquid diet with advancement as symptoms improve is appropriate; I need to ensure adequate analgesia and antiemetics, and I should avoid unnecessary opioids when possible; I should also counsel on activity as tolerated and hydration, and I must arrange follow-up within a week to confirm trajectory and address any deterioration [^113WZBLt] [^114q159b].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with older adults. Older patients have higher complication rates, atypical presentations, and higher risks with interventions, so I should maintain a lower threshold for imaging, antibiotics, and inpatient care, while still aligning with patient goals and functional status; shared decision-making about escalation, including potential surgery, should explicitly incorporate what matters most to the patient [^113aWc5c] [^115qUopy] [^111gFceH]. But wait, I should verify that I am not overusing antibiotics; even in older adults, selective use remains appropriate when risk is low and follow-up is reliable, so I should individualize rather than reflexively treat [^116UsKxZ].

> For immunocompromised patients, I need to ensure I do not under-treat. Antibiotics are strongly advised even for seemingly uncomplicated presentations because failure rates of nonoperative management are higher; I should also have a lower threshold for admission and early source control if complications arise, given the narrow physiologic reserve in this group [^111PGekX] [^112HaqKL] [^114h9ANa]. Hold on, I should verify that my antibiotic choices account for broader coverage needs in this population, including consideration of resistant gram-negatives and anaerobes, guided by local resistance data [^114B1kKC].

> Let me consider recurrence prevention, because patients often ask what they can do to reduce future episodes. High-quality dietary patterns, normal BMI, physical activity, smoking cessation, and avoidance of NSAIDs except for cardioprotective aspirin are reasonable strategies; I should also explain that the risk of complicated diverticulitis is highest at first presentation and that elective resection should not be based solely on the number of episodes, but rather on severity, chronicity, and patient preferences after shared decision-making [^111PGekX] [^1136QV4j]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought mesalamine might help prevent recurrence, but I should double-check; current evidence does not support mesalamine for recurrence prevention, so I should not recommend it routinely [^111PGekX].

> I should confirm follow-up and symptom surveillance. After an episode, colonoscopy is not universally required; it should be guided by prior screening history, disease severity, and course, with a lower threshold if symptoms persist or if cancer risk is a concern; if chronic symptoms persist after an episode, I need to exclude ongoing inflammation with imaging and lower endoscopy and consider visceral hypersensitivity if no active disease is found [^111PGekX] [^116V4vdC] [^113LtfTL].

> Let me summarize the practical algorithm to ensure internal consistency. For suspected diverticulitis, obtain CT to confirm diagnosis and stage severity. If uncomplicated and the patient is immunocompetent with mild symptoms, reliable follow-up, and no concerning labs or CT features, manage outpatient without antibiotics, clear liquids advancing with improvement, analgesia, and reassessment within 7 days. If uncomplicated but high risk by labs, comorbidity, frailty, or CT features, give antibiotics and consider inpatient care. If complicated by abscess, fistula, obstruction, or perforation, administer antibiotics and pursue source control, including percutaneous drainage for larger abscesses and surgical consultation as indicated, tailoring antibiotic spectrum and duration to severity, source control, and patient factors [^114QbyhZ] [^111wzpRm] [^111ms8LD].

> Finally, I need to ensure antibiotic stewardship and patient safety are embedded in every decision. I should avoid routine antibiotics in low-risk uncomplicated cases, use the narrowest effective spectrum when antibiotics are indicated, limit duration to 4–7 days when clinically appropriate, and monitor for adverse effects including C. difficile. I should also document the rationale for withholding or prescribing antibiotics and the follow-up plan to close the loop on safety [^1177rGKK] [^117HwJxb] [^113Pe1KP].

---

The cornerstone of diverticulitis management is **selective antibiotics** for uncomplicated cases [^111TYn2T] and **mandatory antibiotics** for complicated disease [^117H9Cyy]. For uncomplicated diverticulitis in immunocompetent patients, **observation without antibiotics** is safe and supported by guidelines [^111FL5kK] [^112KL8LJ]. When antibiotics are indicated, use **amoxicillin-clavulanate or a fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole** for 4–7 days [^117HwJxb]; reserve intravenous therapy for severe cases or patients unable to tolerate oral intake. Antibiotics are not routinely used for asymptomatic diverticulosis or symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) [^1121c4sT]. Management should be individualized based on comorbidities, severity, and patient preference [^111wPfNc].

---

## Indications for antibiotic therapy

Antibiotic therapy is indicated based on the **severity and complexity** of diverticulitis:

- **Uncomplicated diverticulitis**: Selective use of antibiotics is recommended in immunocompetent patients with mild symptoms [^111PGekX] [^114tSnhe]. Observation without antibiotics is safe and supported by recent guidelines [^111FL5kK].

- **Complicated diverticulitis**: Antibiotics are mandatory for patients with abscess, perforation, fistula, or obstruction [^117H9Cyy] [^116t3h3t].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Antibiotics are strongly recommended regardless of disease severity due to higher risk of complications [^111PGekX] [^114h9ANa].

---

## Commonly recommended antibiotic regimens

The following antibiotic regimens are commonly recommended for **diverticulitis**:

| **Antibiotic regimen** | **Indication** | **Route** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | Uncomplicated cases | Oral | 4–7 days [^117HwJxb] |
| Fluoroquinolone (e.g. ciprofloxacin) + metronidazole | Uncomplicated cases | Oral | 4–7 days [^117HwJxb] |
| Piperacillin-tazobactam | Severe or complicated cases | IV | 7–10 days [^notfound] |
| Carbapenems (e.g. ertapenem) | Severe or complicated cases | IV | 7–10 days [^notfound] |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The duration of antibiotic therapy varies with **severity and response**. Uncomplicated cases are treated for 4–7 days, whereas complicated cases generally require 7–10 days, with adjustments based on clinical response and resolution of symptoms [^117HwJxb].

---

## Role of antibiotics in preventing recurrence

Antibiotics do not significantly **reduce recurrence** in uncomplicated diverticulitis [^112KL8LJ]. Preventive strategies focus on dietary modifications, lifestyle changes, and managing comorbidities rather than prolonged antibiotic use [^111PGekX].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of antibiotic therapy

Antibiotic therapy carries potential risks and side effects, including:

- **Gastrointestinal disturbances**: Nausea, diarrhea, and antibiotic-associated colitis [^113Pe1KP].

- **Allergic reactions**: Ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis.

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Increasing concern with prolonged or inappropriate use [^113Pe1KP].

- **Clostridioides difficile infection**: Particularly with broad-spectrum antibiotics [^113Pe1KP].

---

## Alternative and adjunctive therapies

Adjunctive therapies may be considered alongside or instead of antibiotics in select scenarios. Probiotics have **limited evidence** for preventing recurrence or reducing symptoms [^1121c4sT]. Mesalamine is not recommended for preventing recurrence or reducing symptoms [^1121c4sT]. Dietary modifications — such as a high-fiber diet, weight management, and avoiding smoking — are recommended to reduce recurrence risk [^111PGekX].

---

## Special considerations in elderly patients

Elderly patients may require **individualized management** because of higher risks of complications and atypical presentations. Antibiotics may be indicated in older adults with systemic symptoms or significant comorbidities, and close clinical follow-up is essential [^116UsKxZ] [^113aWc5c].

---

## Current guidelines and consensus statements

Current guidelines emphasize **selective antibiotic use** in uncomplicated diverticulitis and mandatory antibiotics in complicated cases. The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and the American College of Physicians (ACP) recommend selective antibiotic use in uncomplicated cases, while the European Society of Coloproctology (ESCP) and the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) recommend antibiotics for complicated cases [^1136QV4j] [^111FL5kK] [^117H9Cyy] [^111ms8LD].

---

Antibiotic therapy in diverticulitis should be **individualized** based on disease severity, patient comorbidities, and clinical presentation. Selective use of antibiotics in uncomplicated cases is supported by current evidence, while complicated cases require mandatory antibiotic therapy.

Over the last decade there has been a striking shift in our understanding of the epidemiology, pathology, and management of diverticular disease. Indeed, many of the guidelines published in the late nineties and early 2000s are now redundant. High-fiber diets, avoidance of nuts and seeds, antibiotic treatment for mild diverticulitis, elective resection after 2 attacks of diverticulitis, Hartmann's procedure (HP), and aggressive management of young patients are all open to question. The more we challenge our understanding of diverticulitis it becomes apparent how little we know about this disease entity. This review aims update the reader on current hypotheses and evidencebased modern management strategies in diverticular disease.

### Diagnosis and management of acute diverticulitis [^111EPLgr]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Although the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis is somewhat standardized, the scientific evidence and basis for treatment has been questioned. For years, medical and surgical management of acute diverticulitis has been based on the theory that more than 2 significant attacks of diverticulitis would lead to the recommendations of surgical resection. This should be questioned and further investigated with prospective randomized trials. Only a small number of well-published articles support the surgical management with good scientific data. Although our ability to take a history and skill of physical examination has not changed, the use of improved technology such as high-speed computerized axial tomography has afforded us the ability to make earlier and more accurate diagnoses. This may further allow us to standardize treatment and study outcomes. The time has come to further investigate and justify this management. It is possible that only the most critical situations may necessitate an operation. Clearly, the age group less than 40 years, as well as the immunocompromised, steroid-dependent, diabetic, and transplant patients, seem to be at greater risk with increased morbidity if not treated early and aggressively. And those individuals who present with perforation or compromised obstruction most likely will continue to need emergent intervention. We should try to set the rules by evidence-based medicine, while remaining within the confines of excellent and cost-effective care.

### Emerging evidence and recent controversies in diverticulitis: a 5-year review [^114KMZrF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Diverticulitis is a common gastrointestinal disease that still garners significant attention and study because of its heterogeneity in presentation and outcome. We provide a review of the newest and most controversial topics in diverticulitis. Recent discoveries on the influence of diet and other environmental risk factors are discussed, showing how the epidemiology of the disease process is shifting away from what was previously felt to be a disorder primarily limited to older western populations. Interestingly, as has long been suspected, genetic mutations and variations associated with the development of diverticulitis are being discovered and are summarized here. The data for non-operative and outpatient management of diverticulitis are reviewed, as are pharmacologic agents studied for use in the secondary prevention of diverticulitis. Lastly, we present controversies in the surgical treatment of diverticulitis. This review will provide a synopsis of the last 5 years of literature relating to diverticulitis.

Concluding remarks

From honing in on specific dietary and genetic associations to refining surgical techniques, the complex landscape of diverticulitis is ever-changing. At a glance, there are more publications on quality of life and cost-effectiveness outcomes. These matters are particularly important as we attempt to become less aggressive in our care, so that we do not inadvertently promote chronic symptoms and recurrent disease in the name of "doing less". Patterns of treatment and societal guidelines remain significantly heterogeneous worldwide. We look forward to the longer-term results of trials from the last decade and ongoing innovation in the field.

### International, expert-based, consensus statement regarding the management of acute diverticulitis [^115egEyg]. JAMA Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

This Delphi study provides consensus related to many aspects of acute diverticulitis and identifies other areas in need of research.

Objective

To generate an international, expert-based, consensus statement to address controversies in the management of acute diverticulitis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study was conducted using the Delphi technique from April 3 through October 21, 2014. A survey website was used and a panel of acute diverticulitis experts was formed via the snowball method. The top 5 acute diverticulitis experts in 5 international geographic regions were identified based on their number of publications related to acute diverticulitis.

Interventions

The Delphi study used 3 rounds of questions, after which the consensus statement was collated.

Main Outcomes and Measures

A consensus statement related to the management of acute diverticulitis.

Results

Twenty items were selected for inclusion in the consensus statement following 3 rounds of questioning. A clear definition of uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis is provided. In uncomplicated diverticulitis, consensus was reached regarding appropriate laboratory and radiological evaluation of patients as well as nonsurgical, surgical, and follow-up strategies. A number of important topics, including antibiotic treatment, failed to reach consensus. In addition, consensus was reached regarding many nonsurgical and surgical treatment strategies in complicated diverticulitis.

Conclusions and Relevance

Controversy continues internationally regarding the management of acute diverticulitis. This study demonstrates that there is more nonconsensus among experts than consensus regarding most issues, even in the same region. It also provides insight into the status quo regarding the treatment of acute diverticulitis and provides important direction for future research.

What are the aims of treatment?

As mentioned above, the clinical spectrum of colonic diverticular disease is wide and ranges from asymptomatic diverticula to SUDD, uncomplicated diverticulitis and eventually, complicated diverticulitis. Therefore, the management, and the therapeutic approach are different, depending on the severity of the disease. Overall, prevention of progression, treatment of active disease and prevention of recurrence are the three key aims of treatment in any clinical manifestation of diverticular disease.

Asymptomatic diverticulosis does not need any pharmacologic treatment. However, healthy lifestyle (regular physical exercise, maintaining ideal body weight, abstention from smoking) and high-fiber diet are recommended to prevent its progression to SUDD and its complications. Most people with diverticulosis will not progress to symptomatic disease. The proportion of subjects with diverticulosis that eventually develop SUDD or acute diverticulitis is unknown. Consensus papers and reviews, state that 80–85% of subjects with diverticulosis will remain asymptomatic throughout their life, whereas 15–20% of symptomatic patients will suffer from diverticular disease without inflammation, while the remainder will have diverticulitis. However, estimates of progression need to be based on more reliable studies. One studyidentified 2222 patients with baseline diverticulosis. Over an 11-year follow-up period, 95 patients developed diverticulitis (4.3%; 6 per 1000 patient-years). The median time to event was 7.1 years.

Pharmacological treatment of SUDD should reduce intensity and frequency of symptoms and prevent the progression to diverticulitis, (Table 2). Most symptoms in SUDD are mild to moderate but they impair the patients' quality of life. Typical symptoms of SUDD include pain (in the lower or left lower quadrant of the abdomen), bloating and changes in bowel habits, symptoms also observed in patients with IBS; a differential diagnosis between these two clinical entities should therefore be attempted.

Table 2.
Aims of therapy in symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease.

Progression to diverticulitis is uncommon and often benign. One prospective, long-term study, assessing the development of complications in patients with SUDD, pointed out that 97% of patients had mild or no symptoms after a median follow-up of 66 months. Acute diverticulitis appeared in only 2.5% of cases.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^113yJpdz]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The decision to treat patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis with antibiotics or not does not depend on a single outcome measure. All reasons in favour of using antibiotics and all reasons in favour of omitting them should be taken into account. Omitting antibiotics did not increase the risk of ongoing diverticulitis, recurrent diverticulitis, complicated diverticulitis or sigmoid resection, and is therefore a safe treatment strategy. Insufficient statistical power to detect small differences in complicated diverticulitis and sigmoid resection may leave some room for discussion if these small differences are considered clinically relevant. Furthermore, the use of antibiotics should be limited as much as possible to minimize the global threat of rising microbial resistance and to prevent antibiotic‐related morbidity (8.3 per cent of all patients in DIABOLO 2), including potentially life‐threatening allergic reactions. In the end, individual‐patient characteristics or preferences may be deciding factors in the decision‐making process. However, in subgroups of patients with independent risk factors for adverse outcome (high pain scores, high WBC and a history of acute diverticulitis at presentation) no beneficial role for antibiotics in the prevention of such adverse outcomes was found.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^115L6LTL]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis has been treated routinely with antibiotics for decades, although evidence in favour of antibiotic treatment has always been lacking. Recently two RCTs 1, 2 demonstrated the safety of omitting antibiotics in the treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis up to 1 year of follow‐up. First, the AVOD Antibiotics in Acute Uncomplicated Diverticulitis trial 1 showed comparable rates of complicated diverticulitis, recurrent diverticulitis and sigmoid resection between observational and antibiotic treatment. Second, the DIABOLO (Diverticulitis: Antibiotics or Close Observation) trial 2 found no significant differences regarding time to recovery, complicated diverticulitis, recurrent diverticulitis and sigmoid resection. However, both RCTs reported somewhat – by and large non‐significant – higher rates of complicated diverticulitis and sigmoid resections in the non‐antibiotic group. As neither of the studies was powered to analyse these secondary outcomes, uncertainty remained whether these small differences could potentially be true causal associations, the consequence of patient selection or findings by chance in accordance with statistical non‐significance. A regular meta‐analysis of the two RCTs would not be able to account for different follow‐up times and different outcome definitions that were provided in the results papers of these studies. In contrast, a meta‐analysis of individual‐patient data can not only account for these differences but additionally provide an opportunity to use the increased sample size of both trials combined. The aim was to identify patients at risk of complications who may benefit from antibiotic treatment.

### Diverticulitis in older adults: a review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^115kZbEv]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Diverticulitis accounts for over 300,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States and its incidence increases with age. Among older adults, diverticulitis is the fourth leading cause for emergency surgery. Older adults with multimorbidity and geriatric syndromes are often excluded from clinical studies, leaving a gap in the evidence needed to guide management. Here, we provide a clinically oriented review of the diagnosis and management of older adults with diverticulitis through the lens of age‐friendly care.

Methods and Results

We reviewed the literature describing the epidemiology, diagnosis, management, and prevention of diverticulitis in older adults. Due to age‐related physiologic changes, the presence of geriatric syndromes, and multimorbidity, older adults with diverticulitis often present with atypical symptoms, variable laboratory findings, and are at higher risk for complications than younger patients. Guidelines support a more aggressive approach to diagnosis in this population, with lower threshold for obtaining diagnostic imaging. Antibiotics remain a mainstay of treatment for uncomplicated disease, and surgical management should be focused on severity of disease and the balance between the likelihood of improving quality of life and risks and burden of treatment.

Conclusions

Diverticulitis is a common disease that has a unique presentation among older individuals with limited evidence to guide management. Diagnosis and treatment should focus on what matters most to the patient, providing the most meaningful outcome possible within the context of multimorbidity, patient goals, symptom burden, and anticipated treatment outcomes.

Introduction

Diverticula (mucosal outpouchings through the wall of the colon) are rare before the age of 40 years, after which prevalence increases steadily and reaches over 25% by 60 years. However, only 10% to 25% of affected people will develop symptoms such as lower abdominal pain. Recurrent symptoms are common, and 5% of people with diverticula eventually develop complications such as perforation, obstruction, haemorrhage, fistulae, or abscesses.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of medical treatments for acute diverticulitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to August 2014 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 193 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 75 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 37 studies and the further review of 38 full publications. Of the 38 full articles evaluated, four systematic reviews and one RCT were added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for two PICO combinations

Conclusions

In this systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy for one comparison based on information about the effectiveness and safety of medical treatment (mesalazine, antibiotics [any] only) versus placebo or no treatment.

### Trends in the surgical management of diverticulitis [^111kAeEM]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Sigmoid diverticulitis is an increasingly common Western disease associated with a high morbidity and cost of treatment. Improvement in the understanding of the disease process, along with advances in the diagnosis and medical management has led to recent changes in treatment recommendations. The natural history of diverticulitis is more benign than previously thought, and current trends favor more conservative, less invasive management. Despite current recommendations of more restrictive indications for surgery, practice trends indicate an increase in elective operations being performed for the treatment of diverticulitis. Due to diversity in disease presentation, in many cases, optimal surgical treatment of acute diverticulitis remains unclear with regard to patient selection, timing, and technical approach in both elective and urgent settings. As a result, data is limited to mostly retrospective and non-randomized studies. This review addresses the current treatment recommendations for surgical management of diverticulitis, highlighting technical aspects and patterns of care.

### Acute colonic diverticulitis [^116KvfG7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Acute colonic diverticulitis is a gastrointestinal condition frequently encountered by primary care practitioners, hospitalists, surgeons, and gastroenterologists. Clinical presentation ranges from mild abdominal pain to peritonitis with sepsis. It can often be diagnosed on the basis of clinical features alone, but imaging is necessary in more severe presentations to rule out such complications as abscess and perforation. Treatment depends on the severity of the presentation, presence of complications, and underlying comorbid conditions. Medical and surgical treatment algorithms are evolving. This article provides an evidence-based, clinically relevant overview of the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of acute diverticulitis.

### Recurrent diverticulitis [^115eHDHh]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

The term "diverticulitis" indicates the inflammation of a diverticulum or diverticula, which is accompanied by detectable or microscopical perforation. Diverticulitis is a common condition with an estimated incidence of 25%. At present, elective sigmoid resection is recommended after 2 episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis to prevent the serious complications of recurrent colonic diverticulitis. This guideline has been based on the assumption that recurrent episodes (2 or more) of diverticulitis will lead to complicated diverticulitis and higher mortality. The data to support this assumption are based on only a few small studies. Advances in diagnostic modalities, medical therapy, and surgical techniques over the past 2 decades have changed both the management and outcomes of diverticulitis. Many authors have shown that patients treated nonoperatively have a low risk of recurrent disease and would be expected to do well without elective colectomy.

Abstract

Acute colonic diverticulitis is a common disease treated by acute care surgeons. Acute uncomplicated colonic diverticulitis involves thickening of the colon wall with inflammatory changes and less commonly requires the expertise of a surgeon; many cases may be treated as an outpatient with or without antibiotics. Complicated diverticulitis involves phlegmon, abscess, peritonitis, obstruction, stricture, and/or fistula and usually requires inpatient hospital admission, treatment with antibiotics, and consideration for intervention including operative management. This review will discuss what the acute care surgeon needs to know about diagnosis and management of acute colonic diverticulitis.

The treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (UD) with antibiotics remains common despite substantial evidence supporting the non-inferiority of nonantibiotic outpatient management. In the past 15 years, there have been two landmark randomized-controlled clinical trials, follow-up studies, and numerous retrospective studies that have supported the non-inferiority of nonantibiotic management of UD. Multiple medical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Physicians recommend using antibiotics selectively rather than routinely in UD. We aim to raise physician awareness of the latest guideline recommendations through our article, potentially improving antibiotic stewardship and reducing related healthcare costs.

Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon is common in the developed world, affecting approximately 33% of persons older than 60 years. Up to 15% of these patients will develop diverticulitis at some point in their lifetime. The incidence of diverticulitis has increased in the last decade, accounting for nearly 300,000 US hospital admissions and $1.8 billion in annual direct medical costs. With such a wide prevalence and diverse spectrum of clinical presentation, there are bound to be multiple controversies regarding disease management. This article will serve to educate the reader on several important areas to consider when treating this ubiquitous disease.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^114iKtUj]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Uncomplicated acute diverticulitis has been treated routinely with antibiotics for decades, although several guidelines have adapted their recommendations meanwhile. These now state that antibiotics should not be used routinely or can be avoided 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Some guidelines, however, state that antibiotics 'should be used selectively' (American Gastroenterological Association Institute guideline 11), antibiotics 'should be given to patients with risk indications of a complicated course' (German guideline 9), or antibiotics 'on a case‐by‐case basis should possibly be considered' (Italian guideline 8).

Little is known, however, about risk factors for a complicated course of initially uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Therefore, guidelines cannot recommend antibiotics for specific patient subgroups, besides subgroups that were excluded from studies on this topic such as immunocompromised patients and women. The present meta‐analysis identified several risk factors for one or more adverse outcomes that can guide the selection of patients who may benefit from antibiotics. However, the results showed that omitting antibiotics does not increase the risk of adverse outcomes in these high‐risk patients. Therefore, prevention of these adverse outcomes with antibiotic treatment may not be warranted.

What is the best treatment for patients with a small diverticular abscess (< 4–5 cm)? What is the best treatment for patients with large diverticular abscess?

For patients with a small (< 4–5 cm) diverticular abscess, we suggest an initial trial of non-operative treatment with antibiotics alone (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

We suggest to treat patients with large abscesses with percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic treatment; whenever percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not feasible or not available, we suggest to initially treat patients with large abscesses with antibiotic therapy alone, clinical conditions permitting. Alternatively, an operative intervention is required (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

Approximately 15–20% of patients admitted with acute diverticulitis have an abscess on CT scan. The treatment of abscess always requires antibiotic therapy. If the abscess is limited in size, systemic antibiotic therapy alone is considered safe and effective in removing the abscess and solving acute inflammation with a pooled failure rate of 20% and a mortality rate of 0.6%.

### Antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis [^112KL8LJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Diverticulitis is a complication of the common condition, diverticulosis. Uncomplicated diverticulitis has traditionally been treated with antibiotics, as diverticulitis has been regarded as an infectious disease. Risk factors for diverticulitis, however, may suggest that the condition is inflammatory rather than infectious which makes the use of antibiotics questionable.

Objectives

The objectives of this systematic review were to determine if antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis affects the risk of complications (immediate or late) or the need for emergency surgery.

Search Methods

For this update, a comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted in Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform on February 2021.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including all types of patients with a radiologically confirmed diagnosis of left-sided uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Comparator and interventions included antibiotics compared to no antibiotics, placebo, or to any other antibiotic treatment (different regimens, routes of administration, dosage or duration of treatment). Primary outcome measures were complications and emergency surgery. Secondary outcomes were recurrence, late complications, elective colonic resections, length of hospital stay, length to recovery of symptoms, adverse events and mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors performed the searches, identification and assessment of RCTs and data extraction. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or involvement of the third author. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain additional data if needed or for preliminary results of ongoing trials. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias was used to assess the methodological quality of the identified trials. The overall quality of evidence for outcomes was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Effect estimates were extracted as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed with the Mantel-Haenzel method.

Main Results

The authors included five studies. Three studies compared no antibiotics to antibiotics; all three were original RCTs of which two also published long-term follow-up information. For the outcome of short-term complications there may be little or no difference between antibiotics and no antibiotics (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.30 to 2.62; 3 studies, 1329 participants; low-certainty evidence). The rate of emergency surgery within 30 days may be lower with no antibiotics compared to antibiotics (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.13, 1.71; 1329 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence). However, there is considerable imprecision due to wide confidence intervals for this effect estimate causing uncertainty which means that there may also be a benefit with antibiotics. One of the two remaining trials compared single to double compound antibiotic therapy and, due to wide confidence intervals, the estimate was imprecise and indicated an uncertain clinical effect between these two antibiotic regimens (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.11 to 4.58; 51 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). The last trial compared short to long intravenous administration of antibiotics and did not report any events for our primary outcomes. Both trials included few participants and one had overall high risk of bias. Since the first publication of this systematic review, an increasing amount of evidence supporting the treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis without antibiotics has been published, but the total body of evidence is still limited.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence on antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated acute diverticulitis suggests that the effect of antibiotics is uncertain for complications, emergency surgery, recurrence, elective colonic resections, and long-term complications. The quality of the evidence is low. Only three RCTs on the need for antibiotics are currently available. More trials are needed to obtain more precise effect estimates.

### Endoscopic direct diverticulitis therapy for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis [^112A6a4u]. Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Diverticulitis is caused by micro- or macroscopic perforations in the diverticular wall due to increased intraluminal pressures or inspissated food matter, leading to inflammation, ischemia, and focal necrosis. Contemporary approaches advocate less aggressive medical and surgical management of acute diverticulitis. Driven by this trend and advances in endoscopic technology, we developed a novel EDDT method that aligns with this strategy and provides individualized and precise therapy for diverticulitis. Our cholangioscope-assisted colonoscopy enables direct lesion assessment by intubating the diverticulum, allowing immediate interventions, including fecalith retrieval, intraluminal decompression, lesion lavage, hemostasis, biopsy, and stent deployment. This approach tailors treatment efficiently to the individual's condition. The current guidelines predominantly address left-sided colonic diverticulitis, typically seen in the Western population. These recommendations may not fully apply to right-sided disease, a pattern more common in non-Western groups such as our study cohort, with varied ethnic backgrounds and possibly different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. These differences can influence key management decisions, including whether to administer antibiotics. In such cases, EDDT functions as a therapeutic platform with integrated diagnostic capabilities. Endoscopic evaluation allows clinicians to better stratify disease severity, assess the need for antibiotics, and tailor treatment strategies to optimize patient outcomes.

Our approach to the diagnosis and treatment of diverticulitis has evolved over the past 20 y. Routine use of antibiotics has decreased with recent studies suggesting simple cases of diverticulitis can be selectively managed without antibiotics. The criteria necessitating surgical intervention have also been amended as our understanding of the natural history of diverticulitis has grown. We favor selective use of antibiotics, percutaneous drainage, and surgery depending on the severity of the disease, patient factors, and clinical context.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Practice Update — management principles and patient counseling: Whether patients should have a colonoscopy after an episode of diverticulitis depends on the patient's history, most recent colonoscopy, and disease severity and course, and in patients with a history of diverticulitis and chronic symptoms, alternative diagnoses should be excluded with both imaging and lower endoscopy. Antibiotic treatment can be used selectively, rather than routinely, in immunocompetent patients with mild acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, while antibiotic treatment is strongly advised in immunocompromised patients. To reduce the risk of recurrence, patients should consume a high-quality diet, have a normal body mass index, be physically active, not smoke, and avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use except aspirin prescribed for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Patients should be educated that the risk of complicated diverticulitis is highest with the first presentation, and an elective segmental resection should not be advised based on the number of episodes; instead, a discussion of elective segmental resection should be personalized to consider severity of disease, patient preferences and values, as well as risks and benefits. Rarely, a colon malignancy is misdiagnosed as diverticulitis.

What is the optimal antibiotic therapy for patients with diffuse peritonitis due to diverticular perforation? What is the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy after surgical source control in diffuse peritonitis due to diverticular perforation?

We suggest to choose the empirically designed antibiotic regimen on the basis of the underlying clinical condition of the patient, the pathogens presumed to be involved, and the risk factors for major antimicrobial resistance patterns (strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B).

We suggest a 4-day period of postoperative antibiotic therapy in complicated ALCD if source control has been adequate (weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B).

Antibiotic therapy plays an important role in the management of complicated acute diverticulitis. Typically, it is an empiric antibiotic treatment. The regimen should depend on the severity of infection, the pathogens presumed to be involved, and the risk factors indicative of major resistance patterns. Several recommendations have been recently published in literature. However, consideration of local epidemiological data and resistance profiles is essential for antibiotic selection.

Considering intestinal microbiota of large bowel acute diverticulitis requires antibiotic coverage for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as for anaerobes. Most of the complicated acute diverticulitis is mainly a community-acquired infection. The main resistance threat in IAIs is posed by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, which are becoming increasingly common in community-acquired infections worldwide. The most significant risk factors for ESBL-producing pathogens include prior exposure to antibiotics and comorbidities requiring concurrent antibiotic therapy. Anti-ESBL-producer coverage should be warranted for patients with these risk factors. Discontinuation of antibiotic treatment should be at 4 days from source control as this has been demonstrated as non-inferior to longer therapy based on the STOP IT trial.

The recent prospective trial by Sawyer et al. demonstrated that in patients with complicated IAIs undergoing an adequate source-control procedure, the outcomes after approximately 4 days fixed-duration antibiotic therapy were similar to those after a longer course of antibiotics that extended until after the resolution of physiological abnormalities. Patients who have signs of sepsis beyond 5 to 7 days of adequate antibiotic treatment warrant aggressive diagnostic investigation in search of a reservoir of infection.

Ultimately, the decision to move forward with surgery should take into consideration multiple factors, including risk and severity of possible recurrence, impact of diverticulitis episodes on a patient's daily life and function, and risks associated with an elective procedure (Figure 4). Although a severe diverticulitis recurrence may be life threatening, understanding what matters to each patient and whether the anticipated outcomes of surgery align with their goals should primarily drive the decision.

Practice Pointers Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis occurs in approximately 4% of people with colonic diverticulosis and has traditionally been considered a bacterial infection that should be treated with antibiotics. 2 Risk factors for diverticulitis suggest that chronic inflammation is a potential etiology, which has led some clinicians to question the utility of antibiotics.

3 The authors of this Cochrane review sought to determine if antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis reduces complications or the need for emergency surgery. The Cochrane review included three RCTs comparing antibiotics and no antibiotics. The authors included studies in which left-sided acute uncomplicated diverticulitis was confirmed by radiography and excluded complicated diseases. Primary outcomes were complications and emergency surgery within 30 days. Secondary outcomes were recurrence, late complications, or surgery after 30 days; adverse events; and all-cause mortality. The quality of evidence for the primary outcomes was low due to a lack of blinding in two of the three studies, leading to a risk of detection and performance bias. The body of evidence is limited because only three RCTs are included in this review.

However, a recently published non-inferiority, triple-blinded RCT not included in this review demonstrated that not using antibiotics for outpatient treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis is safe and not inferior to antibiotic therapy. 4 The American Gastroenterological Association suggests selective use of antibiotics in acute uncomplicated diverticulitis with patients who are immunocompromised, pregnant, or critically ill, representing a shift toward management without antibiotics. 5 The use of antibiotics to treat acute uncomplicated diverticulitis can cause serious adverse events, including allergic reactions and Clostridioides difficile infections. Antibiotic treatment should be carefully considered because of growing global concerns about antimicrobial resistance. Management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis without antibiotics appears to be safe.

### Systematic review of evidence and consensus on diverticulitis: an analysis of national and international guidelines [^112H69fh]. Colorectal Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

The study aimed to analyse the currently available national and international guidelines for areas of consensus and contrasting recommendations in the treatment of diverticulitis and thereby to design questions for future research.

Method

MEDLINE, EMBASE and PubMed were systematically searched for guidelines on diverticular disease and diverticulitis. Inclusion was confined to papers in English and those < 10 years old. The included topics were classified as consensus or controversy between guidelines, and the highest level of evidence was scored as sufficient (Oxford Centre of Evidence-Based Medicine Level of Evidence of 3a or higher) or insufficient.

Results

Six guidelines were included and all topics with recommendations were compared. Overall, in 13 topics consensus was reached and 10 topics were regarded as controversial. In five topics, consensus was reached without sufficient evidence and in three topics there was no evidence and no consensus. Clinical staging, the need for intraluminal imaging, dietary restriction, duration of antibiotic treatment, the protocol for abscess treatment, the need for elective surgery in subgroups of patients, the need for surgery after abscess treatment and the level of the proximal resection margin all lack consensus or evidence.

Conclusion

Evidence on the diagnosis and treatment of diverticular disease and diverticulitis ranged from nonexistent to strong, regardless of consensus. The most relevant research questions were identified and proposed as topics for future research.

### Diverticulitis in older adults: a review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^111UN4J4]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diverticulitis accounts for over 300,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States and its incidence increases with age. Among older adults, diverticulitis is the fourth leading cause for emergency surgery. Older adults with multimorbidity and geriatric syndromes are often excluded from clinical studies, leaving a gap in the evidence needed to guide management. Here, we provide a clinically oriented review of the diagnosis and management of older adults with diverticulitis through the lens of age-friendly care.

Methods and Results

We reviewed the literature describing the epidemiology, diagnosis, management, and prevention of diverticulitis in older adults. Due to age-related physiologic changes, the presence of geriatric syndromes, and multimorbidity, older adults with diverticulitis often present with atypical symptoms, variable laboratory findings, and are at higher risk for complications than younger patients. Guidelines support a more aggressive approach to diagnosis in this population, with lower threshold for obtaining diagnostic imaging. Antibiotics remain a mainstay of treatment for uncomplicated disease, and surgical management should be focused on severity of disease and the balance between the likelihood of improving quality of life and risks and burden of treatment.

Conclusions

Diverticulitis is a common disease that has a unique presentation among older individuals with limited evidence to guide management. Diagnosis and treatment should focus on what matters most to the patient, providing the most meaningful outcome possible within the context of multimorbidity, patient goals, symptom burden, and anticipated treatment outcomes.

The objectives of therapy in patients who develop acute diverticulitis include the treatment of symptoms, the colonic infection, the prevention of complications and the recurrence of the condition(Table 3). Based on the severity of symptoms, ability to tolerate oral intake, presence of comorbidities and adequate outpatient support, the decision on whether patients should be hospitalized or receive ambulatory care should be carefully considered. Treatment of complications may require interventional radiology or surgery.

### Current status of the treatment of acute colonic diverticulitis: a systematic review [^114QbyhZ]. Colorectal Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Aim

This paper addresses the current status of the treatment of acute colonic diverticulitis by an evidence-based review.

Method

A systematic search in PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google scholar on colonic diverticulitis was performed. Diagnostic tools, randomized controlled trials, non-randomized comparative studies, observational epidemiological studies, national and international guidelines, reviews of observational studies on elective and emergency surgical treatment of diverticulitis, and studies of prognostic significance were reviewed. Criteria for eligibility of the studies were diagnosis and classification, medical treatment, inpatients and outpatients, diverticulitis in young patients, immunosuppression, recurrence, elective resection, emergency surgery, and predictive factors.

Results

Some 92 publications were selected for comprehensive review. The review highlighted that computed tomography is the most effective test in the diagnosis and staging of acute diverticulitis; outpatient treatment can be performed for uncomplicated diverticulitis in patients without associated comorbidities; conservative treatment is aimed at those patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis; elective surgery must be done on an individual basis; laparoscopic approach for elective treatment of diverticulitis is appropriate but may be technically complex; in perforated diverticulitis, resection with primary anastomosis is a safe procedure that requires experience and should take into account strict exclusion criteria.

Conclusion

The heterogeneity of patients with colonic diverticular disease means that both elective and urgent treatment should be tailored on an individual basis.

### Acute colonic diverticulitis [^1118dtuU]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute colonic diverticulitis is a gastrointestinal condition that is frequently encountered by primary care and emergency department practitioners, hospitalists, surgeons, and gastroenterologists. Clinical presentation ranges from mild abdominal pain to peritonitis with sepsis. It is often diagnosed on the basis of clinical features alone, but imaging is necessary in more severe presentations to rule out such complications as abscess and perforation. Treatment depends on the severity of the presentation, the presence of complications, and underlying comorbid conditions. Medical and surgical treatment algorithms are evolving. This article provides an evidence-based, clinically relevant overview of the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of acute diverticulitis.

5 Uncomplicated Diverticulitis

Little data exists to support optimal medical management of diverticulitis in older or frail adults. Historically, management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis involved inpatient admission with intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest. Following several large randomized controlled trials of younger patients (mean age ~57) with few, if any comorbidities, outpatient management with omission of antibiotics has become the recommendation for young patients with mild uncomplicated diverticulitis. However, this treatment strategy has not been evaluated in older or frail adults. As such, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) guidelines recommend selected use of antibiotics in cases of uncomplicated diverticulitis in patients who are frail or have significant comorbidities. Close clinical follow‐up is essential in older adults, and antibiotics and/or inpatient observation should be considered in older, frail patients with systemic symptoms, fever, leukocytosis, multiple comorbidities, or unreliable follow‐up.

### Diverticulitis: when and how to operate? [^115fTCKU]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2004). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease, and particularly diverticulitis, has increasing incidence in industrialised countries. Diverticular disease can be classified as symptomatic uncomplicated disease, recurrent symptomatic disease, and complicated disease. Conservative or medical management is usually indicated for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Indications for surgery include recurrent attacks and complications of the disease. Surgical treatment options have changed considerably over the years along with the inventions of new diagnostic tools and new surgical therapeutic approaches. Indications and timing for surgery of diverticular disease are determined mainly by the stage of the disease. In addition to this major factor, the individual risk factors of the patient along with the course of the disease after conservative or operative therapy do play a big role in decision-making and treatment of this disease. In this context, the purpose of this article is to review the surgical treatment of diverticulitis with regard to indications, timeliness of operative intervention, operative options and techniques, and special circumstances.

### Diverticular disease: diagnosis and treatment [^115zU3KP]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease refers to symptomatic and asymptomatic disease with an underlying pathology of colonic diverticula. Predisposing factors for the formation of diverticula include a low-fiber diet and physical inactivity. Approximately 85 percent of patients with diverticula are believed to remain asymptomatic. Symptomatic disease without inflammation is a diagnosis of exclusion requiring colonoscopy because imaging studies cannot discern the significance of diverticula. Fiber supplementation may prevent progression to symptomatic disease or improve symptoms in patients without inflammation. Computed tomography is recommended for diagnosis when inflammation is present. Antibiotic therapy aimed at anaerobes and gram-negative rods is first-line treatment for diverticulitis. Whether treatment is administered on an inpatient or outpatient basis is determined by the clinical status of the patient and his or her ability to tolerate oral intake. Surgical consultation is indicated for disease that does not respond to medical management or for repeated attacks that may be less likely to respond to medical therapy and have a higher mortality rate. Prompt surgical consultation also should be obtained when there is evidence of abscess formation, fistula formation, obstruction, or free perforation.

### Diverticulitis in older adults: a review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^113aWc5c]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

11 Conclusion

The prevalence of diverticulitis increases with age. Diverticulitis in older adults poses unique challenges due to atypical presentation and differences in the risk benefit profile of treatment strategies. Further research in this population is required to help define optimal medical management strategies (safety of omitting antibiotics), quality of life outcomes with and without surgical intervention, and the impacts of age on recurrence. Based on available data, CT imaging should be considered in any patient over 65 suspected of having diverticulitis and presenting with systemic signs or atypical symptoms such as fatigue, syncope, and/or acute kidney injury. Antibiotics should be considered for older or frail patients who present with systemic symptoms, and patients with complicated, recurrent, or smoldering diverticulitis should be referred to a surgeon if surgery is within their goals of care. Overall, diverticulitis treatment should center on what matters most to the patient and provide the most meaningful outcome possible within the context of the patient's goals, symptoms, and likely treatment outcomes.

### Current management of diverticulitis [^117NrpLH]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Diverticulosis and diverticulitis remain common diagnoses in western countries, and the incidence continues to rise. Diverticulitis accounts for roughly one-third of admissions to acute care hospitals annually, with even more patients being treated as outpatients due to improved understanding of risk stratification and the natural history of disease progression. Thus, having a thorough understanding of the etiology of the disease in conjunction with computed tomography findings and patient presentation can help dictate the appropriate treatment.

### AGA clinical practice update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis: expert review [^111PGekX]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Colonic diverticulitis is a painful gastrointestinal disease that recurs unpredictably and can lead to chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastroenterologists commonly care for patients with this disease. The purpose of this Clinical Practice Update is to provide practical and evidence-based advice for management of diverticulitis. We reviewed systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies to develop 14 best practices. In brief, computed tomography is often necessary to make a diagnosis. Rarely, a colon malignancy is misdiagnosed as diverticulitis. Whether patients should have a colonoscopy after an episode of diverticulitis depends on the patient's history, most recent colonoscopy, and disease severity and course. In patients with a history of diverticulitis and chronic symptoms, alternative diagnoses should be excluded with both imaging and lower endoscopy. Antibiotic treatment can be used selectively rather than routinely in immunocompetent patients with mild acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Antibiotic treatment is strongly advised in immunocompromised patients. To reduce the risk of recurrence, patients should consume a high-quality diet, have a normal body mass index, be physically active, not smoke, and avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use except aspirin prescribed for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. At the same time, patients should understand that genetic factors also contribute to diverticulitis risk. Patients should be educated that the risk of complicated diverticulitis is highest with the first presentation. An elective segmental resection should not be advised based on the number of episodes. Instead, a discussion of elective segmental resection should be personalized to consider severity of disease, patient preferences and values, as well as risks and benefits.

1 Introduction

Sigmoid or left‐sided diverticulosis (hereafter termed "diverticulosis") refers the presence of false diverticula of the colon. Diverticulosis affects 60% of the U.S. population by age 60. Most individuals with diverticulosis are asymptomatic, however, 10%–25% develop symptoms ranging from minor abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits to severe pain, sepsis, or diverticular bleeding. This review will focus specifically on diverticulitis, defined as inflammation centered on the diverticular orifices. The majority (85%) of individuals with diverticulitis develop uncomplicated disease while the remaining 15% experience disease complicated by abscess, fistula, obstruction, or perforation.

Among gastrointestinal diagnoses, diverticulitis is the sixth most common cause of hospital admissions and 11th most common cause of non‐malignant deaths in the United States. The overall incidence of diverticulitis is increasing, driven in part by the aging population in the United States. Diverticulitis increases with age, as does the number of diverticulitis related Emergency Department visits. Diverticulitis is the fourth most common cause for emergency surgery in older adults. Older adults with diverticulitis are at higher risk of in‐hospital mortality and complications of diverticulitis and resulting surgical treatments than younger patients.

Treatment strategies for diverticulitis include observation, medical management, elective surgery, and emergency surgery. Treatment decisions for older adults require weighing symptom severity, impact on quality of life, and risks associated with intervention and non‐intervention. The data supporting optimal management of older adults is sparse and the variable presentation and differing outcomes among older adults support a nuanced approach to diagnosis and management. Recent European multi‐society guidelines for the care of older adults with diverticulitis establish a foundation for unique considerations in this population. Relevant literature was identified via pub med and embase. Articles were selected based on review of their abstracts, which indicated that they were original articles or practice guidelines relevant to diagnosis or management of diverticulitis in older adults or age‐related outcomes related to diverticulitis. This review aims to provide clinically relevant context and recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of diverticulitis in older adults.

Introduction

Despite the longtime prevalence of diverticulitis as one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases in both the inpatient and outpatient setting, its etiology, prevention, and treatment remain hotly contested. Once viewed as a disorder of primarily older people in western populations, diverticulitis has rapidly increased its presence in all age groups worldwide, prompting researchers to reexamine the pathophysiology of the disease process. Clinicians continue to push the envelope with novel approaches to management, from avoiding antibiotics for uncomplicated cases to identifying subsets of patients with complicated diverticulitis who may not require an operation. Here, we review the most recent literature on a wide array of topics in diverticulitis, with an emphasis on publications within the last 5 years.

### What do we know about diverticular disease? A brief overview [^113ToEQR]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Diverticulosis and its complications, particularly diverticulitis, are extremely common in western countries. The major factor in the development of diverticulosis is a lack of adequate fiber intake. Diverticulitis may be complicated by abscess formation, fistula formation, peritonitis, or obstruction. Computed tomography scans are highly useful tools to plan appropriate care. Most cases of simple, uncomplicated diverticulitis respond to conservative therapy with bowel rest and antibiotics. Many controversies remain in the care of diverticulitis patients, including the optimal timing of surgery. One particularly interesting area of recent research examines the overlap of diverticulitis and inflammatory bowel disease, including the use of probiotics and mesalamine in diverticular disease.

Understanding what is important to the patient and how diverticulitis and its treatment may impact the patient's life goals can be a powerful guide for management. In some cases, deviating from the management strategies advocated for younger healthier patients may be best for an older adult with diverticulitis.

### Progress and challenges in the management of diverticular disease: which treatment? [^1121c4sT]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease of the colon (DDC) includes a spectrum of conditions from asymptomatic diverticulosis to symptomatic uncomplicated diverticulosis, segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis, and acute diverticulitis without or with complications that may have serious consequences. Clinical and scientific interest in DDC is increasing because of the rising incidence of all conditions within the DDC spectrum, a better, although still limited understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms involved; the increasing socioeconomic burden; and the new therapeutic options being tested. The goals of treatment in DDC are symptom and inflammation relief and preventing disease progression or recurrence. The basis for preventing disease progression remains a high-fiber diet and physical exercise, although evidence is poor. Other current strategies do not meet expectations or lack a solid mechanistic foundation; these strategies include modulation of gut microbiota or dysbiosis with rifaximin or probiotics, or using mesalazine for low-grade inflammation in uncomplicated symptomatic diverticulosis. Most acute diverticulitis is uncomplicated, and the trend is to avoid hospitalization and unnecessary antibiotic therapy, but patients with comorbidities, sepsis, or immunodeficiency should receive broad spectrum and appropriate antibiotics. Complicated acute diverticulitis may require interventional radiology or surgery, although the best surgical approach (open versus laparoscopic) remains a matter of discussion. Prevention of acute diverticulitis recurrence remains undefined, as do therapeutic strategies. Mesalazine with or without probiotics has failed to prevent diverticulitis recurrence, whereas new studies are needed to validate preliminary positive results with rifaximin. Surgery is another option, but the number of acute events cannot guide this indication. We need to identify risk factors and disease progression or recurrence mechanisms to implement appropriate preventive strategies.

### Antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis [^116TRamW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Diverticulitis is an inflammatory complication to the very common condition diverticulosis. Uncomplicated diverticulitis has traditionally been treated with antibiotics with reference to the microbiology, extrapolation from trials on complicated intra-abdominal infections and clinical experience.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotic interventions for uncomplicated diverticulitis on relevant outcome.

Search Methods

Studies were identified by computerised searches of the The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. Ongoing trials were identified and reference lists of identified trials and relevant review articles were screened for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs including all types of patients with a radiological confirmed diagnosis of left-sided uncomplicated diverticulitis. Interventions of antibiotics compared to any other antibiotic treatment (different regime, route of administration, dosage or duration of treatment), placebo or no antibiotics. Outcome measures were complications, emergency surgery, recurrence, late complications and duration of hospital stay and recovery of signs of infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors performed the searches, identification of RCTs, trial assessment and data extraction. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or involvement of a third part. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain additional data if needed or were contacted for preliminary results of ongoing trials. Effect estimates were extracted as relative risks (RR).

Main Results

Three RCTs were identified. A qualitative approach with no meta analysis was performed because of variety in interventions between included studies. Interventions compared were antibiotics to no antibiotics, single to double compound antibiotic therapy and short to long IV administration. None of the studies found significant difference between the tested interventions. Risk of bias varied from low to high. The newest RCT overall had the best quality and statistical power.

Authors' Conclusions

The newest evidence from one RCT says there is no significant difference between antibiotics versus no antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis. Previous RCTs have only suggested a non-inferiority between different antibiotic regimes and treatment lengths. This new evidence needs confirmation from more RCTs before it can be implicated safely in clinical guidelines. Ongoing RCTs will be published in the years to come and more are needed. The role of antibiotics in the treatment of complicated diverticulitis has not been investigated yet.
