## Question

What iron formulation is best for ckd patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which iron formulation is best for patients with chronic kidney disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how CKD stage and dialysis status change iron handling and the route of administration. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines recommend for hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and non-dialysis CKD. Next, I will review comparative efficacy and safety data for oral versus intravenous iron, including specific IV formulations. After that, I need to consider special populations and comorbidities that might shift the balance of risks and benefits. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with monitoring and safety guardrails, making sure I double-check thresholds and dosing details against current guidance before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: CKD anemia is multifactorial, but iron deficiency — both absolute and functional — is a major, modifiable contributor, and the optimal iron route and formulation vary by dialysis status, severity of iron deficit, prior response, venous access, and cost or access constraints, so I need to avoid a one-size-fits-all answer and tailor to these factors [^115RRCTu] [^112TonLF].

> For hemodialysis patients, I should confirm the default position: most patients require intravenous iron because oral absorption is limited by hepcidin-mediated blockade and ongoing procedural blood losses, and guidelines explicitly recommend IV iron as standard of care in this group, which aligns with pathophysiology and observational practice patterns [^111tr74U] [^111uowxP].

> Wait, let me verify the dosing specifics for hemodialysis, because I recall older protocols using smaller, frequent doses. The UKKA 2025 update recommends a proactive high-dose, low-frequency approach with 600 mg in divided doses in the first month, then 400 mg monthly, unless ferritin exceeds 700 mcg/L or TSAT exceeds 40%, which operationalizes a maintenance strategy while avoiding iron overload, and I should note that this is a shift from purely reactive, small-dose strategies used historically [^112dZs6y].

> For non-dialysis CKD and peritoneal dialysis, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I initially thought IV iron is broadly superior and should be first-line, but I should double-check the evidence base, which shows only modest Hb advantages of IV over oral iron and mixed results in trials, so guidelines endorse a shared decision-making approach with a 1–3 month oral iron trial as reasonable in many patients, reserving IV iron for intolerance, nonresponse, or when rapid repletion is needed, such as before ESA initiation [^115CjH7K] [^114RozD9] [^11712MHp].

> Let me consider oral options in ND-CKD. Ferric citrate is FDA-approved for IDA in CKD not on dialysis and has RCT data showing meaningful Hb increases versus placebo, with diarrhea being the most common adverse effect and dose flexibility across 1–12 tablets/day, which can be useful when aiming for efficacy with tolerability, though I should confirm that phosphate-binding properties may be advantageous or limiting depending on serum phosphate status [^115z9pGZ] [^111S5gUw] [^1119c5k3].

> Next, I should review IV formulations and dosing paradigms. High-dose, low-frequency agents like ferric carboxymaltose and ferric derisomaltose allow 1,000–1,500 mg in one or two infusions, which can rapidly replete iron and reduce ESA requirements, and randomized data in ND-CKD show ferric carboxymaltose targeting higher ferritin delayed ESA initiation and improved Hb more than oral iron, while ferric derisomaltose proved noninferior to iron sucrose for Hb change in NDD-CKD, supporting both efficacy and convenience of these modern agents [^113X8egV] [^116PwD5b].

> I need to ensure safety is front and center. IV iron increases hypersensitivity and hypotension risk compared with oral iron, so I should monitor for 60 minutes after the initial dose of non-dextran IV iron and ensure resuscitation capability, and I must avoid IV iron during active systemic infection because of potential immune modulation and oxidative stress concerns, even though causality remains debated [^115CjH7K] [^113qCqKs] [^113P2yHo].

> But wait, what if the patient has heart failure or is iron deficient without anemia? I should confirm that UKKA 2025 supports IV iron in CKD with iron deficiency and concomitant HF to improve symptoms and reduce HF hospitalizations, whereas for iron deficiency without anemia without HF, a trial of oral or IV iron may be considered for symptom relief such as restless legs, acknowledging limited CKD-specific data [^116xrrNA] [^116ezqs9].

> I should double-check thresholds for initiating iron and for holding or escalating therapy. KDIGO suggests IV iron (or a 1–3 month oral trial in ND-CKD) when TSAT is less than 30% and ferritin is less than 500 ng/mL if an Hb increase or ESA dose reduction is desired, and subsequent decisions should integrate Hb response, ongoing losses, and iron indices, while UKKA advises correcting absolute iron deficiency before starting ESAs, with ferritin thresholds of less than 100 ng/mL in ND-CKD and less than 200 ng/mL in dialysis patients guiding repletion [^114RozD9] [^115oKPk3] [^112gMnEy].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer now. There is no single best iron formulation for all CKD patients, so the best choice is context-specific: for hemodialysis, IV iron is preferred and a proactive high-dose, low-frequency regimen is reasonable. For ND-CKD or PD, start with oral iron if feasible and switch to high-dose, low-frequency IV iron if oral is not tolerated, ineffective, or if rapid repletion is needed. Across settings, ferric carboxymaltose or ferric derisomaltose offer efficient repletion with fewer infusions, while ferric citrate is a useful oral option in ND-CKD, and all decisions should incorporate patient preference, venous access, cost, and safety infrastructure [^111tr74U] [^112dZs6y] [^1139N9TR] [^115z9pGZ].

> Hold on, I should verify that my bottom line aligns with guidelines. Both KDIGO and UKKA emphasize individualized, risk–benefit balancing and shared decision-making for iron route and formulation, and they caution against both under-treatment of iron deficiency and excessive iron exposure, reinforcing the need to monitor ferritin and TSAT trends, Hb response, and clinical status at regular intervals to titrate therapy safely and effectively [^112TonLF] [^1175cmML] [^113y5a6q].

---

IV iron is the **preferred route** for most CKD patients, especially those on hemodialysis [^notfound] [^1139N9TR], because it achieves faster and larger hemoglobin gains [^115CjH7K] and reduces ESA requirements [^113X8egV]. Oral iron is less effective due to poor absorption and gastrointestinal side effects [^115CjH7K] [^111uowxP], but may be tried in non-dialysis CKD if IV access is limited or as a bridge to IV therapy [^112TonLF]. Ferric carboxymaltose or ferric derisomaltose are **preferred IV formulations** for their high-dose, low-frequency dosing and favorable safety profiles [^1139N9TR] [^115Q61WR] [^1112MrfX]. Iron sucrose or ferric gluconate are alternatives when these are unavailable. Avoid IV iron in active infection [^113P2yHo] and monitor for hypersensitivity [^113qCqKs].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting intravenous iron therapy

IV iron is **superior to oral iron** in CKD, particularly in hemodialysis patients [^115CjH7K], with faster and larger hemoglobin increases and reduced ESA requirements [^113X8egV]. Meta-analyses and RCTs consistently show IV iron improves hemoglobin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation [^115CjH7K] and reduces ESA dose [^115CjH7K].

---

## Recommended intravenous iron formulations

Several IV iron formulations are available, each with distinct pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. The **most commonly recommended formulations** for CKD patients include:

| **Formulation** | **Key features** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) | - High-dose, low-frequency dosing <br/> - Favorable safety profile <br/> - Rapid iron repletion | - FIND-CKD trial [^113X8egV] showed superior hemoglobin response and delayed ESA initiation compared to oral iron <br/> - Well tolerated in CKD patients [^1112MrfX] |
| Ferric derisomaltose (FDI) | - High-dose, low-frequency dosing <br/> - Non-dextran formulation <br/> - Low risk of hypersensitivity reactions | - FERWON-NEPHRO trial [^116PwD5b] demonstrated non-inferiority to iron sucrose with a lower risk of hypersensitivity reactions [^notfound] |
| Iron sucrose | - Widely available <br/> - Moderate dosing frequency <br/> - Well-established safety profile | - Effective in increasing hemoglobin and reducing ESA requirements [^notfound] <br/> - Commonly used in hemodialysis patients [^notfound] |
| Ferric gluconate | - Moderate dosing frequency <br/> - Well-established safety profile | - Effective alternative to iron sucrose [^notfound] <br/> - Suitable for patients with hypersensitivity to other formulations |

---

Ferric carboxymaltose and ferric derisomaltose are **preferred** for their high-dose, low-frequency dosing and favorable safety profiles [^1139N9TR] [^115Q61WR]. Iron sucrose and ferric gluconate remain effective alternatives [^1112MrfX].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

IV iron is generally well tolerated, but clinicians should be aware of potential adverse effects and monitor accordingly:

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Rare but potentially severe; monitor patients for 60 minutes after the initial dose and ensure resuscitative facilities are available [^113qCqKs] [^115EvrTg].
- **Infection risk**: Avoid IV iron in patients with active systemic infections due to potential exacerbation of infection risk [^113P2yHo] [^117T1Kr4].
- **Iron overload**: Regularly monitor ferritin and transferrin saturation to avoid excessive iron accumulation [^113y5a6q] [^116ANoLV].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing formulation choice

The choice of iron formulation should be **individualized** based on patient-specific factors:

- **Dialysis status**: Hemodialysis patients generally require IV iron due to poor oral absorption and ongoing blood losses [^111tr74U] [^111uowxP].
- **Severity of anemia**: Severe anemia may necessitate rapid iron repletion with IV formulations [^116vACBd].
- **Venous access**: Availability of reliable venous access influences the feasibility of IV iron administration [^112iWpEq].
- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making should consider patient preferences, tolerability, and convenience [^11712MHp].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current clinical guidelines from KDIGO and the UK Kidney Association provide the following **recommendations**:

- **Route of administration**: IV iron is recommended for hemodialysis patients, while oral iron may be considered for non-dialysis CKD patients depending on severity, response, and patient preferences [^111tr74U] [^112iWpEq].
- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of hemoglobin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation is essential to guide therapy and prevent complications [^113y5a6q] [^116ANoLV].
- **Safety**: Balance the benefits of iron therapy against potential risks, including hypersensitivity reactions and infection risk [^112Wp74T] [^113P2yHo].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

IV iron is the **preferred route** for most CKD patients, particularly those on hemodialysis, due to superior efficacy and faster hemoglobin correction [^111tr74U] [^113X8egV]. Ferric carboxymaltose and ferric derisomaltose are preferred IV formulations for their high-dose, low-frequency dosing and favorable safety profiles [^113X8egV] [^115Q61WR]. Oral iron may be considered for non-dialysis CKD patients with mild anemia or limited venous access, but its efficacy is limited by poor absorption and gastrointestinal side effects [^11712MHp] [^117CS94M].

### The safety and efficacy of ferumoxytol therapy in anemic chronic kidney disease patients [^116qKEf3]. Kidney International (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Administration of safe and effective iron therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease is a time consuming process. This phase II clinical trial studied ferumoxytol, a semi-synthetic carbohydrate-coated iron oxide administered by rapid intravenous injection to anemic chronic kidney disease patients (predialysis or undergoing peritoneal dialysis).

Methods

Inclusion criteria included hemoglobin ≤ 12.5 g/dL and transferrin saturation ≤ 35%. Twenty-one adult patients were randomized to receive ferumoxytol in a regimen of 4 doses of 255 mg iron in 2 weeks or 2 doses of 510 mg iron in 1 to 2 weeks. Ferumoxytol was administered at a rate of up to 30 mg iron/sec.

Results

The maximum hemoglobin response following ferumoxytol administration occurred at 6 weeks, increasing from a baseline of 10.4 ± 1.3 g/dL to 11.4 ± 1.2 g/dL (P < 0.05). Ferritin increased from a baseline of 232 ± 216 ng/mL to a maximum of 931 ± 361 ng/mL at 2 weeks (P < 0.05), while the baseline transferrin saturation increased from 21 ± 10% to 37 ± 22% at 1 week (P < 0.05). Seven adverse events in 5 patients during this trial were deemed possibly related to ferumoxytol, none serious. These events included constipation, chills, tingling, a gastrointestinal viral syndrome, delayed pruritic erythematous rash, and transient pain at the injection site.

Conclusion

Although larger studies are required, this small study demonstrates that ferumoxytol can be safe and effective in increasing iron stores, is associated with an increased hemoglobin response, and is well tolerated at a rapid infusion rate.

Although judicious use of intravenous iron preparations is an indispensable part of anemia treatment in hemodialysis patients, their excessive and indiscriminate use can have insidious but serious adverse consequences. With recent implementation of the bundling reimbursement policy, use of intravenous iron preparations in the hemodialysis population has markedly increased. Excessive use of these agents potentially can exacerbate oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, and immune deficiency and potentially increases the risk of microbial infections in this population. Most of these adverse effects are mediated by iron-catalyzed generation of reactive oxygen species and the resultant cell injury and dysfunction. This review is intended to provide an overview of the nature and mechanisms of the adverse effects of iron overload and call for the judicious use of these vitally important products.

Guideline 2.3.1

We suggest for people with NDD-CKD or maintained on PD (i.e. not requiring HD), the choice between oral vs. parenteral iron depends on a shared decision and should include the impact of the severity of iron deficiency, the previous response and side effects, the availability of venous access and the need to initiate ESA or HIF-PHI therapy. (2 A)

Guideline 2.3.2

We recommend that most people on haemodialysis require IV iron. (1 A)

Guideline 2.3.3

We suggest when offering IV iron therapy to people not receiving in-centre HD, to consider high dose, low frequency (HiD/LF) IV iron as the treatment of choice for adults and young people when trying to achieve iron repletion, considering all the following (2B):

Availability of venous access
Preferences of the person with anaemia of CKD or, where appropriate, their family or carers
Nursing and administration costs
Cost of local drug supply
Provision of resuscitation facilities

Guideline 2.3.4

We suggest the frequency of administration of HiD/LF IV iron for people with CKD not requiring HD and for people receiving PD needs to be tailored for each person as there is no clear data. (not graded)

Rationale

The evidence supporting intravenous (IV) iron over oral iron in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are pre-dialysis or on peritoneal dialysis (PD) is limited. Oral iron, when tolerated, is generally sufficient for most patients, particularly when used alongside erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy. However, in cases where patients are resistant to ESA therapy with oral iron or intolerant to oral supplementation, a therapeutic trial of IV iron may be warranted.

One randomised study of 188 pre-dialysis participants compared IV iron (1000 mg iron sucrose in divided doses over 14 days) with oral iron (ferrous sulphate 325 mg three times daily) and found greater improvements in haemoglobin (Hb) in the IV iron group, with more participants achieving an Hb increase of > 10 g/L. However, there was no difference in the proportion of participants requiring ESA initiation during the study. Two additional studies in pre-dialysis populations not receiving ESAs also demonstrated improved Hb outcomes following IV iron therapy, including one study that assessed IV iron after oral iron therapy.

BACKGROUND TO THE FERINJECT® ASSESSMENT IN PATIENTS WITH IRON DEFICIENCY ANAEMIA AND NON-DIALYSIS DEPENDENT CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE STUDY

Iron deficiency anaemia: a clinical challenge

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects > 10% of adults in developed countries, and the number is increasing as populations age and contributory diseases such as diabetes and hypertension become more common. Only a small proportion require dialysis. For patients with non-dialysis CKD (ND-CKD), management focuses on interventions to ameliorate further loss of kidney function, treating the multiple co-morbidities and managing cardiovascular risk.

Anaemia is a frequent complication of CKD. Prevalence estimates vary widely according to the definition which is applied, but a large U.S. survey observed haemoglobin (Hb) levels < 12 g/dL in more than one in four with relatively mild ND-CKD (Stages 1–2), increasing to more than half of those with severe ND-CKD (Stage 4). In addition to erythropoietin deficiency, iron deficiency is an important cause of anaemia in ND-CKD, arising from multiple factors directly or indirectly related to renal dysfunction. Inflammation is also common and is associated with increased hepcidin levels, which lead to impaired absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal tract and retention of iron in the reticuloendothelial system. Both absolute and functional iron deficiency limit erythropoiesis and are the main cause of hyporesponsiveness to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). In addition, iron is critical for many other cellular functions, such as energy metabolism, muscle performance and immune function.

### Safety and efficacy of iron isomaltoside 1000 / ferric derisomaltose versus iron sucrose in patients with chronic kidney disease: the FERWON-NEPHRO randomized, open-label, comparative trial [^115Q61WR]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Anaemia is an important health problem often encountered in patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD). The major causes of anaemia in patients with CKD are iron and erythropoietin deficiencies and decreased responsiveness to erythropoietin. Patients with CKD who are treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are likely to develop iron deficiency due to the increased demand for iron to support production of new red blood cells. Thus, iron therapy, alone or in combination with ESA treatment, is essential for effective management of iron deficiency anaemia in patients with CKD. According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline, patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD and iron deficiency anaemia should be treated with intravenous (IV) iron or 1–3 months of oral iron depending on the severity of iron deficiency, availability of venous access, response to prior oral iron, side effects with prior iron therapy, expected adherence and cost. For patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD who require IV iron, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines recommend use of high-dose, low-frequency IV iron formulations.

Several trials have shown that IV iron improves symptoms, functional capacity and quality of life compared with placebo in the context of heart failure. However, to date, there are limited data comparing the relative effects of different IV iron formulations in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD.

The FERWON programme was initiated to address the safety and efficacy of high dose iron isomaltoside 1000/ferric derisomaltose (IIM) compared with iron sucrose (IS). The FERWON programme consists of two trials that included a total of 3050 patients with iron deficiency anaemia of mixed aetiologies (FERWON-IDA) or CKD (FERWON-NEPHRO). The results of the FERWON-NEPHRO trial are presented here. The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IIM compared with IS in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD and iron deficiency anaemia with a focus on incidence of serious or severe hypersensitivity reactions and haematological response. The secondary objectives included incidence of composite cardiovascular adverse events (AEs).

Regarding medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to iron therapy, safety, KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend to consider monitoring patients for 60 minutes after the infusion of the initial dose of IV iron nondextran, and ensure the availability of resuscitative facilities (including medications) and personnel trained to evaluate and treat serious adverse reactions.

### Parenteral iron compounds: potent oxidants but mainstays of anemia management in chronic renal disease [^112ww6V4]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Ferric iron (Fe)-carbohydrate complexes are widely used for treating Fe deficiency in patients who are unable to meet their Fe requirements with oral supplements. Intravenous Fe generally is well tolerated and effective in correcting Fe-deficient states. However, the complexing of Fe to carbohydrate polymers does not block its potent pro-oxidant effects; systemic free radical generation and, possibly, tissue damage may result. The purpose of this review is to (1) underscore the capacity of currently used parenteral Fe formulations to induce oxidative stress, (2) compare the severity of these oxidant reactions with those that result from unshielded Fe salts and with each other, and (3) speculate as to the potential of these agents to induce acute renal cell injury and augment systemic inflammatory responses. The experimental data that are reviewed should not be extrapolated to the clinical setting or be used for clinical decision making. Rather, it is hoped that the information provided herein may have utility for clinical hypothesis generation and, hence, future clinical studies. By so doing, a better understanding of Fe's potential protean effects on patients with renal disease may result.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^114c29Qh]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 2.3 - treatment of Anaemia with iron therapy - route of administration

We suggest that oral iron will, in general, be sufficient to maintain and may be sufficient to attain the Hb within targets in ESA treated CKD patients not yet requiring dialysis and in those on peritoneal dialysis (PD). (2B)

For CKD patients not requiring haemodialysis, the choice between oral vs. parenteral iron depends on the severity of iron deficiency, the previous response and side effects, the availability of venous access and the need to initiate ESA therapy (2A).

In contrast most haemodialysis patients will require intravenous iron. (2A).

When offering intravenous iron therapy to people not receiving haemodialysis, consider high dose, low-frequency IV iron as the treatment of choice for adults and young people when trying to achieve iron repletion, taking into account all of the following:
the availability of venous access
preferences of the person with anaemia of CKD or, where appropriate, their family or carers
nursing and administration costs
cost of local drug supply
provision of resuscitation facilities

Intravenous iron administered at a low dose and high frequency may be more appropriate for adults who are receiving in-centre haemodialysis.

High dose, low frequency (HD/LF) is considered to be a maximum of 2 infusions. For adults this is considered to be a minimum of 500 mg of iron in each infusion.

Low dose, high frequency (LD/HF) is considered to be more than 2 infusions. For adults, there would typically be 100–200 mg of iron in each infusion.

At the time of publication intravenous iron products available in the UK did not have a UK marketing authorisation for all ages of children and young people for this indication.

Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for the prescription of individual iron preparations.

### Hemoglobin response to ferric citrate in patients with nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease and iron deficiency anemia [^117CS94M]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common complication in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and often occurs due to iron deficiency. Causes of iron deficiency in CKD include upregulation of hepcidin (a peptide hormone that reduces iron transport across enterocytes) leading to decreased dietary iron absorption, impaired iron release from body stores associated with heightened inflammation, and gastrointestinal blood loss. All result in insufficient bone marrow iron availability and inefficient erythropoiesis, leading to iron deficiency anemia. 1

Recent clinical practice guidelines from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes recommend using oral or intravenous iron before erythropoietin‐stimulating agents for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients with nondialysis‐dependent (NDD)‐CKD. 1 Oral iron preparations are typically ineffective and/or poorly tolerated due to gastrointestinal side effects. 1 Intravenous iron is used infrequently in nephrology offices as it requires intravenous infusion in a monitored setting with facilities for resuscitation because of risks of serious adverse drug events, including hypersensitivity reactions. 1

### Iron deficiency anaemia: pathophysiology, assessment, practical management [^111FSCEk]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

The WHO has recognised iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) as the most common nutritional deficiency in the world, with 30% of the population being affected with this condition. Although the most common causes of IDA are gastrointestinal bleeding and menstruation in women, decreased dietary iron and decreased iron absorption are also culpable causes. Patients with IDA should be treated with the aim of replenishing iron stores and returning the haemoglobin to a normal level. This has shown to improve quality of life, morbidity, prognosis in chronic disease and outcomes in pregnancy. Iron deficiency occurs in many chronic inflammatory conditions, including congestive cardiac failure, chronic kidney disease and inflammatory bowel disease. This article will provide an updated overview on diagnosis and management of IDA in patients with chronic conditions, preoperative and in pregnancy. We will discuss the benefits and limitations of oral versus intravenous iron replacement in each cohort, with an overview on cost analysis between the different iron formulations currently on the market.

For the last 25 years, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and iron therapy have been the mainstay of anaemia management in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), while blood transfusions were only used when these therapies failed or when there was an urgent clinical need. ESAs have been shown to be highly effective in ameliorating anaemia in this setting. However, large randomized controlled trials in patients with CKD either non-dialysed or on dialysis have shown that attempts to normalize haemoglobin (Hb) with ESAs are associated with no benefit for cardiovascular events or mortality, and an increased risk of stroke, venous thromboembolism and possibly death. Secondary analyses of these trials indicated that these risks may be particularly prevalent in patients who are relatively unresponsive to highdosages of ESAs. As a consequence, the prescription and dosage of ESAs have decreased, the number of blood transfusions has increased and — since iron deficiency is one of the main causes of hyporesponsiveness to ESAs — the use of iron therapy in patients with CKD, has increased significantly. However, in non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients with anaemia and/or iron deficiency, intravenous (IV) iron therapy remains far less widely utilized than in the dialysis population.

### Comparing the efficacy of intravenous iron and oral iron in nondialysis patients with chronic kidney disease [^11423eXw]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

This Practice Point commentary discusses the findings and limitations of a phase III trial by Spinowitz et al. that compared oral and intravenous iron therapies in nondialysis patients with chronic kidney disease. In total, 304 patients were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive either two 510 mg doses of intravenous ferumoxytol within 5 ± 3 days or 200mg of elemental oral iron daily for 21 days. At day 35, hemoglobin levels had increased significantly more in patients who had received intravenous ferumoxytol than in those who had received oral iron therapy. Ferumoxytol was well tolerated. The superiority of ferumoxytol over other intravenous iron preparations, however, needs to be investigated, and optimal serum ferritin levels for the nondialysis CKD population need to be defined.

Purpose Of Review

Iron deficiency is a major contributory cause to the development of anaemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and thus, iron replacement therapy plays a critical role in the management of this condition. The two main routes for administering iron are oral and intravenous, and there have been a number of new publications relevant to both routes of administration.

Recent Findings

Recent developments on the topic of iron management in CKD include the introduction of new oral iron preparations, as well as two recent meta-analyses on iron therapy in CKD (one on oral versus intravenous iron, and one on high- versus low-dose intravenous iron in haemodialysis patients). There is also increasing interest in other strategies to improve iron availability, such as intradialytic iron, hypoxia-inducible factor stabilization and antihepcidin strategies.

Summary

Even despite the latest publications in this field, we are still left with serious gaps in our evidence base on how best to provide supplemental iron to CKD patients. Most of the evidence suggests that intravenous iron is superior to oral iron in increasing haemoglobin and minimizing the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, but the safety of intravenous iron remains a controversy. The PIVOTAL study will hopefully provide informative data to fill some of the gap in the evidence-base and inform best clinical practice.

### Proteinuria induced by parenteral iron in chronic kidney disease – a comparative randomized controlled trial [^1142u2mw]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), differences in proteinuria are seen between intravenous iron preparations after a single dose exposure. This study examined differences in proteinuria between two intravenous iron preparations after multiple doses.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Patients with iron-deficiency anemia and CKD, stratified by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor-blocker (ARB) use, were randomized to iron sucrose or ferric gluconate. Each patient at 12 centers received 100 mg of study drug weekly for 5 weeks. Urine protein/urine creatinine ratio was measured before each dose and frequently thereafter for 3 hours.

Results

Postbaseline data were available from 33 patients receiving iron sucrose and 29 patients receiving ferric gluconate. Although neither preparation of intravenous iron increased the predose level of proteinuria, the proteinuric response to intravenous iron was dependent on the type of iron and ACEI/ARB use. Without ACEIs/ARBs, ferric gluconate tended to cause less proteinuria with repeated iron administration; iron sucrose did not mitigate or aggravate proteinuria. Among patients receiving ACEIs/ARBs, in contrast to ferric gluconate, which produced only mild transient proteinuria, iron sucrose produced a consistent and persistent proteinuric response that was on average 78% greater.

Conclusions

Although multiple doses of either intravenous iron did not increase basal levels of proteinuria, postdose proteinuria was greater with iron sucrose than with ferric gluconate. These data suggest that nephrotoxicity of iron may depend on type of intravenous iron and on ACEI/ARB use. The long-term effects on kidney function need to be further evaluated.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to management of anemia, iron therapy, KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend to balance the potential benefits of iron therapy (avoiding or minimizing blood transfusions, ESA therapy, and anemia-related symptoms) against potential risks of harm (anaphylactoid reactions, other unknown long-term risks) when prescribing iron therapy.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111nsaSA]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Anaemia is a commonly diagnosed complication among patients suffering with chronic kidney disease. If left untreated, it may affect patient quality of life. There are several causes for anaemia in this patient population. As the kidney function deteriorates, together with medications and dietary restrictions, patients may develop iron deficiency, resulting in reduction of iron supply to the bone marrow (which is the body organ responsible for the production of different blood elements). Chronic kidney disease patients may not be able to utilise their own body's iron stores effectively and hence, many patients, particularly those receiving haemodialysis, may require additional iron treatment, usually provided by infusion. With further weakening of kidney function, patients with chronic kidney disease may need additional treatment with a substance called erythropoietin which drives the bone marrow to produce its own blood. This substance, which is naturally produced by the kidneys, becomes relatively deficient in patients with chronic kidney disease. Any patients will eventually require treatment with erythropoietin or similar products that are given by injection. Over the last few years, several iron and erythropoietin products have been licensed for treating anaemia in chronic kidney disease patients. In addition, several publications discussed the benefits of each treatment and possible risks associated with long term treatment. The current guidelines provide advice to health care professionals on how to screen chronic kidney disease patients for anaemia, which patients to investigate for other causes of anaemia, when and how to treat patients with different medications, how to ensure safe prescribing of treatment and how to diagnose and manage complications associated with anaemia and the drugs used for its treatment.

### Controversies in optimal anemia management: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^116xKfSw]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

In chronic kidney disease, anemia and disordered iron homeostasis are prevalent and associated with significant adverse consequences. In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) issued an anemia guideline for managing the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease. Since then, new data have accrued from basic research, epidemiological studies, and randomized trials that warrant a re-examination of previous recommendations. Therefore, in 2019, KDIGO decided to convene 2 Controversies Conferences to review the latest evidence, explore new and ongoing controversies, assess change implications for the current KDIGO anemia guideline, and propose a research agenda. The first conference, described here, focused mainly on iron-related issues, including the contribution of disordered iron homeostasis to the anemia of chronic kidney disease, diagnostic challenges, available and emerging iron therapies, treatment targets, and patient outcomes. The second conference will discuss issues more specifically related to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, including epoetins, and hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors. Here we provide a concise overview of the consensus points and controversies resulting from the first conference and prioritize key questions that need to be answered by future research.

Iron Deficiency Anemia in Patients with Non-Hemodialysis Dependent Chronic Kidney Disease (NDD-CKD)

Trial 2 (NCT02940860) was a randomized controlled trial in 1538 patients with NDD-CKD who were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with Monoferric or iron sucrose respectively. Adult patients aged ≥ 18 years with Hb ≤ 11 g/dL, s-ferritin ≤ 100 ng/mL (or ≤ 300 ng/mL if TSAT ≤ 30%), chronic renal impairment with eGFR between 15–59 mL/min, and either no ESAs or ESAs at a stable dose (± 20%) for 4 weeks before randomization were eligible for enrollment. The median age of patients was 69 years (range 25–97), 63% were female.

The efficacy of Monoferric was established based upon the demonstration of non-inferiority for change in hemoglobin from baseline to Week 8 (Table 3).

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of iron therapy in anaemic adults without chronic kidney disease: updated and abridged cochrane review [^111vjjAc]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

Anaemia is increasingly recognized as having an independent impact upon patient outcomes in cardiac disease. The role of novel iron therapies to treat anaemia is increasing. This systematic review and meta-analysis assesses the efficacy and safety of iron therapies for the treatment of adults with anaemia.

Methods and Results

Electronic databases and search engines were searched as per Cochrane methodology. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of iron vs. inactive control or placebo, as well as alternative formulations, doses, and routes in anaemic adults without chronic kidney disease or in the peri-partum period were eligible. The primary outcome of interest was mortality at 1 year. Secondary outcomes were blood transfusion, haemoglobin levels, quality of life, serious adverse events, and length of hospital stay. A total of 64 RCTs (including five studies of heart failure patients) comprising 9004 participants were included. None of the studies was at a low risk of bias. There were no statistically significant differences in mortality between iron and inactive control. Both oral and parenteral iron significantly reduced the proportion of patients requiring blood transfusion compared with inactive control [risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48–0.90; and RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73–0.97, respectively]. Haemoglobin was increased more by both oral and parenteral iron compared with inactive control [mean difference (MD) 0.91 g/dL, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.35; and MD 1.04, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.57, respectively], and parenteral iron demonstrated a greater increase when compared with oral iron (MD 0.53 g/dL, 95% CI 0.31–0.75). In all comparisons, there were no differences in the results comparing patients with and without heart failure.

Conclusion

Both oral and parenteral iron are shown to decrease the proportion of people who require blood transfusion and increase haemoglobin levels, without any benefit on mortality. Further trials at a low risk of bias, powered to measure clinically significant endpoints, are still required.

### Triumph and tragedy: anemia management in chronic kidney disease [^114JcY4n]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent trial data have resulted in a reevaluation of the management of anemia in chronic kidney disease, including the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, intravenous iron, and novel pharmaceuticals. In this review, we evaluate the latest research on anemia management in chronic kidney disease.

Recent Findings

Clinical trials of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents indicate that targeting the complete correction of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease results in a greater risk of morbidity and mortality despite improved hemoglobin and quality of life. Conversely, intravenous iron has been found effective and relatively well tolerated in treating anemia in chronic kidney disease, even in patients with elevated ferritin. New agents to manage anemia, including long-acting erythropoietin derivatives, are also in active development.

Summary

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents should be used to target hemoglobin 11–12 g/dl in patients with chronic kidney disease. Intravenous iron may be beneficial for patients with hemoglobin less than 11 g/dl and transferrin saturation less than 25% despite elevated ferritin (500–1200 ng/ml). An upcoming placebo-controlled trial of darbepoetin should help to define the role of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in chronic kidney disease.

Guideline 3.5 - treatment of Anaemia - initial ESA dose

We recommend that the initial ESA dose should be determined by the patient's Hb level, the target Hb level, the observed rate of increase in Hb level and clinical circumstances. (2B)

Rationale

For initiation of ESA therapy, several points are to be considered:
Type(s) of licensed ESAs available
Initial ESA dose
ESA dose adjustment: dose required for Hb correction vs. maintenance
Route of ESA administration
Frequency of ESA administration that best fit patient requirements and achieve maximal convenience
Patient monitoring for the anticipated response in terms of Hb rise, rate of Hb rise, possible adverse effect (e.g. hypertension).

In general, the aim of initial ESA therapy is to achieve a rate of increase in Hb levels of 10 to 20 g/L per month. This rate of rise is considered safe as evidenced from interventional trials on ESA naïve patients. In CKD patients with initial Hb levels less than target range, these trials have shown the mean initial rate of Hb level increase to be in the range of 7 to 25 g/L in the first 4 weeks. This rate of Hb increase is affected by the patient population, iron status, initial ESA dose, and the frequency and route of ESA administration.

Optimal treatment algorithms for erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) and iron therapy in anemic CKD patients are lacking. Kuragano et al. evaluated hemodialysis patients over two years and report increased mortality risk and/or adverse events in those with high serum ferritin levels and high ferritin fluctuations, and an increase in adverse events in iron users. Clinical practice should avoid disproportionately high ESA or iron doses to achieve hemoglobin targets, particularly in those with significant comorbidity or ESA resistance.

### The FIND-CKD study – a randomized controlled trial of intravenous iron versus oral iron in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients: background and rationale [^111hGSoA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

CLINICAL RELEVANCE OF THE FIND-CKD RESULTS

An evidence-based approach to the use of iron therapy for the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in patients with ND-CKD has been hampered by a lack of randomized, controlled trials of sufficient size and duration. Additionally, the majority of trials have been performed in ND-CKD patients receiving ESA therapy and have used Hb response as their primary end point, and the limitations of this approach have become clear in recent years. A clinical trial such as FIND-CKD is therefore long overdue. The results of FIND-CKD are also likely to receive particular attention in light of safety concerns related to ESA therapy, particularly at high doses, and the 2012 KDIGO Anemia Guideline.

Unlike in haemodialysis patients where IV iron is universally recommended, there is currently no international consensus regarding which route of administration of iron therapy is more appropriate for the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in patients with ND-CKD. The choice of route of administration therefore often varies from country to country and from centre to centre, and indeed among individual nephrologists within the same centre. FIND-CKD will provide a robust comparison of the effectiveness and safety of the two routes of administration and help inform clinical practice in patients with ND-CKD not receiving ESA therapy. In addition, the study will examine whether the route of administration and dosing protocol has benefits beyond achieving certain laboratory targets, such as a significant impact on quality of life.

FIND-CKD will also evaluate the potential for IV iron therapy targeting pre-defined serum ferritin levels, and for oral iron, to delay, reduce or avoid ESA administration as well as other anaemia treatment options such as other iron therapy or blood transfusions. Avoiding or decreasing blood transfusions would be welcomed given the recent increase in blood transfusions that has occurred since the publication of CREATE, CHOIR and TREAT, coupled with the FDA-mandated change in the ESA label, as well as the risk of transfusion-induced sensitization to human leukocyte antigens with adverse effects on waiting time for transplantation and immunological status following transplant.

The study protocol specified that ESA therapy should not be initiated until the Hb level was < 10 g/dL, which is consistent with the latest guidance from KDIGO and the FDA. Using this contemporary protocol, particular attention will be paid to the proportion of subjects requiring ESA therapy, and whether the IV route of administration utilizing a high ferritin or low ferritin target compared with the oral route confers any additional benefit in terms of a reduction in the requirement for ESA therapy.

### A randomized controlled trial comparing intravenous ferric carboxymaltose with oral iron for treatment of iron deficiency anaemia of non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease patients [^1153RXRR]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Iron deficiency is frequently encountered in anaemic non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD) patients. Indeed, the prevalence of low iron indices such as transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels < 20% and ferritin levels < 100 ng/mL is 20–70%, depending on CKD stage. Moreover, iron deficiency is the most common cause of hyporesponsiveness to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA). On the other hand, iron supplementation improves iron indices and haemoglobin (Hb) concentration, and reduces the required ESA dose. Thus, correction of anaemia in CKD patients requires careful balance of the ESA and iron.

The current National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines recommend either oral or intravenous (IV) iron in iron-deficient, anaemic ND-CKD patients. Unfortunately, administration of oral iron is limited by poor gastrointestinal absorption and high rate of adverse events. Over 30% of patients may experience adverse events that result in dose reduction and/or non-adherence to treatment. Alternatively, available IV iron formulations are limited by the maximum dose that can be given in a single visit, although higher non-FDA approved doses have been given. The administration of the typical 1000-mg course would require at least 10 doses of iron dextran, 8 doses of ferric gluconate, 5 doses of iron sucrose or 2 doses of ferumoxytol, which can be both inconvenient and costly for patients and healthcare providers. Thus, there is a need for an IV iron agent that can be safely administered in large single doses, which require less frequent clinic visits and fewer venipunctures.

### Clinical practice guidelines for anemia in chronic kidney disease: problems and solutions. A position statement from kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) [^116P9nkG]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

The development of clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease has been instrumental in identifying and reducing variations in the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and iron replacement. Challenges to the effectiveness and safety of recommendations made in these guidelines were magnified when recent clinical trials showed no benefit or harm with respect to cardiovascular outcomes in subjects randomized to higher target hemoglobin levels. To address these concerns, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) convened an international conference to examine the problems and shortcomings of existing anemia guidelines, which are a prime example of duplication of efforts to derive recommendations from a limited evidence base. The meeting was attended by representatives of the major guideline developing organizations, who agreed to avoid future duplicative efforts and to save resources in generating a common evidence report, whose recommendations could then be prioritized and implemented locally. This is a report to the international nephrology community of the recommendations for and timeline of the next anemia guidelines. It has been reviewed by the conference participants and approved as a position statement by the KDIGO Board of Directors.

### Considerations for optimal iron use for anemia due to chronic kidney disease [^111KMZsJ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Availability of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) has improved the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Iron deficiency is the most common cause of resistance to rHuEPO therapy, contributing to ineffective erythropoiesis and hematocrit/hemoglobin values below the recommended target range (33%-36%/11–12 g/dL). I.v. iron supplementation is necessary to meet increased iron demands from stimulation of erythropoiesis and chronic blood loss; however, questions remain as to the optimal supplementation strategy to maintain appropriate yet safe iron status. Treatment guidelines for anemia management have been developed through the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-K/DOQI).

Objective

This review presents the basis of need for the NKF-K/DOQI guidelines and includes detailed information concerning iron physiology, metabolism, iron preparations, and evaluation of iron status.

Methods

This review was based on a MEDLINE search and complemented by references from the NKF-K/DOQI guidelines (whose review extended beyond MEDLINE). References focusing on normal iron physiology and metabolism, alterations in iron physiology in patients with CKD, laboratory evaluation methods, and strategies for iron supplementation were obtained from MEDLINE and reviewed for content.

Results

Controversy over appropriate use of iron supplementation has led to disparity in accepted practice procedures. Oral iron (ferrous salts and polysaccharide iron complex) and i.v. iron preparations (iron dextran, sodium ferric gluconate, and iron sucrose) are available. Problems with oral iron supplementation include limited absorption and patient noncompliance. Although most available data on i.v. iron use in the United States are specific to iron dextran preparations, published information based on clinical use of sodium ferric gluconate and iron sucrose products has been promising. The use of chronic i.v. iron administration to sustain iron stores has been more widely accepted to prevent development of absolute and functional iron deficiency.

Conclusions

Although iron therapy is commonly warranted in patients with CKD, questions remain as to the most favorable supplementation strategy to optimize therapy through improvements in hematocrits, efficient use of rHuEPO, and maintenance of appropriate and safe iron levels. Clinicians will need to devise strategies based on the compilation of information from clinical experience and the available literature. Clinical practice guidelines devised by the NKF-K/DOQI have provided a useful tool for the medical community using both these resources.

USE OF IV IRON IN NON-DIALYSIS CKD

There is currently no widely accepted consensus on whether IV or oral iron should be used as first-line therapy to replete iron stores and treat iron deficiency anaemia in patients with ND-CKD. The recent KDIGO Anemia Guideline, therefore, proposes a 1- to 3-month trial of oral iron therapy in ND-CKD and IV iron in patients receiving dialysis. The recent European Renal Best Practice position statement recommends a minimum 3-month trial of oral iron unless there is gastrointestinal intolerance, oral iron is ineffective, severe anaemia is present, or to preserve vascular access. While it is recognized that some patients may benefit from oral iron therapy, studies comparing oral with IV iron in ND-CKD populations have demonstrated that IV iron is superior to oral iron with regard to replenishing iron stores, and have shown a small but significant superiority to oral iron with regard to increasing Hb. These studies, however, have been relatively small and of short duration, such that the long-term safety and efficacy of either type of therapy has not been fully elucidated.

### Iron deficiency in chronic kidney disease: updates on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^115RRCTu]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Anemia is a complication that affects a majority of individuals with advanced CKD. Although relative deficiency of erythropoietin production is the major driver of anemia in CKD, iron deficiency stands out among the mechanisms contributing to the impaired erythropoiesis in the setting of reduced kidney function. Iron deficiency plays a significant role in anemia in CKD. This may be due to a true paucity of iron stores (absolute iron deficiency) or a relative (functional) deficiency which prevents the use of available iron stores. Several risk factors contribute to absolute and functional iron deficiency in CKD, including blood losses, impaired iron absorption, and chronic inflammation. The traditional biomarkers used for the diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) in patients with CKD have limitations, leading to persistent challenges in the detection and monitoring of IDA in these patients. Here, we review the pathophysiology and available diagnostic tests for IDA in CKD, we discuss the literature that has informed the current practice guidelines for the treatment of IDA in CKD, and we summarize the available oral and intravenous (IV) iron formulations for the treatment of IDA in CKD. Two important issues are addressed, including the potential risks of a more liberal approach to iron supplementation as well as the potential risks and benefits of IV versus oral iron supplementation in patients with CKD.

### Iron supplementation to treat anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease [^111uowxP]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and use of oral and intravenous iron in patients with CKD who do not require dialysis might obviate or delay the need for treatment with eythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Patients on hemodialysis have lower intestinal iron absorption, greater iron losses, and require greater iron turnover to maintain the ESA-driven red cell mass than do healthy individuals. In these patients, intravenous iron reduces ESA dose requirements and increases the likelihood of maintaining levels of hemoglobin within the desired range. Oral iron is inferior to intravenous iron in patients on hemodialysis, in part because elevated serum levels of hepcidin prevent intestinal absorption of iron. Increased levels of hepcidin also impair the normal recycling of iron through the reticuloendothelial system. Levels of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation below 450 pmol/l and 20%, respectively are indicative of iron deficiency, but values above the normal range lack diagnostic value in patients with CKD on dialysis. The availability of various iron preparations and new developments in delivering iron should enable adequate provision of iron to patients with CKD. This Review examines the efficacy, safety and use of iron supplementation therapy for the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD.

### FIND-CKD: a randomized trial of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose versus oral iron in patients with chronic kidney disease and iron deficiency anaemia [^115vWZEy]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

In patients receiving haemodialysis, IV iron has been shown to be significantly more effective than oral iron for replenishing depleted iron stores, improving Hb levels and reducing dosage requirements for ESAs. However, in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD, the evidence base supporting optimal iron management is notably inadequate, as demonstrated by both a recent meta-analysis of oral versus IV iron in this patient population which included only six studies and a Cochrane review, which included 10 studies of relatively small size and short duration. Both these reports, as well as the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease, stress the need for more robust clinical trials with longer follow-up in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD.

The Ferinject® assessment in patients with Iron deficiency anaemia and Non-Dialysis-dependent Chronic Kidney Disease (FIND-CKD) study assessed the 12-month efficacy and safety of IV ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) compared with oral iron to delay and/or reduce use of ESAs or other anaemia management options in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD, anaemia and iron deficiency not receiving an ESA. Iron therapy based on different ferritin targets has not been previously studied, therefore, two different treatment strategies were assessed using a dosing schema of IV FCM that was adjusted to achieve and maintain ferritin target levels that were either higher (400–600 µg/L) or lower (100–200 µg/L).

### Intravenous iron therapy in end-stage renal disease [^11786uRZ]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

Intravenous iron therapy is instrumental in the management of anemia in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Iron is available in several different preparations, with slight differences in the pharmacology of each. Given the importance of intravenous iron in the management of these patients, clinicians should be aware of the potential risks associated with it. Intravenous iron has effects on host immunity that raise concerns about clinical infection risk. Iron preparations appear to increase oxidative stress in these patients, which has important implications for cardiovascular disease states. Lastly, the effects of intravenous iron on liver disease are largely unknown.

### The FIND-CKD study – a randomized controlled trial of intravenous iron versus oral iron in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients: background and rationale [^1153u8hw]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Rigorous data are sparse concerning the optimal route of administration and dosing strategy for iron therapy with or without concomitant erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in patients with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD).

Methods

FIND-CKD was a 56-week, open-label, multicentre, prospective, randomized three-arm study (NCT00994318) of 626 patients with ND-CKD and iron deficiency anaemia randomized to (i) intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) at an initial dose of 1000 mg iron with subsequent dosing as necessary to target a serum ferritin level of 400–600 µg/L (ii) IV FCM at an initial dose of 200 mg with subsequent dosing as necessary to target serum ferritin 100–200 µg/L or (iii) oral ferrous sulphate 200 mg iron/day. The primary end point was time to initiation of other anaemia management (ESA therapy, iron therapy other than study drug or blood transfusion) or a haemoglobin (Hb) trigger (two consecutive Hb values < 10 g/dL without an increase of ≥ 0.5 g/dL).

Results

The background, rationale and study design of the trial are presented here. The study has been completed and results are expected in late 2013.

Discussion

FIND-CKD was the longest randomized trial of IV iron therapy to date. Its findings will address several unanswered questions regarding iron therapy to treat iron deficiency anaemia in patients with ND-CKD. It was also the first randomized trial to utilize both a high and low serum ferritin target range to adjust IV iron dosing, and the first not to employ Hb response as its primary end point.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^117T1Kr4]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

The benefits of treating iron deficiency in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and haemoglobin (Hb) > 120 g/L remain unclear. Trials in related populations provide mixed insights. The FAIR-HF trial showed that intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose improved patient-reported outcomes and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class in heart failure patients with iron deficiency, but its relevance to CKD populations is uncertain. Similarly, CONFIRM-HF demonstrated improved 6-minute walk test (6MWT) distances with ferric carboxymaltose, including in subgroups with reduced eGFR, but CKD-specific outcomes were not the focus.

The IRONMAN trial in heart failure reported a non-significant trend toward reduced hospitalisations and cardiovascular death with IV ferric derisomaltose (RR 0.82, p = 0.070). Trials such as Iron and Heart and Iron and Muscle, which specifically included CKD participants, found no significant improvements in 6MWT distance with IV iron. A systematic review of iron-deficient but non-anaemic adults associated iron supplementation with subjective fatigue improvements but not objective physical performance gains, though CKD-specific data was not assessed.

In haemodialysis (HD) populations, two randomised trials explored IV iron for restless leg syndrome (RLS), finding transient symptom improvement. A systematic review confirmed iron's benefit for RLS but noted increased, non-severe adverse events (RR 2.04). Guedes et al. linked low iron stores to poorer quality of life, increased mortality, and cardiovascular risk in non-dialysis CKD patients, with or without anaemia. Profound iron deficiency, defined as ferritin < 30 mcg/L and TSAT < 16%, has been suggested as a treatment threshold, but supporting data remain limited.

Oral iron supplementation may suffice for those with milder iron deficiency and preserved Hb, but in severe cases or when oral iron is ineffective, IV iron could be considered, especially for symptom relief or functional improvement. However, further research is needed to define thresholds and benefits in CKD-specific populations.

We recommend that resuscitative medication and personnel trained to evaluate and resuscitate be present in the event of anaphylaxis at each administration of intravenous iron. (1 A)

Guideline 2.6.1

Controlled trials
Meta-analysis of several trials
Cochrane systematic reviews.

Where evidence was available from the above sources, recommendations were based on these publications. Where there was a lack of evidence from high-quality studies, recommendations were based on current consensus and that was made clear in the document:

We also reviewed all related guidelines including those listed below:

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines (ng8).

Background

Anaemia is a common complication of CKD. It is associated with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, in addition to a reduction in exercise capacity and quality of life. The use of iron therapies and erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) has allowed improvement in patients with anaemia of CKD. Newer therapies are under study, but this guideline will not make recommendations on agents such as hypoxia inducible factor stabilisers or hepcidin modulators as data remains preliminary and none of these agents have received a UK marketing authorisation at the time of publication of this guideline.

### Intravenous versus oral iron supplementation for the treatment of anemia in CKD: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112DKcpB]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Iron supplementation is essential for the treatment of patients with anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is not clear which is the best method of iron administration.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis. A search was performed until January 2008 of MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, conference proceedings in nephrology, and reference lists of included trials.

Setting & Population

Patients with CKD (stages III to V). We included dialysis patients and patients with CKD not on dialysis therapy (hereafter referred to as patients with CKD).

Selection Criteria For Studies

We included all randomized controlled trials regardless of publication status or language.

Intervention

Intravenous (IV) versus oral iron supplementation.

Outcomes Measures

Primary outcomes assessed: absolute hemoglobin (Hb) level or change in Hb level from baseline. We also assessed all-cause mortality, erythropoiesis-stimulating agent requirement, adverse events, ferritin level, and need for renal replacement therapy in patients with CKD.

Results

13 trials were identified, 6 including patients with CKD and 7 including dialysis patients. Compared with oral iron, there was a significantly greater Hb level in dialysis patients treated with IV iron (weighted mean difference, 0.83 g/dL; 95% confidence interval, 0.09 to 1.57). Meta-regression showed a positive association between Hb level increase and IV iron dose administered and a negative association with baseline Hb level. For patients with CKD, there was a small but significant difference in Hb level favoring the IV iron group (weighted mean difference, 0. 31 g/dL; 95% confidence interval, 0.09 to 0. 53). Data for all-cause mortality were sparse, and there was no difference in adverse events between the IV- and oral-treated patients.

Limitations

There was significant heterogeneity between trials. Follow-up was limited to 2 to 3 months.

Conclusions

Our review shows that patients on hemodialysis therapy have better Hb level response when treated with IV iron. For patients with CKD, this effect is small.

### Iron dosing in kidney disease: inconsistency of evidence and clinical practice [^115Gg7am]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

The management of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is difficult. The availability of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) has increased treatment options for previously transfusion-requiring patients, but the recent evidence of ESA side effects has prompted the search for complementary or alternative approaches. Next to ESA, parenteral iron supplementation is the second main form of anemia treatment. However, as of now, no systematic approach has been proposed to balance the concurrent administration of both agents according to individual patient's needs. Furthermore, the potential risks of excessive iron dosing remain a topic of controversy. How, when and whether to monitor CKD patients for potential iron overload remain to be elucidated. This review addresses the question of risk and benefit of iron administration in CKD, highlights the evidence supporting current practice, provides an overview of standard and potential new markers of iron status and outlines a new pharmacometric approach to physiologically compatible individualized dosing of ESA and iron in CKD patients.

### Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose versus standard medical care in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease: a randomized, active-controlled, multi-center study [^1112MrfX]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Currently available intravenous (IV) iron agents vary in indication, dosing regimens and safety profiles. Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) is a stable, non-dextran-containing iron formulation developed for rapid IV administration in high doses with controlled delivery of iron into target tissues. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the safety of FCM compared with standard medical care (SMC) in dialysis (HD) and non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.

Methods

Adults 18–85 years of age with CKD were enrolled. NDD-CKD (n = 204) patients received an undiluted IV dose of FCM (15 mg/kg to a maximum of 1000 mg IV) and HD-CKD (n = 50) patients received an undiluted IV push of 200 mg ~30–60 min into the dialysis session. Subjects randomized to the SMC group (n = 259) received treatment determined by the investigator that could include oral iron, IV iron or no iron.

Results

Single doses of FCM of 200 mg in HD-CKD patients and up to 1000 mg in NDD-CKD patients were well tolerated. Incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events were similar between the groups: 30.3% (77 of 254) in the FCM group and 32.8% (85 of 259) in the SMC group. Incidences of serious adverse events were higher in the SMC group overall and in patients receiving iron sucrose or sodium ferric gluconate. There were no clinically significant differences in laboratory or clinical chemistry values or vital signs between the groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the FCM and SMC groups in indices of hemoglobin (Hb) improvement, including proportions of patients achieving a ≥ 1 g/dL increase in Hb and proportions of patients achieving Hb level of > 12 g/dL.

Conclusion

FCM in doses of 200 mg for HD-CKD patients and up to 1000 mg in NDD-CKD patients were well tolerated and displayed comparable efficacy to other IV iron formulations.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in CKD [^117WjGeS]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) Clinical Practice Guideline for Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease provides clinicians with comprehensive evidence-based recommendations to improve patient care. In this commentary, we review these recommendations and the underlying evidence. Most recommendations are well reasoned. For some, the evidence is unclear and recommendations require some qualification. While the KDIGO guideline stresses the potential risks of intravenous iron therapy, withholding iron might have its own risks. The recommendation to avoid hemoglobin levels falling below 9 g/dL sets a lower bound of "acceptability" that may increase blood transfusion. Given the lack of research supporting the optimal transfusion strategy for end-stage renal disease patients, it is difficult to weigh the risks and benefits of red blood cell transfusion. We find a paucity of evidence that hemoglobin concentration targeted between 11 and 11.5 g/dL is associated with a safety risk. Although the evidence that erythropoiesis-stimulating agent use improves patient quality of life is poor, it is possible that the instruments used to measure quality of life may not be well attuned to the needs of chronic kidney disease or dialysis patients. Our last section focuses specifically on the recommendations to treat anemia in children.

### FIND-CKD: a randomized trial of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose versus oral iron in patients with chronic kidney disease and iron deficiency anaemia [^113X8egV]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal iron therapy regimen in patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unknown.

Methods

Ferinject® assessment in patients with Iron deficiency anaemia and Non-Dialysis-dependent Chronic Kidney Disease (FIND-CKD) was a 56-week, open-label, multicentre, prospective and randomized study of 626 patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD, anaemia and iron deficiency not receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Patients were randomized (1:1:2) to intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), targeting a higher (400–600 µg/L) or lower (100–200 µg/L) ferritin or oral iron therapy. The primary end point was time to initiation of other anaemia management (ESA, other iron therapy or blood transfusion) or haemoglobin (Hb) trigger of two consecutive values < 10 g/dL during Weeks 8–52.

Results

The primary end point occurred in 36 patients (23.5%), 49 patients (32.2%) and 98 patients (31.8%) in the high-ferritin FCM, low-ferritin FCM and oral iron groups, respectively [hazard ratio (HR): 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44–0.95; P = 0.026 for high-ferritin FCM versus oral iron]. The increase in Hb was greater with high-ferritin FCM versus oral iron (P = 0.014) and a greater proportion of patients achieved an Hb increase ≥ 1 g/dL with high-ferritin FCM versus oral iron (HR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.52–2.72; P < 0.001). Rates of adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in all groups.

Conclusions

Compared with oral iron, IV FCM targeting a ferritin of 400–600 µg/L quickly reached and maintained Hb level, and delayed and/or reduced the need for other anaemia management including ESAs. Within the limitations of this trial, no renal toxicity was observed, with no difference in cardiovascular or infectious events.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to management of anemia, iron therapy, KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend to consider administering a trial of IV iron (or alternatively a 1–3 month trial of oral iron therapy in patients with non-dialysis CKD) in adult patients with CKD on ESA therapy not receiving iron supplementation if an increase in hemoglobin concentration or a decrease in ESA dose is desired and transferrin saturation is < 30% and ferritin is < 500 ng/mL.

### Should hemoglobin be normalized in patients with chronic kidney disease? [^116UZMd7]. Seminars in Dialysis (2002). Low credibility.

In the last decade the nephrology community has learned much about the impact of anemia on patients with kidney disease. Therapy of anemia can correct many of the symptoms which seriously compromise patient function. Despite the obvious benefits, controversy continues regarding the optimal target hemoglobin concentration both in patients prior to dialysis and in dialysis populations. In this editorial we review the clinical data that contribute to this controversy and the physiologic concepts underlying the treatment of anemia. Furthermore, we discuss the need to individualize hemoglobin targets for specific patient populations and the importance of early identification and treatment of anemia in patients with kidney disease. The economic impact of normalizing hemoglobin with the use of erythropoietin and intravenous or oral iron has affected clinical practice over the last decade. Current guidelines published by Kidney Disease Outcomes and Quality Initiative (KDOQI), the European Working Group on Anemia Management, and the Canadian Society of Nephrology all recommend target hemoglobin concentrations and thresholds for initiation of therapy and also suggest the need for reevaluation of current targets in light of new evidence. This editorial supports those guidelines and challenges the reader to critically evaluate current practice in the context of the accumulating data and the physiologic principles discussed herein. The therapy of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming increasingly sophisticated and is an essential component of care in patients with CKD. However, the effects of therapy will be most impressive when accompanied by the optimal care of all hemodynamic and metabolic abnormalities that are associated with CKD.

Anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — the commentary highlights that although KDIGO emphasizes risks of intravenous iron, withholding iron also has risks; it cautions that avoiding hemoglobin levels falling below 9 g/dL may increase transfusion, finds a paucity of evidence that targeting hemoglobin between 11 and 11.5 g/dL is associated with a safety risk, and notes poor evidence that erythropoiesis‑stimulating agents improve quality of life, making risk–benefit assessment of red blood cell transfusion difficult.

### Iron management in nondialysis-dependent CKD [^117VwcDJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency has been studied extensively in patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis therapy. However, few studies looked at iron treatment in the nondialysis chronic kidney disease population. Limited data suggest that iron deficiency is common in patients with chronic kidney disease with anemia; this lack of iron can hinder the effectiveness of erythropoiesis. The diagnosis of iron deficiency should involve clinical judgment, with an emphasis on clinical characteristics of the patient because of the limited amount of literature examining the interpretation of iron testing results. When iron deficiency is diagnosed in nondialysis patients with chronic kidney disease, a search must be initiated for any sources of blood loss. After addressing any blood loss, the preferred route of iron treatment must be determined. To date, no clear advantage was shown with intravenous versus oral administration in nondialysis patients, as shown in the hemodialysis setting. Thus, oral iron therapy may be a more reasonable option unless oral therapy previously failed. Additional research is needed to support evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of iron deficiency in the nondialysis chronic kidney disease population because this population differs from hemodialysis patients in the decreased extent of blood loss.

CURRENT CLINICAL QUESTIONS

Clinicians managing patients with ND-CKD and iron deficiency, with or without anaemia, currently lack of rigorous data to inform their decision-making regarding the timing and route of administration for iron therapy, the optimal serum ferritin and/or TSAT targets, and when to use ESA therapy. The FIND-CKD study was undertaken to address these important clinical questions and to assist the clinician in managing anaemia in their patients with ND-CKD. The study employed a rigorous study design that compared IV iron therapy targeting pre-defined serum ferritin levels versus oral iron therapy, in terms of preventing or delaying the use of other anaemia management therapies (e.g. ESA therapy, other iron therapy or blood transfusions) and a number of other clinically pertinent secondary end points. The study was also designed to address the question of whether targeting a higher or lower serum ferritin level with IV iron is more effective than oral iron.

14.2 Iron Deficiency Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease Not on Dialysis

Study KRX-0502–306 (NCT 02268994)

The efficacy of ferric citrate tablets for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adult patients with CKD not on dialysis was demonstrated in a 24-week study consisting of a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy period followed by an 8-week open-label safety extension period in which all patients remaining in the study, including the placebo group, received ferric citrate tablets. Patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m2, who were intolerant of or have had an inadequate therapeutic response to oral iron supplements, with Hgb ≥ 9.0 g/dL and ≤ 11.5 g/dL, serum ferritin ≤ 200 ng/mL and TSAT ≤ 25% were enrolled. Patients were randomized to treatment with either ferric citrate tablets (n = 117) or placebo (n = 117). Dosing with ferric citrate tablets or placebo was initiated at 3 tablets/day with meals. Dose titration could occur at Weeks 4, 8 and 12 during Randomized Period, and at Weeks 18 and 20 during Safety Extension Period based on Hgb response. Use of oral or intravenous iron, erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) was not permitted at any time during the study.

The mean age of the patients was 65 years (range 26 to 93); 63% were female, 69% Caucasian, 30% were African American and < 2% were other races.

The main efficacy outcome measure was the proportion of subjects achieving an increase in Hgb of ≥ 1.0 g/dL at any time point between baseline and the end of the 16-week Randomized Period.

During the 16-week randomized period 49% of subjects in the ferric citrate tablet arm and 15% of subjects in the placebo arm (p < 0.001) had a mean change in hemoglobin from baseline ≥ 0.75 g/dL over any 4-week time period provided that an increase of at least 1.0 g/dL had occurred during that 4-week period. Increases in mean hemoglobin (0.75 ± 0.09 g/dL), serum ferritin (163 ± 9 ng/mL) and transferrin saturation (18 ± 1%) were observed from baseline during the 16-week randomized period in the ferric citrate tablet arm.

Iron Deficiency Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease Not on Dialysis

Across two trials, 190 patients with CKD-NDD were treated with ferric citrate tablets. This included a study of 117 patients treated with ferric citrate tablets and 116 patients treated with placebo in a 16-week, randomized, double-blind period and a study of 75 patients treated with ferric citrate tablets and 73 treated with placebo in a 12-week randomized double-blind period. Dosage regimens in these trials ranged from 210 mg to 2,520 mg of ferric iron per day, equivalent to 1 to 12 tablets of ferric citrate.

Adverse reactions reported in at least 5% of patients treated with ferric citrate tablets in these trials are listed in Table 1.

During the 16-week, placebo-control trial, 12 patients (10%) on ferric citrate tablets discontinued study drug because of an adverse reaction, as compared to 10 patients (9%) in the placebo control arm. Diarrhea was the most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of ferric citrate tablets (2.6%).

Lay summary

Anaemia is a commonly diagnosed complication among people suffering with chronic kidney disease. If left untreated, it may affect quality of life. There are several causes for anaemia in this population. As the kidney function deteriorates, together with medications and dietary restrictions, people with chronic kidney disease may develop iron deficiency, resulting in reduction of iron supply to the bone marrow (which is the body organ responsible for the production of different blood elements). People with chronic kidney disease may not be able to use their own body's iron stores well and hence, many people, particularly those receiving haemodialysis, may need additional iron treatment, usually provided by injection.

With further weakening of kidney function, people with chronic kidney disease may need additional treatment with a substance called erythropoietin which drives the bone marrow to produce its own blood. This substance, which is naturally produced by the kidneys, becomes relatively deficient in people with chronic kidney disease. These people will eventually need treatment with erythropoietin or similar products that are given by injection.

Over the last few years, several iron and erythropoietin products (synthetic products and those stimulating the body's own erythropoietin) have been licensed for treating anaemia in people with chronic kidney disease. In addition, several publications discussed the benefits of each treatment and possible risks associated with long term treatment. The current guidelines provide advice to health care professionals on how to screen people with chronic kidney disease for anaemia, which people to investigate for other causes of anaemia, when and how to treat people with different medications, how to ensure safe prescribing and monitoring of treatment and how to diagnose and manage complications associated with anaemia and the drugs used for its treatment.

### Intravenous versus oral iron supplementation for the treatment of anemia in CKD: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Aqm9F]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Iron supplementation is crucial for the treatment of anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although intravenous (IV) iron is preferred for patients with CKD receiving dialysis (CKD stage 5D), the method of iron replacement for patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 is controversial.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis. A search was performed until October 2015 of MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, conference proceedings in nephrology, and reference lists of included trials.

Setting & Population

Patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 or 5D.

Selection Criteria For Studies

All randomized controlled trials, regardless of publication status or language.

Intervention

IV versus oral iron supplementation.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was defined as percentage of patients reaching an elevation in hemoglobin (Hb) concentration > 1g/dL. Secondary end points included percentage of patients who reached Hb levels > 11g/dL, absolute Hb concentration, change in Hb concentration, transferrin saturation, ferritin levels, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and blood transfusion requirement, and quality of life. Safety analysis included all-cause mortality and serious and all adverse events.

Results

24 trials were identified, 13 including 2,369 patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 and 11 including 818 patients with CKD stage 5D. Patients treated with IV iron were more likely to reach an Hb response > 1g/dL (risk ratios [RRs] of 1.61 [95% CI, 1.39–1.87] for CKD stages 3–5 and 2.14 [95% CI, 1.68–2.72] for CKD stage 5D). Safety analysis showed similar rates of mortality and serious and any adverse effects. IV iron replacement was associated with higher risk for hypotension (RR, 3.71; 95% CI, 1.74–7.94) and fewer gastrointestinal adverse events (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.28–0.67).

Limitations

Significant heterogeneity between trials; follow-up was usually limited to 3 months.

Conclusions

Our results agree with current recommendations for IV iron replacement for patients with CKD stage 5D and support increased use of IV iron for patients with CKD stages 3 to 5.

### Parenteral versus oral iron therapy for adults and children with chronic kidney disease [^115CjH7K]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The anaemia seen in chronic kidney disease (CKD) may be exacerbated by iron deficiency. Iron can be provided through different routes, with advantages and drawbacks of each route. It remains unclear whether the potential harms and additional costs of intravenous (IV) compared with oral iron are justified. This is an update of a review first published in 2012.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of IV iron supplementation compared with oral iron for anaemia in adults and children with CKD, including participants on dialysis, with kidney transplants and CKD not requiring dialysis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 7 December 2018 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in which IV and oral routes of iron administration were compared in adults and children with CKD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study eligibility, risk of bias, and extracted data. Results were reported as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes the mean difference (MD) was used or standardised mean difference (SMD) if different scales had been used. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model. Subgroup analysis and univariate meta-regression were performed to investigate between study differences. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 39 studies (3852 participants), 11 of which were added in this update. A low risk of bias was attributed to 20 (51%) studies for sequence generation, 14 (36%) studies for allocation concealment, 22 (56%) studies for attrition bias and 20 (51%) for selective outcome reporting. All studies were at a high risk of performance bias. However, all studies were considered at low risk of detection bias because the primary outcome in all studies was laboratory-based and unlikely to be influenced by lack of blinding. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that IV iron compared with oral iron makes any difference to death (all causes) (11 studies, 1952 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.64, 1.94) (absolute effect: 33 participants per 1000 with IV iron versus 31 per 1000 with oral iron), the number of participants needing to start dialysis (4 studies, 743 participants: RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.41, 1.61) or the number needing blood transfusions (5 studies, 774 participants: RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.55, 1.34) (absolute effect: 87 per 1,000 with IV iron versus 101 per 1,000 with oral iron). These analyses were assessed as having low certainty evidence. It is uncertain whether IV iron compared with oral iron reduces cardiovascular death because the certainty of this evidence was very low (3 studies, 206 participants: RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.41 to 7.18). Quality of life was reported in five studies with four reporting no difference between treatment groups and one reporting improvement in participants treated with IV iron. IV iron compared with oral iron may increase the numbers of participants, who experience allergic reactions or hypotension (15 studies, 2607 participants: RR 3.56, 95% CI 1.88 to 6.74) (absolute harm: 24 per 1000 with IV iron versus 7 per 1000) but may reduce the number of participants with all gastrointestinal adverse effects (14 studies, 1986 participants: RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.66) (absolute benefit: 150 per 1000 with IV iron versus 319 per 1000). These analyses were assessed as having low certainty evidence. IV iron compared with oral iron may increase the number of participants who achieve target haemoglobin (13 studies, 2206 participants: RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.04) (absolute benefit: 542 participants per 1,000 with IV iron versus 317 per 1000 with oral iron), increased haemoglobin (31 studies, 3373 participants: MD 0.72 g/dL, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.05); ferritin (33 studies, 3389 participants: MD 224.84 µg/L, 95% CI 165.85 to 283.83) and transferrin saturation (27 studies, 3089 participants: MD 7.69%, 95% CI 5.10 to 10.28), and may reduce the dose required of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) (11 studies, 522 participants: SMD -0.72, 95% CI -1.12 to -0.31) while making little or no difference to glomerular filtration rate (8 studies, 1052 participants: 0.83 mL/min, 95% CI -0.79 to 2.44). All analyses were assessed as having low certainty evidence. There were moderate to high degrees of heterogeneity in these analyses but in meta-regression, definite reasons for this could not be determined.

Authors' Conclusions

The included studies provide low certainty evidence that IV iron compared with oral iron increases haemoglobin, ferritin and transferrin levels in CKD participants, increases the number of participants who achieve target haemoglobin and reduces ESA requirements. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether IV iron compared with oral iron influences death (all causes), cardiovascular death and quality of life though most studies reported only short periods of follow-up. Adverse effects were reported in only 50% of included studies. We therefore suggest that further studies that focus on patient-centred outcomes with longer follow-up periods are needed to determine if the use of IV iron is justified on the basis of reductions in ESA dose and cost, improvements in patient quality of life, and with few serious adverse effects.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in chronic kidney disease: 2007 update of hemoglobin target [^112ppsbt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Criteria for updating KDOQI anemia guidelines — triggers and surrogate endpoint considerations: An update is prompted when there is new evidence on important clinical outcomes, when evidence comes from studies adequately powered for the outcomes of interest, and when the new evidence would be likely to change the magnitude of the estimate of the effect or change the assessment of the balance of benefits and harms. Evidence from surrogate end point trials can prompt an update if criteria from the Users' Guide for a Surrogate End Point Trial are met, but the Dialysis Patients' Response to IV Iron with Elevated Ferritin (DRIVE) study did not initiate an update because it examined a surrogate outcome (change in Hb) after short follow-up duration (6 weeks).

### Kidney disease: improving global outcomes guidelines on anaemia management in chronic kidney disease: a European renal best practice position statement [^116GXUQA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Recently, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group has produced comprehensive clinical practice guidelines for the management of anaemia in CKD patients. These guidelines addressed all of the important points related to anaemia management in CKD patients, including therapy with erythropoieis stimulating agents (ESA), iron therapy, ESA resistance and blood transfusion use. Because most guidelines were 'soft' rather than 'strong', and because global guidelines need to be adapted and implemented into the regional context where they are used, on behalf of the European Renal Best Practice Advisory Board some of its members, and other external experts in this field, who were not participants in the KDIGO guidelines group, were invited to participate in this anaemia working group to examine and comment on the KDIGO documents in this position paper. In this article, the group concentrated only on those guidelines which we considered worth amending or adapting. All guidelines not specifically mentioned are fully endorsed.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in chronic kidney disease: 2007 update of hemoglobin target [^115Mqgvq]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI anemia guidelines — iron status thresholds — specify TSAT > 20% or CHr > 29 pg/cell and ferritin > 200 ng/mL in hemodialysis chronic kidney disease (HD-CKD), and TSAT > 20% and ferritin > 100 ng/mL in non-dialysis and peritoneal dialysis CKD (ND-CKD, PD-CKD); they also state insufficient evidence to recommend intravenous iron if ferritin > 500 ng/mL. The prescribing information lists TSAT > 20%, Ferritin > 100 ng/mL prior to Epogen.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^112gMnEy]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to ESAs, initiation, UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend to do not initiate ESA therapy in the presence of absolute iron deficiency (ferritin < 100 mcg/L in non-dialysis dependent CKD and < 200 mcg/L in dialysis-dependent CKD) or functional iron deficiency (transferrin saturation < 20% with normal or elevated ferritin levels) until corrected and anemia persists. Administer iron supplements prior to or when initiating ESAs.

### Ironing out the phosphorus problem [^1112rrmH]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Control of serum phosphorus remains a vexing problem in chronic kidney disease. Although novel dialysis regimens may provide excellent phosphorus control, phosphate binders remain necessary for most dialysis patients. Block et al. present a phase I clinical trial examining the safety and efficacy of SBR759, a novel non-calcium, iron-based phosphate binder. Although the risks of iron accumulation and hypocalcemia must be addressed, this phosphate binder appears to be well tolerated and effective and offers a powder-based formulation.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^1139N9TR]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to iron therapy, route of administration, UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering high-dose, low-frequency IV iron therapy in patients not receiving in-center hemodialysis as the treatment of choice for achieving iron repletion. Evaluate the availability of venous access, patient preferences, nursing and administration costs, cost of local drug supply, and provision of resuscitation facilities.

### Iron management in chronic kidney disease: conclusions from a "Kidney disease: improving global outcomes" (KDIGO) controversies conference [^113fcTaF]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Before the introduction of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in 1989, repeated transfusions given to patients with end-stage renal disease caused iron overload, and the need for supplemental iron was rare. However, with the widespread introduction of ESAs, it was recognized that supplemental iron was necessary to optimize hemoglobin response and allow reduction of the ESA dose for economic reasons and recent concerns about ESA safety. Iron supplementation was also found to be more efficacious via intravenous compared to oral administration, and the use of intravenous iron has escalated in recent years. The safety of various iron compounds has been of theoretical concern due to their potential to induce iron overload, oxidative stress, hypersensitivity reactions, and a permissive environment for infectious processes. Therefore, an expert group was convened to assess the benefits and risks of parenteral iron, and to provide strategies for its optimal use while mitigating the risk for acute reactions and other adverse effects.

### A randomized trial of intravenous and oral iron in chronic kidney disease [^116gHU3g]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Although iron is commonly used to correct iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in chronic kidney disease (CKD), its effect on kidney function is unclear. To assess this, we randomly assigned patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD and IDA to either open-label oral ferrous sulfate (69 patients to 325mg three times daily for 8 weeks) or intravenous iron sucrose (67 patients to 200mg every 2 weeks, total 1g). The primary outcome was the between-group difference in slope of measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) change over two years. The trial was terminated early on the recommendation of an independent data and safety monitoring board based on little chance of finding differences in mGFR slopes, but a higher risk of serious adverse events in the intravenous iron treatment group. mGFR declined similarly over two years in both treatment groups (oral -3.6ml/min per 1.73m(2), intravenous -4.0ml/min per 1.73m(2), between-group difference -0.35ml/min per 1.73m(2); 95% confidence interval -2.9 to 2.3). There were 36 serious cardiovascular events among 19 participants assigned to the oral iron treatment group and 55 events among 17 participants of the intravenous iron group (adjusted incidence rate ratio 2.51 (1.56–4.04)). Infections resulting in hospitalizations had a significant adjusted incidence rate ratio of 2.12 (1.24–3.64). Thus, among non-dialyzed patients with CKD and IDA, intravenous iron therapy is associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events, including those from cardiovascular causes and infectious diseases.

### Ferric citrate dosing in iron deficiency anemia in nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease [^1119c5k3]. American Journal of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ferric citrate (FC) is indicated as an oral iron replacement for iron deficiency anemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not on dialysis. The recommended starting dose is one 1-g tablet three times daily (TID). This study investigated long-term efficacy and safety of different FC dosing regimens for treating anemia in nondialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD).

Methods

In this phase 4, randomized, open-label, multicenter study, patients with anemia with NDD-CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate, ≥ 20 mL/min and < 60 mL/min) were randomized 1:1 to one FC tablet (1-g equivalent to 210 mg ferric iron) TID (3 g/day) or 2 tablets twice daily (BID; 4 g/day). At week 12, dosage was increased to 2 tablets TID (6 g/day) or 3 tablets BID (6 g/day) in patients whose hemoglobin (Hb) levels increased < 0.5 g/dL or were < 10 g/dL. Primary endpoint was mean change in Hb from baseline to week 24.

Results

Of 484 patients screened, 206 were randomized and 205 received FC. Mean (standard deviation) changes from baseline in Hb at week 24 were 0.77 (0.84) g/dL with FC TID 3 g/day and 0.70 (0.98) g/dL with FC BID 4 g/day.

Discussion/Conclusions

FC administered BID and TID for 48 weeks was safe and effective for treating anemia in this population, supporting potentially increased dosing flexibility.

### Iron metabolism, iron deficiency, thrombocytosis, and the cardiorenal anemia syndrome [^114TSdc5]. The Oncologist (2009). Low credibility.

In treating moderate to severe anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD), oral iron is effective only in a minority of nondialysis patients. Intravenous iron is more effective and can raise levels of hemoglobin even without the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Unfortunately, the current assays of iron status that are presently widely available are not especially helpful in predicting response. In patients on dialysis, i.v. iron is effective over a wide range of serum ferritin from < 100 ng/ml to 800 ng/ml. None of the three available randomized controlled trials comparing oral with i.v. iron showed evidence of nephrotoxicity caused by i.v. iron. Iron deficiency is a risk factor for thrombocytosis and should, wherever possible, be avoided. Optimal coadministration of iron may reduce the risk for ESA-driven cardiovascular events. Increased total body iron stores (imperfectly reflected by serum ferritin levels in CKD) do not appear to be related to such events or hospitalization in CKD; it is unclear what other risk factors and mechanisms need to be considered. In the appreciable proportion of patients with both renal and cardiac dysfunction, management is further complicated by a vicious circle (which can be characterized as cardiorenal anemia syndrome) in which CKD, heart failure, and anemia exacerbate each other. In such patients, correction of anemia appears to improve cardiac function and quality of life without a greater risk for adverse events.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in CKD [^1119BMZZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Use of iron agents for anemia treatment in CKD — prescribing guidance states: When prescribing iron therapy, balance the potential benefits of avoiding or minimizing blood transfusions, ESA therapy, and anemia-related symptoms against the risk of harm in individual patients (e.g., anaphylactoid and other acute reactions, unknown long-term risks) (Not Graded). For adult CKD patients with anemia not on iron or ESA therapy, we suggest a trial of IV iron (or in CKD ND patients alternatively a 1–3 month trial of oral iron therapy) if (2C).

### Iron therapy challenges for the treatment of nondialysis CKD patients [^111a7TxE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical consequences of untreated, severe anemia in patients with nondialysis CKD can be significant, but disparities exist in the anemia treatment guidelines and position papers issued from working groups and associations across the world. These differ in hemoglobin target and iron levels and their emphasis on various iron markers and other clinical outcomes. Not surprisingly, disparities are observed in anemia treatment strategies among patients with nondialysis CKD across different areas of the world. Over the past decade, the prescription and dosage of both iron therapies and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents have shifted, with notable regional differences observed. Moreover, there is ongoing debate regarding oral versus intravenous administration of iron. Compared with oral iron therapy, which often leads to gastrointestinal adverse events, low patient adherence, and low efficacy, intravenous iron administration has been associated with potential serious adverse events, such as anaphylaxis. New iron-based compounds and drugs currently under development are reviewed to describe their potential benefits in the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD. New oral compounds, including iron-based phosphate binders, heme iron polypeptide, and liposomal iron, show different rates of absorption with possibly different efficacy and improved tolerability. These new potential therapies offer health care providers additional anemia treatment options for their patients with CKD; however, the management of anemia in the CKD population continues to present challenges that require prospective studies to identify the optimal iron therapy for patients.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^1134XF2R]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Oral iron remains an inexpensive and simple treatment option but switching to IV iron is reasonable in patients with CKD who do not respond to or cannot tolerate oral iron. Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral and IV iron supplementation in participants with advanced non-dialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD) receiving concomitant ESA therapy found no significant differences in Hb or ESA dose requirements between groups. The first study of 45 participants (Hb < 110 g/L) compared ferrous sulphate 200 mg three times daily with monthly IV iron sucrose 300 mg over 5.2 months and reported similar Hb outcomes, although iron stores were greater in the IV group. Confounding factors included a higher prevalence of diabetes and ACEi/ARB use in the oral iron group. Similarly, a second study of 96 participants compared 5 weeks of IV iron sucrose (200 mg weekly) with 29 days of oral ferrous sulphate 325 mg three times daily. Again, Hb and ESA dose requirements were comparable, but ferritin levels increased more in the IV group, which also had fewer gastrointestinal side effects, such as constipation (34.5% vs. 12.5%) and nausea (10.4% vs. 4.2%).

### Iron therapy in anaemic adults without chronic kidney disease [^113pUnSK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Anaemia affects about a quarter of the world's population. An estimated 50% of anaemic people have anaemia due to iron deficiency.

Objectives

To assess the safety and efficacy of iron therapies for the treatment of adults with anaemia who are not pregnant or lactating and do not have chronic kidney disease.

Search Methods

We ran the search on 11 July 2013. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, EMBASE (Ovid SP), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) Plus (EBSCO Host), the Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science (ISI WOS) Scientific Citation Index (SCI)-EXPANDED (1970) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI)-Science (1990) and Clinicaltrials.gov; we also screened reference lists. An updated search was run on 24 November 2014 but the results have not yet been incorporated into the review.

Selection Criteria

Two review authors independently selected references for further assessment by going through all titles and abstracts. Further selection was based on review of full-text articles for selected references.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted study data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for binary outcomes and the mean difference (MD) or the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We performed meta-analysis when possible, when I(2) was less than or equal to 80% using a fixed-effect or random-effects model, using Review Manager software. The range of point estimates for individual studies is presented when I(2) > 80%.

Main Results

We included in this systematic review 4745 participants who were randomly assigned in 21 trials. Trials were conducted in a wide variety of clinical settings. Most trials included participants with mild to moderate anaemia and excluded participants who were allergic to iron therapy. All trials were at high risk of bias for one or more domains. We compared both oral iron and parenteral iron versus inactive controls and compared different iron preparations. The comparison between oral iron and inactive control revealed no evidence of clinical benefit in terms of mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.61; four studies, N = 659; very low-quality evidence). The point estimate of the mean difference in haemoglobin levels in individual studies ranged from 0.3 to 3.1 g/dL higher in the oral iron group than in the inactive control group. The proportion of participants who required blood transfusion was lower with oral iron than with inactive control (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.99; three studies, N = 546; very low-quality evidence). Evidence was inadequate for determination of the effect of parenteral iron on mortality versus oral iron (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.56 to 3.94; 10 studies, N = 2141; very low-quality evidence) or inactive control (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.69; six studies, N = 1009; very low-quality evidence). Haemoglobin levels were higher with parenteral iron than with oral iron (MD -0.50 g/dL, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.27; six studies, N = 769; very low-quality evidence). The point estimate of the mean difference in haemoglobin levels in individual studies ranged between 0.3 and 3.0 g/dL higher in the parenteral iron group than in the inactive control group. Differences in the proportion of participants requiring blood transfusion between parenteral iron and oral iron groups (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.58; two studies, N = 371; very low-quality evidence) or between parenteral iron groups and inactive controls (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.06; eight studies, N = 1315; very low-quality evidence) were imprecise. Average blood volume transfused was less in the parenteral iron group than in the oral iron group (MD -0.54 units, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.12; very low-quality evidence) based on one study involving 44 people. Differences between therapies in quality of life or in the proportion of participants with serious adverse events were imprecise (very low-quality evidence). No trials reported severe allergic reactions due to parenteral iron, suggesting that these are rare. Adverse effects related to oral iron treatment included nausea, diarrhoea and constipation; most were mild. Comparisons of one iron preparation over another for mortality, haemoglobin or serious adverse events were imprecise. No information was available on quality of life. Thus, little evidence was found to support the use of one preparation or regimen over another. Subgroup analyses did not reveal consistent results; therefore we were unable to determine whether iron is useful in specific clinical situations, or whether iron therapy might be useful for people who are receiving erythropoietin.

Authors' Conclusions

- Very low-quality evidence suggests that oral iron might decrease the proportion of people who require blood transfusion, and no evidence indicates that it decreases mortality. Oral iron might be useful in adults who can tolerate the adverse events, which are usually mild.• Very low-quality evidence suggests that intravenous iron results in a modest increase in haemoglobin levels compared with oral iron or inactive control without clinical benefit.• No evidence can be found to show any advantage of one iron preparation or regimen over another.• Additional randomised controlled trials with low risk of bias and powered to measure clinically useful outcomes such as mortality, quality of life and blood transfusion requirements are needed.
