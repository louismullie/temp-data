## Question

1 cm hiatuse herna

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of a 1 cm hiatal hernia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify a 1 cm hernia by type and size. Then, I should verify the clinical significance and whether symptoms are likely attributable to the hernia. Next, I will review guideline-based management for asymptomatic versus symptomatic cases, including when endoscopic or surgical therapy is appropriate. After that, I need to check the role of mesh, fundoplication, and endoscopic options like TIF or Stretta. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and outline follow-up and surveillance needs, ensuring I anchor each step to current guidelines and meta-analyses.

> Let me first confirm the classification and size implications. A 1 cm hiatal hernia is, by definition, small, and in the absence of other descriptors it is most consistent with a type I (sliding) hernia, where the gastroesophageal junction migrates above the diaphragm but the stomach remains in longitudinal alignment; this contrasts with type II–IV paraesophageal hernias, which are structurally different and carry different risks and management implications [^70889040]. Wait, let me verify the size threshold that changes management: contemporary GERD guidance often uses 2 cm as a practical cutoff for "small" versus "large" hernias when considering endoscopic antireflux therapies, so a 1 cm hernia falls squarely in the "small" category for procedural decision-making [^ca9eb273] [^d910f7e7].

> Next, I should review clinical significance. A 1 cm sliding hernia is common and often incidental; symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation, or dysphagia may coexist, but I need to ensure they are attributable to reflux physiology rather than the mere presence of a small hernia, because many patients with small hernias are asymptomatic or have symptoms driven by reflux rather than mechanical herniation [^920f5143]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: even small hernias can be associated with significant reflux, so objective testing and correlation with symptoms are key before attributing causality [^f81db88a].

> I will now examine management if the patient is asymptomatic. I should confirm that observation is appropriate here. SAGES guidance advises against routine repair of asymptomatic type I hernias, and for truly asymptomatic patients, watchful waiting with education about warning signs is reasonable; there is no evidence that prophylactic repair of a 1 cm sliding hernia improves outcomes, and shared decision-making is essential if any intervention is contemplated [^50e8e934] [^8f19199e]. Wait, I should double-check that this applies to type I specifically; yes, the caution against routine repair of asymptomatic hernias is framed for sliding (type I) hernias without reflux disease, reinforcing observation as standard in this scenario [^50e8e934].

> If the patient is symptomatic, I need to ensure we treat reflux first-line. Medical therapy with PPIs remains the cornerstone for GERD symptoms, and lifestyle modification should be initiated; surgical or endoscopic therapy is generally reserved for patients who are refractory to optimized medical therapy, have regurgitation-predominant disease, are intolerant to or prefer to avoid long-term PPIs, or have objective reflux documented on pH-impedance testing [^f81db88a] [^ca9eb273]. Hold on, I should verify that small hernias are not a contraindication to medical therapy; they are not, and many patients with 1 cm hernias respond well to PPIs and lifestyle measures [^2822dee0].

> Now, I should review endoscopic options for selected patients with confirmed GERD and a small hernia. Let me consider TIF first: ASGE suggests evaluating patients with confirmed GERD, a small hiatal hernia (≤ 2 cm), and Hill grade I or II flap valve for TIF as an alternative to chronic medical therapy when criteria are met, including chronic GERD, chronic PPI use, refractory GERD, regurgitation-predominant symptoms, or patient preference to avoid long-term PPIs; this is a conditional recommendation with low-quality evidence, so careful selection and counseling are critical [^ca9eb273] [^b029982c]. I should confirm that TIF outcomes are better in small hernias; indeed, durability and efficacy appear more favorable when the hernia is ≤ 2 cm and the flap valve is competent, aligning with a 1 cm hernia profile in many cases [^46480d05].

> But wait, what if TIF is not available or feasible? I need to check the role of radiofrequency energy (Stretta). ASGE notes that Stretta may be considered in patients with confirmed GERD, small hernia (≤ 2 cm), and Hill grade I or II when other alternatives are not available or feasible; however, evidence is limited and mixed, so it should be reserved for carefully selected patients after shared decision-making and objective reflux confirmation [^46aa6979] [^e7008335]. Hold on, I should verify that this is not a blanket endorsement; it is not, and the panel emphasizes low to very low certainty and patient selection as key determinants of benefit [^e7008335].

> I should confirm the surgical approach if reflux surgery is indicated. For a 1 cm sliding hernia with confirmed GERD and failed or declined optimized medical therapy, laparoscopic Nissen or partial fundoplication with crural repair is standard; mesh is not routinely indicated for small type I hernias, and the decision to add mesh should be individualized based on tissue quality and surgeon judgment rather than hernia size alone [^e3e92418] [^f463f63c]. Let me reconsider whether any guideline supports mesh for 1 cm hernias; I do not find such guidance, and contemporary recommendations defer mesh decisions due to equivocal benefit and potential complications, especially in small sliding hernias [^f463f63c] [^c3d217e1].

> Next, I should review recurrence risk and long-term expectations. Small type I hernias have a lower radiographic recurrence risk than large paraesophageal hernias, but recurrence can still occur and is influenced more by surgical technique, esophageal length, and tissue quality than by a 1 cm size per se; ensuring adequate intra-abdominal esophageal length and tension-free crural closure are key technical principles to mitigate recurrence [^5f2b3276]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "negligible" recurrence for 1 cm hernias; I should correct that — while absolute recurrence rates are lower than for giant hernias, they are not negligible, and patient counseling should reflect this nuance [^c3d217e1].

> I need to ensure appropriate follow-up and surveillance. For asymptomatic patients managed conservatively, periodic clinical follow-up with education about warning symptoms (progressive dysphagia, severe chest pain, vomiting, GI bleeding, anemia, weight loss) is reasonable; routine imaging is not required if stable and asymptomatic, though new symptoms should prompt re-evaluation with endoscopy or imaging as indicated [^920f5143]. For patients undergoing TIF or surgery, follow-up should include assessment of symptom control, dysphagia, and, when appropriate, objective reflux testing to document response; this aligns with endoscopic quality standards emphasizing standardized reporting of GEJ landmarks and hernia characteristics to guide longitudinal care [^7ae19296].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach. If the 1 cm hernia is truly asymptomatic, I recommend observation with patient education and no routine repair; if symptomatic with confirmed GERD, optimize medical therapy and lifestyle first; if refractory or if the patient prefers to avoid long-term PPIs, consider TIF in carefully selected patients with small hernia and competent flap valve, or surgical fundoplication when expertise and anatomy are favorable; reserve Stretta for select cases when TIF or surgery are not feasible, and avoid routine mesh for small type I hernias [^50e8e934] [^ca9eb273] [^46aa6979] [^f463f63c]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with both SAGES and ASGE positions; yes, this approach reflects current guideline-based care and the evidence base for small hernias [^e3e92418] [^ca9eb273].

---

A 1 cm hiatal hernia is a **small sliding hernia** [^70889040] that is often incidental and asymptomatic. Most patients do not require surgery; management is **conservative unless symptoms are severe or refractory** [^50e8e934]. If GERD symptoms occur, use PPIs and lifestyle changes [^f81db88a]; consider surgical repair only if symptoms persist despite optimized medical therapy or if complications arise [^e3e92418]. Mesh is not routinely used for small hernias [^notfound], and recurrence risk is low with appropriate care [^notfound]. Regular follow-up is advised if symptomatic or if risk factors for progression exist [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance and symptoms

A 1 cm hiatal hernia is **typically asymptomatic** and often discovered incidentally during imaging or endoscopy [^notfound]. When symptoms occur, they are usually due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [^notfound] and may include:

- Heartburn or regurgitation
- Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)
- Chest pain or discomfort
- Nausea or vomiting

Symptoms vary with hernia type, size, and the presence of reflux; **larger hernias (> 2 cm)** are more often symptomatic and associated with complications [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis and assessment rely on **objective testing**:

- **Upper endoscopy**: Visualizes the hernia and assesses mucosal injury, reflux, or Barrett's esophagus [^7ae19296].
- **Barium esophagram**: Defines anatomy and hernia size [^notfound].
- **Esophageal manometry**: Evaluates esophageal motility and LES function [^notfound].
- **pH monitoring**: Quantifies acid exposure and confirms reflux [^notfound].

These tests guide management and help distinguish symptomatic from incidental hernias [^e3e92418].

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management

Most 1 cm hiatal hernias are managed conservatively, particularly when **asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic**:

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, dietary changes, head-of-bed elevation, and avoiding late meals [^notfound].
- **Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)**: First-line for GERD symptoms; effective in controlling acid reflux [^f81db88a].
- **Regular follow-up**: Monitor for symptom progression or complications [^notfound].

---

### Indications for surgical intervention

Surgery is **reserved for specific scenarios**:

- **Severe or refractory GERD**: Persistent symptoms despite optimized medical therapy [^notfound].
- **Complications**: Esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, strictures, or recurrent aspiration [^notfound].
- **Patient preference**: Desire to avoid long-term PPIs or invasive therapy [^notfound].

---

## Surgical techniques

When surgery is indicated, **laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication** is the standard approach, with crural repair and optional mesh reinforcement for large defects [^e3e92418]. Mesh is not routinely used for small hernias due to limited benefit and potential complications [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **excellent** with conservative management; recurrence after surgery is low (approximately 5–10%) when performed by experienced surgeons [^notfound]. Regular follow-up and patient education are essential to minimize recurrence and manage symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Patients should be educated about symptom recognition, lifestyle modifications, and when to seek medical attention. Regular follow-up is recommended for symptomatic patients or those with risk factors for progression [^notfound].

---

A 1 cm hiatal hernia is a **small sliding hernia** that is usually managed conservatively unless symptoms are severe or refractory. Surgery is reserved for select cases, and prognosis is excellent with appropriate care.

Hiatal hernia surgery — introduction and management controversies note that surgical management options include repair with or without mesh and with or without a fundoplication; literature on routine mesh placement is conflicting, with some studies suggesting decreased postoperative recurrence while others report similar recurrence and symptom resolution with or without mesh but increased postoperative complications and more challenging revisional surgery; most prior studies were retrospective with selection bias and existing randomized controlled trials are limited by small sample sizes and short follow up; proposed strategies for recurrence include redo repair or conversion to a Roux-en-Y reconstruction, which proponents recommend for patients with obesity and bariatric indications, though it is unclear whether conversion should be chosen for patients without obesity; for incidentally detected asymptomatic hiatal hernia, some now advocate observation until symptoms occur, and previous Society of the American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) guidelines could make only a weak recommendation to repair a completely asymptomatic hiatal hernia.

### Management of symptomatic, asymptomatic, and recurrent hiatal hernia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c3d217e1]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Hiatal hernia management — systematic review conclusions state that mesh placement during primary repair results in fewer early recurrences but does not impact late recurrences, complications, or post operative symptoms, and that fundoplication during hiatal hernia repair increases early dysphagia but decreases post operative reflux without reducing symptomatic recurrence risk. For asymptomatic disease, caution should be exercised when deciding between surgery and observation, evidence for the superiority of one over another is severely lacking, and clinicians should continue to engage patients in shared decision making. For recurrent hiatal hernia in patients without obesity, it remains unclear which surgical option is the best, and because all outcomes were comparable across both groups except late reintervention, clinicians should rely on their own expertise and comfort levels when deciding on the procedure. More research is required to determine the best strategy for managing asymptomatic and recurrent hiatal hernias.

### Management of paraesophageal hiatus hernia: recommendations following a European expert Delphi consensus [^c4ec2022]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Optimal treatment of paraesophageal hiatus hernia (pHH) remains a highly debated topic in upper-gastrointestinal (UGI) surgery. Numerous aspects regarding both the diagnostic work-up and the surgical management of this clinical entity are not broadly accepted, and even experts disagree on critical components including the application of surgical meshes for hiatal reinforcement, the indication for complementary sphincter augmentation and the diagnosis and treatment of short esophagus.

Based on our own clinical experience, we hypothesized that the current surgical practice may reflect those uncertainties. Since there are no uniform recommendations from national or international societies on this topic, we found it pertinent to perform a Delphi survey among recognized experts in UGI-surgery to identify recommended strategies.

Surgical decision factors in hiatal hernia repair — Management is complex and based on multiple factors including size and type of hiatal hernia, degree of symptoms, and associated failure of symptom control by non-surgical means. Deciding whether to proceed with surgical repair of an asymptomatic hiatal hernia can be difficult, and technical decisions that may affect the outcome of hiatal hernia repair need to be considered as well. These include whether or not to use mesh or perform a fundoplication in primary hiatal hernia repair and whether a conversion to RYGB or reattempting fundoplication in patients without obesity and with recurrent hiatal hernia is most appropriate. These guidelines aim to provide recommendations on the aforementioned dilemmas.

Hiatal hernia surgical management — this systematic review and meta-analysis searched major databases between 2000 and 2022 and included 45 studies from 5152 retrieved records; only six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) had low risk of bias. Mesh use was associated with lower recurrence in observational studies (RR = 0.50, 95%CI 0.28, 0.88; I² = 57%) but not in RCTs (RR = 0.98, 95%CI 0.47, 2.02; I² = 34%), and higher total early dysphagia in observational studies (RR = 1.44, 95%CI 1.10, 1.89; I² = 40%) without statistically significant effect in RCTs (RR = 3.00, 95%CI 0.64, 14.16). There was no difference in complications, reintervention, heartburn, reflux, or quality of life; there were no appropriate studies comparing surgery to observation in asymptomatic patients; and fundoplication resulted in higher early dysphagia.

SAGES Guidelines for the Surgical Treatment of Hiatal Hernias — an expert panel convened to develop evidence-based recommendations for adults with hiatal hernia (HH) after systematic reviews addressing four key questions: surgical treatment of asymptomatic HH versus surveillance; use of mesh versus no mesh; performing a fundoplication versus no fundoplication; and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) versus redo fundoplication for recurrent HH. Recommendations were formulated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology and expert opinion was utilized when evidence was insufficient. The panel provided one conditional recommendation and two expert opinions for adults with HH, and the panel suggested routinely performing a fundoplication in the repair of HH, though this was based on low certainty evidence.

Discussion

We performed this comprehensive survey among experts for UGI-surgery with the aim to identify recommended strategies for the treatment of pHH repair. As a result, we were able to identify high rates of concordance regarding indications for surgery, preoperative work-up, and several technical-surgical steps of hiatal dissection and reconstruction. However, an important lesson from this survey is that only few basic strategies for pHH are currently unanimously "recommended" or "discouraged". Thus, huge uncertainties remain for many classical adjuncts such as the use of meshes, sphincter augmentation, and gastropexy, but also for the management of Short Esophagus and the correct definition and diagnosis of recurrence or failure. The limited concordance across elementary steps of pHH treatment observed in this European expert Delphi may reflect the influence of different surgical schools, but certainly mirrors a general therapeutic uncertainty caused by a notorious lack of reliable data and scientific evidence in the field.

### Management of symptomatic, asymptomatic, and recurrent hiatal hernia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^46589e32]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The surgical management of hiatal hernia remains controversial. We aimed to compare outcomes of mesh versus no mesh and fundoplication versus no fundoplication in symptomatic patients; surgery versus observation in asymptomatic patients; and redo hernia repair versus conversion to Roux-en-Y reconstruction in recurrent hiatal hernia.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and the ClinicalTrials.gov databases between 2000 and 2022 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and case series (asymptomatic and recurrent hernias). Screening was performed by two trained independent reviewers. Pooled analyses were performed on comparative data. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and Newcastle Ottawa Scale for randomized and non-randomized studies, respectively.

Results

We included 45 studies from 5152 retrieved records. Only six RCTs had low risk of bias. Mesh was associated with a lower recurrence risk (RR = 0.50, 95%CI 0.28, 0.88; I² = 57%) in observational studies but not RCTs (RR = 0.98, 95%CI 0.47, 2.02; I² = 34%), and higher total early dysphagia based on five observational studies (RR = 1.44, 95%CI 1.10, 1.89; I² = 40%) but was not statistically significant in RCTs (RR = 3.00, 95%CI 0.64, 14.16). There was no difference in complications, reintervention, heartburn, reflux, or quality of life. There were no appropriate studies comparing surgery to observation in asymptomatic patients. Fundoplication resulted in higher early dysphagia in both observational studies and RCTs ([RR = 2.08, 95%CI 1.16, 3.76] and [RR = 20.58, 95%CI 1.34, 316.69]) but lower reflux in RCTs (RR = 0.31, 95%CI 0.17, 0.56, I² = 0%). Conversion to Roux-en-Y was associated with a lower reintervention risk after 30 days compared to redo surgery.

Conclusions

The evidence for optimal management of symptomatic and recurrent hiatal hernia remains controversial, underpinned by studies with a high risk of bias. Shared decision making between surgeon and patient is essential for optimal outcomes.

### SAGES guidelines for the surgical treatment of hiatal hernias [^e804a56e]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hiatal hernia (HH) is a common condition. A multidisciplinary expert panel was convened to develop evidence-based recommendations to support clinicians, patients, and others in decisions regarding the treatment of HH.

Methods

Systematic reviews were conducted for four key questions regarding the treatment of HH in adults: surgical treatment of asymptomatic HH versus surveillance; use of mesh versus no mesh; performing a fundoplication versus no fundoplication; and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) versus redo fundoplication for recurrent HH. Evidence-based recommendations were formulated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology by subject experts. When the evidence was insufficient to base recommendations on, expert opinion was utilized instead. Recommendations for future research were also proposed.

Results

The panel provided one conditional recommendation and two expert opinions for adults with HH. The panel suggested routinely performing a fundoplication in the repair of HH, though this was based on low certainty evidence. There was insufficient evidence to make evidence-based recommendations regarding surgical repair of asymptomatic HH or conversion to RYGB in recurrent HH, and therefore, only expert opinions were offered. The panel suggested that select asymptomatic patients may be offered surgical repair, with criteria outlined. Similarly, it suggested that conversion to RYGB for management of recurrent HH may be appropriate in certain patients and again described criteria. The evidence for the routine use of mesh in HH repair was equivocal and the panel deferred making a recommendation.

Conclusions

These recommendations should provide guidance regarding surgical decision-making in the treatment of HH and highlight the importance of shared decision-making and consideration of patient values to optimize outcomes. Pursuing the identified research needs will improve the evidence base and may allow for stronger recommendations in future evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of HH.

Discussion

The panel acknowledged that available evidence consists of studies with varying patient populations and varying definitions of outcomes; however, overall, TIF 2.0 showed short-term improvement of GERD symptoms and durable symptom remission for up to 5 years with low serious adverse event rates. One possible explanation for the heterogeneity of outcomes could also be that the studies were performed over a decade with 3 to 4 different iterations of TIF devices and 3 TIF techniques used. The panel discussed the role of TIF 2.0 for a subset of patients. This included patients with chronic GERD symptoms for at least 6 months, refractory GERD (defined as presence of persistent troublesome GERD symptoms despite double-dose PPI for at least 8 weeks in the setting of ongoing documented pathologic reflux), regurgitation predominant symptoms, those who have intolerance to PPI or wanting to be off of PPI, patients with Hill grade I or II, and hiatal hernia < 2 cm. The panel evaluated established benefits and the lower noninvasive risk profile of existing medical therapy for the majority of the GERD population compared with invasive therapy, with the majority of the data on the short-term benefit for a subset of the population. The panel voiced concerns on appropriate selection of patients with GERD with persistent or refractory symptoms, need for objective confirmation study and other appropriate testing. Therefore, the panel made a "conditional" recommendation suggesting evaluation for TIF 2.0 among patients with chronic GERD with objectively confirmed disease, refractory GERD, patient preference to be off of PPI, small hiatal hernia (≤ 2 cm) or Hill grade I or II who are otherwise eligible as an alternative to long-term medical therapy.

Question 5(b): In patients with confirmed GERD and a large hiatal hernia, how does hiatal hernia repair combined with TIF (cTIF) compare to standard medical therapy for GERD management?

Recommendation 5(b):

In patients with confirmed GERD with large hiatal hernia (> 2 cm) and Hill grade III or IV, ASGE suggests evaluation for cTIF in a multidisciplinary review.

### Giant hiatus hernia presenting as a chronic cough masking a sinister diagnosis [^503d4d0b]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

We present a case of an 82-year-old gentleman with an 18-month history of productive cough. Urgent CT scan of the thorax revealed type 1 hiatus hernia (HH). The patient was managed conservatively with lifestyle modifications to help his reflux symptomology. The patient subsequently presented with acute shortness of breath and vomiting. Repeat CT scan reported a giant incarcerated HH (15cm). Endoscopy revealed an incidental finding of a 3cm polypoid lesion in the oesophagus at the level of the carina and histology of biopsies reported an invasive adenocarcinoma. During admission, the patient unfortunately had a hospital acquired infection and cardiac complications which prevented surgical intervention. Patients with suspected HH should be investigated thoroughly with imaging studies including chest X-ray, CT or MRI alongside oesophageal manometry and gastroscopy. Endoscopic evaluation is particularly important as these patients are at higher risk of Barrett's oesophagus and invasive malignancy.

Certainty of the evidence

Overall, the quality of evidence was very low primarily because of inconsistency (high heterogeneity) and imprecision (low sample size)

Discussion

The panel considered the evidence as important despite inadequacies due to small size studies. The panel also acknowledged the fact that the majority of patients with GERD contain a hiatal hernia > 2 cm and that TIF 2.0 alone has shown evidence of efficacy in patients with small hiatal hernias (≤ 2 cm and Hill grade I or II). Therefore, the panel believed that if correction of a larger hiatal hernia (≥ 2 cm) is done surgically and subsequently if TIF 2.0 is performed, outcomes may be similar to those achieved in patients undergoing TIF 2.0 with a small hiatal hernia. In addition, the panel also discussed that combined endoscopic-surgical intervention cTIF could serve as an alternative to existing surgical therapies or serve as an additional option in the armamentarium. Evidence for surgical therapies have been established, and whether combined endoscopic-surgical therapy with cTIF is comparable has not yet been demonstrated. The panel made a "conditional" recommendation suggesting either cTIF or surgical therapies based on multidisciplinary review for patients with confirmed GERD and large hiatal hernia (> 2 cm) and Hill grade III or IV.

Question 6: In patients with persistent GERD, how does radiofrequency energy to the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) compare to standard medical therapy for GERD management?

Best practice advice:

In patients with confirmed GERD, small hiatal hernia (< 2 cm), and Hill grade I or II, radiofrequency energy to the LES can be considered when other alternatives (endoscopic or surgical fundoplication) are not available or feasible.

### Managing gastroesophageal reflux disease for the lifetime of the patient: evaluating the long-term options [^732a0e54]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Lifetime management goals of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are to control esophageal as well as extraesophageal symptoms, maintain a stable noninflamed esophageal mucosa, and prevent complications. Large randomized clinical trials and > 16 years of worldwide experience have confirmed the high rate of efficacy and excellent safety profile of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy in individuals with all grades of GERD, making these agents the mainstay of treatment. Despite these outcomes, some individuals may desire an alternative to pharmacologic therapy. In such patients, laparoscopic fundoplication may produce symptom relief and healing of esophagitis, but its invasiveness, cost, and inherent surgical risks have created an interest in a variety of endoscopic therapies for reflux disease. Several short-term uncontrolled trials of these endoscopic therapies have reported encouraging preliminary results; however, careful patient selection as well as clinician experience is critical for their success. In addition to clinician expertise with the procedure, success has been observed only in patients with nonerosive GERD and a hiatal hernia < 3 cm, abnormal pH monitoring, and normal esophageal motility studies, as well as in those who have experienced at least partial symptom relief with PPI therapy. Endoscopic therapy should not be considered the standard of care in patients with erosive disease or large hiatal hernias.

Results

Participants

One hundred twenty-one European experts for upper-GI surgery were invited for round 1 and 2 of the Delphi, and 72 surgeons across 17 countries responded (response rate 60%). Details of participants are displayed in Table 1.

Table 1
Details of the participants

Definition of paraesophageal hiatus hernia

There was agreement (91%) that pHH should be defined as the presence of a hernia sac extending from the abdominal cavity and/or bursa omentalis through the hiatus into the paraesophageal mediastinum and containing a variable portion of stomach. In contrast, the sole presence of a hernia sac or of gastric prolapse into the mediastinum was not considered as a suitable definition of pHH.

Preoperative diagnostic work-up and indication for surgery

Upper-GI endoscopy was formally "recommended" and esophageal endosonography was "discouraged" as preoperative diagnostic tests. In contrast, most other diagnostic tools (CT scan, contrast radiography, esophageal manometry, (impedance-) pH-testing, MRI, and esophageal planimetry) were categorized as "acceptable" (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Expert recommendations for diagnostic work-up for pHH

Surgery was the "recommended" therapeutic strategy in symptomatic and anemic patients independent of biological age (> or < 70 years). Conversely, indication for surgery was "acceptable" in patients with no or minor symptoms.

Access routes and steps of surgical dissection

Laparoscopy was the preferred access route of most (89%) participants. Other surgical access techniques (robotic-assisted laparoscopy (8%), thoracoscopy (1%), thoracotomy (1%)) were rarely used.

"Recommended" steps of the surgical dissection phase entailed resection of the hernia sac, visualization of both vagal nerves, resection of the retrocardiac lipoma, preservation of the crural fascia and of the pleural sac; all other details of surgical dissection were categorized as "acceptable" (Table 2).

Table 2
Expert recommendations of surgical dissection for pHH repair

Surgical reconstruction

"Recommended" steps of surgical reconstruction included suture repair of the hiatus and lower esophageal sphincter augmentation. All other steps of surgical reconstruction were categorized as "acceptable" (Table 3).

AIMS and SCOPE

The aim of this ASGE guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations on the management of GERD. This document, subtitled "Methodology and Review of Evidence", provides a detailed account of the evidence synthesis process that ultimately led to our recommendations. A separate publication of "Summary and Recommendations" provides a summary of the main findings and final recommendations of the ASGE Standards of Practice (SOP) Committee for the diagnosis and management of GERD.

This guideline synthesizes the evidence and makes recommendations on the following clinical questions:

Question 1

1a: In patients with GERD symptoms, when should upper endoscopy be performed compared with no endoscopy?

1b: In patients who have undergone SG, should endoscopy be performed to screen for Barrett esophagus compared with no endoscopy?

1c: In patients having undergone POEM who have reflux symptoms, should endoscopy be performed compared with no endoscopy?

Question 2

In patients with GERD undergoing upper endoscopy, what are the criteria for high-quality endoscopy procedure and report?

Question 3

In patients with GERD, should lifestyle interventions be recommended to reduce GERD symptoms?

Question 4

In patients with GERD, does proton pump inhibitor compared with placebo reduce symptoms?

Question 5

5a: In patients with persistent GERD, how does transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) compare to standard medical therapy?

5b: In patients with confirmed GERD and a large hiatal hernia, how does hiatal hernia repair combined with TIF (cTIF) compare to standard medical therapy for GERD management?

Question 6

In patients with persistent GERD, how does radiofrequency energy to the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) compare to standard medical therapy for GERD management?

### EAES multidisciplinary rapid guideline: systematic review, meta-analysis, GRADE assessment and evidence-informed recommendations on the surgical management of paraesophageal hernias [^32f96e54]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

New evidence has emerged since latest guidelines on the management of paraesophageal hernia, and guideline development methodology has evolved. Members of the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery have prioritized the management of paraesophageal hernia to be addressed by pertinent recommendations.

Objective

To develop evidence-informed clinical practice recommendations on paraesophageal hernias, through evidence synthesis and a structured evidence-to-decision framework by an interdisciplinary panel of stakeholders.

Methods

We performed three systematic reviews, and we summarized and appraised the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE methodology. A panel of general and upper gastrointestinal surgeons, gastroenterologists and a patient advocate discussed the evidence in the context of benefits and harms, the certainty of the evidence, acceptability, feasibility, equity, cost and use of resources, moderated by a Guidelines International Network-certified master guideline developer and chair. We developed the recommendations in a consensus meeting, followed by a modified Delphi survey.

Results

The panel suggests surgery over conservative management for asymptomatic/minimally symptomatic paraesophageal hernias (conditional recommendation), and recommends conservative management over surgery for asymptomatic/minimally symptomatic paraesophageal hernias in frail patients (strong recommendation). Further, the panel suggests mesh over sutures for hiatal closure in paraesophageal hernia repair, fundoplication over gastropexy in elective paraesophageal hernia repair, and gastropexy over fundoplication in patients who have cardiopulmonary instability and require emergency paraesophageal hernia repair (conditional recommendation). A strong recommendation means that the proposed course of action is appropriate for the vast majority of patients. A conditional recommendation means that most patients would opt for the proposed course of action, and joint decision-making of the surgeon and the patient is required. Accompanying evidence summaries and evidence-to-decision frameworks should be read when using the recommendations. This guideline applies to adult patients with moderate to large paraesophageal hernias type II to IV with at least 50% of the stomach herniated to the thoracic cavity. The full guideline with user-friendly decision aids is available in https://app.magicapp.org/#/guideline/j7q7Gn.

Conclusion

An interdisciplinary panel provides recommendations on key topics on the management of paraesophageal hernias using highest methodological standards and following a transparent process.

### Evolution and development of surgery for large paraesophageal hiatus hernia [^f48c49e8]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic repair is the standard surgical approach to the problem of large paraesophageal hiatus hernia. It is associated with low risks of morbidity and mortality, although there is a small risk (less than 5%) of a clinically significant recurrent hernia. Various techniques have been proposed to minimise this risk, including esophageal lengthening procedures and mesh reinforcement of the hiatus. Both remain controversial. Radiological outcomes from randomised trials suggest that a reduction in hernia recurrence rates can be achieved with the use of mesh repair, although these trials have not demonstrated any clinically significant benefits for mesh repair. The risk of complications following mesh placement at the esophageal hiatus or an esophageal lengthening procedure needs to be balanced against potential benefits. More work is required to define the optimal approach to repair of large paraesophageal hiatus hernias.

ASGE guideline — combined hiatal hernia repair and transoral incisionless fundoplication (cTIF) for large hiatal hernia in GERD — recommendation and evidence: In patients with confirmed GERD and a large hiatal hernia (> 2 cm) and Hill grade III or IV, the ASGE suggests evaluation for combined hiatal hernia repair and TIF (cTIF) in a multidisciplinary review. (Conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). Seven cohort studies met selection criteria for inclusion, and an ongoing multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) was identified. On meta-analysis, cTIF was associated with a lower use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) compared with use before the procedure (37.5% vs 94.6%; pooled OR, .71; 95% CI, .48-.93, I² = 94%, P < .01), and cTIF was also associated with better symptom resolution compared with preintervention values (pooled MD, 21.87; 95% CI, 12.91–29.83; I² = 100%, P < .01). Among 358 patients undergoing cTIF, only 2 (.01%) had serious adverse events, and the rate of dysphagia was .06% (7/125) after cTIF per 1 cohort study.

### Management of symptomatic, asymptomatic, and recurrent hiatal hernia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^344ed86b]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Hiatal hernia repair with mesh versus without mesh — pooled analyses found fewer symptomatic recurrences with mesh from 17 observational cohort studies with a moderate level of heterogeneity (I² = 55%), whereas four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) did not show a difference with a moderate level of heterogeneity (I² = 52%); for radiological recurrence there was no statistically significant difference and the 95% confidence interval for the pooled observational analysis was marginally over the null value; 21 of 22 studies were assessed as a high risk of bias; there was no difference between groups in post operative complications, need for reintervention / return to the OR, or most postoperative symptoms (regurgitation, reflux, heartburn, and new onset early and late dysphagia); unresolved and total early dysphagia was more likely with mesh in observational studies but not RCTs, whereas total late dysphagia was more likely without mesh in RCTs; three of the four RCTs had a low risk of bias.

Indications for Surgical Treatment of GPEH

While a sliding hiatal hernia can be managed nonoperatively in the absence of symptoms, it is less clear that GPEH can be left alone once discovered. In addition, very few patients are truly asymptomatic if they have a GPEH; they are more likely to be accustomed to symptoms than to be asymptomatic. The natural history of GPEH is ill-defined; one Finnish study showed an in-hospital mortality of 16.4% in patients with paraesophageal hernia treated with conservative therapy. Other studies endeavored to compare watchful waiting versus elective laparoscopic repair and concluded that patients would benefit more from watchful waiting. At this point, we can make some recommendations based on what we understand about GPEH. First, symptomatic GPEH warrants consideration of surgical treatment since symptoms will only worsen with time; second, a patient with a GPEH and crescendo symptoms requires surgical repair in the short term because it may portend an incarceration; third, a patient with an incarcerated or strangulated GPEH needs urgent intervention; fourth, patients with type II hiatal hernia, regardless of size, should be treated surgically whenever possible; and, fifth, patients with minimal or no symptoms should be considered for surgical repair, but with limited understanding of the natural history of untreated GPEH, we allow room for individualization and conservative management with regular follow-up. As a reflection of these heterogeneous indications for surgery, the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) guideline suggests careful evaluation on an individual-case basis.

### Morbidity and mortality following hiatal hernia repair in geriatric patients: a multicenter research network study [^e362cee0]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Hiatal hernia is a common surgical pathology, with over 60,000 repairs performed in the United States in 2018. Many such hernias are found incidentally, leaving the surgeon and patient with a difficult management decision. Given the association between age and size of hiatal hernia, this will become a more frequent dilemma as the population continues to age. Data on the effects of age on the outcomes of hiatal hernia repair may help inform the decision-making process.

The management of hiatal hernia has undergone many iterations over the last century. In 1919, Dr. Soresi published the first account of elective repair of hiatal hernias and advocated for the routine repair of even very small hernias. Fifty years later, some surgeons advocated for observation of minimally symptomatic hernias while others, including Dr. Belsey, advocated for the repair of every paraesophageal hernia. This recommendation was largely born out of concern regarding the risk of gastric volvulus with strangulation.

In 2013, the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) published its Guidelines for the Management of Hiatal Hernia. One of its recommendations was that "Routine elective repair of completely asymptomatic paraesophageal hernias may not always be indicated". This recommendation was made on the basis of a Markov Monte Carlo decision analytic model by Stylopoulos et al. that found the average 65 year-old patient with a minimally symptomatic paraesophageal hernia would benefit more from a strategy of watchful waiting than operative management.

This model assumed 13.87% of the observation population would crossover into surgical management due to symptom progression each year. However, it did not account for worse outcomes in this scenario due to elective repair at an older age. Additionally, outcomes of paraesophageal hernia repair have improved as cases centralize to high volume centers and care improves.

This study was undertaken to delineate the modern outcomes of hiatal hernia repair in an elderly patient cohort compared to a younger cohort to help describe the potential consequences of delaying elective hiatal hernia repair until later in life.

### Guidelines for the management of hiatal hernia [^70889040]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for hiatal hernia, more specifically with respect to classification, SAGES 2013 guidelines recommend to classify hiatal hernias into the following types:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Type I|- Sliding hernias - the GEJ migrates above the diaphragm, the stomach remains in its usual longitudinal alignment and the fundus remains below the GEJ|
|Type II|- Pure paraesophageal hernias - the GEJ remains in its normal anatomic position, but a portion of the fundus herniates through the diaphragmatic hiatus adjacent to the esophagus|
|Type III|- A combination of types I and II, with both the GEJ and the fundus herniating through the hiatus, and the fundus lies above the GEJ|
|Type IV|- Hiatal hernias with the presence of a structure other than stomach (such as the omentum, colon, or small bowel) within the hernial sac.|

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of laparoscopic mesh versus suture repair of hiatus hernia: objective and subjective outcomes [^32fad7ce]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

This meta-analysis was conducted and the results are presented according to the recommendations of PRISMA statement.

Search strategy

PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Springerlink electronic databases were searched until October 2016. A manual search of the reference listed from the articles accessed was also performed to identify other relevant studies. Only articles written in English were searched. A search strategy using disease-specific terms (e.g. gastroesophageal reflux OR hernia, hiatal OR hiatus hernia), management-specific terms (e.g. mesh OR implant OR patch), and terms related to surgical procedures (e.g. laparoscopic surgery OR laparoscopy OR minimally invasive) was used.

Inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or case–control comparative studies in patients who underwent repair of HH with the use of mesh (permanent or absorbable/biologic), (ii) age ≥ 16 years, (iii) a laparoscopic approach was used in all patients, (iv) duration of follow-up ≥ 12 months, (v) raw data could be extracted from studies to calculate outcomes, (vi) patients were diagnosed preoperatively with GERD or any type of HH. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) Studies were non-comparative, (ii) mesh was not used, (iii) the hernia was repaired without a fundoplication, (iv) patients aged < 16 years were included, (v) studies for which raw data could not be extracted to obtain pooled results and the corresponding author was not able or willing to provide revelent additional data at request for this study.

Data extraction

Titles and abstracts of the citations were identified and scrutinized by two of the authors (C Zhang and D Liu) to determine eligibility for inclusion in the pooled analysis. Data were then extracted from the full publication. This comprised (i) descriptive information relevant to each study — first author, publication year, study population characteristics, study design, sample size, follow-up duration, and inclusion/exclusion criteria, and (ii) data required for outcomes analysis, including beneficial and adverse results. Any disagreements between the two reviewers were resolved by discussion and consensus. If data were missing, the authors of the original studies were contacted and the relevant information was requested. Outcomes of interest in studies in which the same cohort was published in more than one paper were extracted based on the article that was published most recently.

Novel endoscopic antireflux therapies — because of primarily uncontrolled data and short-term follow-up, the evidence could not be evaluated further using GRADE methodology and the panel could not derive any recommendation; therefore, the panel did not provide any recommendation in favor of or against the novel endoscopic antireflux therapies at the current time. Like TIF 2.0, these strategies are primarily used for patients with chronic, objectively confirmed GERD with small hiatal hernia defined as ≤ 2 cm.

### Giant hiatal hernia [^cecd7a46]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

A giant hiatal hernia (HH) is a hernia that includes at least 30% of the stomach in the chest, although a uniform definition does not exist; most commonly, a giant HH is a type III hernia with a sliding and paraesophageal component. The etiology of giant HH is not entirely clear, and two potential mechanisms exist: (1) gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) leads to esophageal scarring and shortening with resulting traction on the gastroesophageal junction and gastric herniation; and (2) chronic positive pressure on the diaphragmatic hiatus combined with a propensity to herniation leads to gastric displacement into the chest, resulting in GERD. The short esophagus and GERD are key concepts to understanding the pathophysiology of giant HH, and these concepts are critical to address this problem appropriately. A successful repair of giant HH requires adherence to basic hernia repair principles (ie, hernia sac excision, tension-free repair), recognition and correction of a short esophagus, and a well-performed antireflux procedure. Recurrence rates for open giant HH repairs in expert hands range between 2% and 12%; large series have demonstrated that meticulous laparoscopic surgical technique can emulate the results of open giant HH repair.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on the diagnosis and management of GERD: summary and recommendations [^2822dee0]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

This clinical practice guideline from the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) provides an evidence-based approach for strategies to diagnose and manage GERD. This document was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework and serves as an update to the 2014 ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the management of GERD. This updated guideline addresses the indications for endoscopy in patients with GERD as well as in the emerging population of patients who develop GERD after sleeve gastrectomy or peroral endoscopic myotomy. It also discusses how to endoscopically evaluate gastroesophageal junctional integrity in a comprehensive and uniform manner. Importantly, this guideline also discusses management strategies for GERD including the role of lifestyle interventions, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and endoscopic antireflux therapy (including transoral incisionless fundoplication [TIF], radiofrequency energy, and combined hiatal hernia repair and TIF [cTIF]) in the management of GERD. The ASGE suggests upper endoscopy for the evaluation of GERD in patients with alarm symptoms, with multiple risk factors for Barrett's esophagus, and with a history of sleeve gastrectomy. The ASGE recommends careful endoscopic evaluation, reporting, and photo-documentation of objective GERD findings with attention to gastroesophageal junction landmarks and integrity in patients who undergo upper endoscopy to improve care. In patients with GERD symptoms, the ASGE recommends lifestyle modifications. In patients with symptomatic and confirmed GERD with predominant heartburn symptoms, the ASGE recommends medical management including PPIs at the lowest dose for the shortest duration possible while initiating discussion about long-term management options. In patients with confirmed GERD with small hiatal hernias (≤ 2 cm) and Hill grade I or II who meet specific criteria, the ASGE suggests evaluation for TIF as an alternative to chronic medical management. In patients with persistent GERD with large hiatal hernias (> 2cm) and Hill grade III or IV, the ASGE suggests either cTIF or surgical therapy based on multidisciplinary review. This document summarizes the methods, analyses, and decision processes used to reach the final recommendations and represents the official ASGE recommendations on the above topics.

Question 2: In patients with GERD undergoing upper endoscopy, what are the criteria for high-quality endoscopy procedure and report?

Recommendation 2:

In patients undergoing endoscopic evaluation for GERD symptoms, the ASGE recommends careful endoscopic evaluation, reporting, and photo-documentation of the following to improve patient care and outcomes:

- **Objective GERD findings, when present**: ○ Erosive esophagitis (using the Los Angeles [LA] grading system) ○ Barrett's esophagus (using the Prague classification) ○ Peptic stricture
- Gastroesophageal junction landmarks and integrity ○ Hiatal hernia dimensions using Hill grading or American Foregut society (AFS) grading in forward view and retroflexion ○ Location of the top of gastric folds, Z line, diaphragmatic impression ○ Existing fundoplication description (if present) (Strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence)

Evidence

This was an important question to address for our guideline panel, especially given recent advancements in the endoscopic management of GERD. This is not a comparative question and thus did not follow a GRADE format. We performed a systematic literature search for studies reporting use of endoscopic assessment for GERD. We used Ovid MEDLINE and Embase for all of the studies published through December 2022. We used major search terms and subheadings including "reporting", "evaluation", "assessment", "upper endoscopy", "esophagogastroduodenoscopy", "esophagitis", "hernia", and "Barrett's esophagus". The systematic review was restricted to studies assessing the standardized reporting of findings during upper endoscopy. Data that describe the standardization of reporting upper endoscopies, including documentation of gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) changes that are important in GERD, are scarce. Overall quality of evidence was "very low" because of the low number of studies.

We identified 1 observational study addressing this question. Boys et alexamined inconsistent reporting in their retrospective study of 100 EGD reports from different endoscopists in different patients, in which esophagitis was noted in 33 patients but graded in only 14 (42%). A hiatal hernia was noted in 61 patients (57%) but measured in only 31 (51%) and classified in just 26% of cases.

Certainty of the evidence

Certainty of the evidence was low because of a lack of substantial studies, and the available data were driven from a single observational study of low power.
