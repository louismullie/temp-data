## Question

Actinomyces

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Actinomyces. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the organism's taxonomy and normal colonization niches. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and why it becomes invasive. Next, I will classify clinical syndromes by anatomic site and their mimics. After that, I need to appraise diagnostic pitfalls and the optimal laboratory approach. Then, I will review treatment principles, including duration and when to add surgery. Finally, I should consider special populations and synthesize a practical clinical algorithm with key takeaways, making sure I double-check any overstatements and correct them as I go.

> Let me first confirm the microbiology and ecology. Actinomyces are gram-positive, non–spore-forming, anaerobic or microaerophilic branching bacilli that are normal commensals of the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and female genital tract; they are endogenous and not environmental saprophytes, which distinguishes them from Nocardia, and they are catalase-negative, which is relevant in chronic granulomatous disease contexts [^2295eedd] [^62f67845] [^83f9f39a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pathogenicity. I need to check the pathogenesis. Disease typically follows mucosal barrier disruption (dental disease, trauma, surgery, aspiration, foreign bodies such as IUDs) that permits invasion and allows Actinomyces to proliferate in anaerobic niches; polymicrobial co-infections are common, with companion bacteria consuming oxygen and facilitating Actinomyces growth, and the hallmark is chronic, indolent infection with abscesses, sinus tracts, and sulfur granules due to poor antibiotic penetration into fibrotic lesions [^3d12ce08] [^e10f56cf] [^69b80dfe].

> Next, I should review the clinical syndromes by site. Cervicofacial disease is most common, often odontogenic, presenting as a firm, indurated mass or "lumpy jaw" with sinus tracts and sulfur granules; thoracic disease can mimic malignancy or tuberculosis with chronic consolidation, cavitation, endobronchial obstruction, and pleural involvement; abdominopelvic disease favors ileocecal, ovarian, and tubal sites and can mimic malignancy or IBD; CNS disease is rare but serious; and musculoskeletal and breast infections occur, including osteomyelitis of the mandible and chronic breast abscesses, often with delayed recognition [^3d12ce08] [^c2e58e05] [^69b80dfe] [^8670f7a8] [^10633035].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic challenges and the laboratory approach. Culture is slow and often negative due to prior antibiotics or overgrowth; optimal yield requires anaerobic transport and prolonged incubation, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing improves identification when routine methods fail; histopathology showing sulfur granules with gram-positive branching filaments is classic, and I should remember that MALDI-TOF performance for Actinomyces is improving but still limited, so discordant results warrant molecular confirmation [^ff104185] [^948bc1c7] [^8459ccd2].

> I should double-check the imaging signatures that raise suspicion. In thoracic disease, CT typically shows chronic segmental consolidation with central low-attenuation necrosis, peripheral rim enhancement, adjacent pleural thickening, and trans-fissural extension; endobronchial disease may show an obstructing lesion with distal pneumonia; abdominopelvic disease often appears as a solid, enhancing mass with small rim-enhancing abscesses and extensive inflammatory stranding that can simulate malignancy, so tissue diagnosis is crucial before committing to surgery [^3d12ce08] [^28c9aa4e] [^69b80dfe].

> Let me think about treatment, and I need to ensure I get the duration right. High-dose beta-lactam therapy is first-line, traditionally 2–6 weeks of IV penicillin G followed by 6–12 months of oral penicillin or amoxicillin; however, emerging data suggest many patients can be cured with shorter courses if closely monitored, and some case series report success with 3–6 months total therapy, so I should individualize duration to disease extent and response; metronidazole is not active as monotherapy, and fluoroquinolones should generally be avoided despite in vitro variability; surgery is reserved for refractory cases, abscess drainage, or diagnostic debridement, and source control is essential in polymicrobial disease [^e6f7148c] [^d9416a29] [^f0c81b72].

> But wait, what if the patient has an IUD and Actinomyces is found on cytology? I should confirm guideline-based management. In asymptomatic patients, Actinomyces on Pap smear is an incidental finding; no antibiotics are needed and the IUD can remain in place, with counseling about the very low risk of pelvic actinomycosis; symptomatic patients warrant evaluation for infection and consideration of IUD removal plus antibiotics, so I must avoid reflexively treating colonization [^274dcd5e] [^41da21cf] [^f2cb9bb9].

> I need to ensure I address special hosts. In chronic granulomatous disease, Actinomyces can cause severe, protracted infections despite therapy, likely reflecting impaired oxidative killing of catalase-negative organisms; in children, cervicofacial and thoracic disease are rare but documented, and mandibular osteomyelitis may require repeated debridements; in immunocompromised hosts, disease may be more extensive, though classic teaching that incidence is not clearly increased has been challenged by case series, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion [^83f9f39a] [^10633035] [^9f75b7cf].

> Hold on, I should verify a few common pitfalls and correct them explicitly. I initially thought "most thoracic cases occur in immunocompromised patients", but that overstates the evidence; many cases occur in immunocompetent hosts with poor oral hygiene or dental disease, so I should correct that and emphasize risk factors like alcoholism, bronchiectasis, and aspiration rather than immunosuppression alone; likewise, I almost said "always polymicrobial", but although polymicrobiality is common, monomicrobial cases do occur, so I should qualify that assertion [^9f75b7cf] [^3d12ce08].

> Next, I should review a practical clinical algorithm. Suspect actinomycosis in chronic, indolent infections with mass-like lesions, sinus tracts, or sulfur granules, especially with oral, thoracic, abdominopelvic, or IUD-associated risk factors; obtain tissue for histopathology and culture with anaerobic transport and prolonged incubation, and consider 16S sequencing if identification fails; use high-dose beta-lactam therapy tailored to site and severity, plan 3–6 months minimum with longer courses for extensive disease, add surgical drainage or debridement for abscesses or nonresponders, and monitor closely for relapse given fibrosis and poor drug penetration [^ff104185] [^e6f7148c] [^3d12ce08].

> In summary, I need to emphasize the key takeaways. Actinomyces are endogenous gram-positive anaerobes that cause chronic, destructive infections after mucosal barrier breakdown; diagnosis is often delayed and requires tissue-based confirmation; beta-lactam therapy for months plus source control when indicated is the cornerstone; and incidental colonization, particularly with IUDs, should not trigger treatment without symptoms, which helps avoid overtreatment and unnecessary device removal [^3d12ce08] [^274dcd5e] [^e6f7148c].

Actinomyces are **Gram-positive, anaerobic or microaerophilic bacteria** that are normal human flora in the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and female genital tract [^2295eedd]. They cause **chronic, indolent infections** characterized by abscesses, sinus tracts, and sulfur granules, most often in the cervicofacial, thoracic, abdominopelvic, and pelvic regions [^3d12ce08]. Diagnosis relies on **histopathology with sulfur granules** and Gram-positive branching filaments, plus culture or 16S rRNA sequencing [^f0c81f72] [^ff104185]. Treatment is **high-dose penicillin for 6–12 months**, with surgery for refractory cases or complications [^e6f7148c] [^f0c81f72]. Prognosis is excellent with timely therapy, but delays are common due to nonspecific symptoms and mimicry of malignancy or tuberculosis [^c2e58e05].

---

## Microbiological characteristics

- **Morphology**: Gram-positive, non–spore-forming, branching filamentous rods that fragment into bacillary or coccoid forms [^a718588e].
- **Growth conditions**: Anaerobic or microaerophilic; slow-growing, requiring 5–7 days for visible colonies.
- **Identification**: Phenotypic methods are unreliable; MALDI-TOF MS and 16S rRNA sequencing improve species-level identification [^948bc1c7] [^8459ccd2].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Actinomyces infections are **endogenous and polymicrobial**, typically following mucosal barrier disruption (trauma, surgery, dental disease, foreign bodies) [^3d12ce08]. The most common forms are:

| **Clinical form** | **Frequency** | **Key features** |
|-|-|-|
| Cervicofacial | 50–65% | - "Lumpy jaw" <br/> - Abscesses <br/> - Sinus tracts <br/> - Sulfur granules [^3d12ce08] |
| Thoracic | 15–30% | - Chronic pneumonia <br/> - Mass-like consolidation <br/> - Pleural effusion <br/> - Mimics malignancy or TB [^c2e58e05] |
| Abdominopelvic | 20% | - Chronic abscesses <br/> - Fistulas <br/> - Often IUD-associated [^69b80dfe] |
| Pelvic | Rare | - Chronic pelvic pain <br/> - Masses <br/> - IUD-associated [^69b80dfe] |

---

## Diagnostic methods

- **Histopathology**: Gold standard; sulfur granules (macrocolonies) with Gram-positive branching filaments and surrounding neutrophils [^f0c81f72].
- **Culture**: Slow growth; anaerobic conditions essential; often negative due to prior antibiotics or overgrowth [^f0c81f72].
- **Molecular methods**: 16S rRNA sequencing improves identification, especially for non-israelii species [^8459ccd2] [^948bc1c7].
- **Imaging**: CT/MRI show chronic infiltrative lesions crossing fascial planes, mimicking malignancy [^3d12ce08] [^69b80dfe].

---

## Treatment

- **Antibiotics**: High-dose penicillin G (18–24 million units/day IV) for 2–6 weeks, then oral penicillin V or amoxicillin for 6–12 months [^e6f7148c].
- **Alternatives**: Doxycycline, clindamycin, or ceftriaxone for penicillin allergy [^notfound].
- **Surgery**: Indicated for abscess drainage, debridement, or refractory disease [^f0c81f72].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is **excellent with early, appropriate therapy**; however, delays are common and can lead to extensive tissue destruction, chronic disability, or death [^c2e58e05]. Complications include **osteomyelitis, fistulas, and chronic fibrosis** [^3d12ce08].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **good oral hygiene**, prompt treatment of dental disease, and careful management of foreign bodies (e.g. IUDs) [^62f67845] [^274dcd5e].

---

Actinomyces are **endogenous bacteria** that cause chronic, granulomatous infections with abscesses and sinus tracts; diagnosis requires histopathology and culture or molecular methods, and treatment is prolonged high-dose penicillin with surgery as needed.

### Phenotypic identification of Actinomyces and related species isolated from human sources [^50e93b8d]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

Recent advancements in chemotaxonomic and molecular biology-based identification methods have clarified the taxonomy of the genus Actinomyces and have led to the recognition of several new Actinomyces and related species. Actinomyces-like gram-positive rods have increasingly been isolated from various clinical specimens. Thus, an easily accessible scheme for reliable differentiation at the species level is needed in clinical and oral microbiology laboratories, where bacterial identification is mainly based on conventional biochemical methods. In the present study we designed a two-step protocol that consists of a flowchart that describes rapid, cost-efficient tests for preliminary identification of Actinomyces and closely related species and an updated more comprehensive scheme that also uses fermentation reactions for accurate differentiation of Actinomyces and closely related species.

### Pulmonary actinomycosis [^c2e58e05]. The European Respiratory Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Pulmonary actinomycosis is a rare but important and challenging diagnosis to make. Even when the clinical suspicion is high, the disease is commonly confused with other chronic suppurative lung diseases and with malignancy. An early, accurate diagnosis will prevent the considerable psychological and physical morbidity, including unwarranted surgery, associated with delayed diagnosis. The clinical, radiological and therapeutic characteristics of the infection are reviewed here. Respiratory physicians should be aware of this important differential when investigating patients for persistent pulmonary shadowing. This will expedite the diagnosis of an otherwise highly treatable condition with an excellent prognosis if picked up early.

### An overview of thoracic actinomycosis: CT features [^fb893d9e]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Thoracic actinomycosis is an uncommon, chronic suppurative bacterial infection caused by actinomyces species, especially Actinomyces israelii.

Methods

It is usually seen in immunocompetent patients with respiratory disorders, poor oral hygiene, alcoholism and chronic debilitating diseases.

Results

We illustrate the radiological manifestations of thoracic actinomycoses in various involved areas in the thorax.

Conclusion

Thoracic actinomycosis can be radiologically divided into the parenchymal type, the airway type including bronchiectasis, the endobronchial form, and the mediastinum or chest wall involvement type.

Teaching Points

• Important risk factors for thoracic actinomycosis are underlying respiratory disorders such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. • Different CT patterns can be distinguished in thoracic actinomycosis: parenchymal, bronchiectatic, endobronchial and extrapulmonary. • Typical CT findings in the parenchymal pattern are a central low density within the parenchymal consolidation and adjacent pleural thickening.

### An overview of thoracic actinomycosis: CT features [^741afdae]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Thoracic actinomycosis may range from subclinical illness to a progressively fatal disease. The prognosis is excellent with low mortality when the disease is recognised early and appropriate treatment is given. Thus, actinomycosis should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis when confronted with chronic unresolving pneumonia that extends across anatomic barriers or manifests as an endobronchial lesion. Early diagnosis may prevent serious complications or unwarranted surgery.

### Actinomyces in explanted transvaginal mesh: commensal or pathogen? [^f4fa72e8]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

There is a paucity of information in the literature regarding the clinical impact and treatment of histologically positive actinomycosis explanted vaginal mesh. We aimed to report the prevalence and independent predicators of Actinomyces presence in explanted meshes on histology and to compare the clinical course in those with and without Actinomyces. Our hypothesis is that Actinomyces may act as a commensal rather than a pathogen when identified in extracted transvaginal meshes.

Methods

A single-center retrospective review of explanted vaginal mesh removed between 2013 and 2018 was undertaken and compared Actinomyces-positive and -negative cohorts on histology. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analysis evaluated possible risk factors for positive Actinomyces including patient demographics, smoking, diabetes, hormone replacement therapy (vaginal/systemic), hysterectomy in primary surgery, rate and indication for prior mesh removal. The rate of symptom resolution or need for subsequent mesh excisions is compared between the two cohorts.

Results

Actinomycosis was identified in 11% (31/278) of explanted mesh. After multivariant analysis, only voiding dysfunction as an indication for mesh removal was statistically significantly associated with Actinomyces-negative histology (14 vs 0%, p<0.001). At median review of 17 months, symptom resolution (87% vs 83% p=0.68) and need for subsequent mesh removal (13% vs 19%, p=0.37) following index mesh excision were similar between the groups.

Conclusion

Actinomyces in explanted transvaginal mesh frequently acts as a commensal in those who are infection free. In this cohort, individualized care including conservative surveillance without antibiotics or full explantation is reasonable.

### Paediatric pulmonary actinomycosis: a forgotten disease [^3628911e]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Actinomycosis is a rare, indolent and invasive infection caused by Actinomyces species. Actinomycosis develops when there is disruption of the mucosal barrier, and invasion and systemic spread of the organism, which can lead to endogenous infection affecting numerous organs. It is known to spread in tissue through fascial planes and most often involves the cervicofacial (55%), abdominopelvic (20%) and thoracic (15%) soft tissue. Pulmonary actinomycosis is rare in patients under the age of five years, with the median reported age in the fifth decade. Clinical findings include chest wall mass (49%), cough (40%), pain (back, chest, shoulders) (36%), weight loss (19%), fever (19%), Draining sinuses (15%) and hemoptysis (9%). Chest x-ray findings in pulmonary actinomycosis are mostly nonspecific and can overlap with pulmonary tuberculosis, foreign body aspiration and malignancy. Endobronchial tissue aggregates may show sulphur granules, with yellow to white conglomerate areas of gram positive Actinomyces. Removal or biopsy of these large endobronchial masses must be done with care, because of the risk of bleeding and large airway obstruction. The cytology on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid may show Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive stain, ZN negative and Gram-positive filamentous bacilli which is morphologically suggestive of Actinomycosis. Actinomyces spp is highly susceptible to beta lactam antibiotics, penicillin G, and amoxicillin. A minimum of 3-6 months is needed but up to 20 months of treatment may be needed. Early diagnosis and correct treatment can lead to a good prognosis with a low mortality.

### Actinomyces species isolated from breast infections [^8670f7a8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

Actinomycosis is a chronic infection caused by Actinomyces species characterized by abscess formation, tissue fibrosis, and draining sinuses. The spectrum of infections caused by Actinomyces species ranges from classical invasive actinomycosis to a less invasive form of superficial skin and soft tissue infection. We present a review detailing all Actinomyces species isolated from breast infections in NHS Lothian between 2005 and 2013, Actinomyces species isolated from breast infections referred to the United Kingdom Anaerobe Reference Unit between 1988 and 2014, and cases describing Actinomyces breast infections published in the medical literature since 1994. Actinomyces species are fastidious organisms which can be difficult to identify and are likely to be underascertained as a cause of breast infections. Due to improved diagnostic methods, they are increasingly associated with chronic, recurrent breast infections and may play a more significant role in these infections than has previously been appreciated.

### Role of the microbiome in human development [^2295eedd]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

What is a healthy microbiome?

Individuals differ enormously in the taxonomic content of their microbiota, and even the same person over time can appear dramatically different from their own prior representation. Functional redundancy makes the characterisation of the healthy microbiome extremely complex, because different taxonomic profiles can lead to ecosystems with similar behaviour. It is also unclear whether ‘normal’ in a human population implies healthy, because the health optimum might be context-dependent both at a population and at an individual level—is the average microbiome of lean 20-year-olds, half of whom will become chronically ill 70-year-olds, really healthy? Studies of healthy children in 10 locales in Asia showed substantial variation in the composition of the gut microbiota, yet there was a clear North-South pattern in terms of predominant taxa, likely related to different levels of socioeconomic modernisation and market integration.Thus, we do not yet know what are the key features of healthy microbiomes, beyond the descriptive composition that characterises body sites: Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Veillonella, Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas or Treponema species in the oral cavity, with shared lifestyle, environment and genetic factors playing a role; Acinetobacter and Aeribacillus in the ocular surface, Pseudomonas on the lid margin and conjunctiva;Actinobacteria (Corynebacteriaceae and Propionibacteriaceae and Firmicutes—mostly Staphylococcaceae, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in the skin,lipophilic organisms such as Propionibacterium spp. and the fungus Malassezia spp. in areas of higher density of sebaceous glands (face or back),Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, including Bacteroides, Prevotella, Ruminococcus, Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, the Verrucomicrobia Akkermansia and the archaeal Methanobrevibacter smithii in the mucosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal tract,and Lactobacillus spp. in the women’s genital tract.The ubiquity of the ‘core’ dominant metabolismscontrasts with the variability of niche-specific low abundant functions, many of which remain uncharacterised. A possible approach to the complexity of the human microbiome variability and disease risks is to obtain longitudinal data from multiple cohorts in global studies from which subjects developing any diseases throughout their lifespan are excluded, and only the healthy subjects (lacking a disease phenotype) are considered. In ecosystems like the gut, the extent of diversity is one proxy for health. Immigrants from developing countries lose diversity across human generations, as they develop westernised lifestyles and diseases.

### Imaging of actinomycosis in various organs: a comprehensive review [^3d12ce08]. Radiographics (2014). Low credibility.

Actinomycosis is a chronic suppurative bacterial infection caused by Actinomyces species. Actinomyces israelii is the organism most commonly found in human disease. Actinomycosis usually manifests with abscess formation, dense fibrosis, and draining sinuses. The disease is further characterized by the tendency to extensively spread beyond normal fascial and connective tissue planes. Actinomycosis occurs most commonly in the cervicofacial region (50%-65%), followed by the thoracic (15%-30%) and abdominopelvic (20%) regions, but rarely involves the central nervous system. Most cases of cervicofacial actinomycosis are odontogenic in origin. In the acute form, cervicofacial disease can manifest with soft-tissue swelling, a painful pyogenic abscess, or a mass lesion. In the subacute to chronic form, a painless indurated mass can spread to the skin, leading to draining sinus tracts. Thoracic manifestations include parenchymal, bronchiectatic, and endobronchial actinomycosis. At computed tomography, pulmonary actinomycosis usually appears as chronic segmental airspace consolidation containing necrotic low-attenuation areas with peripheral enhancement. Abdominopelvic actinomycosis preferentially involves the ileocecal region, ovary, and fallopian tube. The imaging findings favoring abdominopelvic actinomycosis include strong enhancement in the solid portion of the mass after contrast material administration, small rim-enhancing abscesses within the mass, and extensive inflammatory extensions. Actinomycosis in the central nervous system may produce brain abscess, meningitis, subdural empyema, actinomycetoma, and spinal and cranial epidural abscess. In general, actinomycosis responds well to antibiotic therapy, but long-term follow-up after treatment is needed because of frequent relapses.

### Actinomycosis: a differential diagnosis for appendicitis. A case report and review of the literature [^da88cf72]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Actinomyces is a genus of gram-positive anaerobic or microaerophilic bacteria that colonize the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and the female genital tract. These organisms cause disseminated disease in the mouth, the respiratory system, and rarely in the gastrointestinal tract. The diseases produced by Actinomyces species result from the disruption of the barriers that allow the dissemination of the bacteria through the surrounding tissues. The appendix is often a nidus of Actinomyces infection, but a prompt diagnosis cannot be made without the results of histologic examination of the appendix. The treatment of choice for actinomycosis of the appendix is the high-dose parenteral administration of penicillin G for 2 weeks immediately after the diagnosis has been made and continued oral treatment with that agent for at least the next 6 months. We present the case of a 13-year-old adolescent boy with actinomycosis of the appendix that was identified by histologic examination after appendectomy.

### Actinobaculum massiliae: a new cause of superficial skin infection [^d5c8e23e]. The Journal of Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Actinomycete-like organisms are well recognised members of normal mucosal flora but some strains are thought to contribute to commensal skin flora too. From here they may become pathogenic. The actinomyces family has undergone significant taxonomic revision in recent years. A new species, Actinobaculum massiliae, closely related to Actinomyces spp., was first discovered in 2002. This case describes only the second human infection and the first reported skin infection due to this organism, whose normal habitat is currently unknown.

### Actinomyces: an under appreciated cause of postoperative infection in rhinoplasty [^d8faeb4e]. The Laryngoscope (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To discuss a case series of Actinomyces infection post-rhinoplasty and review the literature for correct diagnosis and management.

Study Design

Case series with chart review.

Methods

Three cases are presented of patients with a history of recurrent infectious symptoms post revision rhinoplasty later being diagnosed as Actinomyces.

Results

Three patients were identified having undergone revision rhinoplasty and later being diagnosed with Actinomyces infection. They initially presented with underwhelming physical exams, mild erythema, slight swelling, yet extreme pain. They also had periods of recurrent infection once antibiotics were stopped. Aerobic, anaerobic, fungal, and Actinomyces cultures were sent to pathology and returned positive for Actinomyces. Treatment typically involved a combination of prolonged antibiotics, incision and drainage, and/or surgical debridement.

Conclusions

Awareness of Actinomyces as a possible cause of infection post-rhinoplasty is significant as this pathogen can lead to extensive tissue destruction and fistula formation which could be detrimental for a rhinoplasty. Duration of treatment is beyond typical lengths for other infections and a specific culture for Actinomyces is required to be sent as it isn't captured in standard aerobic/anaerobic cultures. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is required by physicians to ensure that patients are evaluated thoroughly. Laryngoscope, 133:2948-2950, 2023.

### Urachal actinomycosis mimicking a urachal adenocarcinoma: case report and systematic review [^da189b5e]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Actinomycosis is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Actinomyces israelii, a Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium typically found in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. This infection can present in various clinical and radiological forms, affecting cervicofacial, thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic regions, often resembling malignancies. This extremely rare disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominopelvic masses. Accurate identification and appropriate management are challenging and depend on the clinician's suspicion. Most patients undergo surgery, and are treated concomitantly with antimicrobials; however, some studies have proven the potential of a strictly medical approach. Both surgical resection and targeted antibiotic therapy have shown to be successful treatments, with no recurrence rates reported. Therefore, increased clinical awareness and further research are needed to establish standardised diagnostic and treatment protocols that prevent unnecessary invasive treatments. The present Grand Round aims to report a rare case of a urachal mass in a man aged 64 years, with clinical, endoscopic, and radiological findings suggestive of adenocarcinoma. We also conducted a systematic review focused on the main presentations and treatment options.

### Cervicofacial primary cutaneous actinomycosis: surgical treatment for complete remission of the disease [^354e90e7]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Actinomycosis, an infectious bacterial disease caused by Actinomyces species, is very rare and is characterized by contiguous spreading, subacute to chronic granulomatous inflammation and the formation of multiple abscesses and sinus tracts that may discharge sulfur granules. Actinomycosis that presents on the skin without endogenous origin is called primary cutaneous actinomycosis, and the occurrence and treatment of primary cutaneous actinomycosis is rarely reported. This report describes the treatment of primary cervicofacial actinomycosis with a literature review, and emphasizes the importance of surgical option for complete remission of the disease.

### Pulmonary actinomycosis mimicking a lung metastasis from esophageal cancer ; a case report [^52345b9c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Actinomycosis is a rare chronic granulomatous infection caused by Actinomyces species. Actinomyces are facultative anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria. The symptom of actinomycosis is nonspecific and similar to those of other chronic suppurative chest diseases. On computed tomography (CT) and 18 F–fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), pulmonary actinomycosis presents as a slow-progressive mass lesion similarly to malignancies. Non-specific symptoms and radiological images make diagnosis of pulmonary actinomycosis difficult. In previous case reports, pulmonary actinomycoses were occasionally resected as pulmonary neoplasms because of its difficult diagnosis. Here we report a case of pulmonary actinomycosis mimicking a lung metastasis from esophageal cancer.

### Thoracic actinomycosis: CT features with histopathologic correlation [^0eff4fff]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Thoracic actinomycosis is a chronic suppurative pulmonary or endobronchial infection caused by Actinomyces israelii, a gram-positive anaerobic organism. We present the CT features of thoracic actinomycosis with histopathologic correlation.

Conclusion

The typical CT feature of parenchymal actinomycosis is a chronic segmental air-space consolidation containing necrotic low-attenuation areas with frequent cavity formation. A broncholith can be secondarily infected with Actinomyces organisms, resulting in endobronchial actinomycosis. It usually manifests as a proximal endobronchial calcification associated with distal obstructive pneumonia.

### Bacteria that masquerade as fungi: actinomycosis / Nocardia [^a718588e]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2010). Low credibility.

The order Actinomycetales includes phylogenetically diverse but morphologically similar aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that exhibit filamentous branching structures which fragment into bacillary or coccoid forms. The aerobic actinomyces are a large, diverse group of gram-positive bacteria including Nocardia, Gordona, Tsukamurella, Streptomyces, Rhodococcus, Streptomycetes, Mycobacteria, and Corynebacteria. The anaerobic genera of medical importance include Actinomyces, Arachnia, Rothia, and Bifidobacterium. Both Actinomyces and Nocardia cause similar clinical syndromes involving the lung, bone and joint, soft tissue, and the central nervous system. The medically important Actinomyces organisms cause infections characterized by chronic progression, abscess formation with fistulous tracts and draining sinuses. Called "great masqueraders," diagnosis of actinomycosis and nocardiosis is often delayed. Once recognized, treatment of these infections requires long courses of parenteral and oral therapy. This review will compare and contrast infections due to Actinomyces and Nocardia.

### A rare case of ascending colon actinomycosis mimicking cancer [^27c091b0]. BMC Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Actinomycosis is an uncommon inflammatory entity caused by the universally distributed anaerobic bacterium, Actinomyces Israeli. This Actinomyces is a gram-positive, rather microaerophilic bacterium, which consists a component of the normal human flora. Actinomyces requires the presence of many other bacteria, which destroy the over-vascularized regions and convert aerobic microenvironment to an anaerobic one. Then it's easy for Actinomyces to migrate, infect and proliferate in already injured tissue. Primary bowel involvement is rare, although it has been increased in frequency over the last years. The most common sites of the disease are the transverse colon and the cecum with the appendix.

Actinomycosis can mimic other abdominal diseases as diverticulitis, abscesses, inflammatory bowel disease and malignant tumors, presenting a diagnostic challenge, and identified post-operatively in most of the cases.

The treatment of choice is antibiotic administration, whenever it is possible due to diagnostic difficulties, although in most cases surgical intervention is performed Diagnosis can be achieved with endoscopy and imaging techniques, as computed tomography (CT scan) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We present a rare case of right colon actinomycosis mimicking malignant tumor, causing bowel obstruction. The diagnosis was achieved only postoperatively.

### Abdominal actinomycosis [^64b66143]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2003). Low credibility.

Intra-abdominal and extraperitoneal actinomycosis are rare infections, caused by different Actinomyces species. However, they have been diagnosed more frequently in the last ten years. We report three cases of abdominal actinomycosis and a literature review of the last eight years. All three patients were diagnosed by means of histopathologic examination only. In one case, an intrauterine device (IUD) was associated with the infection. Therapy consisted of surgical resection of the inflammatory, infected tissue, and long-term antibiotic therapy. All patients are free of recurrence. Abdominal actinomycosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of an abdominal pathology of insidious onset, especially when an IUD is in place. Even when infection had spread extensively, combined operative and antibiotic therapy cured most of the cases.

### Erythematous pustules and plaques following a dental procedure [^5dacdcaf]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Answers: 
A. Actinomycosis – Correct. Actinomyces is a slow-growing bacteria that requires an anaerobic environment, which can be missed on routine aerobic culture. Histologically, Actinomyces is a nonacid-fast gram-stain-positive filamentous rod. Cervicofacial actinomycosis presents with nonspecific symptoms that can mimic granulomatous disorders and cancers. Notable risk factors for the development of cervicofacial actinomycosis involve penetration of the oral mucosa, generally caused by oral surgery, radiation therapy, and dental caries.
B. Nocardiosis – Incorrect. Nocardiosis can present with pulmonary, cutaneous, and central nervous system manifestations, especially in immunocompromised patients. Histologically, it stains as gram-positive filamentous rod, similar to Actinomyces. It differs from Actinomyces by its aerobic pattern of growth.
C. Mucormycosis – Incorrect. Mucormycosis can invade blood vessels, leading to thrombosis and tissue necrosis. Cutaneous mucormycosis can appear erythematous to violaceous plaques that can progress to necrosis or an eschar. Histologically, mucormycosis would present as pauci-septate hyphae with wide angle branching.
D. Blastomycosis – Incorrect. Disseminated blastomycosis can commonly have cutaneous involvement presenting as verrucous or ulcerated pustules or plaques. Primary cutaneous blastomycosis is rare and presents as papules or pustules with regional lymphadenopathy.Histologically, blastomycosis would present with broad-based budding yeasts.
E. Aspergillosis – Incorrect. Aspergillosis typically presents with pulmonary involvement and can have secondary cutaneous manifestations presenting as ulcerated papules and plaques. Cutaneous involvement typically presents in immunocompromised patients.Histologically, aspergillosis presents with septate hyphae with acute angle branching.

### Intra-abdominal co-infection with Mycobacterium bovis and Actinomyces in an AIDS patient: the first reported case and review [^84c50799]. The Journal of Infection (2007). Low credibility.

The Mycobacterium tuberculous complex and Actinomyces can both cause indolent intra-abdominal infections that result in hard mass lesion(s), oftentimes fixed to underlying tissue and involving the right ileocecal fossa region. Although Actinomyces can present as a co-pathogen when anatomic barriers are compromised, its intra-abdominal co-infection with Mycobacterium bovis has not previously been reported. We present the first reported case of intra-abdominal co-infection with Actinomyces and Mycobacterium bovis, a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB), in an AIDS patient and provide a discussion of the pathogenesis and a review of these infections, both individually and together.

### Doc, just cut my ears off – A case report of Actinomyces in bilateral chronic auricular chondritis [^12cc1c33]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Conclusion

When considering a patient with auricular pain that is refractory to anti‐inflammatory and antimicrobial agents, it is important to consider unconventional pathogens such as Actinomyces. A negative culture does not necessarily exclude the presence of Actinomyces, and draining yellow sinus tracts may assist in establishing the diagnosis. Actinomyces chondritis of the ear may represent a particularly morbid and long‐lasting pathology that requires unique treatment approaches, both medical and surgical.

### A systematic approach for discovering novel, clinically relevant bacteria [^f26033de]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene (16S) is a reference method for bacterial identification. Its expanded use has led to increased recognition of novel bacterial species. In most clinical laboratories, novel species are infrequently encountered, and their pathogenic potential is often difficult to assess. We reviewed partial 16S sequences from >26,000 clinical isolates, analyzed during February 2006-June 2010, and identified 673 that have <99% sequence identity with valid reference sequences and are thus possibly novel species. Of these 673 isolates, 111 may represent novel genera (<95% identity). Isolates from 95 novel taxa were recovered from multiple patients, indicating possible clinical relevance. Most repeatedly encountered novel taxa belonged to the genera Nocardia (14 novel taxa, 42 isolates) and Actinomyces (12 novel taxa, 52 isolates). This systematic approach for recognition of novel species with potential diagnostic or therapeutic relevance provides a basis for epidemiologic surveys and improvement of sequence databases and may lead to identification of new clinical entities.

### IUDs and colonization or infection with Actinomyces [^fdf1510c]. Contraception (2007). Low credibility.

Pelvic actinomycosis is an extremely rare disease that can occur in women with a long duration of intrauterine device (IUD) use. This type of abscess is usually unsuspected and, thus, diagnosed and treated surgically; however, long-duration treatment with penicillin can be completely effective. While the occurrence of actinomycosis is well documented by case reports, it is not possible to quantify the risk during IUD use. Approximately 7% of women using an IUD may have a finding of Actinomyces-like organisms on a Pap test. The prognostic significance of this finding is minimal because of the lack of sensitivity and specificity and a low positive predictive value. In the absence of symptoms, women with Actinomyces-like organisms on a Pap test do not need antimicrobial treatment or IUD removal.

### Actinomycotic splenic abscess: a report [^8e2c05f2]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

What we did and why?

C. Percutaneous drainage

Percutaneous drainage was performed with multiple liters of purulent non-bloody fluid drained. The patient’s course in the hospital was uneventful showing no significant signs of infection. Fluid culture showed rare white cells, 2+ growth moderate Gram-positive bacilli, and was positive for Actinomyces sp only. Intravenous antibiotic therapy was started but the patient chose to leave against medical advice.

Splenic artery embolization (SAE) is used for management of stable patients with AAST grade III–V splenic injury or contrast blush on CT of the abdomen or large amount of hemoperitoneum. Patients with focal vascular injury are managed with distal splenic artery embolization whereas proximal splenic artery embolization is more appropriate for patients with multifocal injury. Infection and abscesses are rare complications after SAE and routine antibiotic therapy is not necessary after the procedure. Typically, the presentation can be acute or delayed, the etiology is due to mixed organisms and the management involves splenectomy. Symptoms and signs include fever, leukocytosis, left upper quadrant pain, and left-sided pleural effusion.

This is the first case report of an afebrile patient who underwent percutaneous drainage and fluid culture revealed isolated Actinomyces sp. This case highlights a slow, indolent intra-abdominal Actinomyces infection and the importance and spectrum of infections possible from intravenous drug use. The microorganisms are Gram-positive, anaerobic, branching bacilli normally found in the oral cavity, colon, and female urogenital tract. There remains some debate whether angiography leads to postinterventional splenic abscesses.

### Periapical actinomycosis [^2cb407fb]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Actinomycosis is a rare chronic infection caused by species of Actinomyces and characterised by abscess formation, tissue fibrosis, suppurative lesions and fistulas with purulent discharge containing sulphur granules. Owing to its multiform manners of presentation and non-specificity from its clinical features, it has been considered as a challenging diagnosis. Periapical actinomycosis is one of the rarest forms of actinomycosis occurring in the maxillofacial region. In its occurrence it presents in the form of persistent and recurrent draining fistula in the periapical region. We report a case of periapical actinomycosis occurred in endodontically treated teeth and accidentally found to be actinomycosis during histopatological examination. An insight towards the portal of entry of the organisms into the periapical region is also discussed. The practice of sending even a tiny bit of tissues to histopathology obtained from periapical surgery will very well demonstrate this disease and help in rapid resolution through appropriate antibiotic therapy.

### An overview of thoracic actinomycosis: CT features [^f0c81b72]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Detection of ‘sulphur’ granules by gram or histologic staining is the principal method of direct detection of Actinomyces. Histopathology reveals an acute inflammation surrounded by fibrosing granulation tissue. This material contains sulphur granules, colonies of organisms forming an amorphous centre surrounded by a rosette of clubbed filaments. Direct bacterial confirmation by culture is difficult because of inadequate anaerobic culture, prior antibiotic therapy or overgrowth of concomitant organisms. Thus, culture of expectorated sputum or bronchoscopy aspirates are usually not successful, while fine-needle aspiration, transbronchial biopsy and computed tomography or ultrasound-guided biopsies lead to accurate diagnoses.

The clinical manifestation of the disease has changed to a less aggressive form compared to the pre-antibiotic era. The usual presentation is now an indolent, slowly progressive pneumonia with fever, weight loss, cough, sputum and chest pain. The symptoms and clinical and radiologic signs mimic malignancy or tuberculosis. If the disease progresses to the proximal airway and vessels, life-threatening complications such as massive haemoptysis or bronchoesophageal fistula may occur. The course of the disease depends largely on adequate and early antibiotic therapy. The principal treatment of actinomycosis is long-term use of high-dose intravenous penicillin. However, many recent studies have reported that the short-term treatment is successful and that the traditional intensive, long-term regimen is not necessary. In the setting of abscess, percutaneous drainage in combination with medical therapy may be an option. Surgical resection may be a valid option for patients who do not respond to antibiotics for up to 12 weeks according to a recent study.

An awareness of the typical imaging findings of thoracic actinomycosis helps in making an early diagnosis, preventing fatal complications and unwarranted surgery. This pictorial essay reviews the radiological type of thoracic actinomycosis.

### Establishing microbial composition measurement standards with reference frames [^93e70309]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

These ranks are still relative; a microbe that is detected to be increasing the most could still be decreasing in absolute abundance. For instance, in the tooth brushing example, ranks identified specific genera of Actinomyces to be increasing the fastest, but all of the microbes are depleted, suggesting that Actinomyces is just decreasing much less than the other microbes.

This differential is also commonly referred to as a perturbation in the context of the compositional literature. It is important to note that this does not justify applying rank-based statistical methods, such as Spearman correlation or Kruskal–Wallis, to relative abundance data since these tests do not satisfy scale invariance,.

Both the log-ratios and the differential ranking techniques satisfy scale invariance, meaning that both of these techniques are agnostic to the total microbial load. This concept is critical when analyzing relative abundance data, since this is one step closer to maintaining consistent conclusions between the original environment and the observed sequences.

False discovery rates in relative differential abundance

Attempting to estimate absolute log-fold differentials from relative abundances can result in either false-positives (FP) or false-negatives (FN) depending on the distribution of true differential abundance. Whether FNs or FPs are observed depending on a nonlinear relationship involving the true (unobserved) differential abundance. To demonstrate this, letdenote the absolute differential of the D species between two conditions, A and B. Further, letrepresent the relative differentials from compositional data. By definition, we know the following is true

If, then that will mean that for every microbe i,. This implies that there is increased microbial load in A compared to B, and that this increase will give rise to FNs. This is because the overall community increase will not be captured from the relative abundance data.

In contrast, if, then for every microbe i,. This means that there is a decrease in the absolute microbial load in A compared to B. This decline in the total community will not be captured from the relative abundances, and some of the species will be detected to be increasing, giving rise to FPs. An example of this was shown in the saliva microbiota study (Fig. 2).

### Human cervicofacial actinomycoses: microbiological data for 1997 cases [^856ffe10]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Actinomycoses are sporadically occurring endogenous polymicrobial inflammatory processes, in which fermentative actinomycetes of the genera Actinomyces, Propionibacterium, or Bifidobacterium act as the principal pathogens. Difficulties in diagnosing the disease in a timely and reliable fashion have led clinicians and microbiologists to grossly underestimate its medical importance. Therefore, we evaluated microbiological and selected clinical data derived from 1997 culture-positive cases of human cervicofacial actinomycoses examined in our laboratories during 1972-1999. The causative actinomycetes belonged to at least 9 different species, among which Actinomyces israelii and Actinomyces gerencseriae predominated. The well-known predisposition of male patients to acquire the disease varied with age and appeared to be especially pronounced in patients aged 20-60 years, the highest incidence being found in female patients aged 11-40 years and in male patients aged 21-50 years. The relevant procedures necessary for diagnosing human actinomycoses reliably, as well as details of their complex etiology, are discussed.

Intrauterine device (IUD)–associated actinomyces on cervical cytology—management is expectant for asymptomatic patients, and continued IUD use with patient education is recommended because most findings are asymptomatic and carry extremely low risk of pelvic actinomycosis. Specifically, expectant management is currently recommended for asymptomatic patients with an IUD and actinomyces found by cervical cytology screening, guidance from professional groups recommend continued IUD use and patient education about the small risk, and most IUD users with incidental actinomyces on Pap testing are asymptomatic and at extremely low risk of pelvic actinomycosis.

### Ulcerated yellow-brown nodules on the chest [^e6f7148c]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the most effective medical treatment for this disease? 
A. Initial high dose parenteral penicillin G, followed by high dose oral penicillin V
B. Metronidazole
C. Liposomal amphotericin B
D. Long-term oral fluoroquinolone therapy
E. Rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol

Answers: 
A. Initial high dose parenteral penicillin G, followed by high dose oral penicillin V – Correct. Actinomyces are non–spore-forming, anaerobic Gram positive bacteria. Long-term intensive antibiotic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for actinomycosis. Actinomyces species have traditionally shown exquisite sensitivity to penicillin; however, prolonged treatment is necessary due to poor antibiotic penetration of the thick-walled masses and sulfur granules. This typically entails 2 to 6 weeks of initial parenteral antibiotics followed by oral antibiotics for 6 to 12 months.Severe disease may require surgical management.
B. Metronidazole – Incorrect. Metronidazole should not be used to treat actinomycotic infections without added antimicrobial agents as it is not active against pathogenic actinomycetes.
C. Liposomal amphotericin B – Incorrect. Although it may sound like one, actinomycosis is not a fungal infection. Liposomal amphotericin B is the treatment of choice for mucormycosis.
D. Long-term oral fluoroquinolone therapy – Incorrect. In vitro data suggest that fluoroquinolones should be avoided in actinomycosis. Other antibiotics that should be avoided include oxacillin, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, metronidazole, and aminoglycosides.
E. Rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol – Incorrect. This combination of antibiotics is the treatment of choice for tuberculosis.

### Actinomycosis arising from the nasal cavity, with rare fatal progression [^e63af708]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Actinomycosis is a common treatable disease caused by Actinomyces, and generally has a good prognosis. However, we report a fatal case of actinomycosis of the nasal cavity. A 54-year-old man, reporting of left nasal obstruction, swelling and sharp pain around the root of the nose, was referred to our hospital. Histopathological examinations led to a definitive diagnosis of actinomycosis, and oral antibiotics were administered in an outpatient setting. However, the patient discontinued follow-up at the outpatient clinic because of the adverse effects of intravenous delivery, and poor compliance with oral antibiotic therapy led to him receiving a less than adequate dose. Thus, in the absence of sufficient antibiotic treatment, necrosis gradually progressed in the lesion, and the patient died of multiple organ failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation caused by local infection.

### Pulmonary actinomycosis: the great masquerader [^8c188c7c]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Actinomycosis is a rare but treatable disease. Thoracic manifestations are varied and can mimic malignancy or tuberculosis. We report the case of a 54-year-old man who presented with a persistent cough and radiological evidence of right upper lobe lung mass. Conventional computed tomography guided biopsy and bronchoscopy proved to be non-diagnostic. Thoracotomy and histopathologic examination of the tissue confirmed actinomycosis infection. Excellent clinical and radiologic responses were noted following treatment with penicillin V. Despite a high clinical suspicion, the diagnosis can prove to be challenging.

### Actinomyces cardiffensis sp. nov. from human clinical sources [^ca3deba2]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2002). Low credibility.

Eight strains of a previously undescribed catalase-negative Actinomyces-like bacterium were recovered from human clinical specimens. The morphological and biochemical characteristics of the isolates were consistent with their assignment to the genus Actinomyces, but they did not appear to correspond to any recognized species. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed the organisms represent a hitherto unknown species within the genus Actinomyces related to, albeit distinct from, a group of species which includes Actinomyces turicensis and close relatives. Based on biochemical and molecular genetic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown isolates from human clinical sources be classified as a new species, Actinomyces cardiffensis sp. nov. The type strain of Actinomyces cardiffensis is CCUG 44997(T).

### Establishing microbial composition measurement standards with reference frames [^010bd9fa]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The log-ratio of Actinomyces and Haemophilus between the relative and the absolute abundance data is identical. While we cannot observe the decrease of Haemophilus or the consistency of Actinomyces abundance, with the log-ratio of their relative abundance we can observe the interaction between these two taxa and the increase of Actinomyces relative to Haemophilus after brushing teeth (t -statistic = 5.289, p -value = 9.07 × 10 −5).

These results are consistent with our knowledge about oral biogeography. Haemophilus is typically found on the periphery of oral biofilms and was likely removed from the biofilm during the brushing process, whereas Actinomyces is generally found on the surface of the tooth and acts as an anchor for biofilm attachment. Importantly, this experiment demonstrates the potential fallibility of relying on relative abundance; it is incorrect to conclude that Actinomyces increases after tooth brushing despite the increase in relative abundance. As demonstrated by flow cytometry, total microbial load decreases, and while both Haemophilus and Actinomyces decrease, Haemophilus decreases more.

To investigate how other compositional methods perform, we ran ANCOM and ALDEx2 on the same dataset (Fig. 2e). ALDEx2 did not identify any of the microbes to be changing, which contradicts flow-cytometry measurements that show there is a large decrease in the microbial community after tooth brushing. ANCOM identified multiple significantly changing microbes. One of these detected microbes was Veillonella, which conflicts with absolute abundances suggesting that Veillonella is not significantly changing (t -statistic = 1.04, p -value = 0.315). The false-positive detected by ANCOM likely arose due to their choice of reference frame (Supplementary Fig. 1).

### Actinomyces in chronic granulomatous disease: an emerging and unanticipated pathogen [^83f9f39a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare inherited disease of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase system that causes defective production of toxic oxygen metabolites, impaired bacterial and fungal killing, and recurrent life-threatening infections, mostly by catalase-producing organisms. We report for the first time, to our knowledge, chronic infections with Actinomyces species in 10 patients with CGD. Actinomycosis is a chronic granulomatous condition that commonly manifests as cervicofacial, pulmonary, or abdominal disease, caused by slowly progressive infection with oral and gastrointestinal commensal Actinomyces species. Treatment of actinomycosis is usually simple in immunocompetent individuals, requiring long-term, high-dose intravenous penicillin, but is more complicated in those with CGD because of delayed diagnosis and an increased risk of chronic invasive or debilitating disease.

Methods

Actinomyces was identified by culture, staining, 16S ribosomal DNA polymerase chain reaction, and/or a complement fixation test in 10 patients with CGD.

Results

All 10 patients presented with a history of fever and elevated inflammatory signs without evident focus. Diagnosis was delayed and clinical course severe and protracted despite high-dose intravenous antibiotic therapy and/or surgery. These results suggest an unrecognized and unanticipated susceptibility to weakly pathogenic Actinomyces species in patients with CGD because these are catalase-negative organisms previously thought to be nonpathogenic in CGD.

Conclusions

Actinomycosis should be vigorously sought and promptly treated in patients with CGD presenting with uncommon and prolonged clinical signs of infection. Actinomycosis is a catalase-negative infection important to consider in CGD.

### Chronic madura foot: mycetoma and / orspp or actinomycosis [^974b838a]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Learning points

Actinomyces bacterial infections have been reported in body regions that include cervicofacial, abdominopelvic and pulmonothoracic. However, here we show its presentation as the cause of Madura foot.
Management requires aggressive control of any soft tissue invasive mass, often followed by prolonged antibiotic therapy.
Surveillance is required due to the tendency of actinomycosis to recur. Repeated clinical assessment, imaging and/or biopsy may prove useful in tracking this chronic and persistent pathology.
For mass lesions, surgical debulking may improve quality of life and aid in ‘source control’ for greater antibiotic therapy success.

The authors present a case of maxillary sinus actinomycosis in a young adult woman.This is a rare condition whose unspecific clinical presentation makes its diagnosis challenging. In this case, the diagnosis was given by the identification of Actinomyces colonies in samples of infected tissue.Treatment consisted of a combined medical and surgical approach. Endoscopic sinus surgery was performed to remove diseased mucosa and to aerate the involved sinuses, followed by long-term antibiotic therapy. No recurrence of the disease was observed during follow-up.

### Actinomycosis withempyema [^3eb5ee83]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Actinomyces , are gram-positive, non-spore forming anaerobic or microaerophilic species. Empyema due to actinomycosis is relatively rare and can be difficult to diagnose as the presenting symptoms may be indolent and the micro-organism may be difficult to culture. This case report describes a patient presenting with dyspnoea, weight loss and lethargy. The chest radiograph, CT and thoracic ultrasound revealed a left-sided pleural effusion. A chest drain was inserted under ultrasound guidance. The pleural fluid was macroscopically consistent with pus and microbiology showed growth of gram-positive bacilli, Actinomyces meyeri as well as the Fusobacterium species. The patient was treated with a drainage of the pleural fluid, a prolonged course of antibiotics and made a good recovery. The awareness that the Actinomyces species and the Fusobacterium species through their synergistic interaction may cause empyema, may lead to a timely diagnosis and treatment.

### An overview of thoracic actinomycosis: CT features [^9f75b7cf]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Actinomycetes are branching gram-positive anaerobic bacteria belonging to the Actinomyceataceae family and are commensal in the human oropharynx, gastrointestinal tract and female genitalia. It is a rare infection that in the past has been reported to occur in 1 in 300,000 people per year. The incidence of all forms of actinomycosis has declined markedly in the last 3 to 4 decades. The infection can involve every organ of the body, and pulmonary actinomycosis is the third most common type after cervicofacial and abdomino-pelvic forms. The pulmonary form of actinomycosis constitutes 15 % of the total burden of disease, although estimates of up to 50 % have been reported. Pulmonary actinomycosis has worldwide distribution and has no age or race predilection, although men acquire the disease slightly more often than women (in an approximately 3:1 ratio), and children are rarely affected. A higher incidence of pulmonary actinomycosis has been reported in patients with underlying respiratory disorders such as emphysema, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis and any condition in which the lung parenchyma are destroyed by a previous infection. Alcoholism, poor oral hygiene, dental disease, and facial or dental trauma are important risk factors for the thoracic form. Various chronic debilitating diseases and conditions may facilitate respiratory tract infection, including being at risk for aspiration and having diabetes mellitus, neurologic and psychiatric diseases, malnutrition, drug abuse and hiatal hernia. Unlike in many other unusual granulomatous infectious diseases, the infection rate does not seem to be increased in immunocompromised patients, such as those with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, undergoing chemotherapy, or on steroid or immunosuppressive therapy.

### An atypical form of cervicofacial actinomycosis treated with short but intensive antibiotic regimen [^45ced38d]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Human actinomycosis is a rare soft tissue infection caused by Gram-positive, anaerobic bacteria Actinomyces israelii, a commensal of the oral cavity. The major clinical forms of actinomycosis are cervicofacial, thoracic, abdominal and pelvic forms. The cervicofacial region is most commonly affected. Actinomycosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose and it should be borne in mind in the differential diagnosis of numerous infectious and non-infectious diseases. We report a patient who came with tooth pain and extra-oral swelling which later on presented as multiple draining sinuses. Our initial suspicion was dento-alveolar abscess or osteomyelitis. However, a culture of the discharge and subsequent biopsy revealed actinomycetes, confirming cervicofacial actinomycosis, but presenting itself not as the typical 'lumpy jaw'. The patient was successfully treated conservatively with a short but intensive antibiotic course.

### Actinomyces infectious crystalline keratopathy (...) [^ab4af9ab]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Histopathologic photomicrographs of intrastromal colonies of filamentous, branching, gram-positive bacteria consistent with Actinomyces species with minimal associated inflammation, showing staining with periodic acid–Schiff stain, hematoxylin-eosin stain, and Brown-Hopps stain. She was referred to our service for treatment of corneal ulceration in the nasal and temporal portions of the graft. Corneal scrapings revealed no organisms on Gram or Giemsa staining, and no organisms grew on aerobic, anaerobic, fungal, or viral cultures. She was treated with fortified cefazolin and gentamicin sulfate eyedrops but developed 2 new stromal infiltrates and required repeat PKP. Repeat corneal ulceration prompted another PKP with removal of a 1-mm-larger disc to encompass the previous graft and additional host cornea affected by ulceration and thinning.

Histopathologic analysis of the removed cornea revealed acute and chronic keratitis associated with centrifugal intrastromal colonies of strongly and uniformly gram-positive bacteria with short, stubby branches typical of Actinomyces species. Ziehl-Neelson acid-fast staining was negative, suggesting Actinomyces rather than Nocardia species. Cultures of stromal tissue again were negative. Actinomyces can be a rare cause of infectious crystalline keratopathy, especially in an immune-suppressed condition such as a corneal graft. Infectious crystalline keratopathy is a unique corneal infection characterized by the slowly progressive development of needlelike opacities in the corneal stroma, most commonly caused by streptococcal species. 1, 2 To our knowledge, this is the first case of infectious crystalline keratopathy due to an organism with morphologic characteristics consistent with Actinomyces. There have been other rare reports of Actinomyces corneal infections.

Severe corneal ulceration from Actinomyces has been reported, 3 as has delayed-onset keratitis after laser in situ keratomileusis. 4 In both of these cases, cure was achieved with debridement of the infected cornea and intensive treatment with topical antibiotics, as well as oral penicillin in the case of the corneal ulcer.

### Actinobaculum schaalii: review of an emerging uropathogen [^72cff31b]. The Journal of Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Actinobaculum schaalii is a facultative anaerobic, Gram-positive rod-shaped species phylogenetically related to Actinomyces that is likely part of the commensal flora of the human genitourinary tract. Because of its fastidious growth under aerobic conditions and its resemblance to bacteria of the resident flora, A. schaalii is frequently overlooked or considered as a contaminant. It is also difficult to identify phenotypically, still requiring molecular identification. Note that the recent technology of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight-mass spectrometry could be a promising tool for its identification. Recent studies using sensitive PCR assays showed that its clinical significance was largely underestimated. Since its first description in 1997, A. schaalii has been responsible for numerous urinary tract infections (UTIs), mainly in elderly (usually >60 years) and patients with underlying urological conditions. Infected urines usually show many Gram-positive rods with significant leukocyturia and a negative test for nitrites. Numerous cases of severe infections have also been described, such as urosepsis, bacteremia, cellulitis, spondylodiscitis, and endocarditis. In vitro, A. schaalii is highly susceptible to β-lactams but it is resistant to ciprofloxacin and cotrimoxazole, first-choice antimicrobials for the oral treatment of UTIs. A penicillin (e.g. amoxicillin) or a cephalosporin (e.g. cefuroxime, ceftriaxone) should be the preferred treatment.

Thoracopulmonary actinomycosis can mimic various lung pathologies such as bronchogenic carcinoma, tuberculosis and fungal pneumonia, to name but a few. The common causative agent is Actinomyces israelii. The disease is successfully diagnosed only if there is a high index of suspicion and a thorough evaluation with multidisciplinary involvement. We present a case of thoracopulmonary actinomycosis in a young immunocompetent man who did not have any predisposing illness, and who was treated initially for pulmonary tuberculosis. He showed good response to injection crystalline penicillin, which was later changed to oral amoxicillin.

### Actinomyces in infected osteoradionecrosis – underestimated? [^93c6aafd]. Human Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

Infected osteoradionecrosis (IORN) is a severe complication of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. Infected osteoradionecrosis can lead to fracture and often requires subsequent jaw resection. It is known that irradiated bone is highly susceptible to infections, mainly with Candida species and cariogenic bacteria. Only very few data exist on Actinomyces in IORN. The study population consisted of 31 patients (7 female, 24 male; median age, 58.3 years). All patients exhibited clinical and radiological signs of IORN (infection, mucosa or skin fistula, and sequestrated bone). To detect Actinomyces colonies, histological examination was performed using several staining procedures (hematoxylin-eosin, Gram, Grocott, periodic acid-Schiff). In addition, a semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach was designed targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. We found prominent Actinomyces colonies in 20 (64.5%) of 31 patients. Most of these lesions were localized in the mandible (16/20). Most interestingly, Actinomyces were almost exclusively found attached to the necrotic bone. PCR testing confirmed the presence of Actinomyces-specific DNA sequences (Actinomyces israelii). We show that Actinomyces is considerably more frequent in IORN than previously demonstrated. We suggest that these organisms are involved in the chronic, nonhealing inflammatory processes and the purulent discharge, which are known as characteristics of IORN. It remains to be investigated whether Actinomyces could be involved in the osteolytic mechanisms. From the histopathologic perspective, detection of Actinomyces is important because these bacteria have been shown to be associated with prolonged treatment duration.

### Broncholithiasis secondary to pulmonary actinomycosis [^de1b6aa2]. Respiratory Care (2014). Low credibility.

We report a case of broncholithiasis secondary to pulmonary actinomycosis. Broncholithiasis has occasionally been reported in association with actinomycosis, but it is unclear if actinomycosis leads to lymph node calcification with subsequent erosion into the airway, producing a broncholith, or if an existing generic broncholith is secondarily colonized with Actinomyces. The patient had post-obstruction pneumonia, and computed tomography showed calcified nodules obstructing the bronchus intermedius and distal necrotizing pneumonia. The nodules included sulfur granules containing Gram-positive branching filamentous organisms consistent with Actinomyces. The finding of Actinomyces throughout the broncholith is strong evidence that the etiology of the broncholithiasis was a primary pulmonary Actinomyces infection.

### Paranasal sinus actinomycosis treated with a combination of surgery and long-term low-dose macrolide [^ac95fe5f]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Actinomycosis is a bacterial infection caused by actinomyces. Although almost 50% of cases are related to the head and neck region, those in the nose and paranasal sinuses (PNS) are rare. Actinomycosis of the PNS is presumed to be typically caused by dental caries, dental manipulation, and maxillofacial trauma, which facilitate the penetration of oral pathogens into the sinus, and should thus be treated by the combination of surgical removal and potent antibiotics for at least two months. The current use of these antibiotics might be redundant, considering the nature of actinomycosis of the PNS, which does not invade the mucosal surface. We herein report a 67-year-old female treated with endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) and diagnosed with actinomycosis of the PNS by pathological findings. She had no history of dental impairment or treatment. She was given routine perioperative prophylactic antibiotics (cefazolin) during the surgery, followed by low-dose clarithromycin. The mucosa of the PNS normalized without any discharge by three months after the operation. The patient is a valuable example that should prompt reconsideration of the commonly accepted pathogenesis and treatment of actinomycosis of the PNS.

### Invasive sinonasal actinomycosis: case report and literature review [^24837609]. The Laryngoscope (2013). Low credibility.

Actinomycosis is a rare anaerobic bacterial infection typically caused by Actinomyces israelii. Although part of normal flora in the oral cavity, and respiratory and digestive tracts, A israelii can give rise to pathologic infections most commonly reported in the oral cavity from odontogenic causes. We present a rare case of invasive actinomycosis presenting with extensive midface destruction involving the maxilla and paranasal sinuses, with mucosal necrosis mimicking an aggressive neoplasm. The diagnosis is usually reached only after histopathologic analysis showing characteristic sulfur granules with filamentous gram-positive, non-acid-fast bacteria. We review the literature on its epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.

### Endometriosis MR mimickers: T2-hypointense lesions [^69b80dfe]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Actinomycosis

Actinomycosis is a chronic granulomatous disease and bacterial infection caused by Actinomyces species. Infections of the female genital tract with Actinomyces represent 20% of cases and may be caused by surgery, perforation of the bowel, or foreign bodies, such as intrauterine devices (IUD). Actinomycosis associated with an IUD typically affects the pelvic area and affected patients often present with chronic pelvic pain and insidious symptoms. Pelvic actinomycosis can extend extensively, reaching a severity comparable to that of a frozen pelvis, which can resemble pelvic malignancy or endometriosis. The intraabdominal extension typically occurs through contiguous spread, as the actinomycosis bacteria produce proteolytic enzymes that enable crossing of normal anatomical barriers. This can result in an infiltrating retractile pattern with firm fibrotic tissue, and in some cases, the formation of abscesses and/or fistulas.

Pelvic actinomycosis shows prominent fibrotic tissue and inflammatory stranding, resulting in intermediate to low signal intensity on T2-WI. The mass exhibits mild to marked enhancement, aiding in the differential diagnosis (Fig. 9). High signal intensity components on T1-WI due to hyperproteic content or free radicals are rare, with mild intensity seen within necrotic areas. Surgical intervention should be avoided, and a CT-guided needle biopsy is preferred for definitive microbiological diagnosis prior to initiating medical treatment.

### Pulmonary actinomycosis mimicking a lung metastasis from esophageal cancer ; a case report [^9d3a19df]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Actinomycosis is a rare and chronic bacterial infection caused by Actinomyces species. Actinomyces israelii is one of the Actinomyces species. Actinomyces can colonize the cervicofacial, thoracic, abdominal, pelvic lesions, skin, brain and other organs. Pulmonary actinomycosis accounts for 15% of all actinomycoses, and is mainly caused by aspiration of oral saphrophytes into respiratory tracts. As actinomycosis can develop after dental care or aspiration, careful history taking is necessary for old ages. Sputum examination and culture is difficult to detect pathogenic bacteria, because Actinomyces are anaerobic and exist in normal oral cavity. Clinical symptoms of pulmonary actinomycosis include chest pain, chronic cough, hemoptysis, fever and chill, but actinomycosis frequently has no symptoms. Nonspecific symptoms or no symptoms make a definitive diagnosis difficult. Radiologically, pulmonary actinomycosis presents as a slow-progressive consolidation or mass-like shadow. Pulmonary actinomycosis often has central attenuation area or dilation bronchiole shadow on CT. Central low attenuation area consists of one or more, round or oval low attenuation area at the center of the shadow, which is characteristic of pulmonary actinomycosis. 18 F–FDG PET/CT is useful for detecting malignancies including metastases in the whole body, but various inflammations and infections also have FDG uptake. The interpretation of PET/CT finding needs to be careful with primary malignant lesions. Even experienced physicians could delay diagnosis or misdiagnose with tuberculosis or lung cancer. For a definitive diagnosis, biopsy is often required. However, success of CT-guided, ultrasound-guided, or bronchial biopsy is dependent on the location of pulmonary mass. Lung resection was occasionally performed as a diagnosis of pulmonary neoplasm and pulmonary actinomycosis was diagnosed by the pathology of the resected lung specimens. Regarding to the therapy of actinomycoces, almost all Actinomyces is sensitive to penicillin. For Actinomyces forming chronic granulation, penicillin in high doses is usually needed for long duration (6–12 months) to prevent relapse. Risk factors associated with the acquisition of Actinomyces are diabetes mellitus, male sex, and immunosuppressive condition such as a use of steroid and alcoholism. In this case, the patient’s long-term diabetes mellitus is considered to be a risk factor for infection of Actinomyces. The patient had primary esophageal cancer and past history of primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma, which made a diagnosis difficult. However, a high fever after starting chemotherapy gave us a clue of the infection and prompted us to perform needle aspiration of the pleural effusion.

### Short-term treatment of actinomycosis: two cases and a review [^d9416a29]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Recommendations for prolonged penicillin treatment of actinomycosis date from the early antibiotic era, when patients often presented with neglected, advanced disease and received interrupted therapy at suboptimal dosages. This report describes cases of esophageal and of cervicofacial actinomycosis treated successfully with short-term antibiotic therapy and reviews the literature. Many patients are cured with <6 months of antibiotic therapy. If short-term antibiotic treatment is attempted, the clinical and radiological response should be closely monitored. Cervicofacial actinomycosis is especially responsive to brief courses of antibiotic treatment.

### Palatine tonsilloliths and: a multi-institutional study of adult patients undergoing tonsillectomy [^323fc100]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To better characterize associations between Actinomyces and tonsillolith versus nontonsillolith tonsillectomy specimens.

Study Design

Bi-institutional retrospective case-case study.

Setting

University and county hospital.

Subjects and Methods

Adult patients with a clinical history of tonsilloliths who underwent tonsillectomy from January 2006 to December 2018 were included. Patients undergoing tonsillectomy for tonsillar hypertrophy and chronic tonsillitis were identified as comparative cases. Similarly, patients with ipsilateral oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) who underwent contralateral tonsillectomy of a normal-appearing tonsil for prophylaxis against a second primary cancer were also included as comparative cases.

Results

The study population comprised 134 patients who underwent tonsillectomy: 62 tonsillolith and 72 nontonsillolith (tonsillar hypertrophy, n = 30; chronic tonsillitis, n = 30; normal-appearing contralateral tonsil in patients with ipsilateral OPC, n = 12). Actinomyces was reported in 11% of the patients with tonsilloliths on initial pathology reports but in 95% after re-evaluation (n = 54 of 57). Actinomyces prevalence was significantly higher in patients with tonsilloliths as compared with patients with recurrent tonsillitis (73%, n = 22 of 30, P < .001) and normal-appearing contralateral tonsils in patients with ipsilateral OPC (58%, n = 7 of 12, P < .001). Actinomyces prevalence was not significantly different between patients with tonsilloliths and tonsillar hypertrophy (83%, n = 25 of 30, P = .11).

Conclusion

The prevalence of Actinomyces in tonsillolith tonsil specimens is high; however, Actinomyces routinely colonizes nontonsillolith tonsil specimens. Therefore, Actinomyces is unlikely to be the primary driver of tonsillolith pathogenesis, and Actinomyces- targeted treatment of tonsilloliths may not be effective. Treatment strategies addressing tonsilloliths should be further investigated.

### Actinomyces neuii isolated from a 20-month-old girl with cervical lymphadenitis [^53c00856]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2015). Low credibility.

Actinomycetes are Gram-positive bacteria that can be part of the normal human flora of the gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and genital tract. Infections are rare, slowly progressing and most commonly affect the cervicofacial region. Actinomyces israelii is the most frequently isolated species but a number of other species may cause infection. We report the first postnatally acquired case of an actinomycosis caused by A. neuii in a child. We also provide a systematic review of all published cases of A. neuii infections. In children, there is one case report of a premature infant with perinatally acquired A. neuii sepsis. In adults 21 cases have currently been reported and A. neuii infection was associated with endophthalmitis after eye surgery, foreign material-associated infection and abscess formation in the inguinal, axillary, and mammary area. Our case highlights that a A. neuii infection is also a potential differential diagnosis in children with chronic lymphadenitis.

### Actinomycosis of the temporal bone: a report of a case [^06cd266e]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Actinomycosis is a chronic suppurative infection of the cervicofacial region caused by Actinomyces species, which are anaerobic, gram-positive filamentous bacteria. Although actinomycosis has a propensity for involving the oral cavity, rare cases of actinomycosis involving the temporal bone have been published. We report the case of a 14-year-old girl who presented with clinical, audiometric, and radiologic findings consistent with right chronic suppurative otitis media that persisted despite tympanomastoidectomy. Findings on histologic evaluation of a specimen obtained during revision surgery were consistent with a diagnosis of actinomycosis. Although actinomycosis of the temporal bone is rare, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic suppurative temporal bone infections that are resistant to standard therapy.

### An overview of thoracic actinomycosis: CT features [^e10f56cf]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Bronchiectatic actinomycosis

Actinomyces has a tendency to colonise devitalised tissue. Actinomyces spp. colonise in the dilated bronchi and exacerbate pre-existing bronchial inflammation and bronchiectasis. Previous infections resulting in lung destruction such as tuberculosis and bacterial infections predispose patients to actinomycosis (Fig. 5). Common co-pathogens for thoracic actinomycosis have been described as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Staphylococci, Streptococci, Haemophilus spp. and Aspergillus. The pathogenesis of co-infection is a synergistic effect: oxygen deprivation due to other bacteria creates an anaerobic milieu in which actinomyces thrive (Fig. 6). CT features of the bronchiectatic form include localised areas of bronchiectasis, irregular bronchial wall thickening, and irregular peribronchial consolidation with or without abscess formation. The parenchymal type and bronchiectatic form may occur simultaneously. It is sometimes difficult to differentiate cystic bronchiectasis from central low attenuated necrotic areas of the parenchymal type (Fig. 7).

### Genotypic diversity of clinical Actinomyces species: phenotype, source, and disease correlation among genospecies [^5fd17373]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2002). Low credibility.

We determined the frequency distribution of Actinomyces spp. recovered in a routine clinical laboratory and investigated the clinical significance of accurate identification to the species level. We identified 92 clinical strains of Actinomyces, including 13 strains in the related Arcanobacterium-Actinobaculum taxon, by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and recorded their biotypes, sources, and disease associations. The clinical isolates clustered into 21 genogroups. Twelve genogroups (74 strains) correlated with a known species, and nine genogroups (17 strains) did not. The individual species had source and disease correlates. Actinomyces turicensis was the most frequently isolated species and was associated with genitourinary tract specimens, often with other organisms and rarely with inflammatory cells. Actinomyces radingae was most often associated with serious, chronic soft tissue abscesses of the breast, chest, and back. Actinomyces europaeus was associated with skin abscesses of the neck and genital areas. Actinomyces lingnae, Actinomyces gravenitzii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, and Actinomyces meyeri were isolated from respiratory specimens, while A. odontolyticus-like strains were isolated from diverse sources. Several of the species were commonly coisolated with a particular bacterium: Actinomyces israelii was the only Actinomyces spp. coisolated with Actinobacillus (Haemophilus) actinomycetemcomitans; Actinomyces meyeri was coisolated with Peptostreptococcus micros and was the only species other than A. israelii associated with sulfur granules in histological specimens. Most genogroups had consistent biotypes (as determined with the RapID ANA II system); however, strains were misidentified, and many codes were not in the database. One biotype was common to several genogroups, with all of these isolates being identified as A. meyeri. Despite the recent description of new Actinomyces spp., 19% of the isolates recovered in our routine laboratory belonged to novel genospecies. One novel group with three strains, Actinomyces houstonensis sp. nov., was phenotypically similar to A. meyeri and A. turicensis but was genotypically closest to Actinomyces neuii. A. houstonensis sp. nov. was associated with abscesses. Our data documented consistent site and disease associations for 21 genogroups of Actinomyces spp. that provide greater insights into appropriate treatments. However, we also demonstrated a complexity within the Actinomyces genus that compromises the biochemical identification of Actinomyces that can be performed in most clinical laboratories. It is our hope that this large group of well-defined strains will be used to find a simple and accurate biochemical test for differentiation of the species in routine laboratories.

### Identification of a novel 16S rRNA gene variant of Actinomyces funkei from six patients with purulent infections [^9c4f5a6e]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Little is known about the clinical significance and laboratory diagnosis of Actinomyces funkei. In this report we describe six clinical cases where A. funkei was isolated from purulent, polymicrobial infections. Conventional identification procedures were compared with molecular methods including matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry technique. Analysis of the full 16S rRNA gene sequence of the six investigated strains revealed differences from the A. funkei type strain. DNA-DNA hybridization showed that the clinical strains represent a novel 16S rRNA gene variant within the species of A. funkei.

### A rare case of male Fournier's gangrene with mixed Actinomyces turicensis infection [^1d6272a7]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

In treatment, given the patient’s relatively good general condition at admission, we gave him radical and repeated debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics in time. Regarding the choice of antibiotics, although the result of the first germiculture only suggested Actinomyces as the causative organism, it is known that most actinomycotic infections are polymicrobial, because some concomitant aerobes (such as Escherichia coli, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus) consume oxygen to make the environment more conducive to the growth and proliferation of Actinomyces and strict anaerobes. Combined with the pathogenic features of A. turicensis and the relevant clinical history (the onset of his symptoms following forced defecation) and symptoms of the patient, we considered that the patient suffered from a polymicrobial enterogenic infection. Accounting for the fulminant progress and high level of mortality of FG and the possible long period of identifying certain microbes, we immediately applied broad-spectrum antibiotics after the first debridement and later replaced the antimicrobial agents with those covering A. turicensis. Importantly, surveillance standards for Actinomyces are lacking in both the World Health Organization and developed countries as its importance as a pathogen has been neglected for a long time. Without commercial kits, antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Actinomyces species is performed in only a few clinical microbiology laboratories, so empirical medication is widely accepted.

### A rare case of male Fournier's gangrene with mixed Actinomyces turicensis infection [^f9b5db6e]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Fournier's gangrene (FG), a urological emergency with high mortality, is an infectious necrotizing fasciitis of the perineal and genital regions. The majority of FG is caused by polymicrobial organisms involving mixed aerobes and anaerobes but rarely reveals Actinomyces species.

Case presentation

We report a healthy 67-year-old Asian male who presented with rapidly progressive painful swelling of the scrotum. Clinically diagnosed with FG, the patient underwent an emergency radical debridement, followed by broad-spectrum antibiotics and negative pressure wound therapy. The identification of the causative microorganisms showed Actinomyces turicensis and the antibiotic treatment was adjusted accordingly. After wound bed preparation, we took split-thickness skin grafts to cover the scrotal wound. Active management to minimize faecal contamination was applied throughout the whole course of treatment and repair. The patient was satisfied with the outcome. This was an extremely rare case of A. turicensis as the main causative pathogen of FG.

Conclusions

FG due to Actinomyces species is rarely reported, but we should still consider this pathogenic microorganism that has long been neglected.

### Cervicofacial actinomycosis of the mandible in a paediatric patient [^b8031511]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Cervicofacial actinomycosis remains a rare pathogenic finding in the paediatric population. Diagnosis is challenging, as findings are often non-specific and Actinomyces species are generally difficult to culture. Treatment is a prolonged course of antibiotics, either intravenous and oral, often combined with a surgical procedure to remove the lesion. This patient had non-specific intermittent left mandibular pain for 8months that was eventually attributed to an Actinomyces odontolyticus infection in the mandible. Diagnosis required incisional biopsy, and treatment involved 12 months of oral antibiotics.

Question 2: Which of the following risk factors is associated with this disease? 
A. Exposure to soil, organic matter, or aquatic habitats
B. Advanced age
C. Iron overload
D. Tropical climate
E. Poor oral hygiene

Answers: 
A. Exposure to soil, organic matter, or aquatic habitats – Incorrect. Environmental exposure via inhalation or direct inoculation is more typical of Nocardia infections, which are ubiquitous environmental saprophytes. In contrast, Actinomyces species are exclusively endogenous organisms that colonize human mucous membranes and have never been cultured from nature.
B. Advanced age – Incorrect. The peak incidence of actinomycosis has been reported to be from 30 to 60 years old, with incidence declining above the age of 60 years.
C. Iron overload – Incorrect. Iron overload is a risk factor for mucormycosis, particularly in the setting of iron chelation with deferoxamine.
D. Tropical climate – Incorrect. Actinomycosis is an endogenous organism that colonizes human mucous membranes, and the incidence of the disease is not related to geography.
E. Poor oral hygiene – Correct. Poor oral hygiene facilitates the growth of Actinomyces species, colonizers of the human oral mucosa. Aspiration of oral secretions then predisposes to the development of pulmonary infection. Accordingly, cervicofacial actinomycosis is the most common manifestation of actinomycosis, accounting for 50% of all cases, whereas central nervous system, thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic actinomycosis occur less frequently.

Group 1–outer eye infections—collection media and swab selection are outlined as follows: UTM is recommended for viral culture and, if swabs are used, only dacron, rayon, and flocculated swabs are acceptable for molecular testing. A dichotomous classification distinguishes sites where isolation of commensal microbiota may represent normal microbiota (Group 1-Outer Eye) from tissues where isolation is more likely to represent true infection (Group 2-Inner Eye). Culture of purulent lesions and expressed concretions from clogged ducts are highest yield, particularly for anaerobic bacteria such as Actinomyces. Cotton and calcium alginate swabs should not be used because they inhibit bacterial growth (notably Neisseria species), and dry lesions may benefit from swabs pre-moistened with sterile saline.

Actinomycosis is an uncommon infection caused by Actinomyces species, and the diagnosis is often challenging owing to low prevalence and diverse clinical manifestations. Pericardial involvement of actinomycosis is particularly rare. Here, we present a case of a 79-year-old man who initially complained of exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and decreased urine amount. There was no fever, chest pain, or productive cough. Physical examination was remarkable for decreased breath sounds at the left lower lung field. Poor dental hygiene and a firm, well-defined mass without discharge over the hard palate were noted. Echocardiography revealed reduced ejection fraction of the left ventricle, global hypokinesia, and thickened pericardium (> 5 mm) with a small amount of pericardial effusion. On admission, the patient underwent diagnostic thoracentesis, and the results suggested an exudate. However, bacterial and fungal cultures were all negative. There was no malignant cell by cytology. Computed tomography revealed contrast-enhanced pericardial nodular masses. Video-assisted thoracoscopic pericardial biopsy was performed. Histopathology confirmed actinomycosis with chronic abscess formation, and a tissue culture yielded Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The symptoms resolved with administration of clindamycin for 6 months. This case highlights the challenge in the diagnosis of cardiac actinomycosis, the potential role of concomitant microorganisms as diagnostic clues, and the favorable clinical response achieved with appropriate antibiotic treatment.

### Childhood thoracic actinomycosis: case report [^42a7bf23]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Actinomycosis is a rare bacterial infection. It has a pseudotumoral appearance when localized to the lungs or mediastinum. The diagnosis is often delayed because clinical presentation is nonspecific, bacteriologic diagnosis is difficult, and culture growth is slow. The diagnosis is mainly based upon histologic identification of actinomycotic sulfur granules. Actinomycosis is usually sensitive to penicillin G. Surgical treatment is reserved for failure of medical treatment and complications. We report a case of thoracic actinomycosis in a 13-year-old boy.

Applying t -tests to the relative data had a high false-positive rate, as seen by the disagreements between the relative and absolute t -statistics (Spearman r = 0.53). Further, there was no correlation in p -value distribution between the relative and absolute abundance data (Spearman r = 0.09), highlighting issues when the null hypothesis is not consistent between the relative abundances and the absolute abundances.

Alternatively, evaluating the ratio between Actinomyces and the remaining taxa produced identical t -statistics and p -values between the relative and absolute abundance data (Spearman r = 1.0). Ratio-based analyses are unaffected by microbial load (Eq. (3) in methods) and result in identical interpretations as one obtains from costly and rate-limiting flow-cytometry measurements.

From the DR analysis (Fig. 2c), we can identify which taxa are changing the most relative to each other. Here, we highlight Actinomyces and Haemophilus species, which have very different ranks. Actinomyces tend to have low ranks and Haemophilus have high ranks. The difference in ranks between these taxa correctly suggests that Haemophilus taxa are more prevalent relative to other taxa before brushing, and Actinomyces taxa are more prevalent relative to other taxa after brushing. From the t -test results on relative abundances it appears that Actinomyces significantly increased (t -statistic = 3.74, p -value = 0.002) after brushing teeth and that Haemophilus significantly decreased (t -statistic = −3.67, p -value = 0.002). However, absolute abundance data revealed that only Haemophilus significantly decreased (t -statistic = −2.155, p -value = 0.0478) (Fig. 2d).

### Contemporary empyema necessitatis [^0ba560cc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Empyema necessitatis is defined by the extension of an empyema through the parietal pleura, into surrounding tissue. Clinical manifestations are generally subacute, representing the indolent nature of the most commonly implicated pathogens (Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Actinomyces israelii). Treatment with antimicrobials and surgical debridement has drastically reduced mortality; however, with proper initial assessment and treatment of pulmonary infection, this rare complication can often be avoided. We describe a patient with empyema necessitatis to illustrate the importance of timely diagnosis and treatment of parapneumonic pleural effusion, and the need to consider this diagnosis in patients presenting with constitutional symptoms and a chest wall mass.

### Identification of clinical isolates of Actinomyces species by amplified 16S ribosomal DNA restriction analysis [^8459ccd2]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

Amplified 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) restriction analysis (ARDRA), using enzymes HaeIII and HpaII, was applied to 176 fresh and 299 stored clinical isolates of putative Actinomyces spp. referred to the Anaerobe Reference Unit of the Public Health Laboratory Service for confirmation of identity. Results were compared with ARDRA results obtained previously for reference strains and with conventional phenotypic reactions. Identities of some strains were confirmed by analysis of partial 16S rDNA sequences. Of the 475 isolates, 331 (70%) were clearly assigned to recognized Actinomyces species, including 94 isolates assigned to six recently described species. A further 52 isolates in 12 ARDRA profiles were designated as apparently resembling recognized species, and 44 isolates, in 18 novel profiles, were confirmed as members of genera other than Actinomyces. The identities of 48 isolates in nine profiles remain uncertain, and they may represent novel species of Actinomyces. For the majority of species, phenotypic results, published reactions for the species, and ARDRA profiles concurred. However, of 113 stored isolates originally identified as A. meyeri or resembling A. meyeri by phenotypic tests, only 21 were confirmed as A. meyeri by ARDRA; 63 were reassigned as A. turicensis, 7 as other recognized species, and 22 as unidentified actinomycetes. Analyses of incidence and clinical associations of Actinomyces spp. add to the currently sparse knowledge of some recently described species.

### A rare case of male Fournier's gangrene with mixed Actinomyces turicensis infection [^784d9d4f]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Here, we describe a rare case of FG mainly caused by A. turicensis, which was effectively treated by early aggressive debridements, broad-spectrum antibiotics, together with split-thickness skin grafting and faecal management. Although necrotizing fasciitis such as FG mainly caused by Actinomyces species is seldom reported in either immunocompetent or immunocompromised patients, we should still consider it as a suspected causative agent and avoid missed diagnosis.

### Lacrimal gland ductulitis caused by probable Actinomyces infection [^5dccfe6e]. Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the clinical characteristics and management of a group of patients who had chronic mucopurulent conjunctivitis that was probably due to Actinomyces infection of the lacrimal gland ductules.

Design

A retrospective, interventional case series.

Participants

Seven patients (2 male; 29%) between 34 and 52 years of age (mean, 48.7 years; median, 49 years) who presented to the lacrimal clinic.

Intervention

Surgical excision of the infective focus (6 cases) or fenestration and expression of infective debris (1 case) from the affected lacrimal gland ductule--typically the most inferolateral of the ductules.

Main Outcome Measures

The clinical features of this previously unrecognized cause of chronic conjunctivitis and its response to treatment.

Results

All cases settled rapidly after surgery. There was often a major delay in diagnosis, with the patients having symptoms for between 2 and 42 months before referral (mean, 13.3 months; median, 9 months); 5 patients received prolonged or ineffectual topical medical therapy before referral.

Conclusions

Infective lacrimal gland ductulitis, commonly from Actinomyces infection, should be considered in patients with unexplained chronic mucopurulent conjunctivitis; the condition settles rapidly with surgery.

### Actinomycosis, a rare and unsuspected cause of anal fistulous abscess: report of three cases and review of the literature [^56746f74]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2005). Low credibility.

Primary perianal actinomycosis is rare. Sporadic cases, with lesions varying in extent have been reported. The infection is caused by the bacterium Actinomyces, which often is a saprophyte. Male gender and diabetes are risk factors, but the exact pathogenic mechanism remains speculative. The diagnosis is a challenge and often delayed, with a protracted history of masses and sinuses extending into the gluteal and genital region. The treatment, a combination of surgery and antibiotics, is poorly standardized. We report three cases and compare their characteristics to those of published cases, found by a computerized literature search (1968-2002). The lesions, a simple fistula-in-ano or a mass, were diagnosed in an early stage in all three patients. The infection always spread into the scrotum. There were no risk factors other than gender, except in one patient. The diagnosis was suspected by the observation of draining sulfur granules and promptly confirmed by histology in the three cases. All patients healed with antibiotics in addition to simple surgical procedures. Treatment consisted of amoxicillin for two weeks in two cases and more extended antimicrobial treatment in the third. These findings are contrasting with the classic picture of perianal actinomycosis. It is concluded that perianal actinomycosis can occur in the absence of risk factors and that early diagnosis requires a high degree of suspicion. An infection with Actinomyces should be suspected in the presence of lesions containing watery purulent material with sulfur granules. The indication for extended antibiotherapy combined with sphincter damaging surgery may need to be revised in the presence of early detection.

### A rare case of male Fournier's gangrene with mixed Actinomyces turicensis infection [^b174c018]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

FG is a fulminant infection with extremely high mortality. Once diagnosed with FG, prompt extensive debridements and broad-spectrum antibiotics are two key points. After systemic treatment of the infection, reconstructive techniques should be implemented in time to close or cover the defects of the perineal and genital regions.

Wound cultures of FG often shows polymicrobial infection of both aerobes and anaerobes but rarely reveal Actinomyces species. As a facultative Gram-positive anaerobe, Actinomyces are typically found in the human genitourinary tract (A. turicensis commonly isolated from), digestive tract and oral cavity, mostly causing chronic purulent inflammation. This chronic and recurrent abscess formation is related to the lack of obvious clinical manifestations in the early acute phase of actinomycotic infection, the rigorous culture conditions of Actinomyces species, or a failure to timely and correctly diagnose and treat of the infection. In this case, the infection was taken seriously in the acute stage due to the rapid deterioration of the patient’s genital condition. Generally, actinomycotic infection is not specific in symptoms and signs and sulphur granules in the pus are considered to be a prominent clinical diagnostic feature. However, in this case with A. turicensis infection, no sulfur granules were found. In fact, the formation of the granules depends on the growth environment and the morphology of Actinomyces. Therefore, sulphur granules do not always exist. Microbiologic culture and identification are the gold standard for detecting actinomycotic lesions.

### An overview of thoracic actinomycosis: CT features [^28c9aa4e]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Parenchymal actinomycosis

Parenchymal patterns of pulmonary actinomycosis include a peripheral pulmonary nodule, mass or consolidation, all of which may or may not be cavitary or multifocal. Typical CT findings are reported as central areas of low attenuation within the consolidation in 62–75 % of cases and adjacent pleural thickening in 50–73 % (Fig. 1). The disease initially manifests as a small, poorly defined, peripheral pulmonary nodule with or without interlobular septal thickening. The pulmonary nodule gradually increases to segmental air-space consolidation, which suggests bronchogenic spread of the disease (Fig. 2). If therapy is not adequate, central areas of low attenuation with a cavity form with the slow progression (Fig. 3). Central low-attenuation areas may be multiple and variable in size and show rim-like peripheral enhancement on enhanced CT. In later stages, lung parenchyma may be destroyed and the infection may extend across fissures to a neighbouring pulmonary lobe (trans-fissural extension), the pleura or chest wall, with abscess formation in these areas (Fig. 4).

### Pulmonary actinomycosis with thoracic soft tissue mass: a rare onset form [^d055f7ab]. European Journal of Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Actinomycosis is unusual, and rare especially when the lung and the thoracic wall are involved. It is more frequent in immunocompromised patient. US, CT, or MRI are imaging methods of diagnosis with high sensibility to recognise the disease and are able to the management. We point out a rare case in a normal teenager with thoracic abscess.

### Endobronchial actinomycosis: successful treatment with oral antibiotics [^96e32a15]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

This is a case report of an 84-year-old lady who presented with haemoptysis, weight loss and a right hilar mass on chest radiograph. CT scan of the chest revealed complete proximal occlusion of the right upper lobe from an endobronchial lesion consistent with a tumour. The patient was initially reluctant to undergo fibreoptic bronchoscopy as she was deemed to be unsuitable for any curative treatment of lung carcinoma. Bronchoscopy showed an exophytic necrotic tumour within the right upper lobe. Biopsies showed many bacterial colonies consistent with actinomyces and a diagnosis of endobronchial actinomycosis was made. Owing to multiple antibiotic allergies and patient refusal to have intravenous antibiotics, she was started on a course of doxycycline 200 mg once daily. There was near complete improvement in symptoms and radiographic appearances by the end of 4 months. This case highlights the importance of confirmatory diagnosis in the elderly as curable conditions are otherwise missed.

### Secondary to oral breast trauma as a cause of recurrent breast abscess [^8e9640d7]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Actinomycosis is a rare chronic infection, caused by species of the bacterium Actinomyces spp. This report proposes oral breast trauma as a cause of infection. An adult female in her 30s presented with a recurrent left breast abscess to a local hospital. She had previously undergone nine operations for abscess in the past 2 years. Shortly prior to her first presentation, a sexual partner with reported dental infection bit her periareolar area. The treating team noted that her bacterial culture from the first operation was positive for Actinomyces spp. She was treated with long-term intravenous antibiotics and had no further recurrences of infection. Oral trauma to the periareolar area by an individual with pre-existing dental disease has led to the introduction and establishment of this pathogen in the ductal system of the breast. This infection should be considered in cases of treatment resistant recurrent breast abscess.

### Species-level identification of Actinomyces isolates causing invasive infections: multiyear comparison of vitek MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry) to partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene [^948bc1c7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Actinomyces species are uncommon but important causes of invasive infections. The ability of our regional clinical microbiology laboratory to report species-level identification of Actinomyces relied on molecular identification by partial sequencing of the 16S ribosomal gene prior to the implementation of the Vitek MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry [MALDI-TOF MS]) system. We compared the use of the Vitek MS to that of 16S rRNA gene sequencing for reliable species-level identification of invasive infections caused by Actinomyces spp. because limited data had been published for this important genera. A total of 115 cases of Actinomyces spp., either alone or as part of a polymicrobial infection, were diagnosed between 2011 and 2014. Actinomyces spp. were considered the principal pathogen in bloodstream infections (n = 17, 15%), in skin and soft tissue abscesses (n = 25, 22%), and in pulmonary (n = 26, 23%), bone (n = 27, 23%), intraabdominal (n = 16, 14%), and central nervous system (n = 4, 3%) infections. Compared to sequencing and identification from the SmartGene Integrated Database Network System (IDNS), Vitek MS identified 47/115 (41%) isolates to the correct species and 10 (9%) isolates to the correct genus. However, the Vitek MS was unable to provide identification for 43 (37%) isolates while 15 (13%) had discordant results. Phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA sequences demonstrate high diversity in recovered Actinomyces spp. and provide additional information to compare/confirm discordant identifications between MALDI-TOF and 16S rRNA gene sequences. This study highlights the diversity of clinically relevant Actinomyces spp. and provides an important typing comparison. Based on our analysis, 16S rRNA gene sequencing should be used to rapidly identify Actinomyces spp. until MALDI-TOF databases are optimized.

### Late prosthetic hip joint infection with Actinomyces israelii in an intravenous drug user: case report and literature review [^a31312f2]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2002). Low credibility.

Late infections with Actinomyces israelii have been described for prosthetic hip joints but not in association with intravenous drug use. We present a case of a 43-year-old intravenous drug user who developed A. israelii infection in connection with a hip prosthesis 11 years after implantation, and we review four previously reported cases of Actinomyces prosthetic joint infections.

### A systematic approach for discovering novel, clinically relevant bacteria [^a7733d31]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

To determine taxonomic properties of all 673 isolates, we calculated 16S sequence identities to reference sequences with valid species-level (Figure 3, panel A), genus-level (Figure 3, panel B), or any annotation (Figure 3, panel C). Consistent with results of previous smaller studies, our results showed that most isolates were gram-positive rods and nonfermenting gram-negative rods (Table 1). A total of 294 isolates belonged to the order Actinomycetales, with Actinomyces (n = 71), Corynebacterium (n = 59), and Nocardia (n = 52) being the most common genera. Molecular identification methods have resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of recognized species in these genera, and our results indicate that more species of possible clinical relevance are yet to be described. A total of 535 (79.5%) and 225 isolates (33.4%) belonged to novel species even when more conservative cutoffs of 98.7% and 97% identity, respectively, were used. Of these, 111 isolates (16.5%) represented novel genera at the conservative 95% identity cutoff.

To determine the isolates most likely to be of clinical importance, we identified novel taxa that were isolated repeatedly or were from normally sterile, clinically relevant anatomical sites. More than half of the unidentified organisms were isolated at least twice, forming clusters that represented 95 novel taxa. Most clusters belonged to the order Actinomycetales (45 clusters, 176 isolates), with 14 clusters (42 isolates) in the genus Nocardia and 12 clusters (52 isolates) in the genus Actinomyces. A total of 19 clusters that contained > 5 members were initially identified (total of 156 isolates, Table 2). After manual review, isolates in 2 of these clusters were found to belong to validly described species (Table 2). These species were not identified in the automated analysis due to short reference sequences or because they had a subspecies annotation not covered in the algorithm. The validity of our approach was confirmed, however, when a novel thermoactinomycete, Kroppenstedtia eburnea, was formally described during preparation of this article. The 16S sequence of this organism showed ≈99.5% identity to a large cluster of 12 isolates in our study (Table 2).

### Oral Actinomyces isolates forming red colonies on brain heart blood agar can bee unambiguously classified as A. odontolyticus by macroscopic examination [^5aca7abb]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

The accurate classification of oral Actinomyces isolates as one species is difficult. Out of 18 Actinomyces isolates forming red colonies on brain heart blood agar, 12 could be straightforwardly assigned as Actinomyces odontolyticus by biochemical, morphological, and chemotaxonomic characteristics. For the remaining six isolates, the results of the different identification methods were inconsistent. By sequencing a 16S ribosomal DNA fragment by a rapid mass spectrometric method, all isolates could be identified unambiguously as A. odontolyticus. This result proves the importance of red colony pigmentation on brain heart blood agar together with the characteristic cell morphology for unequivocal assignment of oral Actinomyces isolates to the species A. odontolyticus.

### Actinobaculum schaalii, a common uropathogen in elderly patients, Denmark [^eec47fcc]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Actinobaculum schaalii was first described in 1997 and named after Klaus P. Schaalii, a German microbiologist specializing in actinomycete microbiology. The genus Actinobaculum includes A. schaalii, A. suis, A. massiliae, and A. urinale and is closely related to the genera Actinomyces and Arcanobacterium.

These bacteria are small, gram-positive, facultative anaerobic, CO 2 -requiring coccoid rods. They grow as dimorphic gray colonies <1 mm in diameter, are nonmotile and non–spore forming, and show weak β-hemolysis on agar plates containing 5% horse or sheep blood after 3–5 days of growth. They are catalase, oxidase, and urease negative and resistant to trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin. Their habitat is probably the human genital or urinary tract.

Because of its slow growth and resemblance to the normal bacterial flora on skin and mucosa, A. schaalii is often overlooked or considered a contaminant. Furthermore, it is often overgrown by faster-growing commensal and pathogen bacteria. Most laboratories incubate urine samples only overnight in ambient air, which further impedes isolation of A. schaalii.

Difficulties identifying A. schaalii by using traditional phenotypic tests have obscured its pathologic role for many years. However, A. schaalii can cause urinary tract infections (UTIs), some of which lead to serious illnesses such as urosepsis, osteomyelitis, and septicemia, mainly among the elderly and patients predisposed to UTIs (–). We developed a TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) specific for the gyrase B (gyrB) gene for fast and sensitive detection of A. schaalii from urine and blood samples.

### Practice bulletin no. 186 summary: long-acting reversible contraception: implants and intrauterine devices [^2a3d5231]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) Level C recommendations—Long-acting reversible contraceptives have few contraindications and should be offered routinely as safe and effective contraceptive options for most women. The copper IUD should be offered routinely to women who request emergency contraception and are eligible for IUD placement. To improve LARC method satisfaction and continuation, patient counseling should include information on expected bleeding changes and reassurance that these changes are not harmful. Endometrial biopsy, colposcopy, cervical ablation or excision, and endocervical sampling may all be performed with an IUD in place. Actinomyces on cytology is considered an incidental finding, and in the absence of symptoms, no antimicrobial treatment is needed, and the IUD may be left in place. Intrauterine device removal is recommended in pregnant women when the strings are visible or can be removed safely from the cervical canal. There is no compelling evidence for the removal of an IUD or implant before its expiration date in menopausal women.
