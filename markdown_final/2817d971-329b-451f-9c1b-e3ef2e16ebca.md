## Question

What are the current guidelines for invitation of spironolactone in heart failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about current guideline recommendations for initiating spironolactone in heart failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient phenotypes and how HFpEF differs from HFrEF. Then, I should verify current guideline-backed indications for HFrEF, including dosing and safety thresholds. Next, I will examine the HFpEF evidence and reconcile TOPCAT results with post hoc and regulatory perspectives. After that, I should confirm contraindications and a practical monitoring plan. Finally, I will integrate MRA therapy into modern quadruple therapy and consider special populations and real-world implementation issues.

> Let me first confirm the patient populations because everything hinges on this distinction. HFrEF is generally defined by LVEF 40% or less, HFpEF by LVEF 50% or greater, and HFmrEF sits between 41% and 49%, and the strength of MRA evidence diverges markedly across these strata, with robust mortality benefit in HFrEF but inconsistent or modest signals in HFpEF that depend on region, biomarkers, and EF band, so I need to be cautious in extrapolating beyond trials [^1112ouQR] [^113sQxRC] [^114RV1kG].

> I will now examine the core evidence base in HFrEF. RALES established that spironolactone 25 mg daily added to ACE inhibitor and loop diuretic reduced all-cause mortality by 30% and HF hospitalizations by 35% in NYHA III–IV HFrEF, and EMPHASIS-HF extended benefit to milder symptoms with eplerenone, confirming a class effect for MRAs across NYHA II–IV when used appropriately, so I should anchor recommendations to these outcomes and not overgeneralize beyond them [^111Txyh4] [^115Xfz3i] [^112gwosb].

> Next, I should review contemporary guideline direction for HFrEF. The 2022 ACC/AHA/HFSA guideline recommends an MRA for patients with HFrEF and NYHA II–IV symptoms if eGFR is greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and potassium is less than 5.0 mEq/L, with careful lab monitoring at initiation and titration, and it explicitly lists eGFR 30 or less and potassium 5.0 or more as contraindications to initiation, which I need to treat as non-negotiables in routine practice [^111RKLXp] [^114ykgDS] [^116HAUpi].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing and titration details to avoid overreaching. Standard initiation is spironolactone 12.5–25 mg daily with a target of 25–50 mg daily if tolerated, and for eGFR 30–49, I should halve the starting dose to mitigate hyperkalemia risk; early monitoring at about 1 week and again at 4 weeks is prudent, then spacing out as stable, and I should remember that the dose–response for hard outcomes appears relatively flat between 25 and 50 mg, so pushing to 50 mg is reasonable but not mandatory if 25 mg is effective and better tolerated [^1142HZjA] [^116HAUpi] [^112KSQpN].

> Now, let me consider HFpEF, where the signal is more nuanced. TOPCAT did not meet its primary composite endpoint overall, but HF hospitalizations fell by about 17% and benefit was concentrated in the Americas cohort, with no benefit in Russia/Georgia and concerning adherence and drug exposure issues there, so I should not dismiss HFpEF benefit entirely but must frame it as modest, heterogeneous, and contingent on careful selection and monitoring [^1112ouQR] [^113sQxRC] [^114RV1kG].

> Wait, let me verify how guidelines translate this into practice. ACC/AHA/HFSA assigns a Class IIb recommendation for MRAs in appropriately selected symptomatic HFpEF, particularly those with elevated natriuretic peptides, preserved renal function, and potassium within range, and ESH 2023 suggests considering spironolactone in HFpEF, especially at the lower LVEF spectrum, which aligns with post hoc analyses showing greater effect near LVEF 45–50% and in women, though I should acknowledge the limitations of subgroup findings [^113sQxRC] [^114RV1kG] [^1111Jpii].

> I should double-check the mechanistic and surrogate data that might support use even without mortality benefit. In Aldo-DHF, spironolactone improved diastolic function and induced reverse remodeling without changing exercise capacity, and meta-analytic syntheses suggest improvements in diastolic indices and blood pressure control, which can be clinically meaningful for congestion and hypertension management in HFpEF even if hard outcomes are modest [^117SWSGD] [^113KwGeT].

> Next, I should review contraindications and the monitoring cadence to keep patients safe. Absolute contraindications include eGFR 30 or less and potassium 5.0 mEq/L or more at baseline, and relative cautions include eGFR 30–49, diabetes, and concomitant ACEi/ARB or potassium supplements; I need to check potassium and creatinine within 3–7 days of initiation, again at about 1 month, then every 3–6 months if stable, and hold or reduce the dose if potassium reaches 5.5 mEq/L or if there is acute kidney injury or intercurrent illness that could precipitate hyperkalemia [^111RKLXp] [^116HAUpi] [^115EgLFb].

> But wait, what about real-world safety signals that might temper enthusiasm. Population data after RALES showed increased hyperkalemia hospitalizations when MRAs were used broadly without strict selection and monitoring, and contemporary cohorts still show notable hyperkalemia and discontinuation rates, reinforcing that meticulous lab surveillance and dose adjustment are not optional; this is where structured follow-up and education materially change risk [^1171f8vg] [^116u4xt8] [^111hvMUG].

> I will now integrate spironolactone into modern HFrEF therapy. The current quadruple foundation is ARNI preferred over ACEi/ARB, evidence-based beta-blocker, MRA, and SGLT2 inhibitor, and MRAs remain one of the few HFrEF drug classes with consistent mortality reduction across symptomatic classes, so I should prioritize getting patients on an MRA once ARNI and beta-blocker are initiated and tolerated, adjusting for renal function and potassium at each step [^111RKLXp] [^113eDiob] [^114pU75L].

> Let me reconsider HFpEF positioning to avoid overstating benefits. For HFpEF, SGLT2 inhibitors have the strongest outcome signal for hospitalization reduction, while MRAs are reasonable in selected patients for symptom control, blood pressure lowering, and potential HF hospitalization reduction, particularly in those with elevated natriuretic peptides, milder LVEF reductions, or resistant hypertension, with the understanding that evidence quality is lower and shared decision-making is essential [^114RV1kG] [^114pU75L] [^112DU15b].

> I need to ensure special populations are addressed. In older adults, benefits appear modest but real in observational Medicare data, so I should not withhold therapy solely on age if eligibility criteria are met, though I must be more vigilant with monitoring; in women, TOPCAT subgroup signals suggest potential greater benefit; in diabetes and CKD, benefits persist but hyperkalemia risk is higher, warranting lower starting doses and closer labs; in pregnancy, spironolactone is avoided given teratogenicity concerns and alternatives should be used [^111vc4zd] [^114RV1kG] [^112gbVTN] [^116iUXtJ].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of potassium binders because this often comes up. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate can facilitate MRA continuation in patients prone to hyperkalemia, but data are strongest in CKD rather than HF-specific outcomes, and whether enabling higher MRA doses improves HF events remains uncertain; thus, binders are reasonable adjuncts when hyperkalemia limits otherwise indicated MRA therapy, but not a substitute for proper selection and monitoring [^111hvMUG] [^116HAUpi].

> Let me think about inpatient initiation versus deferral. Early inpatient initiation of MRAs has not shown acute decongestion benefits, and guideline updates suggest no mandate to start during hospitalization without a specific reason; therefore, I should generally plan initiation after discharge once volume status, renal function, and potassium are optimized and reliable follow-up is in place, though exceptions exist in closely monitored settings [^115Ebf5o] [^116MitHX].

> I should confirm the bottom line to synthesize this for practice. For HFrEF with NYHA II–IV symptoms, eGFR above 30, and potassium below 5.0, I should start spironolactone 12.5–25 mg daily and titrate to 25–50 mg with guideline-directed lab monitoring because mortality and hospitalization benefits are robust; for HFpEF, I should consider spironolactone 25 mg daily in symptomatic patients with elevated natriuretic peptides, preserved kidney function, and potassium below 5.0, emphasizing modest HF hospitalization benefit and the need for vigilant electrolyte and renal surveillance, and I should document shared decision-making given the weaker evidence base [^111RKLXp] [^1112ouQR] [^113sQxRC].

Spironolactone is indicated for **HFrEF with NYHA class II–IV symptoms** [^111vLS3P] to reduce mortality and HF hospitalizations [^111Txyh4] when eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and potassium < 5.0 mEq/L, with close monitoring of potassium and renal function [^111RKLXp]. It is also reasonable for **selected HFpEF patients** [^113sQxRC] — especially those with elevated natriuretic peptides or resistant hypertension [^113sQxRC] [^1126mhqL] — to reduce HF hospitalizations, though benefits are modest and monitoring is essential [^1112ouQR]. Avoid initiation if eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L, and monitor potassium and renal function at 1 week, 4 weeks, and periodically thereafter [^116HAUpi].

## Indications for spironolactone in heart failure

### Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)

- **Indication**: Strongly recommended for patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II–IV symptoms [^111vLS3P] to reduce morbidity and mortality [^111RKLXp].
- **Evidence**: RALES showed a 30% reduction in all-cause mortality and 35% reduction in HF hospitalizations [^111Txyh4]; EMPHASIS-HF showed benefit even in mild symptoms [^112gwosb].
- **Prerequisites**: Initiate if eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and potassium < 5.0 mEq/L, with close monitoring [^111RKLXp].

---

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)

In HFpEF, **indication**: Consider in symptomatic patients, particularly with elevated natriuretic peptides or resistant hypertension [^113sQxRC] [^1126mhqL], to reduce HF hospitalizations [^1112ouQR]. Evidence from TOPCAT shows a **nonsignificant primary outcome** but a significant reduction in HF hospitalizations, with benefit mainly in the Americas cohort [^113sQxRC]; the ESH suggests use in the lower HFpEF spectrum [^1111Jpii].

## Contraindications and precautions

| **Condition** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² | Contraindicated [^111RKLXp] |
| Serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L | Contraindicated [^111RKLXp] |
| Severe renal impairment | Contraindicated [^111RKLXp] |
| Addison's disease | Contraindicated [^notfound] |
| Hyperkalemia risk factors (eGFR 30–49, concomitant ACEi/ARB, NSAIDs) | Use caution; monitor closely [^116HAUpi] |

---

## Dosing and titration

- **Initial dose**: 12.5–25 mg once daily [^1142HZjA].
- **Target dose**: 25–50 mg once daily if tolerated [^113eDiob].
- **Renal impairment**: If eGFR 30–49 mL/min/1.73 m², start 12.5–25 mg every other day or reduce dose by 50% [^116HAUpi].
- **Hyperkalemia**: If potassium ≥ 5.5 mEq/L, reduce dose or discontinue [^115EgLFb].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Check potassium and renal function at 1 week, 4 weeks, and periodically thereafter [^116HAUpi].
- **Patient education**: Advise on sick-day rules, avoid NSAIDs, and report hyperkalemia symptoms [^115EgLFb].
- **Clinical monitoring**: Watch for gynecomastia, menstrual irregularities, and hyperkalemia [^111WFyoH].

---

## Clinical outcomes and benefits

- **HFrEF**: Reduces mortality, HF hospitalizations, and improves quality of life [^111Txyh4].
- **HFpEF**: Reduces HF hospitalizations, especially in selected patients [^1112ouQR].
- **Resistant hypertension**: Effective fourth-line agent in HFpEF with resistant hypertension [^114EU3pK].

## Comparison with other mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists

| **Feature** | **Spironolactone** | **Eplerenone** |
|-|-|-|
| Structure | Non-selective | Selective |
| Gynecomastia risk | Higher | Lower |
| Hyperkalemia risk | Similar | Similar |
| Clinical evidence | Strong in HFrEF; modest in HFpEF | Strong in HFrEF; limited in HFpEF |

## Recent guideline updates and expert consensus

Recent updates include the **2022 ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines**, which strongly recommend MRAs for HFrEF and consider them in selected HFpEF patients [^111RKLXp] [^113sQxRC]. The **2023 ACC expert consensus** likewise supports MRA use in selected HFpEF patients, with close monitoring [^115Y3qHa].

---

## Practical clinical considerations

Practical considerations include using **patient selection** — ensuring eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and potassium < 5.0 mEq/L before initiation — and a **monitoring plan** with regular potassium and renal function checks [^115RZ6Uh]. Also anticipate and manage hyperkalemia, gynecomastia, and menstrual irregularities [^111WFyoH].

---

Spironolactone is a **core therapy for HFrEF** and can be considered in selected HFpEF patients, with benefits in mortality and HF hospitalizations for HFrEF and modest HF hospitalization benefits in HFpEF; careful selection and monitoring are essential to balance efficacy and safety [^111vLS3P].

### Practical recommendations for the use of ACE inhibitors, β-blockers and spironolactone in heart failure: putting guidelines into practice [^114nmVCM]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2001). Low credibility.

Surveys of prescribing in both hospitals and primary care have shown delays in translating improved survival data from clinical trials into clinical practice thereby denying patients the benefits of proven treatments, such as the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. This may be due to unfamiliarity with clinical guidelines and concerns about adverse events. Recent trials have shown that substantial improvements in survival are associated with spironolactone and beta-blocker therapy. In order to accelerate the uptake of these treatments, and to ensure that all eligible patients should receive the most appropriate medications, a clear and concise set of clinical recommendations has been prepared by a group of clinicians with practical expertise in the management of heart failure. The objective of these recommendations is to provide practical guidance for non-specialists in order to support the implementation of evidenced-based therapy for heart failure. These practical recommendations are meant to supplement rather than replace existing guidelines.

### Complications of inappropriate use of spironolactone in heart failure: when an old medicine spirals out of new guidelines [^116ZNvtH]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to investigate the appropriateness and complications of the use of spironolactone for heart failure (HF) in clinical practice.

Background

Spironolactone was reported by one prospective randomized trial to decrease morbidity and mortality in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III and IV HF. With this report (Randomized Spironolactone Evaluation Study [RALES] trial), we noted a marked increase in widespread use of spironolactone in patients with HF. Long-term outcome data with respect to safety and utilization of this medication in HF are not available.

Methods

To investigate the use of spironolactone for HF in a clinical setting, we analyzed the application of the RALES trial protocol to the care of 104 patients, whom we identified as being started on spironolactone for HF after prerelease of the RALES trial.

Results

We found broader use, less intensive follow-up, and increased complications with spironolactone treatment compared with the RALES trial. Cardiologists provided more appropriate care than did primary care providers.

Conclusions

These data suggest that spironolactone is being used widely in HF without consideration of the NYHA class and ejection fraction, and without optimization of background treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. Clinical follow-up does not adhere to the RALES trial guidelines, resulting in higher complications. We conclude that long-term studies with further safety and efficacy data are needed.

### Spironolactone [^116SCsHm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Heart Failure

Spironolactone oral suspension is indicated for treatment of NYHA Class III-IV heart failure and reduced ejection fraction in adult patients to increase survival, manage edema, and to reduce the need for hospitalization for heart failure.

Spironolactone oral suspension is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies.

1.2 Hypertension

Spironolactone oral suspension is indicated as an add-on therapy for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure in adult patients who are not adequately controlled on other agents. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g. on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

### Guideline for the management of heart failure caused by systolic dysfunction: part II. treatment [^114oSHnt]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Several large clinical trials conducted over the past decade have shown that pharmacologic interventions can dramatically reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with heart failure. These trials have modified and enhanced the therapeutic paradigm for heart failure and extended treatment goals beyond limiting congestive symptoms of volume overload. Part II of this two-part article presents treatment recommendations for patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The authors recommend that, if tolerated and not contraindicated, the following agents be used in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction: an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in all patients; a beta blocker in all patients except those who have symptoms at rest; and spironolactone in patients who have symptoms at rest or who have had such symptoms within the past six months. Diuretics and digoxin should be reserved, as needed, for symptomatic management of heart failure. Other treatments or treatment programs may be necessary in individual patients.

### Selection of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist for patients with hypertension or heart failure [^113Wuxta]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical trials have demonstrated morbidity and mortality benefits of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in patients with heart failure. These studies have used either spironolactone or eplerenone as the MRA. It is generally believed that these two agents have the same effects, and the data from studies using one drug could be extrapolated for the other. National and international guidelines do not generally discriminate between spironolactone and eplerenone, but strongly recommend using an MRA for patients with heart failure due to LV systolic dysfunction and post-infarct LV systolic dysfunction. There are no major clinical trials directly comparing the efficacy of these two drugs. This article aims to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of spironolactone and eplerenone, and to analyse the available data for their cardiovascular indications and adverse effects. We have also addressed the role of special circumstances including co-morbidities, concomitant drug therapy, cost, and licensing restrictions in choosing an appropriate MRA for a particular patient, thus combining an evidence-based approach with personalized medicine.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in heart failure: an update [^112LuJpH]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Spironolactone, a steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), has been used to treat patients with heart failure (HF) for more than half a century. Spironolactone improved outcomes in patients with severely symptomatic HF with reduced ejection fraction, and later, eplerenone expanded the benefits to patients with mildly symptomatic HF with reduced ejection fraction and myocardial infarction complicated by HF. Spironolactone reduced HF events in some patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction, but the results were not generalizable to all patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction. More recently, the nonsteroidal MRA finerenone improved the HF outcomes of patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction, expanding the benefits previously seen among patients with diabetes and albuminuric chronic kidney disease. The use of MRAs has been limited due to excessive concern about hyperkalemia. Education about the limited true risk associated with hyperkalemia, and about how to predict, prevent, and manage hyperkalemia, may lead to wider acceptability and use of these agents. Several ongoing trials are testing steroidal and nonsteroidal MRAs in HF populations. In this review, we perform a critical appraisal of MRA use in HF populations and point toward future directions.

### Spironolactone (Aldactone) [^115GHxty]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1.1	Heart Failure

ALDACTONE is indicated for treatment of NYHA Class III–IV heart failure and reduced ejection fraction to increase survival, manage edema, and reduce the need for hospitalization for heart failure.

ALDACTONE is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies.

1.2	Hypertension

ALDACTONE is indicated as add-on therapy for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure in patients who are not adequately controlled on other agents. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes.

Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, more specifically with respect to management of hypertension, HFpEF, ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to consider initiating a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (spironolactone) regardless of diagnosed resistant hypertension, particularly in lower HFpEF spectrum.

### After TOPCAT: what to do now in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116RYsn2]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Although patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HF-PEF) represent nearly half of the population with chronic heart failure, few evidence-based medical therapies are available. The neutral overall results of the TOPCAT trial of spironolactone in HF-PEF leave clinicians who treat heart failure with an ongoing clinical dilemma. In this review, we outline an approach to the clinical management of the patient with HF-PEF synthesizing data from available clinical trials and expert consensus.

### Update on therapy for heart failure [^1163wDV3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The success of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure has led to investigations of other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Although ACE inhibitors remain first-line drugs in the treatment of heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction, clinical evidence suggests that a newer class of agents — angiotensin II receptor blockers — may provide additional benefit by blocking the adverse effects of angiotensin II more completely. An improved adverse-effect profile also makes angiotensin II receptor blockers appropriate in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors. Clinical trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers on the combined endpoints of morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. Aldosterone antagonism with spironolactone has additive benefits in patients receiving an ACE inhibitor. The most recent treatment guidelines for heart failure recommend the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers and spironolactone in selected patients.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^113mHhH7]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone antagonist trial evidence — spironolactone and eplerenone — shows that in a "large-scale, long-term trial", adding low-dose spironolactone "starting at 12.5 mg daily" to ACEI therapy for NYHA class IV or class III (recently hospitalized) heart failure reduced mortality "from 46% to 35% (30% relative risk reduction) over 2 years", with a "35% reduction in HF hospitalization"; trial creatinine entry limits were "below 2.0 mg per dL" (pilot) and "below 2.5 mg per dL" (main). In myocardial infarction patients with "LVEF less than or equal to 40%" and HF or diabetes "within 14 days of MI", eplerenone decreased mortality "from 13.6% to 11.8% at 1 year", while hyperkalemia occurred in "5.5%" vs "3.9%" overall and "up to 10.1% versus 4.6%" when creatinine clearance was "less than 50 mL per min".

Heart failure — risks of aldosterone antagonists: The major risk of aldosterone antagonists is hyperkalemia due to inhibition of potassium excretion, with incidence reported to be as high as 24% in one series in which half of hyperkalemic subjects had potassium levels in excess of 6 mEq per liter; in contrast, the large trial reported 2% but a preceding pilot trial observed 13% with a 25-mg dose and 20% with a 50-mg dose. After publication of trial results, a population-based analysis in Ontario of more than 30 000 patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) after a hospitalization for heart failure found spironolactone prescriptions more than tripled, with hospitalization for hyperkalemia increasing from 2.4 to 11 patients per thousand and associated mortality increasing from 0.3 to 2 per thousand. These observations lead to a strong recommendation for caution in the selection and monitoring of patients to be given aldosterone antagonists.

### Tailoring mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy in heart failure patients: are we moving towards a personalized approach? [^116wrwwt]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of personalized medicine is to offer a tailored approach to each patient in order to provide the most effective therapy, while reducing risks and side effects. The use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) has demonstrated major benefits in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), results with challenging inconsistencies in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and 'neutral' preliminary results in acute heart failure. Data derived from landmark trials are generally applied in a 'one size fits all' manner and the development and implementation of more personalized MRA management would offer the potential to improve outcomes and reduce side effects. However, the personalization of pharmacotherapy regimens remains poorly defined in the cardiovascular field (in light of current knowledge) and until further trials targeting specific subpopulations have been conducted, MRAs should be provided to the great majority of HFrEF patients in the absence of contraindication. Spironolactone should be considered for symptomatic HFpEF patients with elevated natriuretic peptides. In the near future, trials should target HFrEF patients using exclusion criteria sourced from landmark trials (e.g. severe renal impairment), select more homogeneous HFpEF populations (e.g. with elevated BNP and structural abnormalities on echocardiography), and determine which patients are likely to benefit from MRAs (e.g. according to prespecified biomarkers).

Practical use of aldosterone antagonists — patient selection and renal function–based dosing — emphasizes that some who meet trial criteria "may need to be excluded" in practice for recent renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia, particularly with insulin-requiring diabetes. In the elderly, "estimated creatinine clearance less than 50 mL per min should trigger a reduction of the initial dose of spironolactone to 12.5 mg daily or of eplerenone to 25 mg daily", and "aldosterone antagonists should not be given when creatinine is less than 30 mL per minute". Patients "chronically requiring high doses of diuretics without potassium replacement should be evaluated closely".

### Hospital variation of spironolactone use in patients hospitalized for heart failure in China-The China PEACE retrospective heart failure study [^1135U9x9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

We provide new information about hospital characteristics associated with spironolactone use. Hospitals with independent cardiology departments and those in the Eastern region of China were associated with better adherence to evidence‐based spironolactone use. This finding signifies the importance of superior access to knowledge and health care resources. These findings are consistent with the survey on knowledge of HF guidelines among 2146 clinicians from 88 hospitals in China, which reported that more than two thirds of physicians failed to fully obtain the indications and contraindications of spironolactone, and general practitioners had poorer awareness of HF guidelines than cardiovascular specialists. The findings indicate the need for further training of clinicians to improve their knowledge and practice related to guideline‐recommended spironolactone prescription.

Our study should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. First, LVEF was not assessed in about a third of the patients; given this condition, we may have excluded some patients who would be considered ideal candidates. However, the physicians also determined whether to use spironolactone without having LVEF information available. Second, only about half of the hospitals had enough candidates for the hospital‐level analysis. However, current assessment includes hospitals from all economic–geographical regions and hospitals of different levels, which justifies the current analysis in representing the practice patterns. Third, we may have underestimated the ideal group as spironolactone is also indicated in other diseases except for HF. Fourth, we cannot analyze the dose of spironolactone as this variable was missing.

In conclusion, we identified the opportunities of optimizing the use of spironolactone among HF admissions, including raising utilization among ideal patients and lowering inappropriate utilization among contraindicated patients. Significant hospital‐level variation in spironolactone use among contraindicated and ideal patients suggests the importance of systematic factors in spironolactone prescribing. Further efforts in illuminating the barriers to more‐appropriate use of evidence‐based therapies, as well as identifying the local barriers to spironolactone prescription, will be needed to maximize the benefit and minimize the potential harm in utilizing spironolactone among patients with HF.

Background

Heart failure (HF) is the only cardiovascular disease with increasing incidence and prevalence. Most HF patients are older adults. With the aging of the population and effective treatment of hypertension and coronary artery disease, the two major underlying causes of HF, the number of older Americans with HF is expected to rise significantly in the coming decades. HF is the number one hospital discharge diagnosis for older adults. It is one of the causes of frequent hospital readmissions, reflecting acute decompensation and compromised quality of life for patients and increased cost and resource use for the healthcare system. It is also associated with approximately 300,000 deaths annually, most in older adults. Advances in the management of HF in the past several decades have significantly decreased the mortality and morbidity associated with this condition. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and spironolactone on survival and quality of life of HF patients, but there is evidence of underuse of evidence-based care for HF. Several national guidelines have been published since 1994 that recommended evidence-based evaluation and management of HF. In 1995, the American College of Cardiologists (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) published their first HF guidelines that recommended left ventricular (LV) function evaluation for all patients presenting with HF and use of ACE inhibitors for all patients with LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) unless contraindicated. The guidelines recommended the use of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate in patients who could not use ACE inhibitors. In addition, digoxin was recommended in patients with HF due to LVSD but not adequately responsive to ACE inhibitors and diuretics and in those with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rates. Diuretic use was recommended for symptomatic patients with evidence of fluid overload. Use of anticoagulation was restricted to patients with atrial fibrillation or to those with a history of systemic or pulmonary embolism. Beta-blockers were reserved for HF patients after acute myocardial infarctions. Recent advances in the management of HF called for a revision of the guidelines.

Purpose

The purpose of revising the 1995 ACC/AHA guidelines was to incorporate recent advances in pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to HF treatment and to assist physicians in clinical decision-making in the management of HF.

Methods

The ACC/AHA invited representatives from the American College of Chest Physicians, the Heart Failure Society of America, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine to participate in the preparation of the guidelines. The writing committee searched pertinent medical literature in English using computerized databases such as MEDLINE and EMBASE and manually searching the bibliographies of the selected articles. The writing committee classified HF into four stages, including patients who are at high risk for developing HF. According to this new classification, Stage A and B represent asymptomatic patients, the former at high risk for developing HF but no structural disorder, the latter with structural disorders of the heart. Stage C encompasses patients with underlying structural heart disorders who are symptomatic, either currently or in the past. Stage D includes end-stage HF patients. This new classification is intended to complement the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification of HF into Class I (asymptomatic), Class II (symptomatic on less than ordinary exertion), Class III (symptomatic on ordinary exertion), and Class IV (symptomatic at rest).

Results

The recommendations are categorized into those for evaluation and management.

### Effectiveness and safety of spironolactone for systolic heart failure [^117Gvevq]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Aldosterone receptor antagonists have been shown in randomized trials to reduce morbidity and mortality in adults with symptomatic systolic heart failure. We studied the effectiveness and safety of spironolactone in adults with newly diagnosed systolic heart failure in clinical practice. We identified all adults with newly diagnosed heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction of < 40%, and no previous spironolactone use from 2006 to 2008 in Kaiser Permanente Northern California. We excluded patients with baseline serum creatinine level of > 2.5 mg/dl or a serum potassium level of > 5.0 mEq/L. We used Cox regression with time-varying covariates to evaluate the independent association between spironolactone use and death, hospitalization, severe hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury. Among 2,538 eligible patients with a median follow-up of 2.5 years, 521 patients (22%) initiated spironolactone, which was not associated with risk of hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 1.08) or death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.93, confidence interval 0.60 to 1.44). Crude rates of severe hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury during spironolactone use were similar to that seen in clinical trials. Spironolactone was independently associated with a 3.5-fold increased risk of hyperkalemia but not with acute kidney injury. Within a diverse community-based cohort with incident systolic heart failure, use of spironolactone was not independently associated with risks of hospitalization or death. Our findings suggest that the benefits of spironolactone in clinical practice may be reduced compared with other guideline-recommended medications.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111RKLXp]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) for HFrEF — In patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II to IV symptoms, an MRA (spironolactone or eplerenone) is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality if eGFR is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and serum potassium is < 5.0 mEq/L, with careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing at initiation and thereafter. In this population, MRA therapy provides high economic value. In patients taking MRA whose serum potassium cannot be maintained at < 5.5 mEq/L, MRA should be discontinued to avoid life-threatening hyperkalemia. MRAs show consistent improvement in all-cause mortality, HF hospitalizations, and SCD in HFrEF, and eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L are contraindications to MRA initiation.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone antagonists — initiation and monitoring: Spironolactone should be initiated at a dose of 12.5 to 25 mg daily, or occasionally on alternate days, and eplerenone was used at 25 mg per day, increasing to 50 mg daily. Potassium supplementation is generally stopped after initiation, patients should be counseled to avoid high potassium-containing foods, and patients should be cautioned to avoid the addition of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors. Potassium levels and renal function should be rechecked within 3 days and again at 1 week after initiation; subsequent monitoring should occur at least monthly for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter, with any addition or increase in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) triggering a new cycle of monitoring. In view of hyperkalemia risk, the Writing Committee recommends that the routine triple combination of ACEIs, ARBs, and an aldosterone antagonist be avoided. The development of potassium levels in excess of 5.5 mEq per liter should generally trigger discontinuation or dose reduction of the aldosterone antagonist, and patients should be instructed specifically to stop the aldosterone antagonist during an episode of diarrhea or while loop diuretic therapy is interrupted.

### Spironolactone reduces the risk of death in veterans with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^113KwGeT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Spironolactone is a potassium‐sparing diuretic and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, which has been used to treat a wide range of conditions including cirrhosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, diabetic nephropathy, and hypertension. As demonstrated by the RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) trial, spironolactone is an effective treatment for HF with reduced ejection fraction. Given the success in HF with reduced ejection fraction and that spironolactone decreases the interstitial fibrotic process that is common in HFpEF, multiple clinical trials have investigated whether spironolactone also effectively treats HFpEF, with only a few that evaluated death and all‐cause hospitalization outcomes. Though findings varied across studies, and many lacked significant results, meta‐analysis pooling data suggest that spironolactone improves diastolic function and reduces blood pressure in HFpEF but had minimal effect on death and hospitalization outcomes. The largest trial thus far, the TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist Trial), also did not show a benefit on the primary composite outcome, although spironolactone did significantly reduce HF hospitalizations. Furthermore, wide regional variations may have contributed to the lack of a significant effect on the primary composite outcome in TOPCAT, because stratification by region demonstrated significant outcome improvements in the Americas but not in Russia and Georgiaand potential issues with adherence in Russia and Georgia. Additional trials, SPIRRIT‐HFPEF (Spironolactone Initiation Registry Randomized Interventional Trial in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction) and SPIRIT‐HF (Spironolactone in the Treatment of Heart Failure), are currently underway to further assess the efficacy of spironolactone in HFpEF.

Based on the results of the TOPCAT trial, current guidelines include a IIb level of evidence recommendation for spironolactone in HFpEF. We conducted the current study to further investigate the effectiveness of spironolactone on death and hospitalization outcomes in a real‐world setting using national electronic health record data, to generate real‐world evidence for the effectiveness of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism in HFpEF.

Mineralocorticoid antagonists in HFpEF — MRAs significantly improve measures of diastolic function in individuals with HFpEF, and spironolactone may reduce the risk of hospitalizations for HF in specific subsets of individuals with HFpEF; however, appropriate monitoring of potassium and kidney function are warranted to reduce the risk of hyperkalemia and worsening kidney function. In TOPCAT, 3,445 individuals with HF and LVEF ≥ 45% were randomized to spironolactone (15–45 mg daily) or placebo; the initially published results did not show a significant benefit in the primary composite outcome (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.77–1.04), although there was a significant reduction in hospitalization for HF (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.69–0.99).

### Carospir [^115MjwY5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

CAROSPIR (spironolactone) is indicated in the management of:

1.1 Heart Failure

CAROSPIR is indicated for treatment of NYHA Class III-IV heart failure and reduced ejection fraction to increase survival, manage edema, and to reduce the need for hospitalization for heart failure.

CAROSPIR is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies.

1.2 Hypertension

CAROSPIR is indicated as an add-on therapy for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure in adult patients who are not adequately controlled on other agents. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g. on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

### Guidelines for treating heart failure [^114pU75L]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Optimal guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction comprises the angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (sacubitril/valsartan), an evidence-based beta-blocker (bisoprolol, carvedilol, or sustained-release metoprolol), a mineralocorticoid antagonist (spironolactone or eplerenone), and a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin or empagliflozin). Optimal guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction comprises a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor with emerging evidence to support the use of a mineralocorticoid antagonist and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. This review will summarize the evidence behind the guideline recommendations, the impact of newer trials on management of patients with HF, and strategies for implementation into clinical practice.

Chronic heart failure — diuretic therapy management and risks: Electrolyte imbalances should be treated aggressively and the diuresis continued, and if hypotension or azotemia occurs the physician may elect to slow the rapidity of diuresis, but diuresis should nevertheless be maintained until fluid retention is eliminated, even if this strategy results in mild or moderate decreases in blood pressure or renal function, as long as the patient remains asymptomatic. Once fluid retention has resolved, treatment with the diuretic should be maintained to prevent the recurrence of volume overload, with dose adjustment often accomplished by having patients record their weight each day and make changes in their diuretic dosage if the weight increases or decreases beyond a specified range. Patients may become unresponsive to high doses if they consume large amounts of dietary sodium, are taking agents that can block the effects of diuretics (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including cyclo- oxygenase-2 inhibitors), or have a significant impairment of renal function or perfusion, but diuretic resistance can generally be overcome by the intravenous administration of diuretics (including the use of continuous infusions), the use of 2 or more diuretics in combination (e.g., furosemide and metolazone), or the use of diuretics together with drugs that increase renal blood flow (e.g., positive inotropic agents). Diuretics can cause the depletion of potassium and magnesium and can predispose patients to serious cardiac arrhythmias, particularly in the presence of digitalis therapy, and the risk of electrolyte depletion is markedly enhanced when 2 diuretics are used in combination; concomitant administration of ACEIs alone or in combination with potassium-retaining agents (such as spironolactone) can prevent electrolyte depletion in most patients with HF who are taking a loop diuretic, and when these drugs are prescribed, long-term oral potassium supplementation is generally not needed and may be deleterious. Excessive use of diuretics can decrease blood pressure and impair renal function and exercise tolerance; if there are no signs of fluid retention, hypotension and azotemia are likely to be related to volume depletion and may resolve after a reduction in diuretic dose, whereas the signs of fluid retention, hypotension and azotemia, are likely to reflect worsening HF and a decline in effective peripheral perfusion, which is an ominous clinical scenario and necessitates considering the measures discussed under Stage D HF.

### Management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^116Pf9H3]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

At present, it is a common practice to establish patients on ACEi/ARB and the other three pillars of heart failure therapy prior to switching to ARNI in those who do not respond (in line with NICE guidelines). This is driven by the cost-effectiveness of this strategy. The data for superiority of ARNI are convincing and in territories where NICE guidelines do not determine funding arrangements, the practice of using ARNI as first-line therapy is becoming more common. Further data and cost-effective analysis in this area is needed to inform a more uniform approach.

Pillar 2: mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism

MRAs block the effects of aldosterone, which ordinarily promotes salt and water retention and has direct profibrotic effects on the myocardium. Spironolactone and eplerenone both reduce relative mortality in HFrEF by ~30% when added to ACEi. Spironolactone is a broad-spectrum mineralocorticoid blocker with side effects relating to its antiandrogen property — particularly in men. It is also an effective antihypertensive agent and can be prescribed with dual indication. Eplerenone is a specific aldosterone blocker so is better tolerated, particularly in males and in those with lower blood pressure. Eplerenone specifically hasbeen shown to reduce mortality in patients with heart failure after myocardial infarction. MRAs (acting as potassium sparing diuretics) can be useful to prevent hypokalaemia but are contraindicated in those with hyperkalaemia and monitoring of electrolytes is essential.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone antagonist therapy — hyperkalemia risk minimization: Impaired renal function is a risk factor for hyperkalemia during treatment with aldosterone antagonists, and risk increases when serum creatinine exceeds 1.6 mg per dL; in patients in whom creatinine may not reflect filtration, determination that glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance exceeds 30 mL per min is recommended. Aldosterone antagonists should not be administered to patients with baseline serum potassium in excess of 5.0 mEq per liter. An initial dose of spironolactone 12.5 mg or eplerenone 25 mg is recommended, with possible increase to spironolactone 25 mg or eplerenone 50 mg as appropriate. The risk of hyperkalemia is increased with concomitant higher doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (captopril greater than or equal to 75 mg daily; enalapril or lisinopril greater than or equal to 10 mg daily); nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors should be avoided, and potassium supplements should be discontinued or reduced. Close monitoring is required: potassium levels and renal function should be checked in 3 days and at 1 week after initiation of therapy and at least monthly for the first 3 months, and diarrhea or other causes of dehydration should be addressed emergently. Although trial entry allowed creatinine greater than 2.5 mg per dL, in 1 trial 95% of patients had creatinine less than or equal to 1.7 mg per dL, indicating most studied patients had better renal function than the entry limit.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors in heart failure: current management, unmet needs, and therapeutic prospects [^113jjm87]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Considering the significant residual risk associated with HFrEF, there is an unmet need for disease‐modifying therapies that have an immediate impact on patient well‐being without dose‐limiting side effects. At the same time, optimizing treatment of HFrEF with existing therapies remains a key therapeutic goal. Initiatives that support implementation of best practice (eg, installation of in‐ and outpatient protocols within practices, ensuring that guidelines are readily available to all healthcare practitioners) may be valuable in facilitating appropriate management of HFrEF.

No Therapy Has Been Shown to Convincingly Reduce Mortality in HFpEF

Several established treatments for HFrEF have shown no efficacy in trials of HFpEF, with no benefit demonstrated in the CHARM‐Preserved (Candesartan in Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity; candesartan), 35 PEP‐CHF (Perindopril for Elderly People with Chronic Heart Failure; perindopril), 36 I‐PRESERVE (Irbesartan in Patients with Heart Failure and Preserved Ejection Fraction; irbesartan), 37 or TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist; spironolactone) trials. 38 Consequently, current European Society of Cardiology guidelines continue to state that "no treatment has yet been shown, convincingly, to reduce morbidity or mortality in patients with HFpEF", with the only class I recommendations being diuretics for symptom control and treatment of comorbidities. 5 The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines similarly emphasize diuretics with a class I recommendation to relieve the symptoms of HF, with the only other class I recommendation being control of blood pressure. The American guidelines also recommend management of atrial fibrillation, addressing any myocardial ischemia with coronary revascularization, and use of other guideline‐recommended therapies for comorbid conditions. These guidelines also include a new class IIb recommendation for consideration of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist in appropriately selected patients with symptomatic HFpEF, particularly those with elevated natriuretic peptide levels, with close monitoring of potassium levels and renal function. 6 This is based on a post hoc analysis of the TOPCAT trial, which showed efficacy of spironolactone in patients with HFpEF in the Americas but not in Russia/Georgia. 39

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — spironolactone (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist): In TOPCAT, the composite of death, aborted cardiac death, and HF hospitalization showed a small, non-significant reduction (HR, 0.89), while HF hospitalization was reduced (HR, 0.83) and hyperkalemia and creatinine increases were more common; efficacy was observed in the Americas (HR 0.83) but not Russia-Georgia (HR 1.10). Analyses suggest potential benefit in appropriately selected symptomatic HFpEF patients meeting LVEF ≥ 45%, elevated BNP or HF admission within 1 year, eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, creatinine < 2.5 mg/dL, and potassium < 5.0 mEq/L, with careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing at initiation and follow-up; post hoc analysis suggested greater efficacy at the lower end of the LVEF spectrum.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: integrating evidence into clinical practice [^117X5UBu]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) improve survival and reduce morbidity in patients with heart failure, reduced ejection fraction (HF-REF), and mild-to-severe symptoms, and in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. These clinical benefits are observed in addition to those of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and beta-blockers. The morbidity and mortality benefits of MRAs may be mediated by several proposed actions, including antifibrotic mechanisms that slow heart failure progression, prevent or reverse cardiac remodelling, or reduce arrhythmogenesis. Both eplerenone and spironolactone have demonstrated survival benefits in individual clinical trials. Pharmacologic differences exist between the drugs, which may be relevant for therapeutic decision making in individual patients. Although serious hyperkalaemia events were reported in the major MRA clinical trials, these risks can be mitigated through appropriate patient selection, dose selection, patient education, monitoring, and follow-up. When used appropriately, MRAs significantly improve outcomes across the spectrum of patients with HF-REF.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Heart Failure: Initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily (2.2).
Hypertension: Initiate treatment at 25 to 100 mg daily in either single or divided doses (2.3).
Edema: Initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly. The recommended initial daily dose is 100 mg in single or divided doses (2.4).
Primary hyperaldosteronism: Initiate treatment at 100 to 400 mg in preparation for surgery. In patients unsuitable for surgery use the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient (2.5).

2.1	General Considerations

ALDACTONE can be taken with or without food, but should be taken consistently with respect to food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2	Treatment of Heart Failure

In patients with serum potassium ≤ 5.0 mEq/L and eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 m2, initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily. Patients who tolerate 25 mg once daily may have their dosage increased to 50 mg once daily as clinically indicated. Patients who develop hyperkalemia on 25 mg once daily may have their dosage reduced to 25 mg every other day [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients with an eGFR between 30 and 50 mL/min/1.73 m2, consider initiating therapy at 25 mg every other day because of the risk of hyperkalemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.3	Treatment of Essential Hypertension

The recommended initial daily dose is 25 to 100 mg of ALDACTONE administered in either single or divided doses is recommended. Dosage can be titrated at two-week intervals. Doses greater than 100 mg/day generally do not provide additional reductions in blood pressure.

2.4	Treatment of Edema

In patients with cirrhosis, initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. The recommended initial daily dosage is 100 mg of ALDACTONE administered in either single or divided doses, but may range from 25 to 200 mg daily. When given as the sole agent for diuresis, administer for at least five days before increasing dose to obtain desired effect.

2.5	Treatment of Primary Hyperaldosteronism

Administer ALDACTONE in doses of 100 to 400 mg daily in preparation for surgery. For patients who are considered unsuitable for surgery, ALDACTONE can be used as long-term maintenance therapy at the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient.

### Patiromer use in patients with heart failure: lessons and clinical considerations from the DIAMOND trial [^11646Fin]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

The choice of target doses of the intervention in the DIAMOND trial was based on what was believed to be the best evidence for spironolactone and eplerenone. 2,3 In the RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) trial, patients were started on spironolactone 25 mg/day with an option to down‐titrate to 25 mg every other day if there was an increase in serum potassium, or to up‐titrate to 50 mg/day after 8 weeks, if there were signs of worsening heart failure without hyperkaalemia. While the average dose of spironolactone was 26 mg/day, 50 mg/day dose was thought to be more effective based on the finding of a lower atrial natriuretic hormone levels in the RALES dose‐finding study. EMPHASIS‐HF (Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure) used a starting dose of 25 mg/day with the option to up‐titrate to 50 mg/day. While many patients did not achieve this dose, this dosing strategy was chosen in line with the pivotal trials and a judgment based on higher doses not being assessed in earlier trials precisely due to risk of hyperkalaemia despite better surrogate improvement at higher doses. Thus, while not guideline‐recommended, using best judgement based on totality of evidence may be an option when designing trials.

Heart failure trial subgroup (TOPCAT) including patients with and without resistant hypertension — spironolactone effects: A subset of 403 participants from the Americas had RHT and 1,361 without RHT served as the comparator group, and patients were treated for an average of 2.92 years with either spironolactone or placebo in addition to their three-drug therapy. SBP in the spironolactone group was lower than in the placebo group at four weeks and remained significantly lower for at least eight months, and the significantly greater reduction in the primary endpoint with spironolactone versus placebo was comparable in those with and without RHT.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) spans trials enrolling patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%, ≤ 40%, and ≤ 30%. For spironolactone and eplerenone, the starting dose is 25 mg orally daily, increased to 50 mg daily orally after a month; for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 31 to 49 mL/min/1.73 m2, dosing should be reduced by half, and regular checks of serum potassium and renal function are advised approximately 1 week, then 4 weeks, then every 6 months after initiating or intensifying MRA, with more frequent testing for clinical instability. Safety concerns include when eGFR is ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and when MRA is initiated at serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L and continued ≥ 5.5 mEq/L; in trials, clinically significant hyperkalemia events were < 10% in EPHESUS and EMPHASIS-HF. Coadministration of MRA with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) mildly increases hyperkalemia risk, hyperkalemia risk was lower with angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) in chronic heart failure but not different in decompensated heart failure when compared with ACEi, diarrhea causing dehydration or loop diuretic therapy interruption should be a consideration for temporarily holding the MRA, and the efficacy of potassium binders (for example, patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) to facilitate continuation of MRA is uncertain.

### Spironolactone reduces the risk of death in veterans with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^1121EeiX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a complex syndrome that constitutes about half of the 6.2 million prevalent heart failure (HF) cases in the United States.HFpEF is associated with poor quality of life, high morbidity and mortality rates, and high health care usage. The prevalence of HFpEF has been increasing, likely due to improved clinical recognition and increasing life expectancy among the aging population. The HFpEF epidemic is increasing at rates faster than other types of HF. Recently, sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors were shown to reduce hospitalizations in HFpEF, and angiotensin–neprilysin inhibition has also been found to benefit subsets of HFpEF. In addition, spironolactone has demonstrated benefit in HFpEF as discussed in more detail below. However, considering the high mortality rate and morbidity in HFpEF, further elucidation of therapeutic strategies is an urgent need in HFpEF.

SGLT inhibitors and MRAs during HF hospitalization — SGLT inhibitors are "now recommended in all outpatients with HF", and "newer evidence indicates that they enhance decongestion during hospitalization". Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists "are recommended to decrease hospitalizations and mortality for outpatients with HFrEF and serum creatinine < 2.5 mg/dL in men and ≤ 2.0 mg/dL in women with stable potassium handling and anticipated access to frequent monitoring of electrolytes after discharge", but "no specific benefit has been demonstrated from initiation during hospitalization". In a randomized blinded trial, "100 mg of spironolactone compared to 0 to 25 mg spironolactone for 96 hours after admission did not increase acute diuresis, relieve clinical congestion, or decrease natriuretic peptide levels in hospital, but was shown to be safe in the hospital setting, where it can be initiated early in the absence of contraindications". Early initiation of other classes is also supported, as beta-blockers and RAS inhibitors were "shown in early studies to improve outcomes when initiated during hospitalization", and after stabilization "sacubitril/valsartan further decreased natriuretic peptide levels compared with enalapril during 8 to 12 weeks, with a trend for early reductions in hospitalization and mortality".

### Hospital variation of spironolactone use in patients hospitalized for heart failure in China-The China PEACE retrospective heart failure study [^112DU39r]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Aldosterone antagonists (AAs) reduce mortality for patients with heart failure (HF) and reduced ejection fraction and are strongly recommended for some patients in clinical guidelines. Patient selection is critical because AAs can cause life‐threatening hyperkalemia or renal insufficiency in individuals with significant renal dysfunction or baseline hyperkalemia. Prior studies, in the United States have identified both underuse of AAs among individuals who might benefit and overuse among those who are at risk for adverse consequences. This pattern of use substantially compromises the population benefits that might be attained with the integration of this therapy in practice.

Little is known about the national practice patterns of evidence‐based spironolactone use in patients hospitalized for HF in China, where spironolactone is the only AA approved by the China Food and Drug Administration and inexpensive and readily available nationwide. Quality of care for HF varied substantially among hospitals in Chinawhich suggests opportunities of improvement at the hospital level. However, little is known about the hospital variation in spironolactone use. Prior studies, have reported the relatively high use of spironolactone in patients with HF in China. Few efforts have been devoted to the appropriate use and unsafe use of spironolactone according to the indications and contraindications and hospital‐level factors associated with appropriateness of use.

Accordingly, we conducted a comprehensive quality assessment of spironolactone use, with data collected in the China PEACE 5r‐HF (China Patient‐Centered Evaluative Assessment of Cardiac Events Retrospective Study of Heart Failure). The study has identified a representative sample of hospitals in China and a large nationally representative sample of HF admissions in 2015. Our objectives were to describe the variation in spironolactone use among ideal and contraindicated patients at discharge and identify hospital characteristics associated with the appropriateness of spironolactone use.

### Under-utilization of evidence-based drug treatment in patients with heart failure is only partially explained by dissimilarity to patients enrolled in landmark trials: a report from the euro heart survey on heart failure [^116gHj8i]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

Surveys on heart failure management suggest under-utilization of life-saving evidence-based treatment. Evidence-based medicine and clinical guidelines are based on the results of randomized controlled trials. Therefore, we investigated how patients who fulfilled the enrolment criteria of randomized trials were treated in real life.

Methods and Results

We selected three large placebo-controlled trials of patients with chronic heart failure, in which ACE-inhibitors (ACE-Is), beta-blockers, and spironolactone proved to be safe and effective. The major enrolment criteria of trials were identified and applied to patients enrolled in the Euro Heart Survey on Heart Failure to identify the proportion of patients eligible for treatment and also treated appropriately. Of the 10 701 patients who were enrolled in the Euro Heart Survey on Heart Failure, only a small percentage (13%) would have qualified for participation in at least one of the selected trials. Patients who fulfilled enrolment criteria of the identified trials were more likely to be treated with ACE-Is (83% of SOLVD-eligible patients), beta-blockers (54% of MERIT-HF-eligible patients), and aldosterone antagonists (43% of RALES-eligible patients) than trial-ineligible patients. Almost half of SOLVD-eligible patients who were treated with ACE-Is received the target dose as recommended in the guidelines, but only < 10% of MERIT-HF eligible patients who were treated with beta-blockers received the target dose.

Conclusion

ACE-Is are widely utilized but given in lower doses than proven effective in clinical trials. beta-Blockers are underused and given in lower doses to patients who fulfil the enrolment criteria of relevant landmark trials.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^112gAvLM]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

The proposed approach is non‐judgmental, i.e. it does not designate any stratum as being 'optimal', 'acceptable' or 'adequate'. It does not make reference to a guideline, since there are numerous different guidelines throughout the world. The proposed approach also does not ask physicians to distinguish among all possible reasons for the prescribing of non‐target doses, since it is failure to follow a forced‐titration strategy that matters rather than the reasons for not following it.

Table 1 displays one possible approach to the definition of the three strata. Thresholds are proposed for the identification of patients who would reside in stratum I, stratum II, or stratum III. The table is presented only for purposes of illustration. The clinical community needs to debate and revise the proposed criteria and reach consensus as to the definitions of specific strata. However, the debate must start somewhere, and Table 1 represents a starting point.

Table 1
Proposed framework for characterizing the adherence of individual patients to trial‐based strategies for the prescribing of neurohormonal antagonists for heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction

An advantage of the approach presented in the table is that it allows physicians to readily describe the degree to which an individual patient's treatment adheres to a trial‐proven strategy. Simple abbreviations could be used to refer to each drug class, i.e. RAS for ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers; BB for beta‐blockers; MRA for spironolactone or eplerenone; and ARNI for neprilysin inhibition. Accordingly, a patient receiving target doses of carvedilol, sacubitril/valsartan and spironolactone might be described as BB1/ARNI1/MRA1. Conversely, a patient who is taking enalapril 5 mg twice daily and metoprolol tartrate 50 mg twice daily but no mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist or neprilysin inhibitor would be designated as RAS2/BB2/MRA3/ARNI3. Finally, a patient who is receiving sacubitril/valsartan, carvedilol and spironolactone at subtarget doses and was prescribed higher doses but shown to be intolerant despite a concerted effort would be designated as BB1/ARNI1/MRA1, since the patient received treatment in accordance with forced strategies used in the landmark trials.

### The spironolactone initiation registry randomized interventional trial in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (SPIRRIT-HFpEF): rationale and design [^112HxkAE]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Key heart failure with preserved and mildly reduced ejection fraction randomized trials targeting the aldosterone–mineralocorticoid receptor pathway as of 2024

Thus, based on the mechanisms involved in HFpEF, the fact that MRAs target these mechanisms, their proven efficacy in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and the suggestive but inconclusive findings in TOPCAT post‐hoc analyses, there is a need for an outcome trial of MRAs in HFpEF and also in HFmrEF. Therefore, the first objective of Spironolactone Initiation Registry Randomized Interventional Trial in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (SPIRRIT‐HFpEF) is to assess whether the initiation of spironolactone or eplerenone plus standard care compared to standard care alone improves outcomes in patients with HFpEF.

2.1 General Considerations

Spironolactone oral suspension is not therapeutically equivalent to Aldactone. Follow dosing instructions given here. In patients requiring a dose greater than 100 mg, use another formulation. Doses of the suspension greater than 100 mg may result in spironolactone concentrations higher than expected [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Spironolactone oral suspension can be taken with or without food, but should be taken consistently with respect to food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2 Treatment of Heart Failure

In patients with serum potassium ≤ 5.0 mEq/L and eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73m2, initiate treatment at 20 mg (4 mL) once daily. Patients who tolerate 20 mg (4 mL) once daily may have their dosage increased to 37.5 mg (7.5 mL) once daily as clinically indicated. Patients who develop hyperkalemia on 20 mg (4 mL) once daily may have their dosage reduced to 20 mg (4 mL) every other day [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients with an eGFR between 30 and 50 mL/min/1.73m2, consider initiating treatment at 10 mg (2 mL) because of the risk of hyperkalemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.3 Treatment of Essential Hypertension

The recommended initial daily dose is 20 mg (4 mL) to 75 mg (15 mL) administered in either single or divided doses. Dosage can be titrated at two-week intervals. Doses > 75 mg/day generally do not provide additional reductions in blood pressure.

2.4 Treatment of Edema Associated with Hepatic Cirrhosis

In patients with cirrhosis, initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The recommended initial daily dose is 75 mg (15 mL) administered in either single or divided doses. In patients requiring titration above 100 mg, use another formulation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. When given as the sole agent for diuresis, administer for at least five days before increasing dose to obtain desired effect.

Table S2 shows the HRs for primary and secondary outcomes in patients with HFpEF with uncontrolled blood pressure, despite the concurrent use of an ACEI/ARB, a CCB, and a diuretic. Similar to the results of patients with HFpEF with resistant hypertension, the risk of primary outcome events and hospitalization for heart failure was significantly lower in the spironolactone group compared with the placebo group (HR for primary outcome events, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.47–0.98; P = 0.04; and HR for heart failure hospitalization, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41–0.94; P = 0.02, respectively).

### Potassium binders for patients with heart failure? The real enlightenment of the DIAMOND trial [^112KSQpN]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Higher doses of MRAs do not improve outcomes more than lower doses

The answer to this question depends on whether the DIAMOND-specified target doses of MRAs are truly needed to produce optimal decreases in mortality and mortality in HFrEF. In RALES, mortality was reduced using a mean of 26 mg/day of spironolactone, with no survival difference between 25 and 50 mg/day. Similarly, when tested in the post-infarction setting, eplerenone reduced cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure when patients were taking only 25 mg/day, with a magnitude of benefit similar to that seen with 50 mg/day. Finally, in EMPHASIS-HF, patients randomized to 25 or 50 mg/day of eplerenone had a similar reduction in the combined risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure. Therefore, the totality of evidence suggests that the shape of the dose–response relationships for both spironolactone and eplerenone for the reduction of major heart failure events is flat between 25 and 50 mg/day. If true, the use of patiromer to facilitate the prescribing of spironolactone 50 mg/day (as opposed to lower doses) might not be expected to yield benefits on heart failure outcomes.

### The spironolactone initiation registry randomized interventional trial in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (SPIRRIT-HFpEF): rationale and design [^112Qh78D]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

‐intervention, study visits and follow‐up

Patients are randomized 1:1 to open‐label MRA (either spironolactone or eplerenone) plus usual care versus usual care alone. Patients randomized to MRA receive a prescription to be filled and paid for out of pocket. (In both Sweden and the US, spironolactone can be obtained for approximately 10 US cents per day. In Sweden, patients pay out‐of‐pocket for prescription medications up to an annual maximum of approximately 250 Euro, after which additional medication costs are covered by the government). Spironolactone is more potent than eplerenone, but the initial dose in guidelines and clinical practice is generally 25 mg/day for both drugs and is the dose recommended in SPIRRIT‐HFpEF. A dose of 25 mg every other day or 25 mg, half tablet every day, may be prescribed at investigator discretion for patients judged to be at higher risk of hyperkalaemia or kidney dysfunction. Patients who at baseline are known not to tolerate spironolactone due to gynecomastia or who prefer eplerenone will be prescribed eplerenone. Eplerenone is relatively inexpensive, although more expensive than spironolactone. Spironolactone (or eplerenone) is recommended to be increased to a target dose of 50 mg daily if tolerated.

Most previous RRCTs in Sweden have involved one‐time interventions (i.e. not chronic therapy) without the need for monitoring during follow‐up. Spironolactone is familiar to all clinicians but is associated with a risk of hyperkalaemia and worsening kidney function. Therefore, there are no required in‐person follow‐up visits in the trial, but potassium and eGFR are measured for all patients in both groups at local laboratories at weeks 1, 4, 26, and 52 after randomization, at end of study, 7–14 days after any dose changes, and as needed at the discretion of the investigator. Local sites order blood tests, instruct patients to have blood drawn at their local clinic, and these laboratory results are then available to investigators in Sweden from regional electronic health records, and in the US laboratory data are acquired from site investigators from individual testing sites and/or the electronic medical record. After obtaining the laboratory result, the investigator or study coordinator has telephone contact with the patient and provides instruction on continued treatment and records any events, laboratory values, and treatment decisions in a separate case report form.

### Serious adverse events experienced by patients with chronic heart failure taking spironolactone [^1156WGHA]. Heart (2001). Low credibility.

In patients with chronic heart failure, spironolactone added to conventional treatment may lead to serious and, occasionally, fatal hyperkalaemia. In some cases this seems to happen because spironolactone causes diarrhoea. Four cases involving men with New York Heart Association functional class III heart failure are presented. As these cases revealed, close monitoring of blood chemistry is mandatory after starting spironolactone, and patients should be advised to stop spironolactone immediately if diarrhoea develops.

### Evidentiary landscape of heart failure therapies, regulatory decisions, and translation into guidelines [^111HXRQx]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the last decade, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved 6 drugs to reduce morbidity or mortality and improve functional capacity in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and 3 drugs to reduce morbidity or mortality in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Of the drugs approved for HFrEF, only 2 reduced mortality (sacubitril/valsartan in the PARADIGM-HF trial and dapagliflozin in the DAPA-HF trial). None of the drugs approved for HFpEF reduced mortality. Four trials, 1 with finerenone (FINEARTS-HF trial), 2 with semaglutide (STEP-HFpEF/DM trial), and 1 with tirzepatide (SUMMIT trial) met their primary endpoint in patients with HFpEF and are currently under review for approval. In contrast, before 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved 11 drugs (captopril, enalapril, valsartan, candesartan, long-acting metoprolol succinate, bisoprolol, carvedilol, digoxin, isosorbide dinitrate-hydralazine, spironolactone, and epleronone) for patients with chronic stable HFrEF but none for HFpEF. All 11 drugs reduced mortality and morbidity except for digoxin, which only reduced hospitalization for heart failure. This state-of-the-art review examines the evidentiary support for regulatory actions and incorporation into guidelines of heart therapies approved since 2015.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for patients with heart failure with midrange ejection fraction: a patient-pooled analysis from the kor HF and kor AHF registries [^116Phznz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

AAs, including spironolactone and eplerenone, are associated with reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with systolic HF (EF < 35%) in addition to recommended therapy. 7, 8 However, the TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist) trial failed to prove the benefit of spironolactone therapy in patients with HFpEF (EF ≥ 45%). 28 Although post hoc analysis from the TOPCAT trial, stratified by EF, showed that the potential efficacy of spironolactone tended to be maximized at the lower end of the LVEF spectrum 29; to date, there are no data comparing the outcomes of use of AAs in patients with HFmrEF. The present study demonstrated that the risk of mortality did not differ between use of AA or not in patients with HFmrEF. However, observational studies consistently show a lack of benefit with AA, but randomized controlled trials consistently show a benefit for patients with HFrEF. Perhaps, this result might be a failure of method rather than a lack of benefit from AA. Because AAs were recommended to be prescribed to those who remained symptomatic taking the medication of RASB and β‐blocker, those with AAs might be more severe patients with worse prognosis, although we performed propensity matching analysis. In addition, the failure to reach the statistical significance of the effect of AA use on clinical outcome might be because of type II error. In this regard, well‐designed randomized controlled trials focusing on the effect of AA in patients with HFmrEF will be needed.

### Appropriateness of spironolactone prescribing in heart failure patients: a population-based study [^115jxk7d]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) established the safety and benefit of spironolactone for heart failure (HF) patients with systolic dysfunction. However, recent data have raised concerns regarding hyperkalemia secondary to spironolactone use and suggest it occurs more commonly in routine practice.

Methods and Results

We explored factors potentially associated with hyperkalemia from spironolactone therapy in a population-based cohort of 9165 HF patients hospitalized in Ontario, Canada, between 1999 and 2001. Compared with patients enrolled in RALES, community-based patients were older (mean age 75 years versus 65 years, P < .001) and were more likely to be female (50% versus 27%, P < .001). Of the 1502 patients that were prescribed spironolactone at discharge, 18% had elevated serum potassium levels (> 5 mmol/L) during hospitalization and 23% were discharged on concurrent potassium supplements. Although only 8% of patients had serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL, many patients had stage III (53.1%), stage IV (12.8%), or stage V (3.9%) chronic renal insufficiency according to glomerular filtration rate.

Conclusion

Spironolactone was often prescribed to inappropriate HF candidates because of the presence of relative or absolute contraindications. These findings highlight the need for more careful patient selection when prescribing spironolactone to minimize potential life-threatening hyperkalemia.

### Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide [^1121eUPP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Essential hypertension:

For patients with essential hypertension in whom other measures are considered inadequate or inappropriate;
In hypertensive patients for the treatment of a diuretic-induced hypokalemia when other measures are considered inappropriate;
Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including the classes to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

### Incidence, predictors and clinical management of hyperkalaemia in new users of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [^116u4xt8]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

We expand previous evidence with the novel finding that a large proportion of MRA users experience mild hyperkalaemia (15% of all study participants and 21% of heart failure participants). Although guidelines do not currently reach consensus on the need to treat these mild events, K + concentrations within this range have been associated with an increased risk of death, hospitalizations and emergency room visits. 26, 27, 28, 29 Most events occurred within the first 3 months of therapy, which again agrees with the experience of MRA trials: in the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) trial, the greatest change in K + occurred within the first 4 weeks following initiation of spironolactone. 30 This finding underscores the importance of early monitoring of K + after initiation of an MRA, something that despite recommended by current guidelines is not taking place in practice. 12, 13

### Spironolactone for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^1112ouQR]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

Mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists improve the prognosis for patients with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. We evaluated the effects of spironolactone in patients with heart failure and a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned 3445 patients with symptomatic heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45% or more to receive either spironolactone (15 to 45 mg daily) or placebo. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for the management of heart failure.

Results

With a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, the primary outcome occurred in 320 of 1722 patients in the spironolactone group (18.6%) and 351 of 1723 patients in the placebo group (20.4%) (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.77 to 1.04; P = 0.14). Of the components of the primary outcome, only hospitalization for heart failure had a significantly lower incidence in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (206 patients [12.0%] vs. 245 patients [14.2%]; hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.99, P = 0.04). Neither total deaths nor hospitalizations for any reason were significantly reduced by spironolactone. Treatment with spironolactone was associated with increased serum creatinine levels and a doubling of the rate of hyperkalemia (18.7%, vs. 9.1% in the placebo group) but reduced hypokalemia. With frequent monitoring, there were no significant differences in the incidence of serious adverse events, a serum creatinine level of 3.0 mg per deciliter (265 μmol per liter) or higher, or dialysis.

Conclusions

In patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction, treatment with spironolactone did not significantly reduce the incidence of the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for the management of heart failure.

### Targeting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in heart failure [^113ab9QK]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is a well-established therapeutic target in the treatment of heart failure (HF). Substantial advances have been made with existing agents — angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II-receptor blockers (ARBs), and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists (MRAs) — and new data continue to emerge. The indication for the use of MRAs has been broadened to include potentially all patients who have HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and ACE inhibitors might have a novel application in patients who are at risk of left ventricular dysfunction (those with aortic valvular disease or pacing-induced heart disease). ARBs have been shown to be a beneficial alternative to ACE inhibitors in HFrEF, but their value when added to ACE inhibitors has been questioned. Upstream, direct renin blockade with aliskiren is being pursued in two large trials of HF, despite the premature halting of a third study. A substantial, unmet need remains in patients who have HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). New data on spironolactone and LCZ696 (a combined ARB and neprilysin inhibitor) show promise for these patients. Results of the TOPCAT study of spironolactone in patients with HFpEF are awaited, and LCZ696 is now being tested in a large trial in patients with HFrEF.

### What is the current best drug treatment for hypertensive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction? Review of the totality of evidence [^112XBKE1]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence in favor of steroidal and nonsteroidal MRAs in HFpEF

To evaluate the effect of the steroidal MRA spironolactone in HFpEF, the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist trialwas performed with study sites in North and South America, in addition to Russia and Georgia. The lack of significant effect of the study drug on the primary endpoint was clouded by the retrospective finding that there were substantial regional differences in participating patients and study conduct, seriously affecting the results of the trial. These differences were related to patient inclusion based on either hospitalization due to HF in the previous 12 months or elevated NPs at any time. In the aftermath, it became apparent that centers in Russia and Georgia disproportionately included study participants based on the history of HF hospitalization. In contrast, in most study participants in North America, HF diagnosis was ascertained by elevated NP values. Reanalysis of the data displayed a significant effect of the study drug on the primary endpoint in the subgroup in the Americas, where the event rate was as expected.

In contrast, the event rate of the subset in Russia and Georgia was low and comparable to the general population. This leaves an open question as to whether participants in Russia and Georgia truly had HF. Furthermore, the blood samples of Russian and Georgian patients revealed that many did not receive or take their assigned treatment with spironolactone, as the metabolite canrenone was not detected, and serum potassium and serum creatinine rose much less than expected. These related data appeared in the Online Supplement of the main publication. However, FDA reversed course on this matter based on the results from the North American subset of the study (TOPCAT Americas). An FDA advisory committee lit a long-standing fuse, recommending that the totality of evidence from TOPCAT can be used to support a new indication for spironolactone. Several advisors concurred, but ultimately, the Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee voted 8 to 4, with one abstaining, that TOPCAT provides "sufficient evidence to support any indication".

Table 18 — GDMT for patients with hypertension and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) outlines class-specific use and thresholds: In patients with HFrEF, even if asymptomatic, the table notes use of 1 of the 3 BBs proven to reduce mortality and hospitalizations (bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol succinate). In patients with symptomatic HFrEF, spironolactone or eplerenone is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality if eGFR is ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 and potassium is ≤ 5.0 mEq/L. In patients with HFrEF and NYHA functional class II to III symptoms, ARNi is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality; when the use of ARNi is not feasible, ACEi or ARB is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality. SGLT2i are recommended in patients with symptomatic HFrEF to reduce hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality irrespective of the presence of type 2 diabetes. For patients self-identified as Black with NYHA functional class II to IV HFrEF receiving optimal medical therapy, the combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate is recommended to improve symptoms and reduce morbidity and mortality, and in patients with current or previous symptomatic HFrEF who cannot be given first-line agents because of drug intolerance or renal insufficiency, a combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate might be considered to reduce morbidity and mortality.

### Spironolactone and resistant hypertension in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^114EU3pK]. American Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recent evidence suggests that the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone should be the preferred fourth-line antihypertensive treatment in resistant hypertension (RHTN). Whether spironolactone improves blood pressure (BP) control in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and RHTN is unknown.

Methods

We identified patients with RHTN, defined as baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 140 and 160 mm Hg on 3 or more medications, in the Americas cohort of the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist trial, in which patients with HFpEF were randomized to spironolactone vs. placebo. We evaluated the effects of spironolactone vs. placebo on BP reduction in this group and related this to the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for heart failure.

Results

We identified 403 participants in the Americas with RHTN. Compared to people without RHTN, those with RHTN were more frequently women, non-White, diabetics, with a higher left ventricular ejection fraction and body mass index, and a lower hemoglobin concentration. In the RHTN group, spironolactone resulted in a decrease of SBP: -6.1 (-8.9, -3.3); P < 0.001 and diastolic BP: -2.9 (-4.6, -1.2); P = 0.001 mm Hg during the first 8 months. BP became controlled after 4 weeks in 63% of patients receiving spironolactone vs. 46% receiving placebo (P = 0.003), with similar responses at 8 weeks, 4 and 8 months. Patients with RHTN derived similar overall benefit from spironolactone on the primary outcomes as those without.

Conclusions

In HFpEF patients with RHTN, spironolactone lowered BP substantially and was associated with similar benefit as those without RHTN.

### Change in renal function associated with drug treatment in heart failure: national guidance [^114Fafef]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The interaction between treatment for heart failure and decline in renal function is frequently misunderstood and commonly used as a reason to withhold potentially life-prolonging therapy. The misunderstanding is not helped by referring to RAAS inhibitors as 'nephrotoxic' drugs, which they most emphatically are not. Well-meaning but poorly evidenced recommendations to give patients 'sick day rules'have the potential to cause harm when patients stop their medication for minor illness (or fail to restart them once illness has passed). Perhaps of even greater concern is inaccurate advice given by bodies such as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which suggested that 'concomitant use of spironolactone with ACEi or ARB is not routinely recommended'. The combination is, of course, of vital importance to patients with symptomatic HFrEF; however, close monitoring of renal function and potassium is vital when using MRA and other RAAS inhibitor together.

There is a danger that concerns over renal function may prevent patients receiving medication beneficial to their long-term outcome. While decline in renal function is important and may require drugs to be stopped, that should only be after very careful consideration of the risks and benefits to the individual patient (figure 3).

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in high-risk heart failure patients with diabetes mellitus and / or chronic kidney disease [^112gbVTN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) spironolactone and eplerenone have been shown in large‐scale prospective double‐blind trials to reduce cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure in patients with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). 1 Their use in patients with midrange and preserved left ventricular function (HFpEF) remains controversial. Despite designation as a class 1 indication in current US 2 and European 3 guidelines for patients with HFrEF, their use remains suboptimal in comparison to β‐adrenergic blocking agents, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blocking agents. 4 The relative underuse of MRAs in guideline‐eligible patients with HFrEF 5 has in large part been attributed to the fear of inducing hyperkalemia and/or renal insufficiency (RI), especially in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and/or chronic kidney disease. 6 In part these fears have been amplified by questions raised as to their effectiveness and safety in "real world" settings based upon retrospective analysis of data in various registries. 7, 8 While large‐scale prospective randomized trials are recognized as the criterion standard for evaluating the safety and efficacy of new therapies for approval, the application and relevance to clinical practice obtained from these studies to the "real world" has been questioned because of various restrictions on inclusion into the large‐scale randomized trials and the intensity of patient monitoring and follow‐up in comparison to clinical practice in "real world" settings. "Real world" data regarding the safety and efficacy of a given intervention based upon retrospective analysis of registry data have, however, been criticized as suffering from bias by intent to treat. In an observational study, observations are collected without assignment, and no adjustment, however elaborate it may be, can protect against the "unavoidable risk of selection bias and of systematic differences in outcomes that are not due to the treatment itself". 9 Nevertheless, registry‐based analysis of safety and efficacy of a given therapeutic intervention is valuable in pointing out areas for further investigation.

### Rationale and design of the treatment of preserved cardiac function heart failure with an aldosterone antagonist trial: a randomized, controlled study of spironolactone in patients with symptomatic heart failure and preserved ejection fraction [^115gGyMW]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Despite increasing prevalence of heart failure (HF) in patients with preserved ejection fraction (PEF), there are no available therapies proven to reduce morbidity and mortality. Aldosterone, a potent stimulator of myocardial and vascular fibrosis, may be a key mediator of HF progression in this population and is therefore an important therapeutic target.

Objective

The TOPCAT trial is designed to evaluate the effect of spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, on morbidity, mortality, and quality of life in patients with HF-PEF.

Methods

Up to 3,515 patients with HF-PEF will be randomized in double-blind fashion to treatment with spironolactone (target dose 30 mg daily) or matching placebo. Eligible patients include those with age ≥ 50 years, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 45%, symptomatic HF, and either a hospitalization for HF within the prior year or an elevated natriuretic peptide level (B-type natriuretic peptide ≥ 100 pg/mL or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ≥ 360 pg/mL) within the 60 days before randomization. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension and those with known infiltrative or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are excluded. The primary end point is the composite of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for HF, or aborted cardiac arrest. Key secondary end points include quality of life, nonfatal cardiovascular events, and new-onset atrial fibrillation. Ancillary studies of echocardiography, tonometry, and cardiac biomarkers will provide more insight regarding this understudied population and the effects of spironolactone therapy.

Conclusion

TOPCAT is designed to assess definitively the role of spironolactone in the management of HF-PEF.

### Meta-analysis on drug and device therapy of New York heart association functional class IV heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^113mvQf6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV symptoms. Decades of discovery have heralded significant advancements in the pharmacologic management of HFrEF. However, patients with NYHA IV symptoms remain an under-represented population in almost every clinical trial to date, leaving clinicians with limited evidence with which to guide drug treatment decisions in this patient group with severe heart failure. Randomized controlled trials of adult patients with NYHA IV symptoms of HFrEF randomized to current guideline-recommended medical therapy were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The outcomes of interest included the rate of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure hospitalization. A total of 39 randomized controlled trials were included. A total of 6 studies examined angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, with meta-analyses of 2 demonstrating a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk (RR) 0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 0.97, p = 0.03). A total of 11 studies examined β blockers, with meta-analysis of 6 demonstrating a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (risk ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 0.92, p = 0.008). A study examined the mineralocorticoid antagonist spironolactone, reporting a reduced risk of all-cause mortality in the NYHA IV subgroup. A total of 6 studies examined device therapy, demonstrating the benefit of cardiac resynchronization therapy with or without an implantable cardiac defibrillator in reducing hospitalization in the NYHA IV subgroup. Although trial evidence exists for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, β-blockers, and mineralocorticoid antagonist therapy in the NYHA IV population, the role of angiotensin receptor blockers is unclear. Ivabradine, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, and sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors remain underinvestigated and have not been proved to provide any benefit above standard heart failure therapy in patients with HFrEF and NYHA IV symptoms.

### Spironolactone for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^112RMVNt]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

The study TOPCAT was published by Pitt B and colleagues in 2014 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the TOPCAT study, the trial question was: what is the effect of spironolactone in patients with HFpEF? In the TOPCAT study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the TOPCAT study, the population was: 3445 patients (1775 female, 1670 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with HFpEF. The key exclusion criteria were severe systemic illness with a life expectancy of < 3 years, severe renal dysfunction, and specific coexisting conditions, medications, or acute events. In the TOPCAT study, the interventions were: n = 1722 spironolactone (15–45 mg/day) n = 1723 placebo (matching placebo). In the TOPCAT study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for HF (18.6% vs. 20.4%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.04). In the TOPCAT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in hospitalization for HF (12% vs. 14.2%; HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.99) No significant difference in cardiovascular death (9.3% vs. 10.2%; HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.12) No significant difference in aborted cardiac arrest (0.2% vs. 0.3%; HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.5). In the TOPCAT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in serious adverse events, serum creatinine level ≥ 3.0 mmg/dL, or dialysis. significant difference in hyperkalemia (18.7% vs. 9.1%) and hypokalemia (16.2% vs. 22.9%). In the TOPCAT study, the conclusion was: in patients with HFpEF, spironolactone was not superior to placebo with respect to death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for HF.

### Heart failure therapy in diabetic patients-comparison with the recent ESC / EASD guideline [^115AbWX8]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Role of comorbidities

The use of ACEi/ARB or spironolactone may cause hyperkalemia, especially in patients with impaired renal function. A large population-based study from Ontario showed an increased incidence of hyperkalemia and subsequent mortality after the publication of the RALES trial and the rate of hyperkalemia in real-world is thought to be much higher than in clinical trials for various reasons (e.g. less frequent assessment of electrolytes and renal function, higher dosage of medication). In heart failure patients, diabetes has been shown to be an independent risk factor for the development of hyperkalemia and severe hyperkalemia (associated with hospitalization or death). Even with impaired renal function, however, heart failure patients with diabetes will benefit from ARB therapy and aldosterone receptor blockade, similarly to patients without diabetes. Our data from a clinical practice setting suggest that the presence of the heart failure comorbidity diabetes restrains doctors from prescribing evidence-based therapy in heart failure patients - possibly in fear of side-effects, although these side-effects can be easily monitored by simple blood tests. As a consequence, we suggest that diabetic heart failure patients should receive appropriate doses of ACEi/ARB and/or aldosterone receptor blockers under a tight control of potassium and renal function markers, rather than withholding these potentially life-saving drugs. Moreover, future heart failure trials should focus on common comorbidities in heart failure populations (diabetes, impaired renal function, high age).

### Hypertension and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: position paper by the European Society of Hypertension [^116AXC7T]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypertension constitutes a major risk factor for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). HFpEF is a prevalent clinical syndrome with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Specific guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HFpEF is not established due to lack of positive outcome data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and limitations of available studies. Although available evidence is limited, control of blood pressure (BP) is widely regarded as central to the prevention and clinical care in HFpEF. Thus, in current guidelines including the 2018 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Society of Hypertension (ESH) Guidelines, blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers provides the backbone of BP-lowering therapy in hypertensive patients. Although superiority of RAS blockers has not been clearly shown in dedicated RCTs designed for HFpEF, we propose that this core drug treatment strategy is also applicable for hypertensive patients with HFpEF with the addition of some modifications. The latter apply to the use of spironolactone apart from the treatment of resistant hypertension and the use of the angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor. In addition, novel agents such as sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors, currently already indicated for high-risk patients with diabetes to reduce heart failure hospitalizations, and finerenone represent promising therapies and results from ongoing RCTs are eagerly awaited. The development of an effective and practical classification of HFpEF phenotypes and GDMT through dedicated high-quality RCTs are major unmet needs in hypertension research and calls for action.

### Safety of spironolactone use in ambulatory heart failure patients [^115NtECE]. Clinical Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Since the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES), the use of spironolactone is recommended in systolic heart failure (HF) patients that have been in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV. There is limited information on the use, side effects, and withdrawal rate of spironolactone in routine clinical practice.

Hypothesis

Side effects related to spironolactone use are more common than reported in clinical trials.

Methods

Patients who had moderate to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) under optimized medical therapy were included. We introduced spironolactone in those with serum potassium (K+) ≤ 5 meq/L, and serum creatinine (Cr) ≤ 2.5 mg/dL. Spironolactone was withdrawn if serum K + ≥ 5.5 meq/L, serum Cr increased more than 30%- 50% of the baseline value, and/or if the patient had gynecomastia.

Results

We selected 134 patients followed in an HF clinic. In our sample, 56.7% of the patients (76 out of 134) were currently or had formerly been on spironolactone therapy. The rate of spironolactone withdrawal was 25% (19 out of 76). Reasons for suspension were hyperkalemia (17.1%), renal function deterioration (14.5%), gynecomastia (5.3% of males), and other reasons (1.3%).

Conclusion

Spironolactone side effects are common and are mostly related to effects on the angiotensin-aldosterone axis. Our results reinforce the need to closely monitor serum K+ and Cr levels in patients treated with spironolactone, as its side effects are more common than reported in clinical trials.

### Usefulness of spironolactone in a specialized heart failure clinic [^112yFFjx]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Several case series published after the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) have focused on the adverse effects of spironolactone when prescribed to participants not in a trial and the appropriateness of these prescribing practices; however, there is a paucity of data on potential benefits in patients not in a trial. Therefore, we examined data from a prospective cohort study of 1,037 patients with heart failure seen at the University of Alberta Heart Function Clinic. Median age was 69 years, 66% were men, 75% had systolic dysfunction, and mean ejection fraction was 33%. Only 40% of the 136 patients prescribed spironolactone had New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms, and < 25% fulfilled all of the RALES eligibility criteria. Mean daily dose of spironolactone was 23.9 mg; 25% of patients had spironolactone withdrawn after initiation, mostly due to increases in potassium and/or creatinine (9%), gynecomastia (5%), or dehydration/hyponatremia (6%). Only 1 of our spironolactone-treated patients developed serum potassium > 6 mmol/L. Cox's proportional hazards analysis confirmed the association between use of spironolactone and increased survival rate (relative risk 0.09, 95% confidence interval 0.02 to 0.39), even though 78% of our patients did not fulfill the RALES eligibility criteria. Thus, although the complication rate was higher, the benefits of spironolactone seen in RALES extended to participants not in a trial who were treated with similar doses and followed closely in a clinic specializing in heart failure.

### Spironolactone and outcomes in older patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^111vc4zd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists or aldosterone antagonists in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is well known. Less is known about their effectiveness in real-world older patients with HFrEF.

Methods

Of the 8206 patients with heart failure and ejection fraction ≤ 35% without prior spironolactone use in the Medicare-linked OPTIMIZE-HF registry, 6986 were eligible for spironolactone therapy based on serum creatinine criteria (men ≤ 2.5 mg/dL, women ≤ 2.0 mg/dL) and 865 received a discharge prescription for spironolactone. Using propensity scores for spironolactone use, we assembled a matched cohort of 1724 (862 pairs) patients receiving and not receiving spironolactone, balanced on 58 baseline characteristics (Creatinine Cohort: mean age, 75 years, 42% women, 17% African American). We repeated the above process to assemble a secondary matched cohort of 1638 (819 pairs) patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (eGFR Cohort: mean age, 75 years, 42% women, 17% African American).

Results

In the matched Creatinine Cohort, spironolactone-associated hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for all-cause mortality, heart failure readmission, and combined endpoint of heart failure readmission or all-cause mortality were 0.92 (0.81–1.03), 0.87 (0.77–0.99), and 0.87 (0.79–0.97), respectively. Respective hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) in the matched eGFR Cohort were 0.87 (0.77–0.98), 0.92 (0.80–1.05), and 0.91 (0.82–1.02).

Conclusions

These findings provide evidence of consistent, albeit modest, clinical effectiveness of spironolactone in older patients with HFrEF regardless of renal eligibility criteria used. Additional strategies are needed to improve the effectiveness of aldosterone antagonists in clinical practice.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116iUXtJ]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Pregnancy and lactation — heart failure medication counseling notes that in 2015 the FDA adopted the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule retiring categories A through X and providing a descriptive risk summary; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are associated with multiple second- and third-trimester fetal harms and are, therefore, strictly contraindicated, and there are no specific data for ARNI or ivabradine. For mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, spironolactone has dose-dependent feminization findings in animal offspring with limited data for eplerenone. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) medications considered acceptable during pregnancy within multidisciplinary shared decision-making include furosemide, beta blockers (most commonly metoprolol), hydralazine, and nitrates. Regarding lactation, breastfeeding may be associated with LV recovery; postpartum women who breastfeed can start ACEi (enalapril or captopril preferred), metoprolol remains the preferred beta blocker, and a medication safety resource is available via LactMed.

### Update on aldosterone antagonists use in heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Heart Failure Society of America guidelines committee [^115Xfz3i]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Aldosterone antagonists (or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [MRAs]) are guideline-recommended therapy for patients with moderate to severe heart failure (HF) symptoms and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and in postmyocardial infarction patients with HF. The Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure (EMPHASIS-HF) trial evaluated the MRA eplerenone in patients with mild HF symptoms. Eplerenone reduced the risk of the primary endpoint of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR] 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54–0.74, P < .001) and all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62–0.93, P < .008) after a median of 21 months. Based on EMPHASIS-HF, an MRA is recommended for patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II-IV symptoms and reduced LVEF (< 35%) on standard therapy (Strength of Evidence A). Patients with NYHA Class II symptoms should have another high-risk feature to be consistent with the EMPHASIS-HF population (age > 55 years, QRS duration > 130 msec [if LVEF between 31% and 35%], HF hospitalization within 6 months or elevated B-type natriuretic peptide level). Renal function and serum potassium should be closely monitored. Dose selection should consider renal function, baseline potassium, and concomitant drug interactions. The efficacy of eplerenone in patients with mild HF symptoms translates into a unique opportunity to reduce morbidity and mortality earlier in the course of the disease.

### Trends in treatment for patients hospitalized with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction before and after treatment of preserved cardiac function heart failure with an aldosterone antagonist (TOPCAT) [^112U8adw]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The TOPCAT trial investigated spironolactone vs placebo in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Although the primary endpoint was not statistically significant, treatment with spironolactone did reduce heart failure hospitalizations compared with placebo. TOPCAT's impact on prescribing patterns in the United States is not well-characterized. We performed a retrospective analysis of discharge prescribing data in the Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure Registry among patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50% discharged between January 2009 and December 2016 to assess prescribing trends upon dissemination of TOPCAT results. Of 142,201 patients included in the study, 18,581 (13.1%) were prescribed mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) at discharge. Compared with those not prescribed MRAs, patients discharged on MRAs were generally younger (75 vs 78 years), and report white race (76.7% vs 72.0%), more likely to have had prior heart failure hospitalizations (75.5% vs 65.7%), lower brain natriuretic peptide levels (492 vs 545 pg/mL), but similar serum creatinine levels (1.2 vs 1.2 mg/dL) upon admission. MRA prescribing modestly increased over time (p < 0.0001), without significant change in the overall trend of prescribing rate for MRAs after TOPCAT results were presented (p = 0.17). In conclusion, our findings suggest that for patients with HFpEF, the use of MRAs at hospital discharge is low, with only modest increases over time and no discernible change in the rate of MRA use after the TOPCAT results were released. There remains an important need for more clinical trials to better establish the efficacy and safety of MRAs for the treatment of HFpEF.

### Influence of ejection fraction on outcomes and efficacy of spironolactone in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^112UeGvt]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

While mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) have been shown to benefit patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), spironolactone did not reduce the primary endpoint of cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, or aborted cardiac arrest in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in the TOPCAT trial, which enrolled patients with LVEF of 45% or greater. We utilized data from TOPCAT to assess the relationship between LVEF as well as outcomes and efficacy of spironolactone.

Methods and Results

We assessed differences in baseline characteristics and outcomes across LVEF categories in 3444 patients with HFpEF, and determined whether LVEF modified the treatment effect of spironolactone. Ejection fraction ranged from 44 to 85%. Patients with higher ejection fraction were older, more likely to be female, less likely to have a history of myocardial infarction, and more likely to have a history of hypertension and diabetes. The incidence of the primary endpoint and cardiovascular death was highest in patients at the lower end of the ejection fraction spectrum. Ejection fraction modified the spironolactone treatment effect, particularly in the patients enrolled in the Americas, for the primary outcome (P = 0.046) and for heart failure hospitalization (P = 0.039), with stronger estimated benefits of spironolactone at the lower end of the ejection fraction spectrum with respect to the primary endpoint (LVEF < 50%: HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.50, 1.05; LVEF ≥ 60%: HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76, 1.23) and heart failure hospitalization (LVEF < 50%: HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.46, 1.27; LVEF ≥ 60%: HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.74, 1.30).

Conclusion

In patients with HFpEF enrolled in TOPCAT, patient characteristics and outcomes varied substantially by LVEF. The potential efficacy of spironolactone was greatest at the lower end of the LVEF spectrum.

### Potassium binders for patients with heart failure? The real enlightenment of the DIAMOND trial [^111bwiFw]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The RALES and EMPHASIS-HF trials

The RALES trial studied patients with severe HFrEF not generally receiving beta-blockers, who were randomized to spironolactone 25 mg/day or placebo for a mean of 24 months. In a pilot trial, doses from 12.5 mg/day to 75 mg/day had produced meaningful decreases in natriuretic peptides, with minimal incremental effect but more hyperkalaemia at doses > 25 mg/day. Accordingly, 25 mg/day was designated as the target dose for spironolactone in RALES, and it is the target dose in clinical practice. In RALES, 50 mg/day could be prescribed if, after 8 weeks, patients experienced progression of heart failure without hyperkalaemia. However, up-titration did not occur in most patients; the mean dose was 26 mg/day. At this dose, spironolactone reduced all-cause mortality by 30% and hospitalizations for heart failure by 35%. A serum potassium concentration ≥ 5.5 mmol/L was seen in 5.5% of the placebo group, in 13.5% taking 25 mg/day, and in 41% taking 50 mg daily. Serious hyperkalaemia was observed in 1–2% of patients.

The EMPHASIS-HF trial enrolled patients with mild HFrEF treated with beta-blockers, who received eplerenone 25 mg/day or placebo for 4 weeks, followed by 50 mg/day for a mean of 21 months, if they had preserved renal function. The doses were halved in those with chronic kidney disease. There is a 2:1 to 4:1 ratio between pharmacodynamically equivalent doses of eplerenone and spironolactone. Eplerenone reduced all-cause mortality by 24% and hospitalizations for heart failure by 42%. A serum potassium concentration > 5.5 mmol/L was reported in 7.2% and 11.8% of the placebo and eplerenone groups, respectively. A serum potassium > 6.0 mmol/L was noted in ∼2%.

Results

Baseline Characteristics

Among 1222 ideal patients for spironolactone, 65.1% received spironolactone prescription at discharge (Figure 1). In the subgroup of 423 patients who were ideal for spironolactone and having both angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and β‐blocker prescription at discharge, 88.2% received spironolactone. Among 900 patients with contraindications of spironolactone (serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL in men or > 2.0 mg/dL in women, or potassium > 5.0 mEq/L, or documented allergy to spironolactone), 33.2% received spironolactone prescription at discharge. Spironolactone was prescribed to 39.7% (196/498) of patients with hyperkalemia, with 42.2% (171/405) and 26.9% (25/93) among patients with potassium 5 to 5.5 mmol/L and > 5.5 mmol/L, respectively. Spironolactone was prescribed to 23.6% patients (117/495) with renal dysfunction. Among 7395 patients with uncertain benefit of spironolactone, 45.3% received spironolactone prescription at discharge. During hospitalization, the rate of spironolactone use among ideal and contraindicated patients were 88.4% (1099/1243) and 49.5% (517/1045), respectively. We compared patients who received a spironolactone prescription and those who did not among ideal and contraindicated patients at discharge, respectively (Tables S1 and S2).

Figure 1
Flow chart.

The contraindicated group includes patients with renal dysfunction (serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL in men or > 2.0 mg/dL in women), hyperkalemia (potassium > 5.0 mEq/L), or documented allergy to spironolactone, irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction. HF indicates heart failure.

### Life-threatening hyperkalemia: a complication of spironolactone for heart failure in a patient with renal insufficiency [^111niG78]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2002). Low credibility.

Implications

Serum potassium concentration should be measured immediately before operation to detect hyperkalemia in heart failure patients treated with spironolactone. Renal insufficiency, advanced age, potassium supplementation, decompensated congestive heart failure, and a spironolactone dose larger than 25 mg/d increase the risk of hyperkalemia as a consequence of spironolactone therapy.

### Patiromer for the management of hyperkalemia in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: the DIAMOND trial [^114PXE2Y]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Triple therapy with a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor, an MRA, and a beta-blocker form the cornerstone of evidence-based HFrEF care, more recently with the addition of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors. However, their use in clinical practice remains suboptimal. Contemporary data from the CHAMP-HF (Change the Management of Patients with Heart Failure) registry showed that < 25% of patients simultaneously received any dose of all three medications and fewer than 5% were on guideline-recommended doses of all three. These patterns, particularly low use of MRAs, are consistent across multiple health care setting and geographic regions. In a large study of new MRA users, nearly 20% experienced hyperkalemia within a year; among these, 47% discontinued MRA use; and among these, 75% were not reintroduced to MRA therapy within the following year. Even in a clinical trial setting, their use is suboptimal, e.g. in the VICTORIA (Vericiguat Global Study in Subjects with Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction) trial, only 59.7% of patients were receiving triple therapy. In this regard, it is important to note that in the DIAMOND trial, 84.6% of the patients at the end of run-in phase were able to achieve ≥ 50% of target dose of the combination RAASi therapy and 97% were able to take the triple therapy at some dose. This underscores that increasing the proportion of patients achieving specified target doses of therapy for HFrEF is feasible. Furthermore, the target doses of MRA in this study, i.e. 50 mg/day of eplerenone/spironolactone, were selected as the maximum doses in the RALES and EMPHASIS-HF trials. The pre-RALES trials found that 50 mg spironolactone produced the highest reduction in N -terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide, which is associated with heart failure prognosis, and whilst it is not an established biomarker of response to therapy, the investigators felt that due to its prognostic association it would be of interest to target 50 mg spironolactone. In RALES, due to the risk of hyperkalemia, the starting dose was 25 mg/day spironolactone (considered to be therapeutically equivalent, to 50 mg eplerenone), which was increased if heart failure progressed to a maximum of 50 mg/day. In EMPHASIS-HF, the target dose of eplerenone/placebo was stratified at randomization according to eGFR (50 mg/day if eGFR ≥ 50 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and ≤ 25 mg/day if eGFR 30–49 ml/min/1.73 m 2).

### Spironolactone [^115H8uYT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1663 patients were randomized 1:1 to spironolactone or placebo. 87% of patients were white, 7% black, and 2% Asian. 73% were male and median age was 67. The median ejection fraction was 26%. 70% were NYHA class III and 29% class IV. The etiology of heart failure was ischemic in 55%, and non-ischemic in 45%. There was a history of myocardial infarction in 28%, of hypertension in 24%, and of diabetes in 22%. The median baseline serum creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL and the median baseline creatinine clearance was 57 mL/min.

At baseline, 100% of patients were taking loop diuretic and 95% were taking an ACE inhibitor. Other medications used at any time during the study included digoxin (78%), anticoagulants (58%), aspirin (43%), and beta-blockers (15%).

The primary endpoint for RALES was time to all-cause mortality. RALES was terminated early because of significant mortality benefit demonstrated during a planned interim analysis. Compared to placebo, spironolactone reduced the risk of death by 30% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval 18% to 40%). Spironolactone also reduced the risk of hospitalization for cardiac causes (defined as worsening heart failure, angina, ventricular arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction) by 30% (p < 0.001 95% confidence interval 18% to 41%).

The survival curves by treatment group are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Survival by Treatment Group in RALES

Mortality hazard ratios for subgroups were studied. The favorable effect of spironolactone on mortality appeared similar for both genders and all age groups except patients younger than 55. There were too few non-whites in RALES to evaluate if the effects differ by race. Spironolactone's benefit appeared greater in patients with low baseline serum potassium levels and less in patients with ejection fractions < 0.2. These subgroup analyses must be interpreted cautiously.

### Potassium binders for patients with heart failure? The real enlightenment of the DIAMOND trial [^111hvMUG]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The terror of hyperkalaemia and the advent of new potassium binders

The results of these two trials established MRAs as foundational drugs for HFrEF. Yet, in clinical practice, only ∼15–30% of patients with heart failure receive an MRA, because of fears that serious hyperkalaemia is common and life-threatening. Juurlink et al. reported an excess of hyperkalaemia-associated hospitalizations and deaths following the publication of the RALES trial. This risk was attributed to the use of inappropriately high doses of spironolactone, the lack of serum potassium monitoring, and the use of potassium supplements in many patients. Trevisan et al.confirmed the risk of serious hyperkalaemia with spironolactone > 25 mg/day and reported that, at the first sign of hyperkalaemia, practitioners generally stopped spironolactone permanently — instead of reducing the dose, as was done in RALES and EMPHASIS-HF.

Potassium binders have been used to reduce the gastrointestinal absorption of potassium for decades, and agents with enhanced tolerability (e.g. patiromer) have been developed. Patiromer reduces the risk of hyperkalaemia in chronic kidney diseaseand, in the PEARL-HF trial, patients with HFrEF (enriched for the risk of hyperkalaemia) were randomized to patiromer or placebo to determine if treatment might enhance the tolerability of spironolactone 50 mg/day. After 4 weeks, patiromer-treated patients were more likely to be receiving 50 mg/day (91% vs. 74%), but the between-group difference was not striking. Nevertheless, the use of patiromer might allow more HFrEF patients to receive the highest doses of MRAs. If very high MRA doses are superior to lower doses in preventing major heart failure outcomes, patiromer might facilitate MRA-mediated decreases in death and heart failure hospitalizations in patients with prior hyperkalaemia.

### The effect of spironolactone on morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure. randomized aldactone evaluation study investigators [^111Txyh4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (1999). Excellent credibility.

The study RALES was published by Pitt B and colleagues in 1999 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the RALES study, the trial question was: what is the role of spironolactone in patients with severe HF and a LVEF < 35% who were being treated with ACEi? In the RALES study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the RALES study, the population was: 1663 patients (446 female, 1217 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with severe HF and an LVEF < 35% who were being treated with ACEi. The key exclusion criteria were congenital heart disease, unstable angina, primary hepatic failure, active cancer, or any life-threatening disease (other than HF), or heart transplantation. In the RALES study, the interventions were: n = 822 spironolactone (25 mg daily) n = 841 placebo (matching placebo daily). In the RALES study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death at 24 months (35% vs. 46%; RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.82). In the RALES study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in frequency of hospitalization for worsening HF (26% vs. 35%; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.77) Significant increase in gynecomastia or breast pain (10% vs. 1%; RR 10, 95% CI 4.07 to 15.93). In the RALES study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious hyperkalemia. significant differences in gynecomastia or breast pain (10% vs. 1%, p < 0.001). In the RALES study, the conclusion was: in patients with severe HF and an LVEF < 35% who were being treated with ACEi, spironolactone was superior to placebo with respect to death at 24 months.

### Incidence, predictors, and outcomes related to hypo-and hyperkalemia in patients with severe heart failure treated with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist [^113Toagh]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure but can cause hyperkalemia, which contributes to reduced use of these drugs. Hypokalemia also leads to worse outcomes in patients with heart failure and may be attenuated by mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

Methods and Results

We assessed incidence and predictors of hyperkalemia (potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L) and hypokalemia (potassium < 3.5 mmol/L) and the relationship to outcomes in 1663 patients with class III or IV heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction < 35% randomized to treatment with spironolactone 25 mg or placebo in the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) trial. All-cause mortality rates and the influence of potassium levels on the effectiveness of spironolactone were assessed in a landmark analysis and in relation to time-varying potassium levels. After 1 month, mean potassium levels increased in the spironolactone group but not in the placebo group (4.54 ± 0.49 versus 4.28 ± 0.50 mmol/L; P < 0.001) and remained elevated during the trial. Although the extremes of hypokalemia and hyperkalemia at 4 weeks were associated with increased risk of mortality in both treatment arms, participants in the spironolactone arm had lower mortality rates at all potassium levels throughout the duration of the trial. The treatment benefit of spironolactone was maintained at least until potassium exceeded 5.5 mmol/L.

Conclusions

With appropriate surveillance of potassium and creatinine, the use of spironolactone was associated with less hypokalemia and improved survival in patients with severe heart failure even in the setting of moderate hyperkalemia.

### Effect of spironolactone on diastolic function and exercise capacity in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: the aldo-DHF randomized controlled trial [^117SWSGD]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Diastolic heart failure (ie, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction) is a common condition without established therapy, and aldosterone stimulation may contribute to its progression.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of long-term aldosterone receptor blockade in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The primary objective was to determine whether spironolactone is superior to placebo in improving diastolic function and maximal exercise capacity in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Design and Setting

The Aldo-DHF trial, a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between March 2007 and April 2012 at 10 sites in Germany and Austria that included 422 ambulatory patients (mean age, 67 [SD, 8] years; 52% female) with chronic New York Heart Association class II or III heart failure, preserved left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% or greater, and evidence of diastolic dysfunction.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone once daily (n = 213) or matching placebo (n = 209) with 12 months of follow-up.

Main Outcome Measures

The equally ranked co-primary end points were changes in diastolic function (E/e') on echocardiography and maximal exercise capacity (peak VO2) on cardiopulmonary exercise testing, both measured at 12 months.

Results

Diastolic function (E/e') decreased from 12.7 (SD, 3.6) to 12.1 (SD, 3.7) with spironolactone and increased from 12.8 (SD, 4.4) to 13.6 (SD, 4.3) with placebo (adjusted mean difference, -1.5; 95% CI, -2.0 to -0.9; P < .001). Peak VO2 did not significantly change with spironolactone vs placebo (from 16.3 [SD, 3.6] mL/min/kg to 16.8 [SD, 4.6] mL/min/kg and from 16.4 [SD, 3.5] mL/min/kg to 16.9 [SD, 4.4] mL/min/kg, respectively; adjusted mean difference, +0.1 mL/min/kg; 95% CI, -0.6 to +0.8 mL/min/kg; p = 0.81). Spironolactone induced reverse remodeling (left ventricular mass index declined; difference, -6 g/m2; 95% CI, -10 to-1 g/m2; p = 0.009) and improved neuroendocrine activation (N-terminal pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide geometric mean ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75–0.99; p = 0.03) but did not improve heart failure symptoms or quality of life and slightly reduced 6-minute walking distance (-15 m; 95% CI, -27 to -2 m; p = 0.03). Spironolactone also modestly increased serum potassium levels (+0.2 mmol/L; 95% CI, +0.1 to +0.3; P < .001) and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (-5 mL/min/1.73 m2; 95% CI, -8 to -3 mL/min/1.73 m2; P < .001) without affecting hospitalizations.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized controlled trial, long-term aldosterone receptor blockade improved left ventricular diastolic function but did not affect maximal exercise capacity, patient symptoms, or quality of life in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Whether the improved left ventricular function observed in the Aldo-DHF trial is of clinical significance requires further investigation in larger populations.

MRAs in HF

Several trials have demonstrated the efficacy of MRAs administration in patients with HFrEF regardless of HF etiology. In the RALES (Effect of Spironolactone on Morbidity and Mortality in Patients with Severe Heart Failure) trial, the addition of 25 mg of spironolactone daily to standard therapy in patients with HFrEF reduced by 35% the risk of both cardiovascular morbidity and death (the relative risk of death was 0.70; 95% CI: 0.60–0.82; P < 0.001. The relative risk of hospitalization was 0.65; 95% CI: 0.54–0.77; P < 0.001). The EMPHASIS-HF trial (Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in HF)demonstrated that addition of eplerenone (up to 50 mg daily) in patients with chronic systolic HF and mild symptoms reduced cardiovascular death and hospitalization for HF; the primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for HF and occurred in 18.3% in the eplerenone group vs 25.9% in the placebo group (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.54–0.74; P < 0.001). The EPHESUS trialshowed the benefit of MRAs in ACS complicated by HF. In the TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With An Aldosterone Antagonist) trialwas evaluated the effects of spironolactone in patients with HF and preserved ejection fraction. The treatment with spironolactone did not reduce the incidence of the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest or hospitalization for HF; after a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, the primary outcome occurred in 18.6% of the spironolactone group vs 20.4% of the placebo group (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.77–1.04; P = 0.14). However, there was a significant reduction in the hospitalization for HF (12.0% in the spironolactone group vs 14.2% in the placebo group; HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.69–0.99; P = 0.04). It should be noted that the incidence of hospitalization for HF was higher in the subgroup with elevated natriuretic peptide level within 60 days before than in the subgroup with previous hospitalization for HF.

### Practical outpatient management of worsening chronic heart failure [^116MitHX]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are seldom used in the acute setting, although their introduction at this phase should nonetheless be considered. Together with their direct inhibition of aldosterone and their potassium‐sparing effect, they can partially offset significant side‐effects of loop and thiazide diuretics. In addition, MRAs initiated in acute settings have been shown to have natriuretic effects. Since the action of the MRA spironolactone occurs 48–72 h after oral intake (Table 1), eplerenone or canrenoate potassium could be favoured in the setting of WHF. In the ATHENA‐HF trial, spironolactone use at 100 mg/day was deemed safe and did not result in hyperkalaemia or WRF (but did not improve outcome either possibly because of the short follow‐up and slow pharmacokinetics of spironolactone).

Finally, assessment of diuretic response is critical in routine practice. Clinical signs of decongestion, diuresis, weight loss and renal function have limited sensitivity for guiding diuretic therapy. Urinary sodium monitoring is a simple indicator of diuretic response that is associated with prognosis and has the potential of becoming a useful tool for routine practice guidance of diuretic therapy. Serial measurement of natriuretic peptide concentrations are commonly utilized in US institutions for monitoring trajectory of decongestion. Given the stability of N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP), even home‐based phlebotomy with centralized measurement may be performed. The use of ultrasound, including serial assessment of lung B‐lines, inferior vena cava or jugular vein diameter, or intra‐renal venous flow have also shown potential to be useful in this setting and is currently under evaluation.

### Guideline for the management of heart failure caused by systolic… [^111gHWTk]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Part I of this guideline detailed how the therapeutic paradigm of heart failure has changed over the past decade. 1 This new understanding of heart failure has led to new treatment approaches. The end point of treatment is no longer merely the limiting of congestive symptoms. Rather, the new standard for treatment also includes decreasing mortality. Part II presents evidence-based treatment options that are practical for use by primary care physicians. The treatment guideline is based on the symptomatic classification scheme described in the first part of this article. 1 The methods for guideline development and the evidence weighting for the recommendations are also detailed in part I.

1. **Pharmacologic Therapy**: Primary Drugs In this guideline, drugs specifically indicated for use in patients with heart failure are referred to as "primary drugs. " Use of these drugs according to the new classification scheme is presented in Table 1.

2 Dosing and cost information are provided in Table 2, 2 and "clinical pearls" are given in Table
3. 2 A comparison of the guideline's recommendations with those from other recent guidelines is presented in Table 4. 3–5 Common drug interactions are listed in Table 5.
2. ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING ENZYME INHIBITORS Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are indicated in the treatment of all patients with systolic heart failure. A number of landmark randomized, controlled trials 6–8 have demonstrated the effectiveness of these drugs in reducing morbidity and mortality in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Unless absolutely contraindicated, ACE inhibitor therapy should be considered a priority. Because of perceived risks and contraindications, ACE inhibitors are often avoided in patients with heart failure. Renal dysfunction and cough should not be considered absolute contraindications to the use of these agents.

When the systolic blood pressure is less than 100 mm Hg or the creatinine level is elevated, careful monitoring is warranted during the initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy. The dosing of ACE inhibitors is controversial. Target dosages that reflect those used in mortality trials are provided in. Table 2. 2 The table includes only agents that have been tested in mortality trials. The Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival Study 9 sought to explore whether higher dosages of ACE inhibitors would be more effective. However, the ATLAS study compared high dosages to low dosages, and there was no comparison to the target dosages that had been shown to be effective in mortality trials. 10 At present, we cannot support the routine use of high dosages of ACE inhibitors as being more effective than the target dosages listed in Table 2 2.

DIRECT-ACTING VASODILATORS In combination, the direct-acting vasodilators isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine were the first medications shown to improve survival in heart failure. 18 Subsequently, randomized, controlled trials demonstrated that ACE inhibitors were superior to these agents. 7 Guidelines from the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research 19 indicate that direct-acting vasodilators can be considered a potential alternative if ACE inhibitors are poorly tolerated in patients with heart failure. A retrospective analysis 20 of these clinical trials suggests that blacks may gain greater benefit from isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine than nonblacks. CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS Calcium channels blockers have no direct role in the treatment of heart failure resulting from systolic dysfunction.

### Spironolactone [^1153mpCE]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Medical uses Spironolactone is primarily used in the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, where it has demonstrated significant benefits in reducing mortality and hospitalizations when added to standard therapy. Multiple studies show that spironolactone improves left ventricular diastolic function and reduces heart failure hospitalisations in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, though without benefits in all-cause death or overall hospitalisation rates. Also, some evidence suggests spironolactone may be effective in HFpEF with resistant hypertension refractory to an ACE inhibitor/ARB, calcium channel blocker, and diuretic.

It is also used to treat edematous conditions such as nephrotic syndrome or ascites in people with liver disease, essential hypertension, low blood levels of potassium, secondary hyperaldosteronism, and Conn's syndrome. The most common use of spironolactone is in the treatment of heart failure. Heart failure Although loop diuretics helps to treat acute symptoms of heart failure, the role of diuretics in the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists' class such as spironolactone is to reduce mortality and morbidity associated with certain types of chronic heart failure. One randomised control trial in 1999 found that the addition of spironolactone to standard therapy reduced all-cause mortality in patients with HF by 30%. Current recommendations from the American Heart Association are to use spironolactone in patients with NYHA Class II-IV heart failure who have a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 35%.

Spironolactone improves left ventricular diastolic function in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, but it has no effect on mortality and hospitalization. Due to its antiandrogenic properties, spironolactone can cause effects associated with low androgen levels and hypogonadism in males. For this reason, men are typically not prescribed spironolactone for any longer than a short period of time, e.g., for an acute exacerbation of heart failure. A newer medication, eplerenone, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of heart failure, and lacks the antiandrogenic effects of spironolactone. As such, it is far more suitable for men for whom long-term medication is being chosen.

While mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist as a class is likely to be beneficial in heart-failure patients, the precise comparative magnitude of effect on mortality between spironolactone and eplerenone remains subject to some clinical uncertainty, with limited comparative data available for canrenone. High blood pressure About one in 100 people with hypertension have elevated levels of aldosterone; in these people, the antihypertensive effect of spironolactone may exceed that of complex combined regimens of other antihypertensives since it targets the primary cause of the elevated blood pressure. However, a Cochrane review found adverse effects at high doses and little effect on blood pressure at low doses in the majority of people with high blood pressure. There is no evidence of person-oriented outcome at any dose in this group.

### Inappropriate use of spironolactone in heart failure… [^1166oDGL]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

In the Randomized Spironolactone Evaluation Study, spironolactone was shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure. Patients enrolled in this trial were those with New York Heart Association Class III and IV heart failure, normal serum potassium levels, and normal or only slightly elevated serum creatinine levels. The dosage used in this study was substantially less than the dosage normally used in the treatment of cirrhosis or hypertension. Spironolactone is easier to start and titrate than the standard heart failure treatment of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers. Because long-term outcome data are not available, Bozkurt and associates studied the appropriateness and complications of the use of spironolactone in the treatment of heart failure in clinical practices. Patients who received prescriptions for spironolactone during a five-month period were eligible for the study.

The medical records of those who met the inclusion criteria were reviewed for 12 months after spironolactone was initiated. Primary objectives were to determine if the patients met the criteria for using spironolactone in advanced heart failure, if the management followed the RALES trial criteria, and the incidence of complications following spironolactone use. Secondary objectives were to determine adverse events related to hyperkalemia, incidence of hypotension, and correlation between the management index and the specialization and training of physicians. Of the patients who were started on spironolactone, only about 26 percent had documented NYHA class III and IV heart failure and met the RALES criteria. Sixty-five percent of the study group had no documentation of their NYHA class. Most patients were receiving ACE inhibitor or angiotensinreceptor blocker therapy. The mean daily dosages of ACE inhibitors and spironolactone in the study population were higher than in the RALES trial.

Less than 40 percent of the study population had appropriate laboratory and clinical follow-up. Twenty-four percent of the patients developed hyperkalemia, with 12 percent developing severe hyperkalemia. Three percent of the patients required temporary pacemaker insertion. The authors conclude that spironolactone is being used to treat heart failure without consideration of the NYHA class or other appropriate criteria for initiating therapy. They add that clinical follow-up did not adhere to the RALES trial guidelines, resulting in a higher incidence of complications. The goal of therapy should be to maximize the use of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers in the treatment of heart failure.
