## Question

when should the first blood sample be taken in pediatrics for enoxaparin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when the first blood sample for enoxaparin monitoring should be drawn in pediatric patients and how to time it relative to dosing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative guideline sources. Then, I should verify the exact timing recommendation and whether it is after the first, second, or third dose. Next, I will check the sampling window around the target time. After that, I need to confirm the therapeutic anti-Xa target range and how it is interpreted. Finally, I should consider special populations and practical nuances that might modify timing or targets, and then synthesize a clear, clinically actionable answer with references.

> Let me first confirm the highest-credibility guidance. The 2024 ASH/ISTH pediatric VTE guidelines explicitly recommend that the first anti-FXa level be checked 4 hours after the second or third dose of LMWH, with a pragmatic range of about 3.5–6 hours, and then dose-adjusted if not in the therapeutic range, which directly answers the timing question for enoxaparin in children [^1178NH3F] [^111yNVoq].

> Wait, let me verify the exact phrasing so I don't overstate it. The guideline says "the first anti-FXa level is usually checked 4 hours (range, 3.5–6) after the second or third dose", which means sampling after dose 2 or 3, not after the very first dose, and drawing the sample 4 hours post-dose with a small window for operational flexibility [^111yNVoq].

> Hold on, I should also cross-check with earlier consensus. The 2012 ACCP guideline suggested monitoring LMWH in children to a target anti-Xa of 0.5–1.0 IU/mL in a sample taken 4–6 hours after subcutaneous injection, which aligns on the timing window and target, though it did not specify precisely after which dose to sample, reinforcing the ASH/ISTH directive to sample after the second or third dose rather than immediately after initiation [^1129N8zb] [^115YKwwo].

> I need to ensure the therapeutic target is correct. The ASH/ISTH guideline targets a peak anti-FXa of 0.5–1.0 IU/mL in a sample taken about 4 hours after a dose, with acknowledgment that some centers use 0.5–0.8 IU/mL and that inter-assay variability complicates strict interpretation, so clinical judgment and local assay characteristics matter when acting on a measured value [^112yzX37] [^115SgNHq].

> Let me consider special populations and practical nuances. In critically ill children, younger infants, and those with rapid clinical changes, closer monitoring is reasonable, and some centers may sample earlier if there is concern for under- or over-anticoagulation, but the standard recommendation remains to check after the second or third dose at steady-state conditions. For children with obesity, higher starting exposures are possible, so careful early monitoring and dose adjustments are prudent, and dose rounding to the nearest milligram is advised due to administration constraints in small children [^115SgNHq] [^114xZra7] [^1178NH3F].

> But wait, what if someone proposes checking after the very first dose to accelerate optimization. I should double-check whether any high-quality guidance endorses that. The ASH/ISTH guideline does not recommend sampling after the first dose; it specifies after the second or third dose, so deviating to an earlier check would be nonstandard and should be reserved for exceptional circumstances with specialist oversight rather than routine practice [^1178NH3F] [^111yNVoq].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final clinical answer succinctly. The first blood sample for enoxaparin monitoring in pediatric patients should be drawn 4 hours after the second or third subcutaneous dose, accepting a pragmatic window of about 3.5–6 hours post-dose, and interpreted against a therapeutic anti-Xa target of 0.5–1.0 IU/mL, with dose adjustment if outside the target range [^1178NH3F] [^111yNVoq] [^112yzX37].

---

The first blood sample for enoxaparin monitoring in pediatrics should be drawn **4 hours after the second or third dose** [^1178NH3F] to assess peak anti-Xa activity and guide dose adjustment. This timing balances early therapeutic assessment with steady-state pharmacokinetics, and dose adjustments should be based on the result to maintain a therapeutic anti-Xa range of 0.5–1.0 IU/mL [^112yzX37].

---

## Recommended timing for the first blood sample

- **Standard practice**: Obtain the first anti-Xa level 4 hours after the second or third enoxaparin dose [^1178NH3F] [^111yNVoq].

- **Rationale**: This timing captures peak anti-Xa activity and reflects steady-state pharmacokinetics, enabling accurate dose adjustment [^116XUwdy].

- **Acceptable range**: Sampling within 3–5 hours post-dose is reasonable if the exact 4-hour window is not feasible [^112yzX37].

---

## Therapeutic anti-Xa target range

The **therapeutic range** is 0.5–1.0 IU/mL, measured 4 hours post-dose [^112yzX37]; some centers use 0.5–0.8 IU/mL [^115SgNHq].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring earlier or more frequent monitoring

Certain clinical scenarios may necessitate **earlier or more frequent monitoring**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale for earlier monitoring** |
|-|-|
| Renal impairment | Enoxaparin is renally cleared; impaired renal function increases drug accumulation and bleeding risk [^116TsbYA] [^115q9xFP] |
| Obesity | Altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate dose adjustments and closer monitoring [^114xZra7] [^115Zbtk6] |
| Critical illness | Hemodynamic instability and organ dysfunction can alter drug disposition [^117FSp8c] |
| Neonates and infants | Rapid growth and developmental changes affect pharmacokinetics [^1159uEy6] |

---

## Practical considerations for blood sampling

- **Sample type**: Use a citrated plasma sample for anti-Xa assay [^1114H3tL].

- **Assay variability**: Be aware of inter-laboratory variability; use the same assay consistently when possible [^115SgNHq].

- **Patient comfort**: Minimize venipuncture frequency, especially in young children [^111cgjGK].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First sample**: 4 hours after the second or third dose [^1178NH3F].

- **Target range**: 0.5–1.0 IU/mL (some centers use 0.5–0.8 IU/mL) [^112yzX37].

- **Earlier monitoring**: Consider in renal impairment, obesity, critical illness, or neonates/infants [^114xZra7] [^115SgNHq].

- **Practicalities**: Use citrated plasma, consistent assays, and minimize venipunctures [^116kPnci] [^111cgjGK].

---

The first anti-Xa level should be drawn **4 hours after the second or third dose**, with earlier or more frequent monitoring in special populations; this approach ensures safe, effective enoxaparin therapy in pediatric patients.

Fondaparinux

Therapeutic range

Fondaparinux is not routinely monitored in adults but, if required, can be monitored using an anti-FXa activity assay, calibrated with fondaparinux. Target peak concentration for therapeutic anticoagulation in adults is 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L, and this range has been extrapolated to children treated with fondaparinux. Fondaparinux does not usually affect routine coagulation tests, prothrombin time, or aPTT, when used in therapeutic doses but can cause aPTT prolongation at higher doses.

Dosing/dose frequency

A starting dose of 0.1 mg/kg once daily is recommended in children aged 1 to 17 years. This is based on an open-label prospective study (FondaKIDS) of 24 children treated for DVT or HIT. Dosing was adjusted to achieve peak concentrations of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L after 4 hours, tested initially after the first dose, with 88% of individuals achieving the target concentration without dose adjustment.

Periprocedural management

The anticoagulant effect of fondaparinux may persist for 2 to 4 days in patients with normal renal function because of its long elimination half-life.

Management of bleeding

There is no antidote to fondaparinux. Bleeding should be managed as per protocols for managing bleeding due to other irreversible anticoagulants.

Warfarin, acenocoumarol, and phenprocoumon

Therapeutic range

Target therapeutic ranges for children are currently extrapolated from the therapeutic ranges used in adults for the different indications. The most common target international normalized ratio (INR) for children for the treatment of VTE is 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0). High-risk conditions may require a higher range of 2.5 to 3.5. As yet, there have been no clinical trials to assess appropriate INR ranges for children.

### Population pharmacokinetics of enoxaparin in infants, children and adolescents during secondary thromboembolic prophylaxis: a cohort study [^113KFCN7]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Enoxaparin has been extensively studied in adults on its safety and efficacy during prevention of symptomatic thromboembolism when acute anticoagulation or secondary prevention is required as a result of venous thrombosis or stroke. In children, it is still used off-label and little is known about the pharmacokinetics in children.

Objectives

The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether a once- or twice-daily dosing regimen would be feasible in children to achieve appropriate plasma levels of enoxaparin.

Patients/Methods

A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using anti-factor (F)Xa activity data from 126 children (median age: 5.9 years) receiving enoxaparin either as a once- or twice-daily dosing regimen.

Results

A two-compartment model was adequate for describing the enoxaparin kinetics. Body weight proved to be the most predictive covariate for clearance and central volume of distribution: clearance 15 mL h⁻¹ kg⁻¹, central volume of distribution 169 mL kg⁻¹, intercompartmental clearance 58 mL h⁻¹, peripheral volume of distribution 10 L and absorption rate 0.414 h⁻¹. Interindividual variability was found to be 54% for clearance and 42% for volume of distribution.

Conclusion

The model is capable of describing all age groups and dosing levels of our population and predicts 12 h and 24 h enoxaparin activities sufficiently. According to our results, a once-daily enoxaparin dosing regimen with frequent monitoring is feasible. In 53.2% of the patients the median 24 h trough level was above the desired range of 0.1 IU mL⁻¹ anti-FXa activity for prophylaxis therapy.

### Enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized obese pediatric patients [^1165WV4Z]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Enoxaparin is an anticoagulant used for pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in pediatrics. Enoxaparin pharmacokinetics can be altered in the setting of obesity. Optimal enoxaparin dosing for thromboprophylaxis in children with obesity remains unclear.

Procedure

A retrospective review was conducted of pediatric patients who weighed ≥ 60 kg with BMI ≥ 95th percentile, received enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis, and had at least one appropriately drawn anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) from 2013 to 2022. Anti-Xa levels were reviewed for patients initially treated with enoxaparin 30 mg every 12 h. The average daily enoxaparin dose required to achieve an anti-Xa of 0.2–0.4 unit/mL, which was stratified by BMI percentile and weight, was calculated.

Results

Of 116 patients (median age 15.8 years) included for analysis, 106 patients were initially treated with enoxaparin 30 mg every 12 h. Anti-Xa levels were < 0.2 unit/mL in 53% of patients with BMI > 99th percentile and 54% of patients > 100 kg. Ninety-one patients had at least one anti-Xa 0.2–0.4 unit/mL with an average daily enoxaparin dosing of 66 mg. When stratified by severity of obesity, higher doses were required to attain an anti-Xa 0.2–0.4 unit/mL in patients with BMI > 99th percentile compared with those with 95th-99th percentile (67.8 ± 15.7 vs. 62 ± 5.6 mg/day, p = .01). Patients > 100 kg required significantly higher dose than those ≤ 100 kg (69.1 ± 15.5 vs 61.2 ± 7.3 mg/day, p = .002).

Conclusions

Increased initial dosing and/or anti-Xa level monitoring should be considered in adolescents with severe obesity receiving enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis.

Low molecular weight heparins

LMWHs are derived from UFH through chemical or enzymatic depolymerisation, have approximately one third the molecular weight of UFH (Table 3), and have largely superseded UFH. LMWHs have reduced anti-IIa activity relative to anti-Xa activity because of their shorter molecular length (mean weight corresponds to ~15 saccharide units), a greater bioavailability and a longer duration of anticoagulant effect than UFH, permitting once/twice daily dosing. Although molecular and thus pharmacological heterogeneity still exists within and between LWMHs, it is less pronounced than for UFH, meaning LMWHs are routinely prescribed without monitoring. In VTE treatment, LMWH is used for both rapid anticoagulation during warfarinisation (LMWH therapy continuing until a stable therapeutic INR has been achieved), and when heparin-based anticoagulation is indicated for the duration of VTE treatment (e.g. in pregnancy). The dosing of LMWHs is mostly fixed for VTE thromboprophylaxis, but is weight-based for VTE treatment.

LMWH anti-Xa monitoring

Although LMWH therapy is generally unmonitored, monitoring has been suggested in specific clinical settings including adult patients receiving LMWH with concomitant renal dysfunction, morbid obesity, during pregnancy, and to check compliance. Consensus-based paediatric guidelines also recommend monitoring therapeutic LMWH in paediatric patients. The recommended monitoring test is the chromogenic anti-Xa assay, which indirectly determines drug concentration (in anti-Xa International Units/mL) by measuring ex vivo the extent to which exogenous factor Xa is inhibited by LMWH-antithrombin complexes present in the patient's blood sample. Clinical factors associated with anti-Xa activity on LMWH include dose, body weight, renal function (see later) and levels of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and TFPI-Xa complexes; the latter two being consistent with heparin-induced TFPI mobilisation.

### Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) [^1176xrL5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism and Reduction in Risk of Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism in Pediatric Patients

Dosing of XARELTO was not studied and therefore dosing cannot be reliably determined in the following patient populations. Its use is therefore not recommended in children less than 6 months of age with any of the following:

Less than 37 weeks of gestation at birth
Less than 10 days of oral feeding
Body weight of less than 2.6 kg.

To increase absorption, all doses should be taken with feeding or with food.

Monitor the child's weight and review the dose regularly, especially for children below 12 kg. This is to ensure a therapeutic dose is maintained.

All pediatric patients (except < 2 years old with catheter-related thrombosis): Therapy with XARELTO should be continued for at least 3 months in children with thrombosis. Treatment can be extended up to 12 months when clinically necessary. The benefit of continued therapy beyond 3 months should be assessed on an individual basis taking into account the risk for recurrent thrombosis versus the potential risk of bleeding.

Pediatric patients < 2 years old with catheter-related thrombosis: Therapy with XARELTO should be continued for at least 1 month in children less than 2 years old with catheter-related thrombosis. Treatment can be extended up to 3 months when clinically necessary. The benefit of continued therapy beyond 1 month should be assessed on an individual basis taking into account the risk for recurrent thrombosis versus the potential risk of bleeding.

Therapeutic range

The "therapeutic range" of LMWH for treatment of VTE in children has been extrapolated from small studies in adults, which targeted a peak anti-FXa level of 0.5 to 1.0 IU/mL in a sample taken 4 hours (range, 3–5) after a dose. Although most pediatric studies have used this range, a large cohort study of enoxaparin used a range of 0.5 to 0.8 IU/mL with similar outcomes. Although monitoring LMWH in adults is not routine, monitoring and adjusting the dose to stay in the therapeutic anti-FXa range is the recommended approach in children, based on numerous studies that have identified significant interpatient dose variation across multiple age groups.

Whether this is the optimal therapeutic anti-FXa range for children remains unknown, and most retrospective studies have been unable to correlate anti-FXa levels with efficacy or safety outcomes, with some exception. In addition, there is poor interlaboratory agreement and considerable variation among available anti-FXa assays, likely providing false reassurance regarding the importance of the therapeutic range. Although some have proposed that fixed weight-based dosing in children without titrating to a "therapeutic range" may be safe, effective, and reduce venipuncture, this has not been demonstrated clinically.

Despite these challenges, we have several decades of experience titrating LMWHs in children targeting this range. Recent phase 3 clinical trials in pediatric VTE have confirmed low rates of bleeding and recurrent VTE in children treated with LMWHs across a wide range of settings.

Monitoring

Anti-FXa levels can ensure the drug is within the target range, typically 0.5 to 1 U/mL. Nonadherence can be detected if anti-FXa levels are not measurable or well below the anticipated level. The optimal frequency of anti-FXa monitoring in children has not been investigated. Clinically stable older children likely require minimal monitoring. Younger children with more rapid changes in weight, as well as children who are critically ill and those with changing renal status or antithrombin levels are likely to benefit from closer monitoring.

Regarding medical management for venous thromboembolism in children, more specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy, choice of agent, ACCP 2012 guidelines recommend to consider titrating therapeutic UFH in pediatric patients to achieve a target range of anti-Xa activity of 0.35–0.7 units/mL or an aPTT range that correlates to this anti-Xa range or to a protamine titration range of 0.2–0.4 units/mL. Consider limiting UFH boluses to no greater than 75–100 units/kg when initiating therapy, and withhold or reduce boluses if there are significant bleeding risks. Consider avoiding long-term use of therapeutic UFH in pediatric patients.

### Non-therapeutic anti-Xa levels in medical patients receiving anticoagulant therapy with enoxaparin [^115uaSPf]. Thrombosis Research (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Anticoagulant activity of enoxaparin is not routinely monitored even when previous studies have shown a high pharmacological variability. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of non-therapeutic anti-Xa levels among medical patients using enoxaparin as anticoagulant therapy and to point out potential risk factors related to the risk of having a sub-therapeutic level.

Materials and Methods

Anti-Xa levels were measured in a cohort of sixty patients with medical indication for enoxaparin. Patients were categorized according to anti-Xa levels as follows: suboptimal anticoagulation (< 0.5 IU/ml), optimal anticoagulation (between 0.5 and 1.2 IU/ml) or overanticoagulated (> 1.2 IU/ml). Demographic and clinical variables and the use of concomitant medications were described for each group. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to assess the relationship between sub-optimal anticoagulation and potential predictive variables. A linear regression analysis was done to assess the relationship between anti-Xa activity, age, weight, body mass index, administered dose/weight and creatinine clearance.

Results

The mean anti-Xa activity was 0.71 ± 0.32 UI/ml. Thirty one percent of patients had anti-Xa levels out of the therapeutic range, most of them (twenty-eight percent of total population) with a sub-therapeutic level. None of the variables were associated with the risk of a sub-therapeutic anti-Xa level.

Conclusion

Almost one third of patients receiving enoxaparin had anti-Xa levels out of the therapeutic range. We need more studies to determine the clinical relevance of these findings.

### Comparison of anti-Xa levels in obese and non-obese pediatric patients receiving treatment doses of enoxaparin [^112RNniz]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if using actual body weight to dose enoxaparin in obese pediatric patients results in higher anti-Xa levels compared with non-obese pediatric patients.

Study Design

This was a retrospective case-matched study of obese and non-obese pediatric patients receiving treatment doses of enoxaparin in a tertiary care children's hospital. Patients were included if they were initiated on treatment doses of enoxaparin, had appropriate anti-Xa levels drawn, and were between 2 and 18 years of age. Patients with renal insufficiency, hyperbilirubinemia, goal anti-Xa level < 0.5 or > 1 unit/mL, or receiving mechanical circulatory support were excluded. Obese patients who met study criteria were matched on a 1:1 basis with non-obese patients.

Results

All baseline characteristics were similar except for body mass index percentile (98.2 ± 2 vs 48.7 ± 15, P < .01). Obese patients had higher initial anti-Xa levels (0.67 ± 0.27 vs 0.53 ± 0.24 unit/mL, P = 0.028). Over time, obese patients required a lower mean dose to achieve therapeutic anti-Xa levels than non-obese patients (0.81 ± 0.19 vs 1.1 ± 0.4 mg/kg, P = 0.005).

Conclusions

The mean initial anti-Xa level was higher in obese pediatric patients compared with non-obese pediatric patients, but a dosage adjustment was not required. Obese patients may need closer monitoring over time to avoid supratherapeutic levels and possible bleeding events.

### Use of real-world data and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling to characterize enoxaparin disposition in children with obesity [^1161KmJ7]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

In developing the novel enoxaparin PBPK model, enoxaparin binding to antithrombin to form the anti‐Xa complex was key to evaluating the model, since enoxaparin is measured via its surrogate anti‐Xa concentration. Limited studies available in the literature reported a K D of 0.64–177 nM, with studies varying considerably in the molecular weight and affinity of heparin used for analysis. This is well below enoxaparin concentrations in plasma at therapeutic doses. However, enoxaparin is widely used clinically because it is known to have dose‐linear PK, so this binding process was forced within the linear binding range by using a K D value of 2.5 μM, just above enoxaparin's therapeutic concentration range. Plasma antithrombin concentration was assumed in excess of this therapeutic concentration to allow for adequate enoxaparin binding, as previously assumed in a coagulation cascade systems model. Additionally, no differences in the absorption rate constant were implemented with obesity. While increased fat mass may decrease the rate at which a subcutaneously dosed drug can reach the bloodstream, no differences in absorption rate were observed when attempting to optimize this parameter in children without vs. with obesity.

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) monitoring and anti-Xa targets — coagulation monitoring is not generally necessary, though some authorities suggest monitoring in obese patients and in those with renal insufficiency, and monitoring may also be advisable when treatment doses are given during pregnancy. A randomized controlled trial comparing monitored and unmonitored dalteparin therapy for treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) showed no benefit of monitoring; monitoring is thus not recommended for the majority of patients, and if monitoring is required, the anti-Xa level is the recommended test. For treatment of VTE, a conservative peak anti-Xa level with twice-daily enoxaparin or nadroparin is 0.6 to 1.0 units/mL, and the target range for peak anti-Xa levels measured 4 h after dosing with once-daily enoxaparin is likely to be above 1.0 units/mL, whereas it is 0.85 units/mL with tinzaparin and 1.3 units/mL and 1.05 units/mL with nadroparin and dalteparin, respectively.

ASH/ISTH pediatric VTE — submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise: For pediatric patients with PE and echocardiographic or biochemical evidence of right ventricular dysfunction but without hemodynamic compromise, the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests using anticoagulation alone rather than thrombolysis followed by anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕◯◯◯). Patients with submassive PE should be monitored closely for the development of hemodynamic compromise, and the panel concluded that the risks of thrombolysis outweighed the benefits in most cases; hence, the conditional recommendation for anticoagulation alone.

Antifactor Xa monitoring and associated dose adjustments

What is the utility of antifactor Xa monitoring for VTE chemoprophylaxis?

Recommendation

A regimen for VTE prophylaxis using enoxaparin with dose adjustment based on anti-Xa levels may be considered for trauma and surgical ICU patients thought to have a low bleeding risk. Such a regimen results in more patients having anti-Xa levels in the target range than with a fixed dosing regimen. However, evidence is insufficient to determine if this practice results in lower VTE rates. This strategy may not be appropriate for some patients (eg, those with TBI) and individual patient characteristics should be considered when choosing a dosing regimen.

Discussion

The study by Geerts et al in 1996showed benefit of enoxaparin 30 mg twice a day in reducing venogram-diagnosed DVT rates, and minimal reduction with UFH (5000 units twice a day) in trauma. More recent evidence, mostly from underpowered retrospective studies, has suggested that the typical fixed dosing regimen of enoxaparin 30 mg two times per day does not inhibit factor Xa in a uniform and predictable manner in all patients. This makes intuitive sense, given the variable degree of VTE risk, hypercoagulability and sometimes unpredictable pharmacokinetics in critically ill and injured patients.

Anti-Xa activity is assessed via a functional assay that measures the degree of inhibition of factor Xa by UFH or LMWH. Blood for anti-Xa testing is typically drawn 4 hours after the third dose of enoxaparin. Levels are measured in International Units per milliliter, with target prophylactic levels falling in the range of 0.2–0.4 IU/mL (the target for therapeutic full anticoagulation is > 0.5 IU/mL). If levels are below target, the dose may be increase by 10 mg and levels rechecked again 4 hours after the third new dose. Data on the maximum safe dose are insufficient, but several authors have recommended not exceeding 60 mg two times per day dosing. While true therapeutic dosing often exceeds 60 mg two times per day, the conditions under which clinicians may provide prophylactic enoxaparin may differ from those for therapeutic, especially when considering bleeding risk. Also, if anti-Xa levels have not reached prophylactic targets at higher doses, one should consider heparin resistance or antithrombin-III deficiency, occult VTE with high clot burden or other undetected factors that may prompt further investigation.

### The challenge of developing pain medications for children: therapeutic needs and future perspectives [^111cgjGK]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Minimum subject numbers – maximum information

Design of pediatric trials is very much a balancing act, keeping the numbers of children participating in the study to a minimum, but obtaining as much information as possible for deriving robust dosing recommendations in all age groups. Modeling and simulation play a key role throughout the program, eg, by using prior knowledge in adults to guide the selection of the first pediatric dose. Blood volumes drawn in pediatric trials are recommended not to exceed 3% of the total blood volume over a 4-week period and 1% of the total blood volume for a single draw. The restriction on blood volume limits the numbers of samples which can be taken from each child, particularly in neonates and young infants. Again, modeling and simulation are indispensable to design the optimal sparse sampling strategy to best characterize the concentration–time profile of the medication with the minimum numbers of patients and samples.

One key question is how many subjects are needed for achieving the objectives of the trial. Wang et alsuggested for trials with a primary pharmacokinetic objective to prospectively "target a 95% confidence interval within 60% and 140% of the geometric mean estimates of clearance and volume of distribution for the drug in each pediatric subgroup with at least 80% power". For efficacy trials, similar constraints on sample numbers apply: sample size must be as low as possible but still sufficient to determine efficacy with adequate power and to provide a robust safety database.

Sensitive bioanalytical methods

The bioanalytical method(s) need to work with the lowest possible plasma/serum volume. Prior to initiating pediatric trials, the available method(s) may therefore require optimization. Microsampling techniques (eg, dried blood spots) may also be considered as an alternative approach to addressing the constraints on blood volumes.

Blood samples taken in adult pharmacokinetic trials are generally venous samples. In our experience with postsurgical trials, most investigators strongly favor arterial sampling in the very young since an arterial line was already in place.

Maturation of body functions

The rates of maturation of body functions and biochemical processes vary widely between the different age groups and can change rapidly within even a few days in the early weeks of life. Thus, linear dosing based on body weight alone can never be assumed in this vulnerable population. All aspects of drug absorption (eg, gastrointestinal activity), distribution (eg, body composition), metabolism (eg, enzyme expression and maturation) and excretion (ADME) change with age.

ASH/ISTH 2024 pediatric VTE guideline — unprovoked DVT/PE duration: For pediatric patients with unprovoked DVT or PE, the panel suggests using anticoagulation therapy for 3 months rather than a longer duration of therapy. Remarks note that rates of recurrent VTE in children and adolescents with age of > 1 year with unprovoked VTE are relatively high (21%-36% at 3.5 years follow up), but there are no pediatric studies evaluating duration of therapy; patient values and preferences should be considered when making this decision.

### Use of real-world data and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling to characterize enoxaparin disposition in children with obesity [^114cESr8]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Enoxaparin is a low‐molecular‐weight (2,000–8,000 Da) heparin that prevents the formation of activated factor X (Xa), a serine protease that plays an essential role in the coagulation cascade. Despite the fact that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) label states that "the safety and efficacy of [enoxaparin] in children has not been established", enoxaparin is commonly dosed in children both with and without obesity. However, obesity‐induced pharmacokinetic (PK) changes and appropriate dosing in children with obesity remains unclear. While not indicated for pediatric populations, the FDA does recommend therapeutic drug monitoring of enoxaparin via anti‐Xa concentration in certain special populations, namely adults with renal impairment or obesity, yet direct measurement of enoxaparin concentration in plasma is challenging given that it is administered as a mixture of polymeric molecules with varying chain length. Therefore, measurement of anti‐Xa concentration in plasma serves as a surrogate for enoxaparin concentration, with the higher the anti‐Xa concentration, the higher the degree of anticoagulation. Therapeutic drug monitoring occurs by comparing maximum anti‐Xa concentration (at 4 hours post dosing) to target ranges of 0.6–1.0 IU/mL for treatment of deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism or 0.1–0.3 IU/mL for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis or ischemic complications from non–Q‐wave myocardial infarction. Therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment to achieve these target ranges helps to mitigate the risk of subtherapeutic or supratherapeutic concentrations (serious thromboembolic events and risk of bleeding events, respectively).

IV enoxaparin — use and pharmacokinetics in children note that IV enoxaparin has been used in a small number of pediatric studies, including patients who are critically ill and those with significant soft tissue edema or burns. When administered as an infusion over 30 minutes, peak anti-FXa levels were similar to those reported with SQ administration, and the clearance of the drug has not been carefully studied with IV administration.

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) dosing and monitoring in children are outlined, including an initial loading dose range, therapeutic target, and a monitoring recommendation. A loading dose of 75 to 100 IU/kg is reported to achieve therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) in most children, and the maintenance dose needed to reach the adult therapeutic range corresponding to an anti-factor Xa (anti-FXa) level of 0.35 to 0.7 is higher in neonates than older children and is gestational age dependent. Both aPTT and anti-FXa are used clinically, but studies show poor correlation and no superiority for predicting thrombosis or bleeding; therefore, we suggest that clinicians consistently use 1 test to monitor patients on UFH anticoagulation.

### Enoxaparin and antifactor Xa levels in pediatric acute burn patients [^113m22Rp]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

Previous work from the authors' group showed a risk for inadequate enoxaparin dosing for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in adult burn patients when traditional recommendations are used. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this also applied to pediatric burn patients. Included patients were acutely burned, aged 14 years or under, and admitted to the authors' regional burn center between October 1, 2004 and December 15, 2012. Thirty-five patients included in this analysis received enoxaparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis dosed initially at 0.5 mg/kg and monitored with anti-factor Xa levels (anti-Xa) between 0.2 and 0.4U/ml. Of the included patients, 80% were male with a median age of 8 years, a median TBSA of 16%, and a median length of stay of 23 days. Initially 21 patients (60%) had an undetectable anti-Xa (< 0.2 U/ml). Enoxaparin doses were increased but 18 patients (51%) never achieved target anti-Xa. There were no significant differences in sex, weight, dose, depth of injury, or body mass index between those who received appropriate prophylaxis and those who were undertreated. However, median size of burn was significantly larger, median age and height were significantly lower in those who did not reach target. The low number of patients achieving target prophylactic anti-Xa in this study demonstrates the need for routine anti-Xa monitoring in pediatric burns. Additionally, pediatric patients with major burn injury may require initial dosing of enoxaparin greater than published recommendations because of altered pharmacokinetics.

Intravenous (Bolus) Injection Technique

Use the multiple-dose vial for intravenous injections. Administer enoxaparin sodium injection through an intravenous line. Do not mix or coadminister enoxaparin sodium injection with other medications. Flush the intravenous access device with a sufficient volume of saline or dextrose solution prior to and following the intravenous bolus administration of enoxaparin sodium injection, to prevent mixing of drugs. Enoxaparin sodium injection is compatible with normal saline solution (0.9%) or 5% dextrose in water.

2.6 Monitoring for Safety

During therapy monitor complete blood counts including platelets and stool occult blood.

Assess for signs and symptoms of bleeding.

In patients with renal impairment anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium injection.

If during enoxaparin sodium therapy abnormal coagulation parameters or bleeding should occur, anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium injection [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) are not adequate for monitoring the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium injection.

### A practical approach to the use of low molecular weight heparins in VTE treatment and prophylaxis in children and newborns [^117PY64h]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Low-molecular weight heparins are currently the most commonly used anticoagulants in children and newborns. However, since thrombotic complications rarely occur outside large children's hospitals, physicians often encounter some practical problems in managing these treatments when a pediatric thrombosis specialist is not available. The drug of choice is enoxaparin, due to its favorable FXa/FIIa ratio and the availability of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data. The treatment of acute thrombosis should be started with two daily injections but when compliance is an issue, a single daily administration schedule could be chosen for secondary prophylaxis ensuring careful measurement of the post 24-hour anti-FXa activity. Furthermore, a subcutaneous device may be a useful tool and a topical dermal anesthetic could be effective in controlling pain without affecting anti-FXa levels. In neonate and toddlers, where mini doses are frequently needed, the dead space of syringes and needles could represent an issue and therefore the use of insulin syringes without dead space is advisable, while a dilution of the drug is useful with other syringes. This article derives from a nonsystematic review of the available literature, with special attention to recent international guidelines and expert recommendations, combined to authors' clinical practice in large tertiary pediatric hospitals and will provide concise and practical information for the use of low-molecular weight heparin in childhood and infancy in a sort of "answering frequently asked questions".

### Association of outcomes and anti-Xa levels in the treatment of pediatric venous thromboembolism [^111ToM4k]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There are few data in the pediatric population evaluating the relationship between measured anti-Xa levels during enoxaparin therapy and thrombotic outcomes.

Objective

To determine whether there is a difference in outcomes in children who receive enoxaparin with mean anti-Xa levels between 0.45 and 0.79 unit/ml (low therapeutic range) versus between 0.80 and 1.05 unit/ml (high therapeutic range) throughout their course of their treatment.

Methods

We retrospectively identified subjects with uncomplicated venous thromboembolism treated with enoxaparin.

Results

Of 69 patients with any response to therapy, 48 (70%) had mean anti-Xa levels in the low therapeutic range and 21 (30%) had mean anti-Xa levels in the high therapeutic range. Of 20 patients with no documented response to therapy, 13 (65%) had mean anti-Xa levels in the low therapeutic range and 7 (35%) had mean anti-Xa levels in the high therapeutic range. Forty-eight (79%) of the 61 patients with low-range mean anti-Xa level had any response to therapy. Twenty-one (75%) of the 28 patients with high-range mean anti-Xa level had any response to therapy. Chi-square test (P = 0.080) and logistic regression (OR = 1.23, P = 0.70) demonstrated no significant association between mean anti-Xa range (lower vs. upper) and therapy response.

Conclusions

There was no statistically significant difference between low-range versus high-range mean anti-Xa levels and thrombus resolution. Empiric clinical practices of targeting anti-Xa levels in the higher therapeutic range to achieve better outcomes may not be warranted.

Evidence base and study characteristics — direct oral anticoagulants in pediatric acute VTE: The updated review identified 3 RCTs (2 dabigatran, 1 rivaroxaban), 2 large multicenter trials, and 1 smaller single-institution trial, totaling 853 patients aged < 18 years, of whom 523 received a DOAC. Acute VTE was objectively confirmed by imaging, and a minimum of 3 days of parenteral therapy preceded DOAC initiation. Approximately 10% in the multicenter dabigatran arm were taken off study for not reaching an a priori therapeutic level. The panel agreed to pool rivaroxaban and dabigatran data, and outcomes considered were mortality, recurrence, major bleeding, and CRNMB.

Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) monitoring and starting doses — anti-FXa levels can ensure the drug is within the target range, typically 0.5 to 1 IU/mL, and the first anti-FXa level is usually checked 4 hours (range, 3–5) after the second or third dose of LMWH and adjusted if not in the therapeutic range. Because of the difficulty of administering submilligram dosing of enoxaparin, rounding up to the nearest whole milligram is recommended, and this recommendation applies also to the other LMWHs, which are dosed in units. Recommended starting doses include enoxaparin 0 to 2 mo: 1.5–1.7 mg/kg, q12h; 3 mo to 1 y: 1.5 mg/kg, q12h; 1–5 y: 1 mg/kg, q12h; 6–11 y: 1 mg/kg, q12h; 12–18 y: 1 mg/kg, q12h, and fondaparinux 1–17 y: 0.1 mg/kg, q24h, with dose subsequently titrated to achieve a peak heparin anti-FXa level of 0.5–1.0 IU/mL. Current recommended dosing of LMWHs is shown in Table 7 and these are predominantly age dependent.

### The in vitro anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban in children [^1143qHRb]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Current anticoagulation therapy in children is less than ideal, requiring regular venous monitoring and dosing adjustments. Limitations associated with conventional anticoagulants have prompted the development of novel drugs that specifically target key proteins in the coagulation system. Rivaroxaban is the first oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor available for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in adults. Its predictable pharmacokinetic profile, high oral bioavailability and once-daily dosing make rivaroxaban an optimal anticoagulant that warrants investigation in children. The aim of this study was to investigate the age-related anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban in vitro.

Materials and Methods

Age-specific plasma pools were created (i.e. 28 days-23 months, 2–6, 7–11, 12–16 years and adults) and spiked with increasing concentrations of rivaroxaban (0–500 ng/ml). Commercially available PT, APTT and anti-Factor Xa assays, as well as sub-sampling thrombin generation assays, were used to measure rivaroxaban effect.

Results

The results of this study indicate that there are no significant differences in rivaroxaban effect across the age groups in vitro.

Conclusion

In vivo studies are required to confirm the consistency of dose-response across the paediatric age groups.

### Management of iatrogenic acute limb ischaemia in the neonate [^114P7Jqd]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

The first pharmacological intervention implemented was anticoagulation by heparinisation. There is limited literature for ALI secondary to known thrombus in this population. However, heparinisation appears to be the most common first-line treatment in previous similar cases. In a recently published editorial by Kwan et al, the authors raise a similar claim and argue that heparin in children and neonates is considered a UK medicolegal standard, despite the scarcity of evidence. Moreover, they emphasised that a negative outcome such as amputation in a paediatric ALI patient who did not receive proper anticoagulation would be considered substandard care. The recommended dosage regimen for systemic heparinisation in paediatric patients comes from the CHEST guidelines published in 2012, which are themselves based on the work of Michelson et al. According to these guidelines, a loading dose of 75 units of unfractionated heparin (UFH) per kg of body weight should be administered intravenously over 10 min, followed by a maintenance dose of 28 units/kg/hour for infants under 1 year of age. Administration of FFP alongside heparin is not routinely suggested but should be considered when indicated according to coagulation screening and subject to haematological consultation, to augment the amounts of natural anticoagulants, and AT in particular, which are usually low after birth (~60% of adult and paediatric normal values). AT serves as a substrate for UFH and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH); therefore, to ensure sufficient levels for adequate anticoagulation, AT may be supplemented via FFP, as indicated. The anticoagulant effect of UFH should be monitored using activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), which is recommended to be 60–85 s. Out of caution, we have decided to forgo UFH loading dose and started FFP and a continuous infusion of heparin at maintenance doses (table 1), which was continued for 5 days before being switched to subcutaneous LMWH, enoxaparin, initially dosed as 1.5 mg/kg twice per dayand adjusted as needed. Switching to LMWH is desired when possible because it is easier and safer to administer (subcutaneous injections twice per day instead of continuous intravenous infusions). LMWH treatment is monitored using anti-Xa test with a recommended range of 0.5–1.0 units/mL in a sample taken 4–6 hours following a subcutaneous injection. Our patient continued LMWH treatment until discharge and beyond, switching along the way from therapeutic dosing (1.5–2.1 mg/kg two times per day) to prophylactic dosing (1.5–2 mg/kg once daily) as the condition of the limb improved. Both therapeutic and prophylactic anticoagulation were administered for a total of 21 days each (table 1).

### Use of real-world data and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling to characterize enoxaparin disposition in children with obesity [^1177nbdL]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

While this study uses extensive EHR data to address a key clinical question in children with obesity, some limitations exist. EHR data served as a valuable, extensive data source, but inherently had a large amount of variability that translated to wide variability in model simulations (due to variability in data recording, assay variability between sites, etc.). There were missing and incomplete data present within the EHR. ICD‐10 codes were used to extract diagnoses, and information on organ dysfunction may be biased, as these codes are intended primarily for billing vs. research purposes. These codes are inconsistently recorded and might be incomplete or inaccurate. Additionally, measurement techniques and accuracy of equipment for measuring weight and height cannot be standardized. The ICD‐10 codes cannot delineate with certainty which participants received enoxaparin for treatment vs. prophylaxis, so this was assumed based on initial dosing. Note that there could be other reasons for a participant to receive a low initial dose of enoxaparin apart from prophylaxis (e.g. high bleeding risk). While the data are extensive, in many cases there was only one anti‐Xa sample available per dose. EHR data collection aimed to exclude children who were critically ill to avoid confounding factors on PK comparison (e.g. children on dialysis or with severe renal and hepatic dysfunction), but observed concentrations were obtained from hospitalized children who may have other disease state factors not accounted for within the PBPK model. The observed concentrations were mostly (74.9%) within 3–5 hours post dosing, and PBPK model predictions may slightly underestimate observed concentrations. Nevertheless, this study sheds further light on the appropriate dosing of enoxaparin, a commonly used drug, in an underserved patient population of children with obesity. This study also demonstrates the utility of EHR data for PBPK model analysis, provided the sample size is large enough to overcome inherent data noise.

2.2	Laboratory Monitoring for Efficacy and Safety

Adjust the dosage of HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION according to the patient's coagulation test results. Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value. When initiating treatment with HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION by continuous intravenous infusion, determine the coagulation status (aPTT, INR, platelet count) at baseline and continue to follow aPTT approximately every 4 hours and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, perform coagulation tests before each injection during initiation of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter. After deep subcutaneous injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injections.

Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION therapy, regardless of the route of administration.

2.3	Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect with Full-Dose Heparin

The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are based on clinical experience. Although dosages must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines:

2.4	Pediatric Use

Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants.

There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients. Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience. In general, the following dosage schedule may be used as a guideline in pediatric patients:

2.5	Cardiovascular Surgery

Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight. Frequently, a dose of 300 units per kilogram is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes.

2.6	Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism

The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer. Administer the heparin by deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer, arm, or thigh) injection with a fine (25 to 26-gauge) needle to minimize tissue trauma.

### Anticoagulation therapy: indications, monitoring, and complications [^117Q5S5y]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation for thromboembolic disease and bleeding, the main complication of anticoagulation therapy, are uncommon but are potentially life- or limb-threatening conditions that may present in the pediatric emergency department. Thromboembolic disease in children usually occurs as a complication of vascular access, primarily in children with congenital heart disease or cancer. However, complications of anticoagulation therapy used in the treatment of venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, and blocked central venous catheter; arterial thromboembolism, including arterial ischemic stroke, Kawasaki disease, and after cardiac surgery, may warrant a visit to n the pediatric emergency department. Anticoagulation therapy may take the form of unfractionated heparin, low-molecular weight heparin, vitamin K antagonists, acetylsalicylic acid, or thrombolytic therapy. Monitoring anticoagulation therapy in children is very important and follows adult guidelines. Anticoagulant dosing may be adjusted based on activated partial thromboplastin time, anti-factor Xa level, and international normalized ratio.

### Anticoagulation therapies in children [^114Lqrr2]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism is occurring with increasing frequency in children resulting in the more widespread use of anticoagulation in pediatrics. Antithrombotic drugs in children can be divided into the standard and alternative agents. This review discusses standard and alternative anticoagulants. Because standard anticoagulants have significant limitations, including variable pharmacokinetics, issues with therapeutic drug monitoring, frequency of administration, efficacy, and adverse effects, it is expected that the use of alternative anticoagulants will increase over time. With their improved properties and recent prospective clinical trial data, the current and future use of these agents will likely slowly replace of the standard anticoagulants.

### A comparative study of varying doses of enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis in critically ill patients: a double-blinded, randomised controlled trial [^113PSMT8]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Outcome measures

Primary endpoint was to determine the optimal enoxaparin dose. The optimal enoxaparin dose was defined as that dose which would yield the highest target anti-Xa levels, allow patients to remain within target anti-Xa levels for > 75% of the study period, and would not cause an increase in major bleeding events. Secondary endpoints included the identification of any correlation between the dose of enoxaparin and (i) levels of AT, fibrinogen, platelets, and (ii) bleeding - major and minor.

Statistical methods

The null hypothesis was that there was no difference in peak anti-Xa levels between the groups. On the basis of data from previous studies, this study was designed with 80% power to detect a 30% absolute difference in anti-Xa levels between the groups, giving a total sample size of 80 patients. All baseline demographic values were compared using one-way ANOVA (numerical data) or chi-squared test (categorical data). Statements of statistical significance are based on a two-tailed test with a level of 0.05. Individual change over time is pursued by repeated effects modelling, which allows for correlation among measurements taken on the same patient over time. Our initial model used APACHE II, SOFA, creatinine clearance, weight, age, gender, time, treatment allocation and an interaction between treatment and time as possible predictors for the anti-Xa levels. Subsequently, model simplifications were based on likelihood ratio tests. Patients were analysed in the group to which they were randomised, according to the intention-to-treat principle.

### Residual enoxaparin activity, anti-Xa levels, and concerns about the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine anticoagulation guidelines [^1173jnfs]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Currently, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) anticoagulation guidelines recommend that before the performance of a neuraxial procedure a minimum of 24 hours should elapse following a treatment dose of enoxaparin (1 mg/kg twice daily or 1.5 mg/kg once daily). The guidelines have since their inception also consistently recommended against the routine use of anti-Xa level monitoring for patients receiving enoxaparin. However, we noted in our clinical practice that anti-Xa levels were frequently still elevated despite patients meeting the time-based recommendation for treatment dose enoxaparin. To further investigate the possibility that residual anticoagulant activity may persist longer than 24 hours after a treatment dose of enoxaparin, we assessed anti-Xa level activity in patients presenting for elective surgery. Despite nearly universal compliance with ASRA's anticoagulation guidelines (1 sample was drawn at 23.25 hours), anti-Xa activity was found to be elevated in 11 of 19 patients. While 10 patients had an anti-Xa level within the peak prophylactic range (0.2–0.5 IU/mL), 1 patient's level was found to still be in the peak therapeutic range (0.5–1.0 IU/mL). These findings suggest that significant anticoagulant activity may persist longer than previously appreciated after the last treatment dose of enoxaparin and that the current time-based ASRA recommendation may not be conservative enough. Further research is needed to delineate the level of anti-Xa activity below which it is likely safe to proceed with a neuraxial procedure, but it may be time to reconsider the utility of anti-Xa level monitoring when it is available.

### Low-molecular-weight heparin and fondaparinux use in pediatric patients with obesity [^112RyWV9]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study is to comprehensively review the efficacy and safety data of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) and fondaparinux in pediatric patients with obesity.

Data Sources

A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL, Academic Search Complete, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases was conducted (1900 to July 2020). Search terms utilized included LMWH, low-molecular-weight heparin, enoxaparin, dalteparin, tinzaparin, fondaparinux, pediatric, child, children, obese, obesity, overweight. No limits or timeline restrictions were imposed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies that reported pediatric patients with described overweight or obesity and utilized LMWHs or fondaparinux were considered.

Data Synthesis

Of 207 studies screened, 12 were included. Average dose reductions of 12.9% to 37.3% from the starting dose were observed with treatment indications of enoxaparin and increased up to 27.3% for prophylactic indications. Trends could not be concluded in the dalteparin and fondaparinux studies. Four thrombotic and 15 bleeding events were reported in the studies.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Pediatric patients with obesity may initially be underdosed or overdosed with enoxaparin compared with children with healthy body weight, depending on the indication.

Conclusion

Pediatric patients with obesity may benefit from proactively adjusting enoxaparin dosing on initiation of therapy. Further studies are needed for dalteparin and fondaparinux in these populations. Clinical controversy exists with the relevance of monitoring these high-risk medications for therapeutic and prophylactic indications. Thrombotic and hemorrhagic events were similar to reported adult outcomes.

Pediatric venous thromboembolism — dabigatran vs standard-of-care anticoagulants: For pediatric patients with VTE, the panel suggests using dabigatran over SOC anticoagulants (LMWH, UFH, VKA, and fondaparinux) as a conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects (⊕OOO). The panel concluded there was a small benefit of dabigatran over SOC in relation to reduced thrombus recurrence and improved thrombus resolution; undesirable effects were felt to be trivial, with major bleeding reported in fewer patients treated with dabigatran and an equivalent frequency of CRNMB. The panel noted exclusions from DIVERSITY included those aged < 2 years with low body weight and those with severe liver or renal impairment, and raised concern that monitoring and dose adjustment of dabigatran during DIVERSITY could affect efficacy and safety of routine use according to current approvals, which do not require such monitoring. The panel also noted reports of gastrointestinal side effects while on dabigatran as an important consideration when choosing an anticoagulant.

### Rapid enoxaparin adjustment for childhood thrombosis / thromboprophylaxis [^116QznLW]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Enoxaparin dosing in children is imperfect and strategies to optimize initial therapy for patients at high-thrombotic risk would be of clinical benefit. This study looked at using peak-post-first-enoxaparin-dose anti-Xa to guide subsequent enoxaparin dose and timing of administration in children deemed high-thrombotic risk. Fourteen patients (seven aged < 3 months, seven children/adolescents) were identified and reviewed retrospectively. All patients were commenced on a therapeutic enoxaparin dose within ≤ 20 h with average time to therapeutic anti-Xa of 15.4 h (range 4–34 h) for neonates/infants and 10.8 h (range 4–24 h) for children/adolescents. No patient had supratherapeutic anti-Xa or thrombotic/bleeding events. Further studies are needed to validate this approach.

### Use of real-world data and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling to characterize enoxaparin disposition in children with obesity [^111QjjUU]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study used RWD from children with and without obesity receiving enoxaparin and found that obesity status was a significant predictor of anti‐Xa 4‐hour concentration. To better characterize this effect mechanistically, we developed a novel enoxaparin PBPK model in adults, scaled and evaluated the model in children, and then used the model to simulate appropriate dosing in children with and without obesity. While the impact of obesity on enoxaparin PK and dosing has been evaluated in adults, there have been limited studies to date in children, and none with data this extensive in the full pediatric age range in children both with and without obesity. To date, this is the first PBPK model of enoxaparin, and, to our knowledge, the first PBPK model evaluated using EHR data from a national multicenter data repository, which could enable a new data source for this vital modeling tool.

Previous studies evaluating the potentially increased risk of supratherapeutic exposure in patients with obesity are conflicting for both adults and children. Some studies in adults support the recommended weight‐based dosing, suggesting that a minority of adults with obesity receive reduced healthcare provider‐adjusted dosing, and that there is no significant difference in peak concentration or bleeding events in patients with vs. without obesity. Conversely, other studies support conservative dosing in adults with obesity, showing that reduced, lean body weight, and fat‐free mass dosing achieved more concentrations within the target range with reduced incidence of bleeding. Although there have been limited studies in children with obesity, the results to date are similarly conflicting. One study in 30 adolescents with obesity and overweight found that reduced (< 0.9 mg/kg) and recommended (1.0 mg/kg) dosing achieved equivalent concentrations with no adverse outcomes. Conversely, a study of 60 children 2–18 years of age found that the mean enoxaparin dose following routine therapeutic drug monitoring was 26% lower and concentrations were 21% higher in children with obesity, suggesting a reduced dose is more appropriate for children with obesity. The results presented herein support the previous findings from the latter pediatric study.

In adult patients with cancer and symptomatic VTE, the recommended dosing of FRAGMIN is as follows: for the first 30 days of treatment administer FRAGMIN 200 units/kg total body weight subcutaneously once daily. The total daily dose should not exceed 18,000 units. Table 3 lists the dose of FRAGMIN to be administered once daily during the first month for a range of patient weights.

Month 1

Months 2 to 6

Administer FRAGMIN at a dose of approximately 150 units/kg, subcutaneously once daily during Months 2 through 6. The total daily dose should not exceed 18,000 units. Table 4 lists the dose of FRAGMIN to be administered once daily for a range of patient weights during months 2 to 6.

Safety and efficacy beyond six months have not been evaluated in patients with cancer and acute symptomatic VTE [see Warnings and Precaution (5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

2.4	Treatment of Symptomatic Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) in Pediatric Patients

The recommended starting dose according to pediatric age is provided in Table 5.

After initiation of FRAGMIN, measure anti-Xa level prior to the 4thdose. Samples for anti-Xa level should be drawn 4 hours after administration of FRAGMIN. Adjust doses in increments of 25 units/kg to achieve target anti-Xa level between 0.5 units/mL and 1 unit/mL. Individualize the maintenance dose of FRAGMIN based on the dose that achieves target anti-Xa level collected 4 hours after administration of FRAGMIN. Monitor anti-Xa level periodically in pediatric patients to maintain anti-Xa level between 0.5 units/mL and 1 unit/mL [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.5)].

The 3.8 mL multiple-dose vials of FRAGMIN contain 14 mg/mL of benzyl alcohol [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Whenever possible, administer benzyl alcohol-free formulations (prefilled syringes) in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

The 10,000 units/4 mL (2,500 units/mL) single-dose vials are preservative-free. For treatment of neonates, use this vial presentation.

### Use of real-world data and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling to characterize enoxaparin disposition in children with obesity [^114ocpPc]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Baseline comparisons and regression model development

As expected, weight, BMI, BMI percentile, and extended BMI were significantly higher among children with vs. without obesity receiving enoxaparin for either treatment or prophylaxis (Table 1). Race significantly differed between children with and without obesity receiving enoxaparin for treatment, whereas ethnicity significantly differed across groups in children receiving enoxaparin for prophylaxis. Estimated creatinine clearance via the Bedside Schwartz equation was significantly lower in children with obesity receiving enoxaparin for both treatment and prophylaxis.

There was substantial variability in concentration across dose and time in the RWD (Figure 1; Figure S1). Children with obesity had statistically significantly higher absolute doses and anti‐Xa 4‐hour concentrations compared to those without obesity (Table 1). For treatment dosing, this observation was maintained even when dose‐normalizing the concentrations, indicating that the statistically significantly higher concentration is attributable to factors beyond only dosing differences between children with and without obesity.

Figure 1
Box plots of (a, c) observed anti‐Xa concentrations and (b, d) dose‐normalized 4‐hour anti‐Xa concentrations for children with vs. without obesity receiving enoxaparin for (a, b) treatment and (c, d) prophylaxis. Dashed lines represent the target anti‐Xa concentration range for treatment and prophylaxis. The P values for comparing the median concentration in children with vs. without obesity are (a) < 0.001, (b) 0.004, (c) 0.12, and (d) 0.12. Conc, concentration.

The linear mixed‐effects regression model indicated that absolute dose, extended BMI, and the interaction between the two were significantly associated with anti‐Xa 4‐hour concentrations for participants receiving enoxaparin for treatment (Table 2; Figure S2) and prophylaxis (Table S5; Figure S3). The negative interaction term between dose and extended BMI suggested that if we compared one participant with a higher extended BMI and one with a lower extended BMI who both received the same dose, the participant with a higher extended BMI had a lower expected 4‐hour concentration. Age was statistically significant in the model for participants receiving enoxaparin for prophylaxis. Race, ethnicity, and estimated creatinine clearance were not statistically significant in either model.

Use the multiple-dose vial for intravenous injections. Administer Lovenox through an intravenous line. Do not mix or coadminister Lovenox with other medications. Flush the intravenous access device with a sufficient volume of saline or dextrose solution prior to and following the intravenous bolus administration of Lovenox, to prevent mixing of drugs. Lovenox is compatible with normal saline solution (0.9%) or 5% dextrose in water.

2.6	Monitoring for Safety

During therapy monitor complete blood counts including platelets and stool occult blood.

Assess for signs and symptoms of bleeding.

In patients with renal impairment anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of Lovenox.

If during Lovenox therapy abnormal coagulation parameters or bleeding should occur, anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of Lovenox [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) are not adequate for monitoring the anticoagulant effects of Lovenox.

Intravenous UFH dosing strategies and monitoring — five RCTs compared initial IV UFH dosing according to a weight-based nomogram with a fixed-dose approach; in the remaining three RCTs a total of 292 patients were randomized, study follow-up periods ranged from 48 h to 3 months, and the two weight-based and fixed-dose approaches achieved similar therapeutic aPTTs during the first 24 to 48 h. Event data included "vs two (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.02–1.13) in the fixed-dose vs weight-adjusted group and only one major bleed (fixed-dose group)", and "These results suggest that weight-adjusted dosing and fixed dosing of IV UFH are similar in outcomes", though "Small numbers of clinical events and failure to specify the timing of thromboembolic complications are major limitations of available studies". Either regimen can be monitored with plasma heparin levels, but there is no evidence to suggest that monitoring improves clinical outcomes, and "The evidence linking plasma heparin levels of 0.3 to 0.7 International Units/mL anti-Xa activity by the amidolytic assay to the occurrence of either bleeding or thrombosis is also of low quality".

Under these assumptions, the enoxaparin PBPK model captured observed adult data and observed pediatric concentrations, with a bias toward underestimation. However, the majority of this underestimation occurred in samples taken after the last dose, as 74.9% of observed pediatric concentrations that were sampled at ~ 4 hours had an AFE of 0.94, with 79.8% of observed concentrations within the 90% model prediction interval. Adult simulated intravenous clearance (~ 24 mL/minute; Table S7) was similar to the FDA label‐reported adult clearance following an intravenous dose (26 mL/minute). Because enoxaparin's bioavailability in the PBPK model was nearly 100% as reported by adult studies, the simulated subcutaneous adult clearance was ~ 24 mL/minute as well, though this overestimates the FDA label‐reported subcutaneous clearance of 15 mL/minute. No reports of pediatric subcutaneous clearance were identified. The pediatric volume of distribution (median 2.8 L) approximated simulated pediatric participants' plasma volume given age as expected from enoxaparin's binding and mechanism of action. Peak simulated anti‐Xa concentrations were similar to a previous report in children 12–18 years (median 0.77 vs. 0.7 IU/mL) and children ~ 6–18 years (median 0.71 vs. 0.67 IU/mL) with obesity under equivalent dosing.

2.5 Venous Thromboembolism Treatment in Pediatric Patients Aged 1 Year or Older Weighing at Least 10 kg

For patients weighing 10 kg to 20 kg, the recommended initial dose is 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously once daily. There is no available prefilled syringe for patients in this weight range, and a patient specific dose should be prepared (see section 2.8 Instructions for Preparation of Individual Pediatric Doses in Pharmacies). The dose should be exact and rounded to the nearest 0.1 mg (see Table 1).

Table 1: Recommended Initial Dose of Fondaparinux Sodium Injection for Treatment of VTE in Pediatric Patients Weighing 10 kg to 20 kg

For patients weighing over 20 kg, the recommended initial dose is 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously once daily with doses rounded to the nearest prefilled syringe according to Table 2.

There is no available information for dosing pediatric patients who weigh less than 10 kg.

Table 2: Recommended Prefilled Syringe Selection for Initial Dose of Fondaparinux Sodium Injection for Treatment of VTE in Pediatric Patients Weighing More Than 20 kg

*Whenever possible, patients weighing more than 20 kg should receive a full prefilled syringe for dosing. If therapeutic levels are not achievable using the prefilled syringe available strengths and dose adjustments are needed, a patient specific dose may be prepared (see section 2.8 Instructions for Preparation of Individual Pediatric Doses in Pharmacies).

Monitor fondaparinux levels 2 hours to 4 hours after the second or third dose and then weekly for a month followed by every 1 month to 3 months for the duration of treatment using a fondaparinux-based anti-Xa assay with a therapeutic goal range of 0.5 mg/L to 1 mg/L.

Dosing adjustments may be necessary to achieve peak blood concentration within the therapeutic target of 0.5 mg/L to 1 mg/L (see Table 3). Do not exceed the maximum dose of 7.5 mg/day.

*Adjust the dose to the nearest 0.1 mg.

There is no adequate data to support the use of fondaparinux sodium injection in pediatric patients below 1 year of age.

2.6 Hepatic Impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, based upon single-dose pharmacokinetic data. Pharmacokinetic data are not available for patients with severe hepatic impairment. Patients with hepatic impairment may be particularly vulnerable to bleeding during fondaparinux sodium injection therapy. Observe these patients closely for signs and symptoms of bleeding [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].

### Antithrombotic therapy in neonates and children: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^111FYEGL]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy in neonates and children is part of the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs, and Grade 2 suggests that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading, see Guyatt et al in this supplement, pages 123S-131S). In this chapter, many recommendations are based on extrapolation of adult data, and the reader is referred to the appropriate chapters relating to guidelines for adult populations. Within this chapter, the majority of recommendations are separate for neonates and children, reflecting the significant differences in epidemiology of thrombosis and safety and efficacy of therapy in these two populations. Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: In children with first episode of venous thromboembolism (VTE), we recommend anticoagulant therapy with either unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) [Grade 1B]. Dosing of IV UFH should prolong the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) to a range that corresponds to an anti-factor Xa assay (anti-FXa) level of 0.35 to 0.7 U/mL, whereas LMWH should achieve an anti-FXa level of 0.5 to 1.0 U/mL 4 h after an injection for twice-daily dosing. In neonates with first VTE, we suggest either anticoagulation or supportive care with radiologic monitoring and subsequent anticoagulation if extension of the thrombosis occurs during supportive care (Grade 2C). We recommend against the use of routine systemic thromboprophylaxis for children with central venous lines (Grade 1B). For children with cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) without significant intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), we recommend anticoagulation initially with UFH, or LMWH and subsequently with LMWH or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for a minimum of 3 months (Grade 1B). For children with non-sickle-cell disease-related acute arterial ischemic stroke (AIS), we recommend UFH or LMWH or aspirin (1 to 5 mg/kg/d) as initial therapy until dissection and embolic causes have been excluded (Grade 1B). For neonates with a first AIS, in the absence of a documented ongoing cardioembolic source, we recommend against anticoagulation or aspirin therapy (Grade 1B).

### Enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis in children hospitalized for COVID-19: a phase 2 trial [^1122RNtx]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis among pediatric patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited. We sought to evaluate safety, dose-finding, and preliminary efficacy of twice-daily enoxaparin as primary thromboprophylaxis among children hospitalized for symptomatic COVID-19, including primary respiratory infection and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MISC).

Methods

We performed a phase 2, multicenter, prospective, open-label, single-arm clinical trial of twice-daily enoxaparin (initial dose: 0.5mg/kg per dose; max: 60mg; target anti-Xa activity: 0.20–0.49IU/mL) as primary thromboprophylaxis for children < 18 years of age hospitalized for symptomatic COVID-19. Study endpoints included: cumulative incidence of International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis-defined clinically relevant bleeding; enoxaparin dose-requirements; and cumulative incidence of venous thromboembolism within 30-days of hospital discharge. Descriptive statistics summarized endpoint estimates that were further evaluated by participant age (± 12 years) and clinical presentation.

Results

Forty children were enrolled and 38 met analyses criteria. None experienced clinically relevant bleeding. Median (interquartile range) dose to achieve target anti-Xa levels was 0.5 mg/kg (0.48–0.54). Dose-requirement did not differ by age (0.5 [0.46–0.52] mg/kg for age ≥ 12 years versus 0.52 [0.49–0.55] mg/kg for age < 12 years, P = 0.51) but was greater for participants with MISC (0.52 [0.5–0.61] mg/kg) as compared with primary COVID-19 (0.48 [0.39–0.51] mg/kg, P = 0.010). Two children (5.3%) developed central-venous catheter-related venous thromboembolism. No serious adverse events were related to trial intervention.

Conclusions

Among children hospitalized for COVID-19, thromboprophylaxis with twice-daily enoxaparin appears safe and warrants further investigation to assess efficacy.

### Enoxaparin dosing at extremes of weight: literature review and dosing recommendations [^112nStTM]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature on both thromboprophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) with enoxaparin in low- and high-body-weight patients and to make dosing and monitoring recommendations in these patient populations.

Data Sources

A search using PubMed was conducted (1995 to January 2018) using the following key words: enoxaparin, body weight, AND thromboprophylaxis, or AND treatment. Additional references were identified from a review of citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies included examined the effect of body weight and/or body mass index (BMI) on VTE, bleeding, enoxaparin dosing, and/or anti-Xa concentrations for thromboprophylaxis and treatment-dose enoxaparin. Studies in pediatric and pregnant patients were excluded.

Data Synthesis

Optimal enoxaparin dosing strategies for VTE prophylaxis and treatment for patients at extremes of weight have not yet been elucidated by clinical trials; however, data suggest that standard dosing regimens may not be appropriate in these patients. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This review provides a thorough discussion on both thromboprophylaxis and treatment of VTE with enoxaparin in low- and high-body-weight patients. It includes dosing recommendations to guide clinicians caring for these patient populations.

Conclusions

Patients at extremes of weight require special consideration to determine appropriate enoxaparin doses. Specifically, low-body-weight patients may benefit from 30 mg subcutaneously daily for VTE prophylaxis, and standard weight-based dosing for VTE treatment. Conversely, in patients with BMIs ≥ 40 kg/m², 40 mg subcutaneously twice daily is recommended, with consideration for higher doses in patients with BMIs ≥ 50 kg/m².

Low-molecular-weight heparin vs vitamin K antagonists — maintenance therapy for pediatric symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE): Recommendation 13 states the panel "suggests using either low-molecular-weight heparin or vitamin K antagonists in pediatric patients with symptomatic DVT or PE (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯)", and the decision "should depend on patient values and preferences, health services resources, infrastructure and support, and underlying condition, comorbidities, and other medications". Evidence included "1 RCT… and 18 observational studies with < 1000 total patients involved", and "Adult data were not considered". For mortality, PE, severe VTE, or recurrent VTE, the RCT had "wide CIs that did not exclude thresholds for plausible benefit or harm", and "Risk estimates cannot be calculated from the observational data because of the lack of direct comparisons"; for major bleeding, the RCT also had "wide CIs that did not exclude thresholds for plausible benefit or harm", with "overall" certainty "very low". The panel noted that choice "should depend on patient values and preferences, health services resources", that "the burden of care was an important consideration… (regular subcutaneous injections vs frequent blood tests)… and there were insufficient data on this important outcome", and that infrastructure support is required with costs likely varying across systems.

A second PK study compared 120 children with VTE who received either once or twice daily treatment after 10 to 14 days of twice daily treatment. In this study the 2- to 4-hour peak anti-FXa target range was 0.5 to 0.8 IU/mL and the 24-hour trough anti-FXa target was > 0.1 IU/mL. Patients aged > 1 year received 1 mg/kg once daily, and those aged < 1 year received 1.5 mg/kg once daily. There were no differences in recurrent VTE or bleeding in the groups. There was significant interpatient variability in PK parameters and among patients treated once daily, only 53% had adequate trough levels.

A retrospective study comparing 39 children who received once daily enoxaparin "maintenance therapy", started after > 2 weeks of twice daily therapy, with 32 children who continued to receive twice daily dosing, did not identify differences in outcomes between these 2 groups, although patients with less extensive thrombus were more likely to receive once daily therapy. Patients treated once daily started at 1.5 mg/kg to target a peak therapeutic anti-FXa of 0.7 to 1.2 IU/mL.

IV ENOXAPARIN. IV enoxaparin has been used in a small number of pediatric studies, including patients who are critically ill and those with significant soft tissue edema or burns. When administered as an infusion over 30 minutes, peak anti-FXa levels were similar to those reported with SQ administration. The clearance of the drug has not been carefully studied with IV administration.

LMWH DOSING CONSIDERATIONS IN OBESITY. Increasing data support concerns that patients who are overweight/obese and are receiving enoxaparin are more likely to have supratherapeutic anti-FXa values. In a review that included 94 pediatric patients from 6 studies, the mean final enoxaparin dose had been reduced from 1 mg/kg twice daily to 0.84 mg/kg twice daily, and population models developed using fat-free mass have been proposed. These studies highlight the importance of more closely monitoring for drug accumulation in this subgroup of patients. There is a lack of data to advise dosing of other LMWHs in children who are overweight/obese.

### Dosing and monitoring of enoxaparin (low molecular weight heparin) therapy in children [^114eUXVx]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are commonly used in paediatric tertiary institutions for primary prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic events. Despite this widespread use, the therapeutic and prophylactic guidelines for LMWH therapy in children are extrapolated from adult guidelines. In fact, there is very little information regarding the pharmacokinetics, clinical effectiveness, adverse event profile and optimal dose schedule for LMWH therapy in children. This study was designed to determine whether paediatric-specific dosage requirements for LMWH are justified, by investigating the doses required to achieve target therapeutic ranges. Patients who were treated with enoxaparin between October 2003 and July 2007 were identified for inclusion in this study. One hundred forty patients had an anti-activated factor X assay result with a total of 55 (39%) patients achieving therapeutic levels 4–6 h post dose. Children younger than 1 year required the highest dose of enoxaparin/kg and highest number of dose changes to achieve the target therapeutic range. Major bleeding occurred in one patient, equating to 0.7%, with complete clot resolution recorded in 16 (11%) patients. This study demonstrated a 2–3-fold variation in individual dose requirements for LMWH in children ≤ 5 years of age, and further mandates the need for age-specific dosage requirements in children receiving enoxaparin.

Fondaparinux — pediatric dosing, targets, and bleeding management specify extrapolated therapeutic peaks and practical considerations. A starting dose of 0.1 mg/kg once daily is recommended in children aged 1 to 17 years, with adjustment to achieve peak concentrations of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L after 4 hours; 88% achieved target concentration without dose adjustment. The adult therapeutic target peak concentration of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L has been extrapolated to children. The anticoagulant effect may persist for 2 to 4 days with normal renal function, and there is no antidote; bleeding is managed per protocols for irreversible anticoagulants.

### Inadequate prophylaxis in patients with trauma: anti-Xa-guided enoxaparin dosing management in critically ill patients with trauma [^111CGwXq]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes the diagnoses deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), affects up to 6 00 000 patients and kills over 100 000 each year. By itself, traumatic injury is a known risk factor for development of VTE, especially in patients with traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries and severe pelvic fractures. Yet, patients with trauma often have multiple additional risk factors for VTE, including admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), prolonged immobilization, mechanical ventilation, major and/or multiple surgeries, extended periods of sedation, central venous catheters and multiple transfusions. Given the numerous risk factors, high rates of VTE are observed in patients with trauma, with DVT estimated to occur in 5%–63% of patients with trauma and PE in approximately 11%. Given the high incidence of VTE in the trauma population, starting VTE prophylaxis early and with the appropriate agent and dosing is critical when taking care of these patients.

Enoxaparin has been the VTE prophylaxis of choice for patients with trauma since the mid-1990s after Geerts et al observed improved VTE rates with enoxaparin administration in the first randomized control trial of unfractionated heparin versus low–molecular weight heparin. Since then, multiple studies, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses, have confirmed these findings in the general trauma population as well as in the geriatric and pediatric trauma populations. Underscoring this data, enoxaparin is the recommended agent for VTE prophylaxis in patients with trauma by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma/American College of Surgeons, Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma and the Western Trauma Association. However, VTE can still occur despite early initiation and compliant enoxaparin administration. In an effort to ensure patients are receiving an appropriate enoxaparin dose, anti-Xa level monitoring with subsequent enoxaparin dose titration has been introduced into the clinical practices of many trauma centers. Early results from several anti-Xa monitoring studies in trauma populations have shown improvement in achieving 'target' anti-Xa levels with one study showing an improvement in VTE rates as well.

### Clinical use of unfractionated heparin therapy in children: time for change? [^11784q3p]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Paediatric recommendations for unfractionated heparin (UFH) management are extrapolated from adult trials, a practice that may contribute to the inferior UFH-related outcomes in children compared to adults. This is the first study to determine UFH concentration in a population of children and correlated UFH concentration with measures of UFH effect. Correlation coefficients between protamine titration (concentration) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), anti- activated factor X (Xa) assay and thrombin clotting time (effect) were 0·59, 0·46 and 0·52 respectively. A protamine titration level of 0·2–0·4 iu/ml in children was not equivalent to an anti-Xa assay of 0·35–0·7 iu/ml but to an anti-Xa assay 0·17–0·85 iu/ml. In addition, use of the anti-Xa or protamine titration assays to establish an APTT therapeutic range resulted in upper limits of APTT ranges exceeding 200 s. Existing methods for determining therapeutic ranges for UFH in adult populations do not produce equivalent ranges in children. As a result, paediatric clinical guidelines that state a therapeutic range for UFH can be determined using a protamine titration assay of 0·2–0·4 iu/ml or an anti-Xa assay of 0·35–0·7 iu/ml are not based on appropriate evidence. There is an urgent need for change in our approach to the use of UFH in children.

### Antithrombotic therapy in neonates and children: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115YKwwo]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Neonates and children differ from adults in physiology, pharmacologic responses to drugs, epidemiology, and long-term consequences of thrombosis. This guideline addresses optimal strategies for the management of thrombosis in neonates and children.

Methods

The methods of this guideline follow those described in the Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines.

Results

We suggest that where possible, pediatric hematologists with experience in thromboembolism manage pediatric patients with thromboembolism (Grade 2C). When this is not possible, we suggest a combination of a neonatologist/pediatrician and adult hematologist supported by consultation with an experienced pediatric hematologist (Grade 2C). We suggest that therapeutic unfractionated heparin in children is titrated to achieve a target anti-Xa range of 0.35 to 0.7 units/mL or an activated partial thromboplastin time range that correlates to this anti-Xa range or to a protamine titration range of 0.2 to 0.4 units/mL (Grade 2C). For neonates and children receiving either daily or bid therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparin, we suggest that the drug be monitored to a target range of 0.5 to 1.0 units/mL in a sample taken 4 to 6 h after subcutaneous injection or, alternatively, 0.5 to 0.8 units/mL in a sample taken 2 to 6 h after subcutaneous injection (Grade 2C).

Conclusions

The evidence supporting most recommendations for antithrombotic therapy in neonates and children remains weak. Studies addressing appropriate drug target ranges and monitoring requirements are urgently required in addition to site- and clinical situation-specific thrombosis management strategies.

In a review that included 94 pediatric patients from 6 studies, the mean final enoxaparin dose had been reduced from 1 mg/kg twice daily to 0.84 mg/kg twice daily, and population models developed using fat-free mass have been proposed; these studies highlight the importance of more closely monitoring for drug accumulation in this subgroup of patients, and there is a lack of data to advise dosing of other LMWHs in children who are overweight/obese.

Recommendation 17

For pediatric patients with VTE, the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests using DOACs (rivaroxaban/dabigatran) over SOC anticoagulants (low molecular weight heparin [LMWH], unfractionated heparin [UFH], vitamin K antagonists [VKAs], and fondaparinux; conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁◯◯◯).

Remarks: The panel concluded that there was a small benefit of DOACs over SOC, in relation to reduced thrombus recurrence rate and increased rate of thrombus resolution. The undesirable effects of DOACs vs SOC were felt to be small, with a reduction in major bleeding albeit with an increase in clinically relevant non major bleeding (CRNMB). The panel acknowledged the limitations of these data when evaluating the outcomes of mortality, recurrence, postthrombotic syndrome (PTS), and major/CRNMB due to the small number of events reported. Given the natural history of PTS and thrombus recurrence, evaluation at 3 to 6 months was considered to be too soon to provide accurate representation of these outcomes. The monitoring of drug level and dose adjustment of dabigatran during the DIVERSITY trial raised concern about the potential effect on efficacy and safety of routine use according to current approvals, which do not require such monitoring. Although data on QOL, cost-effectiveness, and acceptability of an oral agent that does not require monitoring were lacking, the panel felt that these were important factors when making this recommendation.

Recommendation 18

For pediatric patients with VTE the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests using rivaroxaban over SOC anticoagulants (LMWH, UFH, VKA, and fondaparinux; conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁◯◯◯).

Remarks: The panel concluded that there was a small benefit of rivaroxaban over SOC, in relation to reduced thrombus recurrence and improved thrombus resolution. The undesirable effects of rivaroxaban vs SOC were felt to be small, with a reduction in major bleeding countered by an increase in CRNMB. These data were limited by the small number of important outcomes that were reported, that is mortality, recurrence, PTS, and major bleeding/CRNMB. The panel noted that some individuals were excluded from the EINSTEIN-Junior trial, including those aged < 6 months with low birth weight and those with severe liver or renal impairment. The panel also noted reports of heavier menstrual bleeding while on rivaroxaban and felt that this was an important consideration when choosing an anticoagulant.

### Use of real-world data and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling to characterize enoxaparin disposition in children with obesity [^114coSSK]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑ Current clinical studies of enoxaparin pharmacokinetics and dosing in children with vs. without obesity are unclear as to whether dosing adjustments are needed for these children.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑ This study used a real‐world data set of electronic health record data to develop a physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic model that mechanistically evaluated the pharmacokinetics and dosing requirements in children with vs. without obesity.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

☑ This analysis of real‐world data suggests that obesity status significantly impacts anti‐Xa concentrations. Physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic model simulations show that children with obesity have higher concentrations under recommended dosing compared with children without obesity, and suggest that age and obesity status should be considered in enoxaparin dose selection for children.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

☑ This study sheds light on the dosing of enoxaparin, a drug that is commonly prescribed in children with obesity. This physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic modeling approach using real‐world data can be applied to other drugs dosed in children with obesity.

### Lack of anti-factor Xa assay standardization results in significant low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) dose variation in neonates and children [^116kPnci]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Enoxaparin is a frequently used anticoagulant in children. Unlike in adults, consensus guidelines recommend therapeutic monitoring to a target anti-factor Xa level of 0.5–1 U mL(-1). Therapeutic ranges are not well correlated with clinical outcomes (e.g. thrombosis or hemorrhage), and assays are not standardized. Owing to limited reagent supplies, our clinical laboratory conducted a validation process and switched anti-FXa assays. Although the assays correlated well with each other, anti-FXa values were, on average, 33% higher with the new assay. The target anti-FXa range was not altered. We evaluated how this change in anti-FXa assays influenced enoxaparin dosing (mg kg(-1)).

Methods

Enoxaparin dosing and anti-FXa values for all patients started on enoxaparin for the 6 months before and after assay change were retrospectively compiled and analyzed with a Student's t-test.

Results

One hundred and nine children were started on enoxaparin before assay change, and 104 after assay change. The mean therapeutic enoxaparin dose (mg kg(-1)) was significantly lower in subjects aged < 3 months (P = 0.01) and 3 months to 2 years (P < 0.0001), but not in subjects aged > 2 years (P = 0.18), after assay change. The median number of enoxaparin dose changes required to achieve the target range was significantly reduced after assay change, from 1 to 0 (P = 0.004).

Conclusions

The current pediatric practice of dose adjustment to achieve and maintain a target anti-FXa range is vulnerable to assay determination, which may provide false reassurance of efficacy and safety and represent misappropriation of time and resources. These data support a pediatric randomized controlled clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of enoxaparin weight-based dosing with or without dose titration based on anti-FXa.

### Population pharmacokinetics of enoxaparin in pediatric patients [^111A8Piz]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

There are no studies evaluating the pharmacokinetics of enoxaparin in the hospitalized pediatric patient population.

Objective

To characterize the pharmacokinetics of enoxaparin in pediatric patients.

Methods

A retrospective review of inpatients 1 to 18 years of age admitted to our institution who received enoxaparin with anti-factor Xa activity level monitoring was performed. Demographic variables, enoxaparin dosing, and anti-factor Xa activity levels were collected. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with bootstrap analysis. Simulation (n = 10 000) was performed to determine the percentage who achieved targeted anti-Xa levels at various doses.

Results

A total of 853 patients (male 52.1%, median age = 12.2 years; interquartile range [IQR] = 4.6–15.8 years) received a mean enoxaparin dose of 0.86 ± 0.31 mg/kg/dose. A median of 3 (IQR = 1–5) anti-factor Xa levels were sampled at 4.4 ± 1.3 hours after a dose, with a mean anti-factor Xa level of 0.52 ± 0.23 U/mL. A 1-compartment model best fit the data, and significant covariates included allometrically scaled weight, serum creatinine, and hematocrit on clearance, and platelets on volume of distribution. Simulations were run for patients both without and with reduced kidney function (creatinine clearance of ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m²). A dose of 1 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours had the highest probability (72.3%) of achieving an anti-Xa level within the target range (0.5–1 U/mL), whereas a dose reduction of ~30% achieved the same result in patients with reduced kidney function.

Conclusions

Pediatric patients should initially be dosed at 1-mg/kg/dose subcutaneously every 12 hours for treatment of thromboembolism followed by anti-Xa activity monitoring. Dose reductions of ~30% for creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 are required.

Unlike GFR, maturation of antithrombin and heparinase was not considered during scaling, as the literature suggests that antithrombin concentrations approach adult values in the first few months following birth, and ontogeny information for heparinase was not available.PK‐Sim pediatric virtual populations with and without obesity include relevant physiological parameters, including changes from adults in body weight, height, organ volumes, blood flows, and tissue composition. Virtual populations including children with obesity had increased overall body weight as determined by updated BMI‐for‐age growth curves and increased lean body weight, organ volume, blood flow, and corresponding effects on clearance processes as previously described.

PBPK model evaluation

For each reported adult study, virtual populations of 500 virtual participants were generated based on patient demographics from the respective study to evaluate the adult model. The number of observed concentrations falling within the 90% model prediction interval was calculated, as well as the average fold error (AFE) of the median simulated concentration for all observations using Eq. 5 :where n is the total number of samples for a particular participant (or digitized study). Because of the heterogeneous nature of EHR data, including wide variability in dose amount, frequency, and route as well as sampling time, virtual "individualized" populations were used for pediatric model simulations to predict the pediatric RWD concentrations. These virtual "individualized" populations included 500 virtual participants with demographics matched to each particular observed participant's demographics and dosing regimen. A separate virtual "individualized" population was used for each observed child in the RWD.

Regarding medical management for venous thromboembolism in children, more specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy, choice of agent, ACCP 2012 guidelines recommend to consider monitoring LMWH in neonates and pediatric patients receiving either once- or twice-daily therapeutic doses to a target anti-Xa activity range of 0.5–1.0 units/mL in a sample taken 4–6 hours after subcutaneous injection or 0.5–0.8 units/mL in a sample taken 2–6 hours after subcutaneous injection.

Once-a-day enoxaparin in children — pharmacokinetic and clinical findings include that enoxaparin is approved for treatment of adult VTE at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg SQ once daily. A prospective PK and pharmacodynamic study of once daily enoxaparin in 16 children aged > 3 months who had received > 48 hours of twice daily dosing then transitioned to 1.5 mg/kg once daily measured steady state anti-FXa 4 hours after the second dose with a therapeutic anti-FXa range of 1.0 to 2.0 IU/mL; the conclusion was that once daily enoxaparin was probably not feasible in children. A second PK study compared 12 children with once or twice daily treatment and used a 2- to 4-hour peak anti-FXa target range of 0.5 to 0.8 IU/mL and a 24-hour trough target > 0.1 IU/mL; patients aged > 1 year received 1 mg/kg once daily and those aged < 1 year received 1.5 mg/kg once daily, with no differences in recurrent VTE or bleeding and among patients treated once daily only 53% had adequate trough levels. A retrospective study reported patients treated once daily started at 1.5 mg/kg to target a peak therapeutic anti-FXa of 0.7 to 1.2 IU/mL.

### Use of real-world data and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling to characterize enoxaparin disposition in children with obesity [^115Zbtk6]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Dosing guidance for children with obesity is often unknown despite the fact that nearly 20% of US children are classified as obese. Enoxaparin, a commonly prescribed low-molecular-weight heparin, is dosed based on body weight irrespective of obesity status to achieve maximum concentration within a narrow therapeutic or prophylactic target range. However, whether children with and without obesity experience equivalent enoxaparin exposure remains unclear. To address this clinical question, 2,825 anti-activated factor X (anti-Xa) surrogate concentrations were collected from the electronic health records of 596 children, including those with obesity. Using linear mixed-effects regression models, we observed that 4-hour anti-Xa concentrations were statistically significantly different in children with and without obesity, even for children with the same absolute dose (P = 0.004). To further mechanistically explore obesity-associated differences in anti-Xa concentration, a pediatric physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed in adults, and then scaled to children with and without obesity. This PBPK model incorporated binding of enoxaparin to antithrombin to form anti-Xa and elimination via heparinase-mediated metabolism and glomerular filtration. Following scaling, the PBPK model predicted real-world pediatric concentrations well, with an average fold error (standard deviation of the fold error) of 0.82 (0.23) and 0.87 (0.26) in children with and without obesity, respectively. PBPK model simulations revealed that children with obesity have at most 20% higher 4-hour anti-Xa concentrations under recommended, total body weight-based dosing compared to children without obesity owing to reduced weight-normalized clearance. Enoxaparin exposure was better matched across age groups and obesity status using fat-free mass weight-based dosing.

Although higher dosing strategies have not been prospectively validated, existing studies suggest that if an anti-FXa range of 0.5 to 1.0 IU/mL is the target, higher starting doses in younger patients will achieve this target more rapidly than current recommendations. Many centers have developed modified dosing strategies based on analysis of their own patient data, which has the benefit of center-specific anti-FXa assays, and, when possible, this approach is recommended. Although it remains uncertain whether higher dosing strategies will influence clinical outcomes, a reduction in dose adjustments and venipuncture has merit, and retrospective studies have not reported higher bleeding rates with higher starting doses. Therefore, we have included a higher enoxaparin starting dose strategy for children aged < 5 years in Table 7. This strategy is informed by ∼25 studies and > 3000 children. Prospective evaluation of this strategy is strongly encouraged. This range may also allow for more individualized dosing based on unique patient risks for bleeding or thrombotic complications.

ONCE-A-DAY ENOXAPARIN. Enoxaparin is approved for treatment of adult VTE at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg SQ once daily. Several studies have investigated once daily administration in children with variable results and conclusions, in part because they used different anti-FXa target ranges.

A prospective PK and pharmacodynamic study investigated the use of once daily enoxaparin in 16 children aged > 3 months with VTE who received > 48 hours of twice daily enoxaparin dosing and then transitioned to 1.5 mg/kg once daily. Peak anti-FXa was measured 4 hours after the second dose, with a therapeutic anti-FXa range of 1.0 to 2.0 IU/mL. The study found significant variation in the dose required to achieve this target range and low anti-FXa trough values, resulting in lower total drug exposure in children compared with adults. The conclusion from this small study was that once daily enoxaparin was probably not feasible in children.

Therapeutic range

A therapeutic range for heparin was derived from experimental animal studies in which the whole-blood clotting time was used. A prospective study using aPTT for monitoring heparin therapy in adult patients with VTE showed that the risk of recurrent VTE was associated with failure to obtain an aPTT ratio of ∼1.5 times the control value and that a heparin concentration of 0.2 to 0.4 IU/mL by protamine titration correlated with this aPTT range. This aPTT ratio became the standard for the lower limit of the therapeutic range in adults.

A therapeutic range for UFH in children is largely extrapolated from adult studies and recommend targeting an aPTT range that reﬂects a heparin level by protamine titration of 0.2 to 0.4 IU/mL or an anti–factor Xa (anti-FXa) level of 0.35 to 0.7 IU/mL, but this has yet to be confirmed by RCTs. The measured response to the aPTT and the anti-FXa varies between reagents and instruments used to measure these tests. Additionally, there are multiple variations to the anti-FXa assay that change the response to UFH, and there are no data to confirm which test variation is clinically optimal. Therefore, clinicians must understand the specifics/pitfalls of the tests run in their laboratories.

The evidence for adjusting the dose of heparin to maintain a therapeutic range is weak and is based on a post hoc subgroup analysis of a descriptive study. There is a paucity of data on the performance of the aPTT or anti-FXa for UFH monitoring in children, and a therapeutic UFH dose targeting an aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds and anti-FXa activity of 0.35 to 0.7 IU/mL is most commonly used.

### Use of enoxaparin in a preterm infant [^1177GGue]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the use of enoxaparin to treat suspected thrombosis in a preterm neonate.

Case Description

A 29-week-gestation white infant with a family history of protein S deficiency lost color and blood flow to the right hand several hours after removal of the umbilical artery catheter. Although normal color returned to all except the distal first, second, and third fingers after warming, Doppler flow showed a radial artery defect, indicating a lack of blood flow. Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg intravenously every eight hours was then started. Heparin concentrations measured via anti-Xa assay drawn four and eight hours after a dose were 0.78 and 0.39 units/mL, respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameters calculated from these concentrations using a one-compartment model were elimination half-life four hours, volume of distribution 0.13 L/kg, and clearance 0.022 L/kg/h. No adverse effects were noted. Blood flow eventually returned, leaving only the third fingertip chronically injured.

Discussion

Differences between the neonatal and adult hemostatic systems contribute to an increased risk of thromboembolic events and an altered sensitivity to heparin anticoagulation in the neonate. Although heparin is currently the anticoagulant of choice, it may produce several adverse effects, such as hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia, which may be avoided by use of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs). However, despite the efficacy and improved safety profile of LMWHs in adults, data regarding their use in children and neonates are scarce. This case demonstrates that enoxaparin can be used safely and effectively in a preterm infant through appropriate monitoring of heparin concentrations to adjust dosages. A larger volume of distribution of enoxaparin was noted in this neonate than in adults.

Conclusions

Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg intravenously every eight hours was used safely in this preterm infant with suspected thrombosis, suggesting that more than one dosing regimen may be appropriate in this population.

### Aspects of anticoagulation in children [^1163VHmH]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

The number of children receiving anticoagulation is increasing. Thromboembolic events are associated with significant risk of morbidity and mortality although the optimal management of asymptomatic events remains unclear. Specific challenges in paediatrics include the diagnosis of thrombosis, delivery and monitoring of anticoagulation in a wide range of ages from neonates through to adolescents. The development of the haemostatic system as children age results in changing pathophysiology of thrombosis and response to anticoagulation agents. Although registry and observational studies have provided vital information, specific paediatric, prospective anticoagulation studies have been few and limited in design. The result is that much of current practice is extrapolated from adult studies. Traditional anticoagulants have significant limitations. Both heparin and warfarin are in widespread use but many fundamental questions regarding dose, therapeutic range, efficacy and optimum duration have not been fully answered. Alternative agents, such as direct thrombin inhibitors and the selective anti-factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux, may have advantages for children. Clinical trials in adults and preliminary data in children are promising but caution should be applied until specific paediatric studies have demonstrated safety and efficacy.

Enoxaparin pediatric dosing — age-based regimens and practical considerations include that existing age-related dosing recommendations and dose adjustments for enoxaparin (< 2 months of age: 1.5 mg/kg SQ injection 2 times a day; > 2 months of age: 1 mg/kg SQ every 12 hours) are based on a small prospective dose-finding study of 23 children. Prefilled syringes of LMWH use the closest dose within reason [10%-15%] and administration from multidose vials may be preferred in smaller children; a large retrospective population PK study in > 800 children aged > 1 year predicted that using 1 mg/kg, 2 times a day, had the highest probability of achieving the therapeutic anti-FXa level, and although higher dosing strategies have not been prospectively validated, if an anti-FXa range of 0.5 to 1.0 IU/mL is the target, higher starting doses in younger patients will achieve this target more rapidly than current recommendations; prospective evaluation of this strategy is strongly encouraged.

Dosing

Current recommended dosing of LMWHs is shown in Table 7. These are predominantly age dependent.,

Table 7.
Recommended starting dose for LMWHs and fondaparinux

A typical nomogram for adjusting LMWH dose according to anti-FXa level is provided in Table 8. The first anti-FXa level is usually checked 4 hours (range, 3.5–6) after the second or third dose of LMWH and adjusted if not in the therapeutic range. Because of the difficulty of administering submilligram dosing of enoxaparin, rounding up to the nearest whole milligram is recommended. This recommendation applies also to the other LMWHs, which are dosed in units. A pragmatic approach also applies to the use of prefilled syringes of LMWH (using the closest dose within reason [10%-15%], rather than exact weight-based dose). Administration from multidose vials may be preferred in smaller children because it allows the use of a smaller bore needle than the standard for the prefilled syringes.

CONCLUSIONS

Data to guide frequency of monitoring and use of specific anticoagulation assay(s) during anticoagulation with UFH or DTIs in pediatric ECMO are scarce and, at times, contradictory. We suggest that an appropriate panel of assays combined with interpretation by experts in anticoagulation, ECMO, and pediatric intensive care medicine, may result in superior bleeding and clotting outcomes; however, research in this area is desperately needed. It is crucial for clinicians caring for ECMO patients to have a thorough understanding of the anticoagulation monitoring assays used in their institutions to effectively interpret assay results.

Table 5 — comparison of anticoagulants/thrombolytics for pediatric venous thromboembolism — highlights key advantages, disadvantages, and quality-of-life notes for commonly used agents. For UFH, advantages include "Short half-life" and "Available reversal agent (protamine)" with "No drug or food interactions", while disadvantages include "Difficult to titrate in younger patients" and "Poor correlation between dose and aPTT or anti-FXa levels", and its "Impact on QOL No studies". For low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), advantages include "More predictable dosing (vs UFH and VKAs)", with disadvantages such as "Unpredictable dose-effect response as measured by anti-FXa levels" and "SQ administration", and quality-of-life noting "SQ injections are traumatic". For vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), "Oral administration (only after therapeutic anticoagulation with parenteral agent)" is balanced by "Due to long and variable half-life, achieving target therapeutic range can take 5–7 d", while "At home point-of-care monitoring improves QOL". For rivaroxaban, "Oral administration (only after ≥ 5 d of parenteral anticoagulation)" is noted, with the precaution "Should not be used in children with mechanical valves and APS".

### Evaluating residual anti-Xa levels following discontinuation of treatment-dose enoxaparin in patients presenting for elective surgery: a prospective observational trial [^116RtQ1i]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prior studies have demonstrated that patients presenting for elective surgery may have higher-than-expected residual anti-Xa level activity at or beyond 24 hours following their last treatment dose of enoxaparin. Given that 24 hours of abstinence is currently recommended by both European and American societies before the performance of neuraxial or deep anesthetic/analgesic procedures, determining the actual timeframe at which residual anti-Xa level activity reliably falls below 0.2IU/mL, the lower limit of the target range for thromboprophylaxis, is critical.

Methods

This was a prospective observational trial. Consenting patients on treatment-dose enoxaparin were randomized to either a 24-hour group (last dose at 07:00 the day prior to surgery) or a 36-hour group (last dose at 19:00 2days prior to surgery). On arrival for surgery, blood samples were obtained to assess residual anti-Xa level activity and renal function. The primary outcome was residual anti-Xa level activity following the last treatment dose of enoxaparin. Incorporating all patients, linear regression modeling was performed to predict the timepoint at which the level of anti-Xa activity reliably fell below 0.2IU/mL.

Results

103 patients were analyzed. Time from the last dose at which residual anti-Xa activity fell below 0.2IU/mL, based on the upper bound of the 95% CI, was 31.5hours. No correlation overall between age, renal function, or sex was found.

Conclusion

Residual levels of anti-Xa activity do not reliably fall below 0.2IU/mL 24 hours following discontinuation of treatment-dose enoxaparin. Therefore, current time-based guidelines are not conservative enough. Routine anti-Xa testing should be strongly considered, or current time-based guidelines should be reassessed.

### IV enoxaparin in pediatric and cardiac ICU patients [^112e4Sin]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To report our experience with the use of IV enoxaparin in neonatal and pediatric patients in the ICU.

Design

We performed a case control from January 1, 2009, to June 30, 2012, comparing patients that received IV enoxaparin to controls that received subcutaneous enoxaparin. Cases were matched to controls in a 1:2 manner. IV enoxaparin doses were infused over 30 minutes and anti-Factor Xa levels were drawn 4 hours after the start of the IV infusion or 4 hours after a subcutaneous dose.

Setting

The pediatric and cardiac ICUs of a tertiary/quaternary, free-standing, academic children's hospital.

Patients

Forty-five neonatal and pediatric patients receiving prophylactic or therapeutic enoxaparin.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Fifteen cases and 30 controls were included. Of 15 patients, 13 received IV enoxaparin for treatment and two received IV enoxaparin for prophylaxis as compared with 25 of 30 controls receiving subcutaneous enoxaparin for treatment and five receiving subcutaneous enoxaparin for prophylaxis. The ages for the cases ranged from 21 days to 16 years with a median weight of 5 kg, and the ages for controls ranged from 10 days to 23 years with a median weight of 31 kg. The median duration of IV therapy was 11 days (range, 1–120 d) and the median duration for subcutaneous therapy was 15 days (range, 3–85 d). The mean initial IV dose was 1.14 ± 0.38 mg/kg/dose q12h, and the mean initial subcutaneous dose was 0.85 ± 0.2 mg/kg/dose subcutaneous q12h (p = 0.003). The mean therapeutic IV dose was 1.31 ± 0.52 mg/kg/dose q12h, and the mean therapeutic subcutaneous dose was 0.9 ± 0.3 mg/kg/dose q12h (p = 0.016). There were no adverse events reported related to bleeding, thrombosis, or hypersensitivity in any of the cases or controls evaluated.

Conclusion

The pharmacodynamics of a 30-minute IV enoxaparin infusion was found to produce therapeutic 4 hour anti-Factor Xa levels similar to subcutaneous doses. Although this was a small study, there were no adverse events, suggesting the safety profile of IV enoxaparin may be similar to subcutaneous dosing with the added benefit of less pain associated with IV dosing. These findings suggest that IV enoxaparin may be a viable option for anticoagulating critically ill children and its use warrants further study.

### Enoxaparin, effective dosage for intensive care patients: double-blinded, randomised clinical trial [^115q9xFP]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Periodic monitoring of aFXa levels is recommended in special populations (for example, in pregnant patients, children, patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), or in those at extremes of body weight. The aFXa activity 3 hours after enoxaparin had a negative correlation with BMI, owing to reduced blood flow in fat tissues, resulting in decreased drug absorption, and thus obese patients were not included. Standard therapeutic-dose enoxaparin in patients with severe AKI led to accumulation, resulting in higher aFXa levels and a concurrent increased risk of bleeding complications. Many advocate avoiding the use of LMWHs or using a lower dose of these agents combined with careful monitoring of drug levels and anticoagulant effects. From the median creatinine clearance in Table 1, it is easily inferred that study patients had renal functions that ranged from being normal to only moderately impaired. This was done to prevent AKI from influencing the anticoagulant effect of the different enoxaparin doses.

One clear limitation of our study was that it was not designed to detect VTE. The patients had a drug exposure of only 24 hours and were not screened for VTE by using Doppler ultrasound. In addition, the nurses found it somewhat difficult to titrate such small doses of enoxaparin, and this may have resulted in the variability in anti-factor Xa levels seen within the same dose group. Despite this, the present study is both timely and relevant to issues facing intensive care physicians. The inclusion of 72 patients is quite good for a project of this nature, and the study was powered to 80%. In addition, our study generates the hypothesis of inadequate dosage being one of the possible mechanisms for the higher failure rate of enoxaparin in ICU patients.

Our findings cannot be extrapolated to mean that ICU patients receiving 60 mg are better protected than are those receiving a standard dose of 40 mg, as aFXa activity is only a surrogate parameter.

Most studies suggest that although aFXa activity cannot be directly related to clinical outcome, lower concentrations seem to result in less-effective prevention of VTE. One study has even demonstrated a statistically significant relation between aFXa levels and wound hematoma and thrombosis, with regression analysis suggesting that aFXa levels are predictive of outcome. It remains to be established whether these results obtained with enoxaparin can be generalized to other LMWHs.

### Use of real-world data and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling to characterize enoxaparin disposition in children with obesity [^115txud4]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with obesity may be at greater risk of supratherapeutic anti‐Xa exposure and, therefore, additional bleeding risk, due to weight‐based dosing coupled with obesity‐induced physiological changes that can impact enoxaparin's PK. Recommended enoxaparin dosing from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) is weight‐based (i.e. 1.0 mg/kg twice‐daily for treatment and 0.5 mg/kg twice‐daily for prophylaxis) for both children and adults. This means that patients with obesity receive higher absolute doses (i.e. in milligrams) than their counterparts without obesity, which could place patients with obesity at greater risk of major bleeding events. Enoxaparin exhibits significant renal elimination (with ~ 40% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine in adults), and renal clearance is often altered with obesity due to increases in kidney size and function with obesity. This increase in clearance does not increase proportionally with overall increases in total body size and absolute dose, leading to potentially higher anti‐Xa exposure. Additionally, enoxaparin's volume of distribution is approximately equal to 4 L in adults, indicating that its distribution is restricted to the vasculature. Consequently, higher absolute doses in patients with obesity may sequester in the blood and lead to elevated concentrations.

Enoxaparin PK studies in children with and without obesity are limited, most likely due to many ethical and logistical challenges to studying children with obesity. A stigma of obesity can further lower pediatric enrollment rates, making it challenging to include the full age and body size range of children required to characterize drug disposition. Additionally, indirect measurement of enoxaparin concentration in plasma via anti‐Xa imposes further challenges to characterizing changes to its PK with obesity. Also, many prior studies of enoxaparin rely only on concentrations taken 4 hours post dosing instead of full concentration‐vs.‐time profiles, more typical of PK studies. As a result, the objective of this study was to use real‐world data (RWD) from a multicenter electronic health record (EHR)–derived data repository developed by the Pediatric Trials Network (PTN) to evaluate differences in enoxaparin drug dosing and disposition in children with obesity using linear mixed‐effects regression models and physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling.

### Anti-Xa levels in critically ill children receiving enoxaparin for venothromboembolism prophylaxis [^1139RPs2]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Venothrombolism (VTE) prophylaxis is increasingly utilized in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Enoxaparin, a low-molecular weight heparin, is frequently used for this purpose. Enoxaparin can also be used for therapeutic anticoagulation in cases of known thrombus. In such cases, monitoring involves obtaining serum anti- Xa levels with a target value of 0.5–1 units/mL. No monitoring recommendations currently exist for enoxaparin when intended for pediatric VTE prophylaxis. We hypothesize that a clinically important number of patients on VTE prophylaxis with enoxaparin have serum anti-Xa levels consistent with values targeted for therapeutic anticoagulation. We found that over 20% of patients on VTE prophylaxis with enoxaparin had serum anti-Xa levels consistent with true therapeutic anticoagulation (anti-Xa level 0.5–1 units/mL) during their enoxaparin course and 5% achieved values of supratherapeutic anticoagulation (anti-Xa level > 1 units/mL). Serum anti-Xa level did not correlate with once versus twice daily dosing, body mass index (BMI), or creatinine level. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was found to have a positive odds ratio for an anti-Xa level ≥ 0.5 units/mL. We believe that this incidence of unintended therapeutic anticoagulation indicates a clinically significant number and therefore routine anti-Xa evaluation while on VTE prophylaxis is warranted within our population.

### Higher doses of low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin) are needed to achieve target anti-Xa concentrations in critically ill children* [^117FSp8c]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To demonstrate that low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin) can be used in critically ill pediatric patients to achieve target anti-factor Xa concentrations and determine appropriate dosing corrected for age and illness severity.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Single tertiary level PICU.

Patients

One hundred ninety-two children age 1 day through 18 years admitted to PICU undergoing every 12-hour enoxaparin therapy with at least one anti-factor Xa concentration obtained. Patients receiving renal replacement therapy or infants with corrected gestational age less than 37 weeks were excluded.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

We collected patient characteristics including age, weight, height/length, gender, corrected gestational age, illness severity markers, diagnosis, creatinine, enoxaparin dose and times of administration, anti-factor Xa concentrations, and collection times. Only 42% of critically ill children (80 of 192) and only 29% of children (9 of 31) on inotropes achieved recommended target range of anti-factor Xa concentrations on initial recommended enoxaparin dosing (1.5 mg/kg/dose < 2 mo; 1 mg/kg/dose > 2 mo), but 81% were ultimately within target range with dose titration. Increased enoxaparin dose was required to reach target concentrations in younger patients and those with worse illness severity as evidenced by concurrent use of inotropes, previous ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, cardiac surgery, and increased risk of mortality defined by severity-of-illness scores.

Conclusions

Enoxaparin can be used to reach recommended target range of anti-factor Xa concentrations in the PICU patient. However, younger patients and patients with higher illness severity are less likely to achieve target concentrations using currently recommended dosing and may require higher doses of enoxaparin to reach target anti-factor Xa concentrations. Starting enoxaparin dose at least 1.3 mg/kg dosed every 12 hours for treatment of thromboembolic disease in critically ill patients aged 61 days to 1 year or those requiring inotropic support should be confirmed in prospective study.

### Anticoagulant prophylaxis and therapy in children: current challenges and emerging issues [^111VN9W1]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

This review is aimed at describing the unique challenges of anticoagulant prophylaxis and treatment in children, and highlighting areas for research for improving clinical outcomes of children with thromboembolic disease. The evidence presented demonstrates the challenges of advancing the evidence base informing optimal management of thromboembolic disease in children. Recent observational studies have identified risk factors for venous thromboembolism in children, but there are few interventional studies assessing the benefit-risk balance of using thromboprophylaxis in risk-stratified clinical subgroups. A risk level-based framework is proposed for administering mechanical and pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. More research is required to refine the assignment of risk levels. The anticoagulants currently used predominantly in children are unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, and vitamin K antagonists. There is a paucity of robust evidence on the age-specific pharmacology of these agents, and their efficacy and safety for prevention and treatment of thrombosis in children. The available literature is heterogeneous, reflecting age-specific differences, and the various clinical settings for anticoagulation in children. Monitoring assays and target ranges are not well established. Nevertheless, weight-based dosing appears to achieve acceptable outcomes in most indications. Given the limitations of the classical anticoagulants for children, there is great interest in the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), whose properties appear to be particularly suitable for children. All DOACs currently approved for adults have Pediatric Investigation Plans ongoing or planned. These are generating age-specific formulations and systematic dosing information. The ongoing pediatric studies still have to establish whether DOACs have a positive benefit-risk balance in the various pediatric indications and age groups.

### American Society of Hematology / International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2024 updated guidelines for treatment of venous thromboembolism in pediatric patients [^111dC8Wg]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) — therapeutic range and monitoring in children: The therapeutic range used in pediatrics is largely extrapolated from adults, recommending an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) that reflects "a heparin level by protamine titration of 0.2 to 0.4 IU/mL or an anti–factor Xa (anti–FXa) level of 0.35 to 0.7 IU/mL", noting that this "has yet to be confirmed by RCTs". Foundational adult data linked recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk to failure to achieve "an aPTT ratio of ∼1.5 times the control value" with correlation to "0.2 to 0.4 IU/mL by protamine titration". For monitoring in children, "UFH monitoring using the aPTT titrated to an anti-FXa assay result of 0.35 to 0.7 IU/mL, is associated with significant age-related variation", and "Infants and children can have significantly higher aPTT compared with adult reference ranges". The guideline notes that "Most laboratories do not adjust aPTT therapeutic ranges based on age", and that "pediatric studies report a poor correlation between aPTT and anti-FXa activity", with "some pediatric institutions" using anti-FXa monitoring for UFH.

### Experience with intravenous enoxaparin in critically ill infants and children [^113b4Tjc]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Subcutaneous administration of enoxaparin is often difficult in special populations, such as premature infants and critically ill children with severe edema. The difficulty achieving adequate anticoagulation in these patients has led to the employment of intravenous enoxaparin in some cases. However, little pharmacodynamic data are available for determining the appropriate dosing and monitoring (by anti-Factor Xa levels) of intravenous enoxaparin. The objective of this study is to report our experience with the use of intravenous enoxaparin in pediatric patients in the intensive care unit.

Design

Retrospective review of medical records.

Setting

Single institution pediatric intensive care unit.

Patients

All pediatric patients receiving intravenous enoxaparin in the pediatric intensive care unit at Children's Medical Center Dallas between April 1, 2005 and March 31, 2006 were identified using hospital pharmacy records.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Seven patients were identified as having received intravenous enoxaparin while in the intensive care unit. Higher anti-Xa levels were found at 1–2 hrs after administration of intravenous enoxaparin rather than at the 4–6 hrs documented with subcutaneous administration and these levels decreased substantially 6–8 hrs after an intravenous dose. Mean therapeutic dose for children < 1 yr of age was 2.40 mg/kg/dose (± sd 0.58). For children ≥ 1 yr of age, the mean therapeutic dose was 1.11 mg/kg/dose (± sd 0.13). The mean prophylactic dose for the two children was 0.93 mg/kg/dose (± sd 0.43).

Conclusions

Our data show that the pharmacodynamics of intravenous administration is different from subcutaneous administration and deserves further study.

### Therapeutic enoxaparin dosing in obesity [^1172tNao]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Search Strategy

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement 2020 was used to conduct this systematic review. The clinical question was formulated using the "Population, Intervention, Comparator and Outcome" (PICO) method. For this question, "P" represented obese adults with an indication for therapeutic anticoagulation; "I" represented treatment with therapeutic enoxaparin; "C" (the comparator) was not applicable; and "O" represented adverse bleeding, thrombotic outcomes during course of treatment, and implications of AFXa biochemical monitoring regarding dose adjustments.

A systematic electronic search of the Ovid Medline database and Embase was conducted on March 20, 2023 and was last updated December 20, 2023 to identify any additional relevant articles, reporting on original studies evaluating outcomes and/or monitoring of therapeutic enoxaparin in patients with obesity without language or publication date restrictions. The references of eligible studies were screened to determine any additional eligible studies. The search terms used were:

(Enoxaparin [MeSH] OR enoxaparin.mp) AND (Obesity [MeSH] OR Overweight [MeSH] OR obese.mp)

Owing to the large number of results, the additional search term "treatment.mp" was included in only the Embase search to further refine results for title and abstract review.

Eligibility Criteria

Studies were included in this review if they met the following criteria: (1) original data, (2) inpatients and/or outpatients with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or body weight of ≥ 100 kg, (3) adults > 18 years of age, (4) therapeutic dosing regimen of enoxaparin, and (5) evaluation of adverse bleeding and/or thrombotic outcomes, and/or (6) assessment of AFXa levels. The following exclusions were applied: (1) case reports with less than 5 cases, (2) studies on pregnant/postpartum patients, (3) guidelines, conference abstracts, or expert commentaries, (4) studies on pediatric populations, (5) nonhuman studies, and (6) studies evaluating surgical dose adjustments.

### Use of real-world data and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling to characterize enoxaparin disposition in children with obesity [^1139y6Mp]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

PBPK‐model simulated lower anti‐Xa 4‐hour concentrations for younger children is in line with prior population PK analyses in children without obesity, noting a trend of decreased weight‐normalized clearance with increasing age, with allometrically scaled weight as a significant covariate. This makes sense, as younger children have higher weight‐normalized clearance compared with older children. Using total body weight–based dosing, model simulations show ~ 20% higher anti‐Xa exposure for older children with obesity ages 12–18 years, potentially necessitating reduced total body weight–based dosing in older children with obesity as has been previously suggested for treatment and prophylactic dosing. These results suggest that to effectively select an initial total body weight–based enoxaparin dose for children, both the child's age and body size should be considered. Alternatively, fat‐free mass‐simulated dosing resulted in similar anti‐Xa 4‐hour concentrations across all age and obesity status subgroups. Since fat‐free mass already incorporates age and body size, a fat‐free mass dosing strategy could offer a simplistic and more precise method of dose selection for physicians, provided the fat‐free mass metric can be calculated.

### Retrospective evaluation of antithrombin III supplementation in neonates and infants receiving enoxaparin for treatment of thrombosis [^117N94ou]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Thromboembolic events are occurring at increasing rates in neonates and infants. At Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, antithrombin III (AT3) concentrates are often used in combination with enoxaparin to supplement physiologically low AT3 levels. Theoretically, AT3 enhances the anticoagulant activity of enoxaparin and results in decreased time to therapeutic anti-Xa levels. No data exist on use of AT3 for this indication.

Procedure

This retrospective study compared time to therapeutic anti-Xa levels in patients < 1 year of age receiving enoxaparin with AT3 (Group 1) and without AT3 (Group 2) for treatment of thrombosis. Primary objective was to compare time to therapeutic anti-Xa levels (0.5–1 U/ml) between groups. Secondary objectives included comparison of the initial and therapeutic dose of enoxaparin, enoxaparin dose changes, AT3 supplementation, and level monitoring. Bleeding events and cost were also evaluated. Statistical tests included Schuirmann's two one-sided tests for equivalence and general linear models/logistic regression for independent effects of age, critical illness, and timing of AT3.

Results

Mean time to therapeutic anti-Xa levels were not equivalent between Groups 1 and 2 (80.7 vs. 65.2hours; P = 0.28). Initial enoxaparin dose and number of dose changes were equivalent. Group 1 required higher doses of enoxaparin to achieve therapeutic anti-Xa levels. Age, critical illness, and timing of AT3 had no effect on time to therapeutic anti-Xa levels. Bleeding events were not equivalent between Groups 1 and 2 (14.3% vs. 3.9%; P = 0.55).

Conclusion

Supplementation with AT3 did not decrease time to therapeutic anti-Xa levels, added significant cost, and was associated with increased bleeding events.

### A comparative study of varying doses of enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis in critically ill patients: a double-blinded, randomised controlled trial [^1158UNUn]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Primary results

Unblinding occurred on 1 October 2012. For patients with 1 mg/kg QD the mean administered dose of enoxaparin was 75 mg. Repeated measures modelling revealed that anti-Xa levels differed in a linear fashion with the dose of enoxaparin administered, and the time at which the blood samples were drawn. On the first day of enoxaparin administration, doses of 40 mg QD and 40 mg BID yielded similar mean peak anti-Xa of 0.20 IU/ml and 0.17 IU/ml respectively, while a dose of 30 mg BID resulted in much lower levels of anti-Xa (0.08 IU/ml). Patients receiving 1 mg/kg QD enoxaparin achieved near steady-state levels from day 1 of administration with mean peak anti-Xa levels of 0.34 IU/ml (Figure 2). Steady-state anti-Xa was achieved for all doses of enoxaparin at day 3. At steady state, mean peak anti-Xa levels of 0.13 IU/ml and 0.15 IU/ml were achieved with doses of 40 mg QD and 30 mg BID respectively. This increased significantly to 0.33 IU/ml and 0.40 IU/ml for doses of 40 mg BID and 1 mg/kg QD enoxaparin respectively. The anti-Xa response profiles were thus significantly different over the 3 days between the four treatment allocation groups (P < 0.0001). Patients maintained anti-Xa levels within a target range of 0.1 to 0.4 IU/ml for: 33.3% (40 mg QD), 41.7% (30 mg BID), 83% (1 mg/kg QD) and 91.7% (40 mg BID) of the study period (Figure 3). There were no adverse effects.

### Monitoring treatments with unfractionated heparin: CTAD must be used instead of citrate as the anticoagulant solution when using partial-draw collection tubes. results of a multicenter evaluation [^1114H3tL]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Sampling small volumes of blood may be necessary, particularly in pediatric patients, or in case of difficult or recurrent venipunctures.

Methods

Routine hemostasis test results evaluated in partial- and full-draw evacuated polymer tubes obtained in 4 centers were compared.

Results

No relevant discrepancy (Bland-Altman) was found between test results measured in partial- and full-draw tubes obtained from untreated patients and from patients on vitamin K-antagonist or low molecular weight heparin. In patients on unfractionated heparin (UFH), significantly lower anti-FXa activity [median = 0.29IU/mL (range:0.04–1.15) vs. 0.39 (0.05–1.25), n = 89, p < 0.0001] and shorter aPTT were measured in partial-draw tubes. This discrepancy was likely to be related to the release of higher amounts of PF4 after increased platelet activation in partial-draw tubes. As CTAD is known to counteract platelet activation, we then collected blood into partial-draw CTAD tube and full-draw citrate tube. Both in patients on UFH and in untreated patients, no relevant difference could be demonstrated for all studied parameters (Bland-Altman), including aPTT and anti-FXa activity, even if analytical comparison showed significantly higher anti-FXa activity in partial-draw CTAD than in full-draw citrated tubes with a mean bias of 0.02 IU/mL, identical throughout the measuring range.

Conclusions

These results suggest that samples collected into partial-draw citrate tubes allow accurate routine coagulation testingin all patients but those requiring UFH assessment, in which their use led to a significant underestimation ofanticoagulation. In such cases, partial-draw tubes containing CTAD could be validly used to monitor heparin therapy as well as to perform routine coagulation testing.

Nomogram for adjusting LMWH dose

ADDITIONAL POINTS ON DOSING ENOXAPARIN. Existing age-related dosing recommendations and dose adjustments for enoxaparin (< 2 months of age: 1.5 mg/kg SQ injection 2 times a day; > 2 months of age: 1 mg/kg SQ every 12 hours) are based on a small prospective dose-finding study of 23 children. There have been numerous subsequent studies demonstrating that this dosing strategy results in subtherapeutic anti-FXa levels in many children aged < 5 years who often require multiple dose adjustments, although the proportion varies across studies, partly because of variation in anti-FXa assays. The proportion of neonates with subtherapeutic values is even higher, likely because of a higher volume of distribution, lower concentration of antithrombin, and more rapid clearance. These findings have led many to call for higher starting doses for younger patients, particularly neonates. Two retrospective studies comparing the current dosing recommendations to higher starting doses have reported that fewer dose adjustments and venipunctures were needed in those with a higher starting dose, without an increase in bleeding. In contrast, a large retrospective population PK study of enoxaparin in > 800 children aged > 1 year predicted that using 1 mg/kg, 2 times a day, had the highest probability of achieving a therapeutic anti-FXa level.

### Fondaparinux sodium (Arixtra) [^111J3BzX]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.4 Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism Treatment in Adults

In adult patients with acute symptomatic DVT and in patients with acute symptomatic PE, the recommended dose of ARIXTRA is 5 mg (body weight less than 50 kg), 7.5 mg (body weight 50 kg to 100 kg), or 10 mg (body weight greater than 100 kg) by subcutaneous injection once daily (ARIXTRA treatment regimen). Initiate concomitant treatment with warfarin sodium as soon as possible, usually within 72 hours. Continue treatment with ARIXTRA for at least 5 days and until a therapeutic oral anticoagulant effect is established (INR 2 to 3). The usual duration of administration of ARIXTRA is 5 days to 9 days; up to 26 days of ARIXTRA injection was administered in clinical trials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Adverse Reactions (6), and Clinical Studies (14)].

2.5 Venous Thromboembolism Treatment in Pediatric Patients Aged 1 Year or Older Weighing at Least 10 kg

For patients weighing 10 kg to 20 kg, the recommended initial dose is 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously once daily. There is no available prefilled syringe for patients in this weight range, and a patient specific dose should be prepared (see section 2.8 Instructions for Preparation of Individual Pediatric Doses in Pharmacies). The dose should be exact and rounded to the nearest 0.1 mg (see Table 1).

For patients weighing over 20 kg, the recommended initial dose is 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously once daily with doses rounded to the nearest prefilled syringe according to Table 2.

There is no available information for dosing pediatric patients who weigh less than 10 kg.

Monitor fondaparinux levels 2 hours to 4 hours after the second or third dose and then weekly for a month followed by every 1 month to 3 months for the duration of treatment using a fondaparinux-based anti-Xa assay with a therapeutic goal range of 0.5 mg/L to 1 mg/L.

Dosing adjustments may be necessary to achieve peak blood concentration within the therapeutic target of 0.5 mg/L to 1 mg/L (see Table 3). Do not exceed the maximum dose of 7.5 mg/day.

There is no adequate data to support the use of ARIXTRA in pediatric patients below 1 year of age.
