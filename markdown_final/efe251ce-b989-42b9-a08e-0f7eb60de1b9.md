## Question

duration of action of lisinopril

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the duration of action of lisinopril and how to reconcile its pharmacokinetics with pharmacodynamics, dosing recommendations, and special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA label says regarding lisinopril's half-life and disposition. Then, I should verify whether there is a direct statement on 24‑hour duration of action from clinical studies. Next, I will examine mechanistic reasons for a pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic divergence. After that, I should confirm that standard dosing guidance aligns with a 24‑hour effect and review any nuances in renal impairment and hemodialysis. Finally, I will double-check onset/peak/trough dynamics and correct any misattributions before synthesizing a clear conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the foundational pharmacokinetic data. The FDA label states that after multiple dosing, lisinopril has an effective half-life of about 12 hours, with peak serum concentrations reached roughly 7 hours post-dose, and the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine; there is a prolonged terminal phase likely reflecting saturable ACE binding that does not contribute to accumulation, and elimination is affected by renal function, especially when GFR is below 30 mL/min [^117WzcbJ] [^111dXKB3].

> Now, I should verify whether there is a direct clinical statement about duration of action. The SPACE trial explicitly notes that the duration of action for lisinopril is 24 hours, citing half-life values of 12–17 hours for lisinopril and ramipril and recommending at least 24 hours of cessation before noncardiac surgery, which, while a perioperative context, directly addresses the clinical duration question [^117WzcbJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without reconciling PK and PD. I need to check mechanistic explanations for a 24‑hour effect despite a 12‑hour effective half-life. The label's mention of a prolonged terminal phase due to saturable ACE binding supports sustained pharmacodynamic inhibition beyond simple plasma levels, and ACE inhibition reduces angiotensin II and may elevate bradykinin, leading to downstream effects that persist past the serum half-life; together, this can maintain blood pressure control across a 24‑hour dosing interval, consistent with class behavior seen with other ACE inhibitors as well [^115AEmxA] [^113VvTrU].

> Next, I should confirm that standard dosing recommendations are congruent with 24‑hour coverage. Multiple FDA SPL sources consistently recommend once‑daily dosing for hypertension, heart failure, and post‑myocardial infarction across usual dose ranges, which operationalizes a 24‑hour effect in routine practice and aligns with the clinical duration described above [^116DC8nj] [^1153XTfh] [^114mb1QW] [^116BFVNy].

> I will now examine special populations to ensure there isn't a hidden need for altered frequency. In renal impairment, elimination is slower and time to steady state is prolonged, yet guidance still recommends once‑daily dosing with lower starting doses when CrCl is 10–30 mL/min and further reduction below 10 mL/min, implying preserved 24‑hour dosing frequency despite altered clearance; notably, in hemodialysis populations, supervised post‑dialysis lisinopril provided persistent blood pressure reduction over the 44‑hour interdialytic interval, reinforcing prolonged pharmacodynamic action in reduced clearance states [^111dXKB3] [^117B8MCk] [^111ZuRpN] [^111kKjud].

> Let me think about the timing of effect, trough coverage, and a potential misattribution I noticed. Initially, I thought the ATLAS trial directly provided a trough‑to‑peak ratio for lisinopril, but wait, I should verify that; ATLAS primarily contrasted high‑ versus low‑dose lisinopril in heart failure and does not furnish the specific trough‑to‑peak ratio claim I was recalling. I should correct that and instead rely on direct PK/PD and class data: lisinopril shows measurable clinical BP lowering within hours in acute settings, moexipril's label demonstrates onset by about 1 hour with a 3–6 hour peak and diminished but present 24‑hour trough effects, and quinapril data show a trough effect around 50% of peak with chronic dosing, a pattern that supports sustained class efficacy across 24 hours even if trough effect is attenuated relative to peak, which is consistent with once‑daily lisinopril use and label PK dynamics [^1175m1GC] [^111mwQGe] [^113VvTrU] [^115AEmxA].

> But wait, what if perioperative guidance overstates duration compared with ambulatory hypertension management? Let me reconsider by triangulating sources. The perioperative SPACE statement of a 24‑hour duration dovetails with FDA once‑daily dosing across indications and mechanistic persistence from ACE occupancy and RAAS modulation, and the observed sustained interdialytic BP control further corroborates meaningful effect at 24 hours; taken together, these lines of evidence converge on clinically relevant 24‑hour action for lisinopril in typical use, with the caveat that trough effects are weaker than peak, as is typical for the class [^117WzcbJ] [^116DC8nj] [^1153XTfh] [^111kKjud] [^113VvTrU].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. The clinical duration of action of lisinopril is 24 hours, despite an effective serum half-life of about 12 hours, due to sustained ACE inhibition and downstream RAAS effects; this is reflected in once‑daily dosing across labeled indications and supported by perioperative guidance and hemodialysis data, with the understanding that trough effectiveness persists but is lower than peak response at 24 hours [^115AEmxA] [^117WzcbJ] [^116DC8nj] [^1153XTfh] [^111kKjud].

Lisinopril has a **duration of action of approximately 24 hours** [^115AEmxA], supporting once-daily dosing for hypertension and heart failure [^114mb1QW]. Its **effective half-life is about 12 hours** [^115AEmxA] with repeated dosing, and the antihypertensive effect is sustained over 24 hours. In renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min) [^111dXKB3], elimination is prolonged and dose adjustment is required [^117B8MCk]. Lisinopril is not metabolized [^115AEmxA] and is excreted unchanged in urine.

---

## Pharmacokinetic properties influencing duration of action

- **Absorption**: Peak serum concentrations occur ~7 hours after oral administration [^115AEmxA]; food does not affect bioavailability.

- **Distribution**: Not protein-bound [^115AEmxA]; distributes into tissues, including ACE-rich sites.

- **Metabolism**: Not metabolized [^115AEmxA]; excreted unchanged in urine.

- **Elimination**: Effective half-life ~12 hours with repeated dosing [^115AEmxA]; terminal phase reflects saturable ACE binding and does not cause accumulation.

---

## Clinical duration of antihypertensive effect

- **Once-daily dosing**: Provides sustained 24-hour blood pressure control [^114TWo8N].

- **Onset of action**: Antihypertensive effect begins within 1 hour; peak effect at 6–8 hours.

- **Duration of effect**: Single dose lasts ~24 hours, supporting once-daily use.

---

## Factors influencing duration of action

- **Renal function**: Impaired renal function prolongs elimination and increases exposure [^111dXKB3]; adjust dose when GFR < 30 mL/min [^117B8MCk].

- **Age**: Older patients have higher exposure and prolonged elimination; monitor closely.

- **Comorbidities**: Heart failure and renal impairment can prolong duration; monitor and adjust as needed.

---

## Clinical implications of duration of action

Once-daily dosing improves adherence and convenience, and the long duration supports **consistent blood pressure control** [^112FgYDX]. Sustained 24-hour control reduces cardiovascular risk [^112aX4mq].

## Comparison with other ACE inhibitors

| **ACE inhibitor** | **Duration of action** | **Dosing frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| Lisinopril | ~24 hours | Once daily |
| Enalapril | 12–24 hours | Once or twice daily |
| Ramipril | 24 hours | Once daily |
| Captopril | 6–12 hours | Two to three times daily |

---

Lisinopril's duration of action is **approximately 24 hours** [^115AEmxA], enabling once-daily dosing and sustained antihypertensive control [^117WzcbJ].

### Zestoretic [^113CbeKq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Lisinopril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. This latter decrease may result in a small increase in serum potassium. The removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity.

In hypertensive patients with normal renal function treated with lisinopril alone for up to 24 weeks, the mean increase in serum potassium was less than 0.1 mEq/L. However, approximately 15 percent of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEq/L, and approximately six percent had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEq/L. In the same study, patients treated with lisinopril plus a thiazide diuretic showed essentially no change in serum potassium (see precautions). ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of lisinopril remains to be elucidated.

While the mechanism through which lisinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, lisinopril is shown to be antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin hypertension.

### Zestril [^111dXKB3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Impaired renal function decreases the elimination of lisinopril, which is excreted principally through the kidneys, but this decrease becomes clinically important only when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min. Above this glomerular filtration rate, the elimination half-life changes little. With greater impairment, however, peak and trough lisinopril levels increase, time to peak concentration increases, and the time to attain a steady state is prolonged [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis.

- **Pediatric patients**: The pharmacokinetics of lisinopril were studied in 29 pediatric hypertensive patients between 6 years and 16 years with a glomerular filtration rate greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m². After doses of 0.1 mg per kg to 0.2 mg per kg, steady-state peak plasma concentrations of lisinopril occurred within 6 hours, and the extent of absorption based on urinary recovery was about 28%. These values are similar to those obtained previously in adults. The typical value of lisinopril oral clearance (systemic clearance/absolute bioavailability) in a child weighing 30 kg is 10 L/h, which increases in proportion to renal function. In a multicenter, open-label pharmacokinetic study of daily oral lisinopril in 22 pediatric hypertensive patients with stable kidney transplants (ages 7 to 17 years; estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), dose-normalized exposures were in the range reported previously in children without a kidney transplant.

The dosage of lisinopril PO for adjunctive treatment for heart failure in adults is as follows:

- **Initial dosage**: Start at 5 mg PO daily.
- **Maintenance dosage**: 5–40 mg PO daily.
- **Maximum dosage**: 40 mg per day.

### Zestril [^115AEmxA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: In adult patients, following oral administration of Zestril, peak serum concentrations of lisinopril occur within about 7 hours, although there is a trend toward a slight delay in reaching peak serum concentrations in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Food does not alter the bioavailability of Zestril. The declining serum concentrations exhibit a prolonged terminal phase, which does not contribute to drug accumulation. This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to dose. Upon multiple dosing, lisinopril exhibits an effective half-life of 12 hours.

Lisinopril does not appear to be bound to other serum proteins. It does not undergo metabolism and is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine. Based on urinary recovery, the mean extent of absorption of lisinopril is approximately 25%, with large intersubject variability (6% to 60%) at all doses tested (5 mg to 80 mg). The absolute bioavailability of lisinopril is reduced to 16% in patients with stable NYHA Class II-IV congestive heart failure, and the volume of distribution appears to be slightly smaller than that in normal subjects. The oral bioavailability of lisinopril in patients with acute myocardial infarction is similar to that in healthy volunteers.

### Discontinuation vs. continuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibition before non-cardiac surgery: The SPACE trial [^117WzcbJ]. European Heart Journal (2024). Low credibility.

For most ACE inhibitors alone, at least 24 hours of cessation is required. For example, the duration of action for lisinopril and ramipril, the most commonly used ACE inhibitors in SPACE participants, is 24 hours, with half-life elimination times of 12–17 hours, respectively. The lack of consistency in the timing of RAS inhibitors cessation before — and resumption after — non-cardiac surgery partially explains the considerable variability in international recommendations for managing RAS inhibitors in surgical patients.

The evidence base relies mostly on retrospective studies with a strong risk of bias and small, single-center randomized trials with non-blinded primary outcomes. A similarly sized trial to ours examined hemodynamic changes after 275 patients were randomized to either continue ACE inhibitors or omit a single ACE inhibitor dose. Intra-operative hypotension occurred less frequently after ACE inhibitor omission, with decreased vasopressor use. Similar to our study, post-operative hypertension was more frequent when ACE inhibitors were omitted, although fluid requirements did not differ between groups. In the absence of markers for organ injury, the relevance of these hemodynamic alterations remains unclear. Moreover, recent randomized controlled trial data do not support universally targeting higher intra-operative blood pressures to reduce post-operative complications.

In our study, we specifically focused on older patients aged over 60 years, who are most at risk of myocardial injury, rather than younger patients (age ≥ 18 years) with markedly less risk of morbidity. Three ongoing, pragmatic mu…

### Development of lisinopril radioconjugates for nuclear imaging of the angiotensin converting enzyme [^111HAruA]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). High credibility.

The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is essential in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis, and its dysfunction is associated with various pathological conditions. This study aimed to investigate lisinopril-based radioconjugates for nuclear imaging of ACE.

- **Methods**: Lisinopril conjugates were prepared using solid-phase peptide synthesis and labeled with gallium-67. The resulting radioconjugates were assessed for their in vitro stability in saline and in mouse and human blood plasma. ACE-mediated uptake was evaluated in HEK cells transfected with human ACE, and the findings were interpreted using molecular dynamic studies. Tissue distribution profiles of the radioconjugates were evaluated in mice bearing HEK-ACE xenografts through nuclear imaging and classic biodistribution studies. The feasibility to detect physiologic ACE was further assessed by ex vivo autoradiography of the lungs and the kidneys collected from mice injected with [⁶⁷Ga]Ga-DOTA-LIS-02.

- **Results**: DOTA-LIS-01, DOTA-LIS-02, and NODAGA-LIS-02 were prepared with > 98% chemical purity. Radiolabeling of the conjugates with gallium-67 was achieved at 80 MBq/nmol with > 99% radiochemical purity. [⁶⁷Ga]Ga-DOTA-LIS-02 and [⁶⁷Ga]Ga-NODAGA-LIS-02 exhibited radiolytic stability for up to 3 hours in saline and remained intact in mouse and human blood plasma for 1 hour. The uptake of [⁶⁷Ga]Ga-DOTA-LIS-02 and [⁶⁷Ga]Ga-NODAGA-LIS-02 in HEK-ACE cells after 3 hours of incubation reached approximately 57% and 50%, respectively, while only approximately 21% cell uptake was reached with [⁶⁷Ga]Ga-DOTA-LIS-01. This discrepancy was ascribed to the…

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of renin inhibitors for primary hypertension [^116RrMfd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a chronic condition associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. Renin is the enzyme responsible for converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II. Renin inhibitors are a new class of drugs that decrease blood pressure (BP) by preventing the formation of both angiotensin I and angiotensin II.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the dose-related BP lowering efficacy of renin inhibitors compared to placebo in the treatment of primary hypertension. To determine the change in BP variability, pulse pressure, and heart rate, and to evaluate adverse events (mortality, non-fatal serious adverse events, total adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse effects, and specific adverse events such as dry cough, diarrhoea, and angioedema).

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. There was no restriction by language or publication status. We also searched the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for clinical study reports, the Novartis Clinical Study Results Database, bibliographic citations from retrieved references, and contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of renin inhibitors on blood pressure in adults with primary hypertension.

### Diverse effects of increasing lisinopril doses on lipid abnormalities in chronic nephropathies [^111TSr9s]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Dyslipidemia frequently complicates chronic nephropathies and increases the risk of renal and cardiovascular events. This might be ameliorated by drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which effectively reduce proteinuria.

- **Methods and results**: In this longitudinal study, we evaluated the extent to which uptitration of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril to maximum tolerated doses (median [range]: 30 [10 to 40] mg/d) ameliorated proteinuria and dyslipidemia in 28 patients with nondiabetic chronic nephropathies. Maximum lisinopril doses significantly and safely reduced proteinuria, serum total, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides without substantially affecting serum HDL and renal hemodynamics. Proteinuria already decreased at 10 mg/d. Serum lipids progressively and dose-dependently decreased during uptitration to maximum doses. Reduction in total and LDL cholesterol correlated with increases in serum albumin/total protein concentration and oncotic pressure, peaked at lisinopril maximum doses, and persisted after treatment withdrawal. Despite less proteinuria reduction, hypercholesterolemia decreased more (and reflected the increase in serum albumin) in hypoalbuminemic than in normoalbuminemic patients who, despite more proteinuria reduction, had less decrease in cholesterol and no changes in serum albumin. Changes in serum triglycerides were independent of changes in serum proteins, were strongly correlated with lisinopril doses (r = -0.89, P = 0.003), and recovered promptly after treatment withdrawal. Lisinopril was well tolerated and did not affect renal hem.

### SPL drug information for lisinopril / hydrochlorothiazide [^111uTQPT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Common adverse reactions (1–10%) associated with the use of lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide PO (also known as Zestoretic) include:

- **Cardiovascular effects**: chest pain, hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, palpitations
- **Nervous system effects**: dizziness, headache, paresthesia
- **Respiratory effects**: cough, upper respiratory tract infections
- **Musculoskeletal effects**: muscle cramps
- **Metabolic effects**: increased serum potassium
- **Sexual effects**: decreased libido, erectile dysfunction
- **General effects**: asthenia, fatigue, skin rash, indigestion

### Zestoretic [^114qHuXU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Lisinopril monotherapy is an effective treatment for hypertension with once-daily doses ranging from 10 mg to 80 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy is effective in doses from 12.5 mg to 50 mg per day. In clinical trials involving lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy, using lisinopril doses of 10 mg to 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 mg to 50 mg, the antihypertensive response rates generally increased with higher doses of either component.

The side effects of lisinopril (see WARNINGS) are generally rare and appear to be independent of dose. In contrast, the side effects of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g. pancreatitis); the former is much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide may be associated with either or both dose-independent or dose-dependent side effects. However, the addition of lisinopril in clinical trials blunted the hypokalemia typically observed with diuretics.

To minimize dose-dependent side effects, initiating combination therapy is usually appropriate only following a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy.

- **Dose titration guided by clinical effect**: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be switched to lisinopril/HCTZ 10/12.5 or lisinopril/HCTZ 20/12.5, depending on the monotherapy dose. Further increases of either or both components should depend on clinical response, with blood pressure measured frequently.

### Which patients benefit the most from the perindopril/amlodipine combination [^112D8yiD]. Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Fixed-dose combinations have been strongly endorsed by European guidelines for first-line and second-line treatment of hypertension. Among recommended combinations, that of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker stands out because the mechanisms of action of these two therapeutic classes are complementary, leading to enhanced efficacy. In the large multicentre ASCOT-BPLA trial, treatment based on the combination of amlodipine and perindopril significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular and all-cause death, stroke, coronary events and procedures, new-onset diabetes, and new-onset renal impairment in a wide range of patients with hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors compared with atenolol/thiazide-based therapy. The perindopril/amlodipine single-pill combination was developed based on guideline recommendations for combination treatment, the indications of each component, and ASCOT-BPLA trial data. Several studies in real-life settings show that a wide range of hypertensive patients, including everyday hypertensives with common risk factors, would benefit from the perindopril/amlodipine combination.

### Low-dose combination therapy: The rationalization for an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker in higher risk patients [^116nxBY7]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

As more high-risk hypertensive patients are treated and the need for more intensive antihypertensive therapy is recognized, combination therapies are increasingly used. For initial therapy, particularly for relatively low-risk patients, low-dose combinations are often appropriate. For those who require additional therapy, higher doses of combinations may provide further efficacy while minimizing dose-dependent side effects of monotherapy, thereby improving adherence to therapy. These combination agents should provide 24-hour control with one daily dose, ensuring protection in the early morning hours. Combining an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker is a rational approach to treating hypertension. Not only does it provide significantly better blood pressure control than individual components used as monotherapies, but it also minimizes dose-dependent side effects. Furthermore, combining agents from different classes results in complementary mechanisms of action that provide additional cardiovascular protective benefits.

### Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of lisinopril in pediatric kidney transplant patients: Implications for starting dose selection [^115sgAD4]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertension in pediatric kidney transplant recipients contributes to long-term graft loss; yet treatment options, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, are poorly characterized in this vulnerable population. We conducted a multicenter, open-label pharmacokinetic (PK) study of daily oral lisinopril in 22 children (ages 7–17 years) with stable kidney transplant function. Standard noncompartmental PK analyses were performed at steady state. Effects on blood pressure were examined in lisinopril-naïve patients (n = 13). Oral clearance declined in proportion to underlying kidney function; however, in patients with low estimated glomerular filtration rate (30–59 ml/min per 1.73 m²), exposure (standardized to 0.1 mg/kg/day dose) was within the range reported previously in children without a kidney transplant. In lisinopril-naïve patients, 85% and 77% had a ≥ 6 mmHg reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively. Lisinopril was well tolerated. Our study provides initial insight on lisinopril use in children with a kidney transplant, including starting dose considerations.

### Accupril [^113VvTrU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In the treatment of hypertension, single doses of 20 mg of Accupril provide over 80% inhibition of plasma ACE for 24 hours. The inhibition of the pressor response to angiotensin I is shorter-lived, with a 20 mg dose achieving 75% inhibition for about 4 hours, 50% inhibition for about 8 hours, and 20% inhibition at 24 hours. However, with chronic dosing, there is substantial inhibition of angiotensin II levels at 24 hours when doses of 20–80 mg are administered.

The administration of 10 to 80 mg of Accupril to patients with mild to severe hypertension results in a reduction of both sitting and standing blood pressure to about the same extent, with minimal effect on heart rate. Symptomatic postural hypotension is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt and/or volume-depleted (see WARNINGS). Antihypertensive activity commences within 1 hour, with peak effects usually achieved by 2 to 4 hours after dosing. During chronic therapy, most of the blood pressure-lowering effect of a given dose is achieved within 1–2 weeks.

In multiple-dose studies, daily doses of 10–80 mg, whether administered as a single dose or in divided doses, lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure throughout the dosing interval. The trough effect is about 5–11/3–7 mm Hg, representing approximately 50% of the peak effect. Although the dose-response relationship is relatively flat, doses of 40–80 mg were somewhat more effective at trough than 10–20 mg, and twice-daily dosing tended to yield a somewhat lower trough blood pressure than once-daily dosing with the same total dose. The antihypertensive effect of Accupril continues during long-term therapy, with no evidence of loss of efficacy.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^115FQHjS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure lead to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug should be used first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives include quantifying the blood pressure-lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects, compared to placebo or no treatment, when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one year in duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were targeted.

### Renin inhibitors versus angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for primary hypertension [^114ynicX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Renin inhibitors (RIs) reduce blood pressure more than placebo, with the magnitude of this effect thought to be similar to that for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, a drug's efficacy in lowering blood pressure cannot be considered a definitive indicator of its effectiveness in reducing mortality and morbidity. The effectiveness and safety of RIs compared to ACE inhibitors in treating hypertension is unknown.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of renin inhibitors compared to ACE inhibitors in people with primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to August 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers about further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) with at least four weeks follow-up in people with primary hypertension, which compared renin inhibitors with ACE inhibitors and reported morbidity, mortality, adverse events, or blood pressure outcomes. We excluded people with proven secondary hypertension.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected the included trials and evaluated the risks of bias.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^116NuM1A]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Studies suggest that bedtime dosing of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker shows a more sustained and consistent 24-hour antihypertensive profile, including greater night-time blood pressure (BP) reduction. We compared the antihypertensive effects of morning (a.m.) and evening (p.m.) dosing of valsartan on 24-hour BP.

- **Methods**: This 26-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study evaluated the efficacy and safety of valsartan 320 mg, dosed a.m. or p.m., versus lisinopril 40 mg (a.m.), a long-acting ACE inhibitor, in patients with grade 1–2 hypertension and at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. Patients (n = 1093; BP = 156 ± 11/91 ± 8 mmHg; 62 years, 56% male, 99% white) received (1:1:1) valsartan 160 mg a.m. or p.m. or lisinopril 20 mg a.m. for 4 weeks, then force-titrated to double the initial dose for 8 weeks. At week 12, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg was added for 14 weeks if office BP was more than 140/90 mmHg and/or ambulatory BP more than 130/80 mmHg.

- **Results**: Mean 24-hour ambulatory SBP change from baseline to weeks 12 and 26 was comparable between valsartan a.m. (-10.6 and -13.3 mmHg) and p.m. (-9.8 and -12.3 mmHg) and lisinopril (-10.7 and -13.7 mmHg). There was no benefit of valsartan p.m. versus a.m. on night-time BP, early morning BP, and morning BP surge. Evening dosing also did not improve BP lowering in patients requiring add-on HCTZ or in nondippers at baseline. All treatments were well tolerated.

- **Conclusion**: Once-daily dosing of valsartan 320 mg results in equally effective 24-hour BP efficacy, regardless of administration time.

### Zestoretic [^114mnP1b]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Hypotension and related effects: Excessive hypotension was rarely seen in uncomplicated hypertensive patients but is a possible consequence of lisinopril use in salt/volume-depleted persons such as those treated vigorously with diuretics or patients on dialysis (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Syncope has been reported in 0.8 percent of patients receiving Zestoretic. In patients with hypertension receiving lisinopril alone, the incidence of syncope was 0.1 percent. The overall incidence of syncope may be reduced by proper titration of the individual components (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, ADVERSE REACTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

In patients with severe congestive heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, excessive hypotension has been observed and may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death. Because of the potential fall in blood pressure in these patients, therapy should be started under very close medical supervision. Such patients should be followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of lisinopril and/or diuretic is increased. Similar considerations apply to patients with ischemic heart or cerebrovascular disease in whom an excessive fall in blood pressure could result in a myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident.

If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, receive an intravenous infusion of normal saline.

### Lisinopril therapy for hemodialysis hypertension: Hemodynamic and endocrine responses [^111kKjud]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

To evaluate the antihypertensive effects of lisinopril, a renally excreted angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, we assessed supervised administration of the drug after hemodialysis (HD) three times weekly. Blood pressure (BP) was measured using interdialytic 44-hour ambulatory BP (ABP) monitoring, and endocrine responses were assessed by plasma renin activity (PRA) before and after dialysis. Lisinopril dosage was titrated at biweekly intervals. If ineffective after full titration (up to 40 mg three times weekly), ultrafiltration was added to reduce dry weight. The primary outcome variable was the change in BP from the end of the run-in period to the end of the study. No change in mean ABP was noted during the run-in period. However, mean 44-hour ABP decreased from 149 ± 14 (SD)/84 ± 9 to 127 ± 16/73 ± 9 mm Hg, a decrease of 22/11 mm Hg (P < 0.001). At the final visit, 6 patients had systolic hypertension (≥ 135 mm Hg), and 1 patient had diastolic hypertension (≥ 85 mm Hg). Four patients were administered 10 mg of lisinopril, 5 patients were given 20 mg, and 2 patients received 40 mg; only 1 of these patients required ultrafiltration therapy. There was a persistent antihypertensive effect over 44 hours. BP reduction was achieved without an increase in intradialytic symptomatic or asymptomatic hypotensive episodes. PRA increased in response to dialysis, as well as lisinopril. In conclusion, supervised lisinopril therapy is effective in controlling hypertension in chronic HD patients. This may be related to the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system.

### Paramedic initiated lisinopril for acute stroke treatment (PIL-FAST): Results from the pilot randomised controlled trial [^116LfrfS]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Adults with new unilateral arm weakness thought to be due to acute stroke within 3 hours of symptom onset and hypertension (systolic BP > 160 mm Hg on two consecutive occasions) were eligible, provided they were being transported to one of the three hospitals in the study and had no exclusion criteria, including contraindications to lisinopril and clinical features associated with stroke mimics. Eligible participants were identified, recruited, verbally consented, and given the first dose of study medication by a research-trained paramedic attending the emergency call.

A standardised consent script incorporating a simple capacity assessment was designed for use by paramedics. Having listened to the study description, if the patient answered the study questions correctly, they were asked to provide verbal consent to participate in the trial. If the patient was unable to answer the questions or appeared to lack mental capacity during the paramedic routine assessment, the next of kin or other close relative (if present) could provide consent based on their understanding of the wishes of the patient. Following arrival at the hospital, patients and/or next of kin/close relative were given more information about the study and a standard information sheet. They were subsequently asked to confirm consent in writing. These unique consent processes were specifically designed to enable this trial to take place in the emergency setting without creating a delay in standard care.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^113Dt9PV]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Studies suggest that bedtime dosing of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker shows a more sustained and consistent 24-hour antihypertensive profile, including greater nighttime blood pressure (BP) reduction. We compared the antihypertensive effects of morning (a.m.) and evening (p.m.) dosing of valsartan on 24-hour BP.

- **Methods**: This 26-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study evaluated the efficacy and safety of valsartan 320 mg, dosed a.m. or p.m., versus lisinopril 40 mg (a.m.), a long-acting ACE inhibitor, in patients with grade 1–2 hypertension and at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. Patients (n = 1093; BP = 156 ± 11/91 ± 8 mmHg; 62 years, 56% male, 99% white) received valsartan 160 mg a.m. or p.m. or lisinopril 20 mg a.m. for 4 weeks, then force-titrated to double the initial dose for 8 weeks. At Week 12, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg was added for 14 weeks if office BP was more than 140/90 mmHg and/or ambulatory BP more than 130/80 mmHg.

- **Results**: Mean 24-hour ambulatory SBP change from baseline to Weeks 12 and 26 was comparable between valsartan a.m. (–10.6 and –13.3 mmHg) and p.m. (–9.8 and –12.3 mmHg) and lisinopril (–10.7 and –13.7 mmHg). There was no benefit of valsartan p.m. versus a.m. on nighttime BP, early morning BP, and morning BP surge. Evening dosing also did not improve BP lowering in patients requiring add-on HCTZ or in nondippers at baseline. All treatments were well tolerated.

Once-daily dosing of valsartan 320 mg results in equally effective 24-hour BP control, irrespective of whether it is administered in the morning or evening.

### Moexipril Hydrochloride [^111mwQGe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effect

Single and multiple doses of 15 mg or more of moexipril hydrochloride gives sustained inhibition of plasma ACE activity of 80 to 90%, beginning within 2 hours and lasting 24 hours (80%).

In controlled trials, the peak effects of orally administered moexipril increased with the dose administered over a dose range of 7.5 to 60 mg, given once a day. Antihypertensive effects were first detectable about 1 hour after dosing, with a peak effect between 3 and 6 hours after dosing. Just before dosing (i.e. at trough), the antihypertensive effects were less prominently related to dose and the antihypertensive effect tended to diminish during the 24-hour dosing interval when the drug was administered once a day.

In multiple dose studies in the dose range of 7.5 to 30 mg once daily, moexipril hydrochloride lowered sitting diastolic and systolic blood pressure effects at trough by 3 to 6 mmHg and 4 to 11 mmHg more than placebo, respectively. There was a tendency toward increased response with higher doses over this range. These effects are typical of ACE inhibitors but, at the time of writing, there are no trials of adequate size comparing moexipril with other antihypertensive agents.

The trough diastolic blood pressure effects of moexipril were approximately 3 to 6 mmHg in various studies. Generally, higher doses of moexipril leave a greater fraction of the peak blood pressure effect still present at trough. During dose titration, any decision as to the adequacy of a dosing regimen should be based on trough blood pressure measurements. If diastolic blood pres

### Effect of antihypertensive therapy on development of incident conduction system disease in hypertensive patients [^1169HX3p]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Low credibility.

Previous work has demonstrated that treatment of hypertensive patients with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril was associated with a reduced incidence of a composite conduction system disease endpoint and also left bundle branch block (LBBB) compared with chlorthalidone therapy. The relationship of incident conduction system disease to angiotensin receptor blocker therapy has not been examined.

- **Methods**: Risk of new right (RBBB) or left bundle branch block (LBBB) in relation to losartan-based vs. atenolol-based treatment was assessed in 8,342 hypertensive patients without baseline RBBB or LBBB. Risk of incident intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD), defined as new QRS duration of at least 110 ms, was assessed in the 7,110 patient subset who also had baseline QRS duration less than 110 ms. QRS duration and bundle branch block (BBB) were determined on in-study ECGs done at 6 months, 1 year, and then yearly.

- **Results**: During 4.8 ± 1.0 years of follow-up, 459 patients developed new LBBB (5.5%), 184 (2.2%) developed new RBBB, and 1,173 (16.5%) developed a new IVCD. In univariate Cox analyses, losartan-based treatment was not associated with a significantly reduced risk of either new LBBB (hazard ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.79–1.14, P = 0.583) or RBBB (hazard ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.76–1.36, P = 0.903), but resulted in a 15% lower risk of new IVCD (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.76–0.95, P = 0.005). In a multivariable Cox model that adjusted for other statistically significant predictors of incident IVCD in this population (age, sex, race, history of ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, diabetes or atrial fibrillation, prior antihypertensive therapy.

### Low-dose lisinopril in normotensive men with idiopathic oligospermia and infertility: A 5-year randomized, controlled, crossover pilot study [^115C35Xg]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

The outcomes of drug treatment for male infertility remain conjectural, with controversial study results. Our pilot study employed a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover methodology with intention-to-treat analysis. Thirty-three men with idiopathic oligospermia were randomized to start either daily oral lisinopril 2.5 mg (n = 17) or daily oral placebo (n = 16). Lisinopril was found to cause a normalization of seminal parameters in 53.6% of the participants.

Although the mean ejaculate volume was unchanged (P ≥ 0.093), the total sperm cell count and the percentage of motile sperm cells increased (P ≤ 0.03 and P < 0.001, respectively), whereas the percentage of sperm cells with abnormal morphology decreased (P ≤ 0.04). The pregnancy rate was 48.5%, and there was no serious adverse drug event.

It is concluded, albeit cautiously, that prolonged treatment with 2.5 mg/day of oral lisinopril may be well tolerated in normotensive men with idiopathic oligospermia, may improve sperm quantity and quality, and may enhance fertility in approximately half of those treated.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^1143bGFm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are widely prescribed for the treatment of hypertension, especially for diabetic patients, based on postulated advantages in reducing diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite the widespread use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for hypertension in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remain unclear.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with hypertension.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to November 19, 2014, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to October 19, 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies with at least six months of follow-up in people with primary elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. Patients with proven secondary hypertension were excluded.

### Does the antihypertensive response to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition predict the antihypertensive response to angiotensin receptor antagonism [^1159RJ9J]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

To test the hypothesis that the antihypertensive response to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition can predict the response to angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) antagonism, 33 hypertensive patients were randomized to receive either lisinopril (20 mg) or losartan (50 mg) for five weeks. Patients were then crossed over to the alternative treatment for a second five-week period. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) was measured before randomization and on the final day of each period.

The agreement in ABP response between the two drugs was assessed using the following approaches:

- **Classification of subjects**: Subjects were classified as responders and nonresponders using as a threshold an arbitrary level of response (ABP fall ≥ 10 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 5 mm Hg diastolic) or the median ABP response achieved by each of the drugs.

- **Disagreement expression**: Disagreement between the two drugs in the responders-nonresponders classification was expressed as the proportion of subjects whose ABP responded to one of the drugs only.

Lisinopril was more effective than losartan in reducing ABP, with a mean difference of 4.7 ± 8.1/3.3 ± 5.7 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic, P < .05). Disagreement in the antihypertensive response between the two drugs was observed in 39%/33% of subjects for systolic/diastolic ABP using the arbitrary response criterion (33%/39% using the median response criterion). Significant correlations were found between the responses to lisinopril and losartan (r = 0.47/0.59, systolic/diastolic, P < .01). We conclude that in more than one third of hypertensive subjects, the blood pressure response to ACE inhibition fails to predict the response to AT1R antagonism.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^116em1Sr]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Efficacy results indicated no difference in the blood pressure (BP) control rate at the end of the study (Week 26) between patients receiving valsartan 320 mg as a morning dose (40.7%) or evening dose (39.7%) or when compared with lisinopril 40 mg (43.3%, P = 0.4989 for lisinopril versus valsartan a.m.). Similarly, the percentage of patients achieving BP control at Week 12 was consistent irrespective of the time of dosing of valsartan (36.7% a.m. versus 35.0% p.m. P = 0.6752) or when compared with lisinopril treatment (39.5%, P = 0.4641 versus valsartan a.m.).

The change in mean systolic blood pressure (maSBP) from baseline to Week 12 showed no difference between the valsartan a.m. and p.m. groups (−10.6 versus −9.8, P = 0.4219, 95% confidence interval [CI]: −2.30 to 0.96, with no adjustment for multiplicity). It was also similar between the valsartan a.m. and lisinopril groups (−10.6 versus −10.7, P = 0.8966, 97.5% CI, adjusted for multiplicity: −1.76 to 1.98). The CI limits were well within the noninferiority margins of ± 4 mmHg. The mean hourly systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values were comparable among the three treatment groups at Week 12, with circadian BP profiles being similar for both morning and evening dosing of valsartan. Additionally, the change from baseline in maSBP and maDBP at the end of the study (Week 26) was also similar between the valsartan a.m. and p.m. dosing groups.

### Drug therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: What is the 'right' dose [^113C3CKD]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). High credibility.

It is also important to consider the actual dose in the treatment arms in the two larger trials. In ATLAS, these were 4.5 versus 33.2 mg of lisinopril, and in HEAAL, 46 versus 129 mg of losartan. ATLAS is perhaps most striking in suggesting that even a small dose (one-seventh of the higher dose) preserves much of the benefit of a larger dose of an ACE inhibitor. However, we still face the challenge of knowing what dose of enalapril or candesartan 4.5 mg of lisinopril is equivalent to. There are no satisfactory comparisons of doses of lisinopril and enalapril, or doses of lisinopril and candesartan, in patients with heart failure. However, existing data and comparisons in hypertension suggest that the low dose of lisinopril used in ATLAS was probably equivalent to less than 10 mg of enalapril.

Of interest, in both HEAAL and ATLAS, the proportion of patients who discontinued study drugs did not differ between the high and low-dose groups. In both trials, hypotension, renal dysfunction, and hyperkalaemia occurred more frequently in the higher dose group, but there was no significant excess of discontinuation for any of these reasons in the higher dose group in either trial.

Although three trials comparing doses of beta-blockers showed a greater increase in left ventricular ejection fraction with bigger doses, each was small and reported too few deaths and hospital admissions (or reported these incompletely) to draw any meaningful conclusion about a dose-related effect on outcomes. Two of these trials compared carvedilol over a wide daily dose range (5 to 50 mg).

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: A double-blind randomized controlled trial [^112h5r8W]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

A strength of the PATHWAY studies is the use of home blood pressure (BP) monitoring as the primary outcome measure. Measured over a number of days and averaged, this value is a better prognostic marker of cardiovascular disease than clinic pressure and avoids misclassification due to the "white coat effect" seen with clinic measures. Although some guidelines now recommend 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements for initial diagnosis, this is not a practical alternative to home BP monitoring (HBPM) for routine monitoring of treatment. Within a trial environment, the use of serial ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for primary outcome measurements can compromise power by increasing dropout rates.

In addition to the use of HBPM, we conducted a substudy assessing left ventricular (LV) mass. Consistent with the large reductions in BP over phases 1 and 2 in the combination therapy group and over phase 2 in the monotherapy group, our substudy found greater than 10% reduction in LV mass, which compares favorably with the reduction seen in other studies. The absence of difference in LV mass between groups confirms rejection of the never-catch-up hypothesis and the rapidity with which cardiovascular risk (for which LV mass is the best surrogate) can be reversed by good BP control.

The British Hypertension Society Research Network took a lead role in the design of ACCELERATE (Aliskiren and the Calcium Channel Blocker Amlodipine Combination as an Initial Treatment Strategy for Hypertension Control), a previous trial addressing questions similar to those in PATHWAY-1.

### Suspected aripiprazole-induced neutropenia in a geriatric patient: A case report [^114NhKJY]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Low credibility.

It is highly unlikely that the patient developed the neutropenia from lisinopril or citalopram, as there is also no established association with neutropenia in either of these drugs. Although not required, a temporal relationship between an adverse reaction and exposure to the suspected agent is highly suspicious, and in this case, a temporal relationship only exists with aripiprazole. Additionally, the patient did not have a prior adverse reaction to lisinopril or citalopram during previous hospitalizations, and restarting the medications did not result in a return of neutropenia. Levothyroxine's adverse effects are typically limited to symptoms of hyperthyroidism, and it is not known to be associated with neutropenia. It is highly unlikely metformin or insulin induced the patient's neutropenia as he has taken these medications for decades due to his chronic diabetes mellitus. Additionally, while the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia mildly fluctuated throughout this hospitalization, there was no significant change or trend away from baseline, suggesting that this was an isolated neutropenic dyscrasia.

The exact mechanism for aripiprazole-associated neutropenia is unknown, and there are not enough reported cases to establish which populations may be at risk. However, clozapine-induced agranulocytosis has been extensively studied and may partially explain the observed association in this case. Aripiprazole is like clozapine and olanzapine in that their metabolism involves the production of nitrenium ions. In clozapine studies, these nitrenium ions were shown to covalently bond with.

### Time of administration important? Morning versus evening dosing of valsartan [^112FgYDX]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) follows a circadian rhythm, with BP levels falling during sleep and increasing in the early morning hours in most individuals. In patients with hypertension, a lack of fall in night-time BP, i.e. nondipping, and/or a marked rise or surge in BP during the early morning hours, is associated with a higher incidence of stroke and an increased risk for other cardiovascular complications, especially among the elderly. This has led some researchers to recommend the dosing of antihypertensive agents in the evening or bedtime hours in patients with hypertension to preserve the normal circadian pattern of BP. An ideal antihypertensive agent would retain its efficacy throughout the 24-hour period while also effectively restoring the normal circadian BP pattern, e.g. reduction in BP at night.

Several studies with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, both agents that reduce the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) activity, have reported improvements in night-time BP and a reduction in the early morning rise in BP with bedtime dosing compared to traditional dosing upon awakening. The benefit of night-time dosing might be related to the incomplete 24-hour action of a once-daily antihypertensive when given in the morning, even though the agent is approved for single daily use. Better BP lowering with night-time dosing, however, has been reported for both short and longer-acting ACE inhibitors and ARBs, and hence it is not solely a pharmacokinetic effect.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^115x2qQ6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

This is the first update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2015. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and renin inhibitors. They are widely prescribed for the treatment of hypertension, especially for individuals with diabetes due to their postulated advantages in reducing diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread use for hypertension, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remain unclear.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in people with hypertension.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

### Sustained 24-hour blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: a high dose of a long-acting blocker is as effective as a lower dose combined with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [^114TWo8N]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Whether a higher dose of a long-acting angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) can provide as much blockade of the renin-angiotensin system over a 24-hour period as the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a lower dose of ARB has not been formally demonstrated so far.

In this randomized double-blind study, we investigated the renin-angiotensin system blockade obtained with three doses of olmesartan medoxomil (20, 40, and 80 mg every day) in 30 normal subjects and compared it with that obtained with lisinopril alone (20 mg every day) or combined with olmesartan medoxomil (20 or 40 mg). Each subject received two dose regimens for one week according to a crossover design with a one-week washout period between doses. The primary endpoint was the degree of blockade of the systolic blood pressure response to angiotensin I 24 hours after the last dose after one week of administration.

At trough, the systolic blood pressure response to exogenous angiotensin I was 58% ± 19% with 20 mg lisinopril (mean ± SD), 58% ± 11% with 20 mg olmesartan medoxomil, 62% ± 16% with 40 mg olmesartan medoxomil, and 76% ± 12% with the highest dose of olmesartan medoxomil (80 mg) (P = 0.016 versus 20 mg lisinopril and P = 0.0015 versus 20 mg olmesartan medoxomil).

With the combinations, blockade was 80% ± 22% with 20 mg lisinopril plus 20 mg olmesartan medoxomil and 83% ± 9% with 20 mg lisinopril plus 40 mg olmesartan medoxomil (P = 0.3 versus 80 mg olmesartan medoxomil alone). These data demonstrate that a higher dose of the long-acting ARB olmesartan medoxomil can produce an almost complete blockade of the systolic blood pressure response.

### Starting antihypertensive drug treatment with combination therapy: Controversies in hypertension - con side of the argument [^114iinKP]. Hypertension (2021). Low credibility.

The 2018 European guideline proposed that the combination of medications targeting multiple mechanisms, such as blocking the renin-angiotensin system and inducing vasodilatation and diuresis, reduces the heterogeneity of the blood pressure (BP) responses to initial treatment and provides a steeper dose response than is observed with escalating doses of monotherapy. Whereas this might be true during the first 6 months after starting BP-lowering treatment, this certainly does not apply to the long-term life course treatment of hypertension. A post hoc analysis of the Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-Term Use Evaluation Trial did not confirm the widely promoted notion in SPC publications that earlier short-term differences in BP lowering over the long run would reduce cardiovascular endpoints.

Furthermore, the European and International Societies of Hypertension instructions ignored that the association of multiple drugs in a single pharmaceutical formulation may have effects on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of each individual component and may lead to undesired interactions between components. The trials and observational studies reviewed in this debate article were generally not powered or had a duration not long enough to highlight serious adverse effects. As demonstrated by an observational study of patients aged 50 years or more and reflecting a real-world setting, use of SPCs was associated with a greater risk of hypotension than titrated SD free combinations.

### US hypertension management guidelines: A review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^115aJoE7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

One trial that supports the first-line status of thiazides, CCBs, and ACEIs is the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT). This trial randomized 33,357 people aged ≥ 55 years with hypertension and ≥ 1 other CVD risk factor to chlorthalidone, amlodipine, or lisinopril. All-cause mortality was not different between the groups, and while SBP was higher in the amlodipine and lisinopril groups compared with chlorthalidone, the difference was statistically but not clinically significant at 0.8 to 2 mm Hg (P < 0.05). However, there were some notable differences in secondary outcomes, like higher rates of HF in the amlodipine (10.2%) versus chlorthalidone group (7.7%). Because the primary outcome and other secondary outcomes were comparable, this was not considered by JNC 8 as a strong enough reason to recommend thiazide diuretics as the sole initial antihypertensive class.

ASH/ISH and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence make a distinction for those aged < 55 to 60 years to favor an ACEI or ARB, while those aged ≥ 55 to 60 years should start with a thiazide or CCB. β-Blockers are included as first-line for adults aged < 60 years in the Canadian Hypertension Education Program guidelines and for adults aged < 80 years in ESH/ESC. While combination therapy with β-blockers can be very effective, the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study demonstrated a lower rate of death, MI, or stroke in their losartan group compared with the atenolol group.

### Lisinopril for the treatment of hypertension within the first 24 hours of acute ischemic stroke and follow-up [^1175m1GC]. American Journal of Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Hypertension immediately after acute ischemic stroke is associated with impaired morbidity and mortality, although there are few data on antihypertensive use immediately after ictus. This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study explored the hemodynamic effect and safety of oral lisinopril initiated within 24 hours after an ictus.

- **Methods**: Forty hypertensive (systolic blood pressure [BP] ≥ 140 or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg) acute ischemic stroke patients (14 lacunar, 13 partial anterior, 7 total anterior, 6 posterior circulation infarct) were randomized to 5 mg of oral lisinopril (n = 18) or matching placebo (n = 22). The dose was increased to 10 mg (or 2 x placebo) on day 7 if casual systolic BP was ≥ 140 mm Hg and continued to day 14. After the initial dose, automated BP levels were monitored for 16 hours. The BP levels and stroke outcome measures were assessed at day 14, and all patients were followed to day 90.

- **Results**: At hour 4 after the first dose, systolic/diastolic BP change was -20 ± 21/-6 ± 10 mm Hg (mean ± SE) in the lisinopril group and 1 ± 11/0 ± 8 mmHg in the placebo group (group differences: systolic BP, P < .05; diastolic BP, P = 0.07). With a daily dosing regimen, systolic BP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), diastolic BP, and pulse pressure (PP) were significantly lower in the lisinopril group compared to the placebo group at day 14 (P < .01). Neurologic and functional measures were similar between groups at follow-up.

Lisinopril, even at small dosages, is well tolerated and an effective hypotensive agent after acute ischemic stroke.

### Familial factors in the antihypertensive response to lisinopril [^1111pWSC]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Although it is widely recognized that there are familial elements in the pathogenesis of hypertension, remarkably little is known about the influence of family history on the response to specific antihypertensive agents. This study was designed to address that issue by comparing the depressor response to lisinopril in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg in 74 patients enrolled as sibling pairs. Because all patients were treated with lisinopril, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), an objective measure not influenced by the investigators, was used to assess the primary blood pressure (BP) outcome variable.

- **Results**: Diastolic BP was highly correlated between sibling pairs at baseline (r = 0.476; P < .03) and on treatment (r = 0.524; p = 0.0021). Ethnicity/race had a striking influence on lisinopril dose and response rate. Among African American patients, 23 of 28 reached the top dose of 40 mg/day, whereas only 14 of 36 Caucasian patients reached that dose level. Among Caucasians, 92% responded, compared to only 48% of African Americans. Responders were characterized by being younger and heavier, having significantly lower microalbuminuria at baseline, higher baseline renal plasma flow (RPF), and higher urinary kallikrein.

- **Conclusion**: Among Caucasians, the presence of a hypertensive sibling predicts a striking therapeutic response to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.

### Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors versus angiotensin receptor blockers for primary hypertension [^112HdZPs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely prescribed for primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg). However, while ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in placebo-controlled trials, ARBs have not. Therefore, a comparison of the efficacies of these two drug classes in primary hypertension for preventing total mortality and cardiovascular events is important.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs on total mortality and cardiovascular events, and their rates of withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs), in people with primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the ISI Web of Science up to July 2014. We contacted study authors for missing and unpublished information, and also searched the reference lists of relevant reviews for eligible studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials enrolling people with uncontrolled or controlled primary hypertension with or without other risk factors. Included trials must have compared an ACE inhibitor and an ARB in a head-to-head manner and lasted for a duration of at least one year. If background blood pressure lowering agents were continued or added during the study, the protocol to do so must have been…

### Paramedic initiated lisinopril for acute stroke treatment (PIL-FAST): Results from the pilot randomised controlled trial [^111hfEdz]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

The protocol specified that participants receive 5–10 mg of lisinopril or matched placebo daily for 7 days. The first dose, 5 mg, was administered by a research-trained paramedic sublingually, due to the high frequency of swallowing problems in acute stroke. The 5 mg tablet was crushed in a syringe crusher with 3–5 mL of water prior to sublingual administration. Following arrival at the hospital and review of appropriateness to continue study medication, dose titration was performed. If the systolic BP remained > 150 mm Hg, a second 5 mg dose was to be administered, and a daily dose of 10 mg was prescribed. If the systolic BP was < 150 mm Hg, a second dose was not to be administered, and a daily dose of 5 mg was prescribed. If clinically significant hypotension occurred, trial medication was withheld.

- **The PIL-FAST trial pack and randomisation**: To enable paramedic access to study medication and administration equipment in the prehospital setting, boxes of medication (lisinopril or placebo, identical in appearance) and other study materials (paramedic research paperwork, syringe crusher, 5 mL syringe, 5 mL vial of water) were packaged into a 'trial pack'. Each pack carried a unique study number according to the randomisation code (intervention and control in 1:1 ratio). One pack was issued to each research-trained paramedic, carried on emergency shifts, and opened when an eligible patient consented to enter the trial. Opened packs accompanied the participant to hospital where the contents were collected by the hospital research team.

### Effects of immediate versus delayed antihypertensive therapy on outcome in the Systolic Hypertension in Europe Trial [^112aX4mq]. Journal of Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

To assess the impact of immediate versus delayed antihypertensive treatment on the outcome of older patients with isolated systolic hypertension, we extended the double-blind, placebo-controlled Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) trial by an open-label follow-up study lasting 4 years.

- **Methods**: The Syst-Eur trial included 4,695 randomized patients with a minimum age of 60 years and an untreated blood pressure of 160–219 mmHg systolic and below 95 mmHg diastolic. The double-blind trial ended following a median follow-up of 2.0 years (range 1–97 months). Of 4,409 patients still alive, 3,517 received open-label treatment consisting of nitrendipine (10–40 mg daily) with the possible addition of enalapril (5–20 mg daily), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5–25 mg daily), or both add-on drugs. Non-participants (n = 892) were also followed up.

- **Results**: Median follow-up increased to 6.1 years. Systolic pressure decreased to below 150 mmHg (target level) in 2,628 participants (75.0%). During the 4-year open-label follow-up, stroke and cardiovascular complications occurred at similar frequencies in patients formerly randomized to placebo and those continuing active treatment. These rates were similar to those previously observed in the active-treatment group during the double-blind trial. Considering the total follow-up of 4,695 randomized patients, immediate compared with delayed antihypertensive treatment reduced the occurrence of stroke and cardiovascular complications by 28% (P = 0.01) and 15% (P = 0.03), respectively, with a similar tendency for total mortality (13%, P = 0.09).

### Selective inhibition of the C-domain of ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) combined with inhibition of NEP (neprilysin): A potential new therapy for hypertension [^115fCzwq]. Hypertension (2021). Low credibility.

We developed a C-domain-selective derivative of lisinopril (lisinopril-tryptophan [lisW-S]) by substituting a tryptophan for the P2' proline. In TtRhRen mice (LinA3), a model of Ang II–dependent hypertension, lisW-S effectively reduced Ang II levels and lowered BP without influencing BK levels. The effect of lisW-S combined with a NEP inhibitor could have the same beneficial effects as omapatrilat but without the undesirable properties attributed to BK accumulation. We, therefore, hypothesized that this new combination would reduce BP, improve cardiovascular function, and reduce Ang II levels without affecting BK levels. To gain a better understanding of the systematic actions of this combined treatment, we compared its effects to sacubitril, lisinopril (which inhibits ACE C- and N-domains), lisinopril+sacubitril, and omapatrilat (which inhibits ACE C- and N-domains).

### Low doses vs. high doses of the angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor lisinopril in chronic heart failure: a cost-effectiveness analysis based on the Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival (ATLAS) study. The ATLAS study group [^112ozrTw]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2000). High credibility.

A cost-effectiveness analysis of high and low doses of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril was conducted in the treatment of chronic heart failure. This analysis utilized data from a randomized controlled trial, ATLAS, involving 3,164 patients with chronic heart failure. Participants were allocated to a high-dose strategy (daily target dose of 32.5–35 mg) or a low-dose strategy (daily target dose of 2.5–5.0 mg) of lisinopril.

Differential costs were derived from resource use data collected in the trial and calculated using UK unit costs. The cost-effectiveness analysis related differential costs to differential life-years over a 4-year trial follow-up period.

The results indicated that the mean total number of hospital in-patient days per patient was 18.5 in the high-dose group and 22.5 in the low-dose group. Throughout the trial's duration, the mean (S.D.) daily dose of lisinopril in the high-dose group was 22.5 mg (15.7 mg), in contrast to 3.2 mg (2.5 mg) in the low-dose group. The mean difference in cost per patient was £397 lower in the high-dose group, with a 95% confidence interval [CI (high-dose-low-dose)] ranging from -£1,263 to £436. Mean life-years per patient were 0.085 years higher in the high-dose group, with a 95% CI of -0.0074 to 0.1706.

Based on the mean costs and life-years, high-dose therapy dominates low-dose therapy as it is less costly and more effective. Allowing for uncertainty in mean costs and life-years, there is an 82% probability that high-dose therapy is less costly than low-dose therapy. If a decision-maker is willing to pay at least £3,600 per life-year gained, the probability…

### Pulse pressure lowering effect of dual blockade with candesartan and lisinopril vs. high-dose ACE inhibition in hypertensive type 2 diabetic subjects: a CALM II study post-hoc analysis [^114LtH85]. American Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Elevated pulse pressure (PP) is strongly associated with micro- and macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetic patients. We examined the effect of 12 months of dual blockade with candesartan and lisinopril versus high-dose lisinopril monotherapy on ambulatory PP in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients from the CALM (Candesartan and Lisinopril Microalbuminuria Trial) II study.

- **Methods**: The CALM II study was a 12-month prospective, randomized, parallel-group, double-masked study that included 75 type 1 and type 2 diabetic subjects with hypertension. Participants were randomized for treatment with either high-dose lisinopril (40 mg once daily (o.d.)) or dual blockade treatment with candesartan (16 mg o.d.) and lisinopril (20 mg o.d.). In this article, we present data from the post-hoc subgroup of 51 type 2 diabetic subjects who completed the full 12-month study period with successful ambulatory blood pressure (BP) measurements at both baseline and follow-up visits.

- **Results**: Baseline 24-hour BP values were similar in the two groups (24-hour systolic BP (SBP) 130 ± 12 vs. 127 ± 9, 24-hour diastolic BP (DBP) 77 ± 8 vs. 74 ± 7, and 24-hour PP 53 ± 8 vs. 53 ± 7 mm Hg, for the lisinopril and dual blockade groups, respectively, P > 0.2 for all). Compared with lisinopril monotherapy, dual blockade treatment caused a highly significant reduction in 24-hour PP levels (-5 ± 5 mm Hg, P = 0.003), although the difference in the BP lowering effect between the treatment groups did not differ significantly for 24-hour systolic (P = 0.21) or diastolic (P = 0.49) BP.

### Comparison of candesartan with lisinopril on ambulatory blood pressure and morning surge in patients with systemic hypertension [^114o92Hj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

We performed a prospective crossover study in 73 essential hypertensives to compare the effects of candesartan and lisinopril on ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and early-morning BP. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory BP monitoring was performed at baseline and for each active treatment. Small doses of thiazide diuretic were added as needed.

The effects of both drugs on 24-hour BP were almost identical and satisfactory. When we classified patients into the morning surge group (the highest quartile of morning systolic BP surge > 36 mm Hg) and the non-morning surge group (the remaining three quartiles of morning BP surge), candesartan was superior in decreasing morning BP and morning BP surge.

### Long-term renoprotective effect of nisoldipine and lisinopril in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy [^115MtrYd]. Diabetes Care (2000). Low credibility.

To compare the long-term effect on kidney function of a long-acting calcium antagonist (nisoldipine) versus a long-acting ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) in hypertensive type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy, we performed a 4-year prospective, randomized, double-dummy controlled study. We compared nisoldipine (20–40 mg once a day) with lisinopril (10–20 mg once a day), with the study being double-blinded for the first year and single-blinded thereafter. The study included 51 hypertensive type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy; however, three patients dropped out during the first month. Results for the remaining 48 patients are presented below.

At baseline, the two groups were comparable: the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 85 ± 5 and 85 ± 6 mL × min⁻¹ × 1.73 m⁻². The mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure was 108 ± 3 and 105 ± 2 mmHg, and albuminuria was 1,554 mg/24 h (95% CI 980–2,465) and 1,033 mg/24 h (760–1,406) in the lisinopril and nisoldipine groups, respectively.

- **Results**:
	- Mean 24-hour arterial blood pressure during the study did not differ between the lisinopril and nisoldipine groups, at 100 ± 2 and 103 ± 1 mmHg, respectively.
	- The time course of albuminuria differed significantly between groups (P < 0.001). While the initiation of treatment with lisinopril resulted in a reduction from baseline albuminuria by 52% (95% CI 14–73), albuminuria in the nisoldipine group did not change throughout the study.
	- GFR declined in a biphasic manner with an initial (0–6 months) reduction of 1.3 ± 0.3 mL × min⁻¹ × month⁻¹ in the lisinopril group.

These findings highlight the differential impact of lisinopril and nisoldipine on kidney function and albuminuria in this patient population.

### Comparison of the effects of omapatrilat and lisinopril on circulating neurohormones and cytokines in patients with chronic heart failure [^1134GmCm]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors exert their effects by modulating the neurohumoral milieu. Vasopeptidase inhibitors (VPI) are both ACE and neutral endopeptidase inhibitors and may increase natriuretic peptides, bradykinin, and perhaps endothelin-1 in patients with congestive heart failure. Patients (n = 107) with ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy, New York Heart Association functional class II to III, with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%, and on ACE inhibitor therapy were randomized to either the VPI omapatrilat 40 mg/day or the ACE inhibitor lisinopril 20 mg/day.

- **Trough levels of neurohormones**: Assessed 24 hours after dosing at baseline, and at 12 and 24 weeks of follow-up. C-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide (C-ANP) levels decreased with lisinopril (p = 0.035), but not with omapatrilat. In contrast, N-terminal ANP levels did not change, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels tended to decrease similarly in both groups.

- **Endothelin-1 levels**: Increased in both groups, the increase reaching statistical significance with omapatrilat (p = 0.008). Levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 tended to decrease, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 increased in both groups, with statistical significance only for interleukin-10 with omapatrilat therapy.

- **Catecholamines and angiotensin II**: Neither agent changed these levels. Thus, even at trough levels, omapatrilat potentiates C-ANP more than lisinopril. Potentially important effects of omapatrilat on endothelin-1 and anti-inflammatory cytokines were identified, providing potential explanations for the observed outcomes.
