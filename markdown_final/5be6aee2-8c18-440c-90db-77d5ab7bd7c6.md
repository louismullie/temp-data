## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to approach the workup of diarrhea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify diarrhea by duration and severity. Then, I should verify the initial history and physical examination priorities. Next, I will review first-line laboratory testing for acute and chronic presentations. After that, I need to check indications for stool testing and the role of culture-independent panels. Then, I will examine when to escalate to endoscopy and imaging. I should also consider special populations and red flags. Finally, I will integrate management principles and follow-up, ensuring each step aligns with guideline-backed evidence and correcting any inconsistencies as I go along.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework, because everything downstream depends on getting this right. Diarrhea is defined as three or more loose or liquid stools in 24 hours, with acute lasting less than 14 days, prolonged 14–29 days, and chronic 30 days or longer, and I should also categorize severity by dehydration, fever, dysentery, and systemic toxicity to guide testing and treatment decisions [^1125KSJb].

> Wait, let me verify the initial assessment priorities before ordering tests. A careful history should characterize stool form and frequency, nocturnal occurrence, blood or mucus, volume, urgency, incontinence, diet, medications including antibiotics and laxatives, travel, animal or childcare exposures, sexual history, and comorbidities, while the physical exam focuses on hydration status, vitals, abdominal findings, and extraintestinal clues such as weight loss, rash, arthralgia, or thyroid signs, because these elements rapidly narrow the differential and determine risk [^112XuboH] [^116YLzzu].

> I will now examine first-line laboratory testing for acute diarrhea. I should confirm that most immunocompetent patients with mild, nonbloody, watery diarrhea do not require labs beyond supportive care, but when indicated, a CBC with differential can help assess severity and inflammatory tone, and electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, and glucose support dehydration and comorbidity assessment; I need to ensure I do not over-order serologies that won't change management in acute infectious diarrhea [^114MD6uR] [^1139WpoV] [^112XuboH].

> Hold on, I should verify stool testing indications for acute diarrhea so I don't miss high-yield scenarios. Testing is warranted for dysentery, moderate to severe disease, persistent symptoms beyond about a week, immunocompromise, recent antibiotics or healthcare exposure, outbreaks, high-risk occupations, travel to high-risk regions, and when results will alter management; restricting to these contexts improves diagnostic yield and stewardship [^116CuDrD] [^1148R2pr] [^112taLBZ].

> Let me consider the optimal stool specimen and testing modalities. A diarrheal stool sample that conforms to the container is preferred, with rectal swabs acceptable if timely stool is unobtainable. Culture-independent multiplex panels can broaden detection of bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens and should be interpreted in clinical context because they detect nucleic acids rather than viable organisms, and targeted culture remains important when susceptibility will influence care or public health action [^1156wEs2] [^1135EwHG] [^113K9Et9].

> I should double-check specific acute-pathogen considerations. For suspected Shiga toxin–producing E. coli, I need to order Shiga toxin or gene detection and avoid empiric antibiotics due to HUS risk. For cholera risk, I should add Vibrio testing. For C. difficile, I should test patients with healthcare-associated diarrhea or recent antibiotic use. And in immunocompromised hosts, I should broaden to culture, viral studies, and parasite evaluation given the wide differential [^112nS66C] [^117SFMqP] [^113iRdjj] [^1152cwfm].

> Next, I should review first-line testing for chronic diarrhea, and I need to ensure I do not jump to conclusions. Basic blood tests should include CBC, electrolytes, renal and hepatic panels, TSH, celiac serology with total IgA, and iron studies. Stool tests should include fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin to screen for colonic inflammation, C. difficile in new-onset diarrhea regardless of antibiotic history, and selective ova and parasite testing when risk factors exist. Fecal immunochemical testing can help triage further workup when rectal bleeding is absent [^116YLzzu] [^112Td3Ns] [^112XTkXf].

> But wait, what if the patient is young with suspected IBD and I want to avoid unnecessary colonoscopy. I should confirm that fecal calprotectin is a useful rule-out test in patients under 40 with suspected IBD, and I should avoid using ESR or CRP alone to screen for IBD in chronic diarrhea, as these are less specific and can be misleading in isolation [^114oH5gi] [^111oktFQ].

> I will now examine when to escalate to endoscopy, and I need to ensure I match the modality to the pretest probability. For chronic unexplained diarrhea, colonoscopy with intubation of the terminal ileum and multiple biopsies from the right and left colon is recommended to evaluate for IBD, microscopic colitis, and neoplasia; flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsies is reasonable when colonoscopy is contraindicated or when left-sided disease is suspected; EGD with duodenal biopsies is indicated for suspected malabsorption or positive celiac serology; and in immunocompromised patients with persistent diarrhea, sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy with biopsies is appropriate when labs are nondiagnostic [^112gFkx1] [^116eX8sV] [^117Kv6jL] [^1114SUAV].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of video capsule endoscopy and cross-sectional imaging so I don't overuse them. Video capsule endoscopy is not recommended for routine chronic diarrhea evaluation but may be considered after negative upper and lower endoscopy with ongoing suspicion of small-bowel disease; MR enterography or CT enterography are preferred for suspected fistulizing disease or when small-bowel anatomy is needed, and traditional barium studies should be avoided [^114NeMRB] [^111XjhNm] [^115vRRBH].

> Let me think about special populations and red flags, because missing these has consequences. In elderly patients, I should maintain a high index for ischemic colitis, NSAID-related injury, diverticular segmental colitis, malignancy, and microscopic colitis. In patients with HIV, severity thresholds for admission and empiric IV antibiotics are lower. In suspected graft-versus-host disease, flexible sigmoidoscopy with distal biopsies is the initial endoscopic test. And in travelers with persistent symptoms, I should consider post-infectious IBS and other GI diseases after treating infection [^112R8rog] [^115zja2c] [^113f58i9] [^116zAqZn].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought endoscopy is not recommended for persistent symptoms between 14 and 30 days with a negative stool workup, but I should verify that nuance. The ACG advises that endoscopic evaluation is not routinely recommended in this window when stool studies are negative, yet if alarm features are present or symptoms progress, targeted endoscopy may still be appropriate; I need to ensure I individualize based on risk and evolving findings rather than apply a blanket rule [^113qkdVk] [^111FSJ4D].

> Next, I should review management principles and ensure I align with guideline strength. For acute watery diarrhea, oral rehydration is first-line and loperamide is reasonable in adults without dysentery, while empiric antibiotics are generally discouraged unless the patient is ill-appearing, has severe inflammatory features, or is a traveler with high fever. For bloody diarrhea, I should avoid empiric antibiotics if STEC is suspected and treat only when indicated by confirmed pathogens. For chronic diarrhea, management is etiology-specific, with symptomatic therapy and dietary strategies as needed while the workup proceeds [^112XuboH] [^117NPL7v] [^112YEmNY] [^115aSody].

> I should confirm follow-up and safety-netting steps. Persistent symptoms beyond 10–14 days warrant re-evaluation of fluids and electrolytes, nutrition, and reconsideration of the differential including noninfectious causes. In patients recovering from HUS, regular follow-up of renal function, anemia, and thrombocytopenia is advised until normalization. And in suspected outbreaks or high-risk occupational exposures, coordination with public health and broader pathogen testing are essential [^111pT2PA] [^112Mr8D9] [^113KxSyB] [^116ttxDz].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency and guideline concordance. Classify by duration and severity, prioritize history and exam, reserve stool testing for indicated scenarios with attention to specimen quality and panel interpretation, escalate to endoscopy for chronic or alarm-feature presentations with age- and risk-tailored strategies, avoid low-yield imaging or serologies, and manage supportively while targeting therapy to identified causes, adjusting the course if new data emerge [^1125KSJb] [^112XuboH] [^112gFkx1].

---

The diarrhea workup should be guided by duration, severity, and alarm features [^112XuboH]. For **acute diarrhea (< 14 days)**, focus on hydration and selective testing if severe, bloody, persistent, or high risk [^116CuDrD]; use stool PCR or culture for bacterial pathogens, C. difficile testing after antibiotics, and ova/parasites for travel or immunocompromise [^113KF55P] [^113iRdjj]. For **chronic diarrhea (≥ 4 weeks)**, obtain CBC, electrolytes, TSH, celiac serology, and stool calprotectin/lactoferrin; if positive or alarm features exist, proceed to colonoscopy with biopsies for IBD, microscopic colitis, or neoplasia [^116YLzzu] [^112Td3Ns] [^1136UkmR]. Reserve EGD with duodenal biopsies for malabsorption or positive celiac serology [^112gFkx1], and use imaging (CT/MRI) for suspected obstruction, fistulae, or abscess [^113J7ZZr]. Most cases are self-limited; avoid overtesting and tailor to clinical context [^112tmtT6].

---

## Initial clinical assessment

### History

- **Onset and duration**: Acute (< 14 days) vs chronic (≥ 4 weeks) [^116YLzzu].
- **Stool characteristics**: Watery, fatty, bloody, mucus, nocturnal, urgency, incontinence [^116Si5YT].
- **Associated symptoms**: Fever, abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea/vomiting [^112XuboH].
- **Risk factors**: Travel, antibiotics, immunocompromise, family history of IBD/colon cancer, diet, medications, stress [^1126MvG2].

---

### Physical examination

Assess **hydration status** — including signs of dehydration — and perform an abdominal and rectal examination to evaluate for masses, tenderness, or occult blood [^112XuboH].

---

## Categorization of diarrhea

| **Category** | **Characteristics** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|-|
| Watery | - Large volume <br/> - No blood <br/> - No fat | - viral gastroenteritis <br/> - IBS <br/> - medications <br/> - osmotic diarrhea [^116Si5YT] |
| Fatty | - Greasy <br/> - Difficult to flush <br/> - Oil droplets | - malabsorption <br/> - celiac disease <br/> - exocrine pancreatic insufficiency <br/> - SIBO [^notfound] |
| Inflammatory | - blood <br/> - mucus <br/> - fever <br/> - abdominal pain | - IBD <br/> - infectious colitis <br/> - ischemic colitis [^112R8rog] |

## Diagnostic testing

### Acute diarrhea

#### Indications for testing

Testing is indicated for **severe dehydration, bloody stools, persistent symptoms (> 7 days), immunocompromise, recent antibiotic use, travel to high-risk areas, outbreak suspicion, or high-risk occupations (healthcare, food handlers)** [^1148R2pr] [^116ttxDz].

---

#### Recommended tests

- **Stool studies**: Culture, C. difficile toxin, ova and parasites, fecal leukocytes, Shiga toxin (if EHEC suspected) [^112nS66C].
- **Molecular testing**: Multiplex PCR panels for bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens [^1135EwHG].
- **Blood tests**: CBC, electrolytes, renal function (generally not for etiology but useful clinically) [^1139WpoV].

---

### Chronic diarrhea

#### Initial laboratory tests

- **Blood tests**: CBC, electrolytes, renal function, TSH, celiac serology (tTG-IgA with total IgA), fasting glucose, calcium, phosphate, liver enzymes [^116YLzzu].
- **Stool tests**: Calprotectin or lactoferrin (screen for IBD), C. difficile, ova and parasites, fecal fat (qualitative or quantitative) [^112Td3Ns] [^112R8rog].

---

#### Indications for endoscopy

- **Colonoscopy with biopsies**: Chronic diarrhea with positive calprotectin, alarm features (weight loss, anemia, nocturnal symptoms, family history of IBD/colon cancer), suspected IBD, microscopic colitis, or neoplasia [^1136UkmR] [^116eX8sV].
- **Upper endoscopy (EGD)**: Suspected malabsorption, positive celiac serology, or unexplained steatorrhea [^112gFkx1] [^117Kv6jL].
- **Video capsule endoscopy**: Small bowel disease suspected after negative upper and lower endoscopy [^111XjhNm].

---

#### Imaging studies

Imaging with **CT or MRI** is indicated for suspected obstruction, fistulae, abscess, or structural abnormalities, while **MR enterography** is preferred for small bowel evaluation in IBD or malabsorption [^113J7ZZr].

---

## Special considerations

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Broad stool testing for bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens; consider endoscopy early [^1152cwfm].
- **Traveler's diarrhea**: Test for bacterial pathogens, parasites; consider post-infectious IBS if persistent [^116zAqZn].
- **Elderly patients**: Higher suspicion for colorectal cancer, ischemic colitis, microscopic colitis [^112R8rog].

---

## Management principles

Management centers on **supportive care** — rehydration with oral or IV fluids and correction of electrolyte abnormalities — and etiologic therapy tailored to the identified cause, including antibiotics for bacterial infections, immunosuppression for IBD, and dietary modifications for malabsorption. Empiric therapy may be used when the diagnosis is unclear or to control symptoms (e.g. loperamide, bile acid binders) [^112XuboH] [^113uFvCT].

---

A structured approach to diarrhea — categorizing by duration and features, using selective testing, and escalating to endoscopy or imaging when indicated — ensures accurate diagnosis and efficient care.

### Chronic diarrhea as the presenting feature of primary systemic AL amyloidosis: serendipity or delayed diagnosis? [^11181KiW]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic diarrhea in adults is a common symptom with a wide range of underlying etiologies. Although various strategies have been proposed for evaluation, there are still cases with undetermined origins even after extensive workup. Amyloidosis with gastrointestinal (GI) involvement is one of the causes that should be considered in adult patients with chronic diarrhea. We report a case of primary systemic amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, presenting initially as chronic diarrhea and weight loss.

Case presentation

A 43-year-old man with chronic diarrhea and weight loss was referred to our hospital. Prior to his presentation, extensive evaluation including an exploratory laparotomy was carried out and did not yield any valuable findings. An echocardiography performed after repeated episodes of orthostatic hypotension revealed infiltrative cardiomyopathy. Moreover, biopsies of the terminal ileum revealed amyloid deposition confirmed by Congo Red staining. Finally, a diagnosis of systemic AL amyloidosis was made after hematological workup. Anti-plasma cell therapy did ameliorate his GI symptoms.

Conclusion

Although amyloidosis with GI involvement is a rare cause of chronic diarrhea, it should be considered especially in patients with intestinal malabsorption and extra-GI manifestations, such as orthostatic hypotension. The delayed diagnosis in the present case highlights the importance of recognizing clinical "red flags" not seemingly related to one another, and underscores the need to get intestinal biopsies even with normal endoscopic appearance of the mucosa.

### Functional diarrhea [^116UGKP7]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea is a frequent and challenging problem in clinical medicine. In a considerable subgroup of these, no underlying cause is identified and this is referred to as functional diarrhea. A consensus definition for functional diarrhea is based on loose stool consistency and chronicity and absence of coexisting irritable bowel syndrome. Underlying pathophysiology includes rapid intestinal transit, which may be worsened by stress or be triggered by a preceding infectious gastroenteritis. Diagnostic work-up aims at exclusion of underlying organic disease. Treatment starts with dietary adjustments, aiming at decreasing nutrients that enhance transit and stool and at identifying precipitating food items.

### Acute bloody diarrhea: a medical emergency for patients of all ages [^115MSYwf]. Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute bloody diarrhea should be considered a medical emergency. Its causes are frequently serious or actionable or both and are usually identified. However, acute bloody diarrhea as a stand-alone clinical presentation has received little scholarly attention in the past several decades. Although the range of possible causes of acute bloody diarrhea is broad, infectious considerations are paramount and should always be prioritized in the evaluation of such patients. History, examination, and laboratory testing should be focused on minimizing time to diagnosis (and, by extension, to implementing appropriate therapy). Strategically chosen tests and imaging, avoidance of extraneous diagnostic pursuits, and provision of supportive care while awaiting diagnostic clarity are central to the adroit management of patients with acute bloody diarrhea. Diagnostic considerations differ somewhat between adults and children but have many elements in common, including the need for vigilance in detecting Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection. In this review, we discuss diagnostic approaches (emphasizing the importance of rapid, accurate, and thorough microbiologic investigation) and measures that can be taken to support patients while awaiting information that determines the cause of their disease. These topics are discussed in the context of the medical care that is available to children and adults with bloody diarrhea in most institutions in developed nations.

### Acute diarrhea in adults [^112XuboH]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute diarrheal disease accounts for 179 million outpatient visits annually in the United States. Diarrhea can be categorized as inflammatory or noninflammatory, and both types have infectious and noninfectious causes. Infectious noninflammatory diarrhea is often viral in etiology and is the most common presentation; however, bacterial causes are also common and may be related to travel or foodborne illness. History for patients with acute diarrhea should include onset and frequency of symptoms, stool character, a focused review of systems including fever and other symptoms, and evaluation of exposures and risk factors. The physical examination should include evaluation for signs of dehydration, sepsis, or potential surgical processes. Most episodes of acute diarrhea in countries with adequate food and water sanitation are uncomplicated and self-limited, requiring only an initial evaluation and supportive treatment. Additional diagnostic evaluation and management may be warranted when diarrhea is bloody or mucoid or when risk factors are present, including immunocompromise or recent hospitalization. Unless an outbreak is suspected, molecular studies are preferred over traditional stool cultures. In all cases, management begins with replacing water, electrolytes, and nutrients. Oral rehydration is preferred; however, signs of severe dehydration or sepsis warrant intravenous rehydration. Antidiarrheal agents can be symptomatic therapy for acute watery diarrhea and can help decrease inappropriate antibiotic use. Empiric antibiotics are rarely warranted, except in sepsis and some cases of travelers' or inflammatory diarrhea. Targeted antibiotic therapy may be appropriate following microbiologic stool assessment. Hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, and food and water safety measures are integral to preventing infectious diarrheal illnesses.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of patients with diarrhea [^1114SUAV]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Diarrhea endoscopy — recommendations (additional evaluations) specify that video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is not recommended for the routine evaluation of chronic diarrhea. In patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and diarrhea, we suggest either flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy if laboratory evaluation is nondiagnostic, and in the absence of a diagnosis on flexible sigmoidoscopy, we recommend a full colonoscopy with biopsy and/or esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy for HIV patients with persistent diarrhea. In patients with suspected graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and diarrhea, we suggest flexible sigmoidoscopy with distal colon biopsies as the initial endoscopic evaluation, and in the event of negative colonic histology findings or when upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms predominate, we recommend an EGD with biopsies.

### Chronic diarrhea as the presenting feature of primary systemic AL amyloidosis: serendipity or delayed diagnosis? [^113atKe3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic diarrhea is common with a prevalence of 3% to 5% in the general population. The major causes of chronic diarrhea can be assessed by combining a patient's history and characteristic of the stool (inflammatory, fatty or watery). The differential diagnosis covers a wide range of diseases from common encountered entities such as chronic infection, inflammatory bowel disease, laxative abuse, and irritable bowel syndrome to rare disorders. Guidelines recommend categorizing chronic diarrhea as osmotic, inflammatory, secretory or motile, which help focus the diagnosis and further tests. Despite careful evaluation of the differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea, physicians can sometimes fail to recognize the cause. In this case, physicians should take into consideration causes less frequent or even rare diseases. In the present report, a case of primary AL amyloidosis with GI involvement presented as chronic diarrhea and weight loss. Although similar conditions have been reported scantly, none of them was initially diagnosed via random intestine biopsy, and with a detailed therapeutic follow-up.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of patients with diarrhea [^111FSJ4D]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Immunocompetent host — initial approach to acute diarrhea specifies that infectious diarrheal illnesses in otherwise healthy individuals are common and short-lived and rarely require specific therapy, therefore endoscopy is not warranted for the initial evaluation of acute diarrhea. An endoscopic evaluation should be considered for patients with persistent symptoms, inconclusive diagnosis after routine blood and stool tests, or failure to respond to empirical therapy.

### Chronic unexplained diarrhea: a logical and cost-effective approach to assessment [^112ybPBR]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The workup of chronic unexplained diarrhea can be equally frustrating for care providers and patients. It carries a physical, financial, and social toll. In this review we provide a sensible approach to evaluating and managing chronic diarrhea.

Recent Findings

Bile acid diarrhea is becoming increasingly recognized as a potential cause behind some cases of chronic diarrhea.

Summary

A detailed history and physical examination can provide clues that guide a logical approach to the evaluation. We suggest a cost-effective approach to the workup and management of chronic diarrhea based on individual patient factors related to clinical history and physical exam. We find that this approach leads to initiation of treatment in a time-efficient fashion and avoids unnecessary testing.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^115KAQ4R]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Adult acute diarrhea — management algorithm begins with passage of ≥ 3 unformed stools in 24 h plus an enteric symptom and then triages by syndrome and severity. For watery diarrhea with mild illness, management is hydration only and patients may use loperamide 4 mg initially to control stooling. For watery illness with no or low-grade fever (≤ 100°F), consider ≤ 48 h of loperamide therapy. For dysenteric diarrhea with no or low-grade fever (≤ 100°F), it specifies microbiologic assessment, then anti-microbial agent directed to cause for all but STEC infection. In severe illness with fever (≥ 101°F) in a single case (not outbreak), listed actions include to consider microbiologic assessment and empiric treatment with Azithromycin 1 g in single dose OR 500 mg once daily for 3 days. Persistent diarrhea (14–30 days) should be worked up by culture and/or culture-independent microbiologic assessment, then treated with an anti-microbial agent directed to cause.

### Appropriateness of colonoscopy in Europe (EPAGE II). Chronic diarrhea and known inflammatory bowel disease [^116PEMmG]. Endoscopy (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

To summarize the published literature on assessment of appropriateness of colonoscopy for investigation of chronic diarrhea, management of patients with known inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and for colorectal cancer (CRC) surveillance in such patients, and to report report appropriateness criteria developed by an expert panel, the 2008 European Panel on the Appropriateness of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, EPAGE II.

Methods

A systematic search of guidelines, systematic reviews, and primary studies regarding the evaluation of chronic diarrhea, the management of IBD, and colorectal cancer surveillance in IBD was performed. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was applied to develop appropriateness criteria for colonoscopy for these conditions.

Results

According to the literature, colonoscopic evaluation may be justified for patients aged > 50 years with recent-onset chronic diarrhea or with alarm symptoms. Surveillance colonoscopy for CRC should be offered to all patients with extensive ulcerative colitis or colonic Crohn's disease of 8 years' duration, and to all patients with less extensive disease of 15 years' duration. Intervals for surveillance colonoscopy depend on duration of evolution, initial diagnosis, and histological findings. The EPAGE II criteria also confirmed the appropriateness of diagnostic colonoscopy for diarrhea of > 4 weeks' duration. They also suggest that, in addition to assessing extent of IBD by colonoscopy, further colonoscopic examination is appropriate in the face of persistent or worsening symptoms. Surveillance colonoscopy in IBD patients was generally appropriate after a lapse of 2 years. In the presence of dysplasia at previous colonoscopy, it was not only appropriate but necessary.

Conclusions

Despite or perhaps because of the limitations of the available published studies, the panel-based EPAGE II (http://www.epage.ch) criteria can help guide appropriate colonoscopy use in the absence of strong evidence from the literature.

Empiric management of infectious diarrhea — bloody diarrhea indications and agents: In immunocompetent children and adults, empiric antimicrobial therapy for bloody diarrhea while waiting for results of investigations is not recommended (strong, low), except for infants < 3 months of age with suspicion of bacterial etiology, ill immunocompetent people with fever documented in a medical setting, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and bacillary dysentery presumptively due to Shigella, and people who have recently traveled internationally with body temperatures ≥ 38.5°C and/or signs of sepsis (weak, low). In adults, empiric antimicrobial therapy should be either a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin, or azithromycin, depending on the local susceptibility patterns and travel history (strong, moderate). Empiric therapy for children includes a third-generation cephalosporin for infants < 3 months of age and others with neurologic involvement, or azithromycin, depending on local susceptibility patterns and travel history (strong, moderate). Empiric antibacterial treatment should be considered in immunocompromised people with severe illness and bloody diarrhea (strong, low). Asymptomatic contacts of people with bloody diarrhea should not be offered empiric treatment and should be advised to follow appropriate infection prevention and control measures (strong, moderate). People with clinical features of sepsis who are suspected of having enteric fever should be treated empirically with broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy after blood, stool, and urine culture collection (strong, low).

ACG Clinical Guideline — epidemiology/public health and diagnosis: Diagnostic evaluation using stool culture and culture-independent methods if available should be used in situations where the individual patient is at high risk of spreading disease to others, and during known or suspected outbreaks. Stool diagnostic studies may be of value in cases of dysentery, moderate-to-severe disease, and symptoms lasting > 7 days to clarify the etiology of the patient's illness and enable specific directed therapy. Traditional methods of diagnosis fail to reveal the etiology of the majority of cases of acute diarrheal infection; if available, the use of FDA-approved culture-independent methods of diagnosis can be recommended at least as an adjunct to traditional methods. Antibiotic sensitivity testing for management of the individual with acute diarrheal infection is currently not recommended.

### Imaging of pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^1154WACr]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this review is to examine the current imaging literature and develop basic imaging guidelines for evaluation of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The three following typical clinical scenarios in the imaging evaluation of IBD are considered: patient with an initial diagnosis of suspected IBD, the goals being to determine disease extent and severity and to differentiate Crohn disease from ulcerative colitis; patient with known IBD presenting with new acute symptoms (fever, peritonitis, leukocytosis) requiring urgent evaluation; and patient with known IBD presenting with nonacute symptomatic recurrence (abdominal pain, diarrhea), the goals being to assess the efficacy of the current treatment and to evaluate the possible need for additional medical or surgical intervention.

Conclusion

Imaging of pediatric patients with IBD must balance considerations of diagnostic accuracy against concerns about patient exposure to ionizing radiation and tolerance of the imaging technique. The imaging modality chosen depends on the clinical presentation and expected pathologic finding.

### Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome… [^115aSody]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

DIETARY THERAPY Reported dietary triggers of IBS include caffeine, citrus, corn, dairy lactose, wheat, and wheat gluten. Lactose and caffeine, in particular, may be associated with diarrhea-predominant IBS. 1 Food diaries are recommended because they may help patients identify and avoid dietary triggers. Although one study showed a reduction of IBS symptoms in 48 percent of patients on an elimination diet, 6 other specific diets have not been effective, and few studies have been done. A complicating factor is that patients may experience symptoms as a generalized effect to eating any foods. Increasing dietary fiber has long been recommended as a treatment for IBS. The proposed mechanism of action is the enhancement of the stool's water-holding properties, gel formation to provide lubrication, bulking of the stool, and binding of agents such as bile.

7 A systematic review 8 of 13 randomized controlled trials found no convincing evidence that bulking agents relieve global symptoms of IBS. However, a second systematic review 9 did find significant improvement in the ease of stool passage and in general satisfaction with bowel movements. ANTIDIARRHEAL AGENTS A systematic review 9 of loperamide for the treatment of IBS found that it improved diarrhea symptoms; two of the four studies in the review also reported improved global symptoms. Loperamide slows intestinal transit, increases intestinal water absorption, and increases resting sphincter tone. 12 Because loperamide does not cross the blood-brain barrier, side effects are less than other opioids, but it should be used with caution. 13 The successful use of low doses supports a mechanism of action separate from the recognized psychiatric effects.

14 It is thought that tricyclic antidepressants facilitate endogenous endorphin release and block norepinephrine reuptake, which leads to enhancement of descending inhibitory pathways blockage of the pain neuromodulator serotonin. 15 Tricyclic antidepressants may slow intestinal transit time and aid in the treatment of diarrhea. PSYCHOTHERAPY A variety of psychotherapies, including cognitive behavior therapy, hypnosis, and stress management/relaxation therapy, reduce abdominal pain and diarrhea. 18 For example, in one study 19 patients were more likely to experience a significant benefit with cognitive behavior therapy than education. Psychotherapies should be considered for motivated patients who have more severe or disabling symptoms.

### Pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of chronic watery diarrhea [^1174bXkA]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic watery diarrhea poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge and is often a disabling condition for patients. Although acute diarrhea is likely to be caused by infection, the causes of chronic diarrhea (> 4 weeks in duration) are more elusive. We review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic diarrhea. Drawing on recent insights into the molecular mechanisms of intestinal epithelial transport and barrier function, we discuss how diarrhea can result from a decrease in luminal solute absorption, an increase in secretion, or both, as well as derangements in barrier properties. We also describe the various extraepithelial factors that activate diarrheal mechanisms. Finally, clinical evaluation and tests used in the assessment of patients presenting with chronic diarrhea are reviewed, and an algorithm guiding therapeutic decisions and pharmacotherapy is presented.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^117NPL7v]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — empiric antimicrobial therapy for acute and persistent watery diarrhea is generally discouraged: in most people with acute watery diarrhea and without recent international travel, empiric antimicrobial therapy is not recommended (strong, low), with an exception that may be made in people who are ill-appearing, and empiric treatment should be avoided in people with persistent watery diarrhea lasting 14 days or more (strong, low). Asymptomatic contacts of people with acute or persistent watery diarrhea should not be offered empiric or preventive therapy, but should be advised to follow appropriate infection prevention and control measures (strong, moderate). Features suggesting inflammatory infection that warrant investigation include high fever, significant abdominal pain, and duration > 3 days, and given the relatively small benefit of empiric treatment (1 day shorter illness on average) and the likelihood of viral infection in the absence of inflammatory signs, empiric treatment cannot be recommended and may be potentially harmful.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of inflammatory bowel disease in elderly patients: expert review [^112R8rog]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in elderly patients — initial evaluation and differential: When elderly persons present with symptoms such as diarrhea, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and weight loss, providers should have a strong clinical suspicion for IBD, but compared with persons younger than 40 years those older than 60 years are more likely to have mimics including colorectal cancer, ischemic colitis, segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug–induced pathology, radiation enteritis or colitis, or microscopic colitis. The first diagnostic steps should include laboratory investigations that include a complete blood count and serum albumin, serum ferritin, and C-reactive protein levels; liver enzymes and urea and creatinine levels serve to assess comorbidities and provide a baseline for toxicity monitoring. Stool testing for Clostridium difficile in all new presentations of diarrhea, regardless of antibiotic use history, and selective testing of stool for culture and ova and parasites may be appropriate. Cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography is appropriate in elderly persons with acute symptoms, especially when abdominal pain is prominent, and colonoscopy with histologic confirmation remains a cornerstone of diagnosis.

### Oral rehydration solutions for the treatment of acute… [^114Et1y9]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer Oral rehydration solutions are distinguished by high or low osmolarity and by whether they are made with complex or simple carbohydrates. When oral rehydration solutions with high osmolarity are compared, polymer-based solutions may result in lower stool output in the first 24 hours and shorter duration of diarrhea than glucose-based solutions. Practice Pointers Oral rehydration solutions are essential in the management of acute watery diarrhea. The original oral rehydration solution formulation, introduced by the World Health Organization in 1979, consisted of glucose and other electrolytes with an osmolarity of 310 mOsm per L. It improved signs of dehydration but did not reduce stool volume loss or diarrhea duration, and the high osmotic load potentiated fluid losses and electrolyte imbalances. Since 2004, the WHO has recommended low-osmolarity glucose-based oral rehydration solutions.

This analysis included 35 randomized controlled trials of 4, 284 patients with acute watery diarrhea and dehydration. The patients were mostly infants and children in India and Bangladesh, but the trials also involved patients in 12 other countries. Seven trials included adults, although adults were never directly compared with children. Patients were excluded if they were unable to take fluids orally, had been diagnosed with shock, or had bloody diarrhea. Twenty-seven of the studies used high-osmolarity oral rehydration solutions. Rice was the most common starch in polymer-based solutions. In studies of low-osmolarity oral rehydration solutions, patients receiving polymer-based solutions had a mean duration of diarrhea that was eight hours shorter than those receiving glucose-based solutions, but the results were underpowered.

In studies of high-osmolarity oral rehydration solutions, patients receiving polymer-based solutions had lower stool output and a mean duration of diarrhea that was 8. 5 hours shorter than those receiving glucose-based solutions.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of patients with diarrhea [^112gFkx1]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Diarrhea endoscopy — recommendations (initial evaluation and small-bowel workup) state that stool and laboratory tests should be the initial step for the evaluation of clinical scenarios suggestive of infectious diarrhea. In patients with chronic unexplained diarrhea, we suggest colonoscopy with random biopsies of the right and left side of the colon, and sigmoidoscopy is an alternative option, although this may miss right-sided organic disease. We recommend intubation of the terminal ileum during colonoscopy for patients undergoing evaluation of chronic diarrhea, and there are insufficient data to determine whether biopsy of an endoscopically normal-appearing terminal ileum should be routinely performed, but the yield of this is likely low. We recommend esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with small-bowel biopsy in patients with chronic diarrhea or suspected malabsorption and inconclusive evaluation after colonoscopy with biopsy and in patients with positive celiac serology. We recommend obtaining a minimum of 4 duodenal biopsy specimens for evaluation of suspected celiac disease. Enteroscopy is not recommended for the routine evaluation of chronic diarrhea but may be useful for evaluation of small-bowel disease when other investigations are nondiagnostic.

### Recognizing gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations of primary immunodeficiency diseases [^1132sTps]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Given the complex immune function of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, it is not surprising that many children with primary immunodeficiencies present with GI tract manifestations. Although many immunodeficiency disorders present with overt evidence of immune dysregulation, a few can present in older children with more subtle signs and symptoms. Such children may present first to a gastroenterologist with common symptoms, including malabsorption, diarrhea, hepatomegaly, or inflammatory bowel disease, which may actually be a manifestation of their underlying immune disorder. A thorough clinical history in combination with a careful review of histology from biopsies may reveal clues that one is dealing with a disease entity outside the norm and may prompt additional laboratory studies beyond the usual set of screening laboratory tests. Once the true underlying diagnosis is revealed, more appropriate therapy can be initiated. Additionally, more appropriate anticipatory guidance regarding the expected disease course, response to medications, and any additional risks that therapy may entail can be provided to the family.

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: an algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^112o9daJ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Diarrhea is a common yet complex disorder precipitated by multiple etiologic and pathogenic mechanisms. Distinguishing these conditions from each other can be problematic, especially where symptoms overlap. This is highlighted in individuals with IBS-D: in the United States, up to 75% of patients meeting the criteria remain undiagnosed. This is concerning because IBS is the most common cause of diarrhea and can be diagnosed with high accuracy based on a few simple binary questions and minimal diagnostic testing.

One of the most reported mimickers of IBS-D is EPI, and it is not uncommon for patients with EPI to be misdiagnosed with IBS-D. Consequently, we have proposed an algorithm designed specifically to help distinguish between these 2 disorders (Fig. 3) and differentiate them from other etiologies of chronic diarrhea. Most importantly, this algorithm incorporates recommendations from the recently published ACG and AGA IBS guidelines stressing a positive diagnostic strategy. This simple algorithm should assist practitioners in making timely diagnoses and reduce superfluous testing, thus reducing delays in treatment and improving patient health and quality of life.

### Clinical and microbiological profile of patients with diarrhea evaluated using the gastrointestinal panel in a high-complexity center [^116GztEc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding treatment, most patients initially received empirical antibiotic management. An impact was observed in more than 50% of the management after the PGI result given by continuing without antibiotic treatment, maintaining the initial empirical regimen or changing the treatment. These results are consistent with previous studies, where empirical treatment was prescribed in up to 70% of the adult diarrhea population. In addition, other studies evaluating the impact of the gastrointestinal panel on treatment describe that in approximately 50% of patients, the result of the panel allows for treatment tailoring.

GIP is emerging as a useful tool in the personalized management of gastrointestinal infections; however, it should be considered as a diagnostic support element in decision making, encompassing other clinical parameters of the patient that can be considered in additional studies.

Strengths and limitations

This retrospective study on the identification of microorganisms by GIP presents significant strengths, such as the evaluation of an advanced diagnostic technique in a real clinical context. However, an important limitation was that the results were not communicated in a timely manner to the treating physicians, which probably reduced their impact on the clinical management of patients. This limitation underscores the need for prospective studies that evaluate the real impact of this diagnostic tool when effectively integrated into clinical practice. Future studies should focus on measuring the impact of timely use of GIP on variables such as length of hospital stay, days of antibiotic treatment, need for abdominal imaging studies, and associated costs per patient. This would allow a more complete evaluation of the clinical and economic utility of this technology in the management of gastrointestinal infections.

### Prevalence of enteric infections in patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors and impact on management and outcomes [^112ZmR5y]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study is the largest analysis of stool pathogen testing in patients with diarrhea on ICI, the first to examine all-comers within this group undergoing initial GI PCR testing for the workup of new onset diarrhea and the first to assess endoscopic and histological associations with treatments within this group. By analyzing patients at the time of presentation for diarrhea and initial GI PCR testing, we were uniquely able to capture the clinical reality of irEC evaluations and in turn maximize the applicability of our results to real world practice settings.

There are several limitations to our study. Due to its retrospective design, our results are unable to describe causal relationships between GI infections and diarrhea severity, treatment regimens, and patient outcomes. The PCR panel is unable to distinguish between active infection, colonization, or contamination and does not assess for all potential infectious agents, especially less-common pathogens. Furthermore, patients with C. diff were excluded due to the pathogen's exclusion from the PCR panel and distinct risk factors, associations with colitis, and outcomes. However, C. diff remains a major infectious cause of diarrhea in cancer patients, and we plan to study patients with suspected irEC and superimposed C. diff infection and their unique considerations in a dedicated future analysis. Treatment protocols for diarrhea on ICI are not standardized, and so the decision for therapy escalation or endoscopic evaluation were at the discretion of the treating gastroenterologist and/or oncologist.

Infectious diarrhea — initial assessment and Shiga toxin–producing organisms: People of all ages with acute diarrhea should be evaluated for dehydration, which increases the risk of life-threatening illness and death, especially among the young and older adults. When the clinical or epidemic history suggests a possible Shiga toxin–producing organism, diagnostic approaches should be applied that detect Shiga toxin (or the genes that encode them) and distinguish Escherichia coli O157:H7 from other Shiga toxin–producing E. coli (STEC) in stool; if available, diagnostic approaches that can distinguish between Shiga toxin 1 and Shiga toxin 2, which is typically more potent, could be used. In addition, Shigella dysenteriae type 1, and, rarely, other pathogens may produce Shiga toxin and should be considered as a cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), especially in people with suggestive international travel or personal contact with a traveler. Clinicians should evaluate people for postinfectious and extraintestinal manifestations associated with enteric infections.

### Differential diagnosis of diarrhea in patients with neuroendocrine tumors [^115tPCnW]. Pancreas (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and carcinoid syndrome experience diarrhea that can have a debilitating effect on quality of life. Diarrhea also may develop in response to other hormonal syndromes associated with NETs, surgical complications, medical comorbidities, medications, or food sensitivities. Limited guidance on the practical approach to the differential diagnosis of diarrhea in these patients can lead to delays in appropriate treatment. This clinical review and commentary underscore the complexity in identifying the etiology of diarrhea in patients with NETs. Based on our collective experience and expertise, we offer a practical algorithm to guide medical oncologists and other care providers to expedite effective management of diarrhea and related symptoms in patients with NETs.

Diarrhea generates a wide range of diagnostic considerations and has profound individual and public health significance. The setting and circumstances under which a patient presents with diarrhea drastically influences the concern brought to the encounter. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are often provisionally labeled "gastroenteritis" with appropriate expectant management. In resource-poor countries, the significance of diarrhea is even greater. This review focuses on diarrhea and its initial evaluation and management in the emergency department.

9 Summary and conclusions

Establishing a clear definition of diarrhoea based on history alone can prove difficult, and this tends to lead to overinvestigation of functional diarrhoea including IBS. Serological testing for coeliac disease, the most common small bowel enteropathy in Caucasian populations, should be performed early in the course of investigations. The initial assessment should direct the clinician to determine whether further investigation is necessary and, if so, whether the focus should be on colonic, small bowel or pancreatic disease. This analysis could reasonably be performed in the primary care setting.

Most chronic diarrhoea is due to colonic abnormalities. Colonic investigations should be age stratified, in keeping with the risk of neoplasia and inflammation, and the high prevalence of bile acid diarrhoea estimated to be similar to coealic disease should be recognised and investigated. After appropriate normal investigations, those with persistent diarrhoea are likely to be self-limiting 'idiopathic' diarrhoea or undiagnosed factitious diarrhoea. Since the overall prognosis appears to be good in this group, including those that self-report and self-remedy, further investigation in this group is not warranted and symptomatic treatment could be instituted.

Diarrhea and colitis

Diagnostic workup for grade 1 diarrhea or colitis symptoms should include CBC, CMP, and fecal lactoferrin.
Additional workup should be performed for patients with diarrhea or colitis symptoms of grade ≥ 2, and these additional tests should include fecal calprotectin, and stool infectious analysis (stool ova and parasite, C. difficile and cytomegalovirus (CMV) testing via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if available or if high index of suspicion is present, among other infectious studies (eg, COVID-19)). Serum TSH and celiac serologies (antitransglutaminase antibodies with total IgA level) may also be considered, if clinical suspicion of ICI-induced celiac disease is present.
Abdominal CT scan should be obtained in patients with signs and symptoms of colitis complications, such as bowel perforation or toxic megacolon. Flexible sigmoidoscopy and/or colonoscopy with biopsy should be performed for patients with diarrhea or colitis symptoms of grade ≥ 3 or with persistent (≥ 5 days) diarrhea or colitis symptoms of grade 2 (LE: 4).
ICIs may be temporarily withheld (instead of discontinued) in patients experiencing grade ≥ 3 diarrhea or colitis symptoms. These patients may be re-challenged with ICIs if their symptoms are stable (grade ≤ 1 or baseline) with < 10 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent) (LE: 4).
Close monitoring for recurrence of diarrhea or colitis symptoms is recommended after re-challenging patients with ICI therapy.
Corticosteroids should be started in patients experiencing diarrhea or colitis symptoms of grade ≥ 2. The initial dose of prednisone should be 1 mg/kg/day (or equivalent) for grade 2 diarrhea or colitis and 1–2 mg/kg/day for grades 3 and 4. Grade 4 diarrhea or colitis should initially be treated with IV corticosteroids. Corticosteroids should be tapered within 4 weeks after improvement of diarrhea or colitis symptoms to grade ≤ 1 (LE: 1).
Prior to administration of infliximab or vedolizumab, patients should be tested for HBV, HIV, and TB. Administration of infliximab or vedolizumab should not be delayed if test results are pending.
If diarrhea or colitis symptoms do not respond to corticosteroid therapy within 3–5 days, if diarrhea or colitis symptoms recur after tapering corticosteroids, or if there is severe ulcerative presentation on colonoscopy, 3 doses of infliximab (5 mg/kg) should be administered at 0, 2, and 6 weeks (LE: 1) to reduce the risk of colitis recurrence.
If diarrhea or colitis symptoms persist after the second dose of infliximab treatment, the third dose should be held and 3 doses of vedolizumab (300 mg) should be administered at 0, 2, and 6 weeks (LE: 1).
If no clinical improvement is observed following immunosuppressive therapy in patients with grade ≥ 3 diarrhea or colitis, a repeat endoscopy with infectious workup (C. difficile and CMV) should be performed. Repeat endoscopy should be performed prior to resuming ICI therapy.
If diarrhea or colitis symptoms recur following corticosteroid taper, they should be evaluated and treated in the same manner as the first episode.

Biopsies should be performed for histologic evaluation even when the mucosa appears normal to exclude microscopic colitis and other etiologies, and colonoscopy should be considered if sigmoidoscopy findings are inconclusive, symptoms persist, there is large-volume blood loss, or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or colorectal cancer is suspected.

### Visual diagnosis: chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive in a 5-year-old girl [^111BVEzu]. Pediatrics in Review (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic GVHD usually develops 100 days after BMT and is a serious and potentially life-threatening long-term complication. Chronic GVHD can occur after previous or ongoing acute GVHD or in patients without a history of acute GVHD (eg, de novo disease) as illustrated by this case. In evaluating a patient presenting with chronic diarrhea more than 100 days after BMT, one must consider a serious underlying illness such as chronic GVHD because it is a major cause of morbidity and mortality of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. As indicated by this case, chronic GVHD can cause diarrhea. Complete evaluation of the diarrhea state should be part of the initial investigation. In many cases, however, the diagnosis of GVHD is not straightforward, and gastrointestinal biopsy and histologic confirmation is often necessary to corroborate a clinical impression of chronic GVHD.

### Chronic diarrhea: diagnosis and management [^113uFvCT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea is a common problem affecting up to 5% of the population at a given time. Patients vary in their definition of diarrhea, citing loose stool consistency, increased frequency, urgency of bowel movements, or incontinence as key symptoms. Physicians have used increased frequency of defecation or increased stool weight as major criteria and distinguish acute diarrhea, often due to self-limited, acute infections, from chronic diarrhea, which has a broader differential diagnosis, by duration of symptoms; 4 weeks is a frequently used cutoff. Symptom clusters and settings can be used to assess the likelihood of particular causes of diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome can be distinguished from some other causes of chronic diarrhea by the presence of pain that peaks before defecation, is relieved by defecation, and is associated with changes in stool form or frequency (Rome criteria). Patients with chronic diarrhea usually need some evaluation, but history and physical examination may be sufficient to direct therapy in some. For example, diet, medications, and surgery or radiation therapy can be important causes of chronic diarrhea that can be suspected on the basis of history alone. Testing is indicated when alarm features are present, when there is no obvious cause evident, or the differential diagnosis needs further delineation. Testing of blood and stool, endoscopy, imaging studies, histology, and physiological testing all have roles to play but are not all needed in every patient. Categorizing patients after limited testing may allow more directed testing and more rapid diagnosis. Empiric antidiarrheal therapy can be used to mitigate symptoms in most patients for whom a specific treatment is not available.

3 Primary clinical assessment

The initial assessment of patients with chronic diarrhoea can be mostly carried out in the primary care setting. The importance of careful history taking and examination cannot be overemphasised.

3.1 Initial presentation in primary care

In most countries where there is a split primary/secondary care system, the first consultation is with the primary care physician. Around 10% of all consultations in primary care are for gastroenterological problems, of which half are for lower gastrointestinal (GI) problems. Most of these are for self-limiting symptoms or for functional GI disorders and only a very small proportion comprise chronic or persistent diarrhoea. Based on the accepted definition of chronic diarrhoea being abnormal passage of ≥ 3 loose stools per day for more than 4 weeks and a rate of 3–5% per year, a primary care physician with an average list size of 1700 patients may have 50–85 such patients each year. Only a proportion of these will consult, with many managing with self- or pharmacy-based treatments, while others will be managed within primary care, often with antidiarrhoeals.

No data are available on the proportion referred to secondary care, but these are likely to be a small minority of the total number of people with chronic diarrhoea in the community. First-line investigations are normally performed within primary care and patients may be referred if their condition causes interference with normal activities or a compromise of quality of life sufficient to warrant further action. As with other conditions, many patients merely adapt their lives to their symptoms. No formal primary care referral guidelines or recommendations exist for patients with chronic diarrhoea, but the presence of normal first-line investigations with symptoms severe enough to impair quality of life and not responding to treatment constitutes a rationale for referral.

The impact of the symptoms of chronic diarrhoea and the differential diagnoses that need to be considered are clearly different in individual patients. A patient with recent change in bowel habit to include diarrhoea over 6 weeks is likely to need a different approach compared with another patient who has suffered from intermittent watery diarrhoea which has been present for over 5 years. Blood, stool (if an infectious aetiology or if an inflammatory component is suspected) and serological tests (for coeliac disease, hyperthyroidism and anaemia) should be performed in primary care as an initial assessment. Equally, if alarm features (such as unexplained change in bowel habit, persistent blood in the stool and unintentional weight loss) are detected, then referral for further investigations should be initiated.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC DIARRHEA

Early and accurate diagnosis is essential in disease management. A patient with chronic diarrhea may present with a spectrum of symptoms indicating one of several disorders, including IBS-D, EPI, celiac disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, inflammatory bowel disease, and infections (eg, giardiasis). All of these conditions may include diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence among their symptoms. To assist in the accurate diagnosis of patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, we suggest a four-step diagnostic process (Fig. 2).

Step 1: Thorough History and Physical Examination

Diagnosis should begin by taking a thorough history and physical examination. Patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, defined as persisting for ≥ 4 weeks, should be questioned in detail on their symptoms and prior diarrhea history. Although the clinical definition of diarrhea is loose or watery stools ≥ 3 times in a 24-hour period, patients use various definitions (eg, loose stools, increased stool frequency, or fecal urgency), underscoring the importance of an accurate and detailed patient history. Abnormal stool form can be more important in defining diarrhea because patients with functional constipation will also present with a chief complaint of diarrhea owing to increased defecatory frequency. However, further questioning may cause illicit symptoms of straining, incomplete evacuation, obstruction, and the passage of hard stools.

As an initial approach, we recommend determining if diarrhea can be categorized as watery (indicative of IBS, celiac disease, endocrinopathy, or laxative misuse), fatty or greasy (which may indicate a malabsorptive or maldigestion disease, such as celiac disease or EPI), or inflammatory (indicative of infectious or inflammatory bowel disease); however, definitive categorization is not always possible using these criteria because some conditions overlap (Table 2). Further questioning should include the following: What is the pattern of diarrhea? Is it continuous, intermittent, or meal-related (this may differentiate secretory from osmotic diarrhea)? When did it start? Was there a precipitating event? What is the volume of feces? Is there blood, mucus, or fat in the stool or toilet basin? Is there a nocturnal component to diarrhea? Is there fecal urgency or incontinence?, In addition, other gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms should be explored, and potential aggravating factors, such as diet, stress, or medications, and alleviating factors should be queried.

Acute diarrhea is commonly caused by an infection. Severe acute diarrhea warrants immediate medical evaluation and hospitalization. Indications for stool studies include fever; bloody diarrhea; recent travel to an endemic area; recent antibiotics; immunosuppression; and occupational risks, such as food handlers. Noninfectious causes include inflammatory bowel disease, radiation enteritis, and intestinal ischemia. Management of severe acute diarrhea includes intravenous fluid rehydration and empiric antibiotics. Use of antidiarrheal agents is controversial when invasive pathogens are suspected.
