## Question

A 38-year-old man with newly diagnosed HIV infection presents with a two-week history of fever, cough, and pleuritic chest pain. Chest imaging reveals a right lower lobe infiltrate. Sputum cultures and serology confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary coccidioidomycosis. His initial laboratory results show a CD4 count of 220 cells/mm³ and an HIV viral load of 120,000 copies/mL. He has no evidence of disseminated or central nervous system involvement. The infectious diseases team initiates oral fluconazole for coccidioidomycosis. The primary care team asks when to start antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Based on current guidelines, when should antiretroviral therapy (ART) be initiated in this patient?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to start antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a 38-year-old man with newly diagnosed HIV, pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, a CD4 count of 220 cells/mm³, and no evidence of disseminated or CNS disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and risk stratification. Then, I should verify what the most authoritative guidelines say about ART timing in coccidioidomycosis. Next, I will examine the rationale for early versus delayed ART in this specific context, including IRIS risk. After that, I should review any exceptions that would change timing, such as severe immunosuppression or CNS involvement. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and confirm drug–drug interaction considerations with fluconazole and ART.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and risk profile. This is newly diagnosed HIV with a CD4 count of 220 cells/mm³, indicating advanced immunosuppression, and pulmonary coccidioidomycosis without dissemination or CNS disease, which places him at higher risk for complications but not in the highest-risk category that mandates ART delay for IRIS mitigation [^86be9288] [^880b45f6].

> Next, I should review the highest-credibility guidance. The 2025 HIV.gov OI guidelines explicitly state that ART should not be delayed while treating coccidioidomycosis, and they do not recommend routine delays for IRIS concerns in this setting, which directly addresses this patient's scenario [^13530209] [^880b45f6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the IDSA coccidioidomycosis guideline as well. The 2016 IDSA guideline similarly advises that initiation of potent ART should not be delayed because of concern about coccidioidal IRIS, reinforcing the same principle across societies [^ad7dbb09] [^137c79f3].

> I will now examine the rationale for early ART here. Early ART accelerates immune reconstitution, reduces HIV replication, and lowers the risk of further opportunistic infections; in coccidioidomycosis, better HIV control correlates with less severe disease expression, supporting timely ART rather than deferral [^44247e70] [^6db56b34].

> But wait, what if the patient were in a higher-risk subgroup where delays are sometimes considered? I should double-check the exceptions. The main exception is in severely immunosuppressed patients with disseminated or CNS coccidioidomycosis, where a 4–6 week delay after starting antifungal therapy may be prudent to mitigate IRIS; neither applies here, as there is no dissemination or CNS disease and the CD4 count, while low, is not in the "profound immunosuppression" range that triggers this exception [^8f060082] [^880b45f6].

> Let me consider IRIS risk specifically. Coccidioidal IRIS is reported infrequently in people with HIV, and contemporary guidance emphasizes that the risk should not be a reason to defer ART in non-CNS, non-disseminated disease; with close monitoring, most IRIS cases are manageable if they occur [^880b45f6] [^2afd3b68].

> Next, I should review antifungal therapy alignment and duration. Fluconazole is appropriate for pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, and in HIV with CD4 < 250 cells/mm³, antifungal therapy should continue until the CD4 count is ≥ 250 cells/mm³ and viral suppression is achieved; this supports ongoing azole therapy while ART is initiated promptly rather than waiting for antifungal completion [^cdd75974] [^561d1af9].

> I need to ensure drug–drug interaction safety. Fluconazole has minimal clinically important interactions with common ART backbones, so starting ART now is unlikely to create meaningful interaction issues; nonetheless, I should confirm the chosen ART regimen and monitor for hepatotoxicity and QT effects when combining azoles with certain agents, adjusting as needed [^notfound].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. For this patient with HIV and pulmonary coccidioidomycosis without dissemination or CNS involvement, ART should be started as soon as feasible — ideally within 1–2 weeks of initiating antifungal therapy — and should not be delayed out of concern for coccidioidal IRIS, with continued fluconazole until immune reconstitution targets are met and close clinical follow-up arranged [^13530209] [^880b45f6] [^cdd75974].

---

Start ART now, ideally within **2 weeks** of starting fluconazole, because the patient has HIV with a CD4 count of 220 cells/mm³ and pulmonary coccidioidomycosis without CNS involvement. Current guidelines advise **not to delay ART** for coccidioidomycosis outside the CNS, as IRIS risk is low and early ART improves outcomes. If CNS disease were present, a 4–6 week delay would be reasonable; here, it is not indicated. Monitor closely for clinical response and IRIS, and continue fluconazole until the CD4 count is ≥ 250 cells/mm³ with viral suppression [^13530209] [^880b45f6] [^cdd75974].

## Current guideline recommendations

Current guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) provide clear recommendations on the timing of ART initiation in patients with HIV and coccidioidomycosis:

- **IDSA 2016 guidelines**: Initiation of potent ART should not be delayed because of concern about coccidioidal immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) [^ad7dbb09] [^137c79f3].

- **DHHS 2025 guidelines**: Do not delay ART while treating coccidioidomycosis, except in cases of severe immunosuppression (CD4 count < 100 cells/mm³) with disseminated or CNS disease, where a short delay (4–6 weeks) may be considered [^13530209] [^8f060082].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting early ART initiation

Several studies and reviews have demonstrated the benefits of early ART initiation in patients with HIV and opportunistic infections, including coccidioidomycosis:

- **Improved immune reconstitution**: Early ART initiation leads to faster immune recovery, reducing the risk of further opportunistic infections and improving overall prognosis [^6db56b34].

- **Reduced mortality**: Early ART initiation has been associated with reduced mortality in patients with HIV and opportunistic infections, including those with coccidioidomycosis [^6953a88b].

- **Low risk of IRIS**: The risk of coccidioidal IRIS is relatively low, and most cases are manageable with supportive care and continuation of ART [^880b45f6].

---

## Risks associated with delaying ART

Delaying ART in patients with HIV and coccidioidomycosis can lead to several adverse outcomes:

- **Progression of HIV disease**: Delayed ART can result in further immunosuppression, increasing the risk of additional opportunistic infections and complications [^6db56b34].

- **Increased mortality**: Delayed ART initiation has been associated with increased mortality in patients with HIV and opportunistic infections [^6953a88b].

- **Prolonged antifungal therapy**: Delayed ART may necessitate prolonged antifungal therapy, increasing the risk of drug toxicity and resistance [^cdd75974].

---

## Clinical considerations and monitoring

While initiating ART early, clinicians should consider the following:

- **Drug interactions**: Fluconazole, the antifungal therapy for coccidioidomycosis, has minimal clinically significant interactions with most ART regimens. However, clinicians should remain vigilant for potential interactions and adjust therapy as needed [^notfound].

- **Monitoring for IRIS**: Although the risk of coccidioidal IRIS is low, clinicians should monitor for signs of paradoxical worsening of symptoms after ART initiation and manage accordingly [^880b45f6].

- **Clinical response**: Regular clinical assessment, including serial chest radiographs and coccidioidal serology, is essential to monitor treatment response and detect any complications early [^880b45f6].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Based on current guidelines and clinical evidence, ART should be initiated as soon as possible in patients with HIV and pulmonary coccidioidomycosis without CNS involvement. Delaying ART is not recommended, as the benefits of early ART outweigh the risks of coccidioidal IRIS. Therefore, in this patient, **ART should be initiated within 2 weeks** of starting fluconazole therapy, with close monitoring for clinical response and IRIS.

IDSA 2016 coccidioidomycosis — HIV infection management recommendations state that antifungal prophylaxis is not recommended to prevent coccidioidomycosis in patients infected with HIV living in coccidioidal endemic regions (strong, moderate), and that antifungal therapy is recommended for all patients with HIV infection with clinical evidence of coccidioidomycosis and a peripheral blood CD4+ T-lymphocyte count < 250 cells/μL (strong, moderate). Antifungal therapy should be continued as long as the peripheral CD4+ T-lymphocyte count remains < 250 cells/μL (strong, low), whereas for patients with peripheral CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts ≥ 250 cells/μL, clinical management of coccidioidomycosis should occur in the same manner as for patients without HIV infection, including discontinuing antifungal therapy in appropriate situations (strong, moderate). Within coccidioidal-endemic regions, patients should receive yearly serologic screening and chest radiography for coccidioidomycosis (strong, low), but outside coccidioidal-endemic regions, serologic screening is not recommended (strong, moderate). Although data are lacking, pediatric patients with HIV infection and coccidioidomycosis should be managed in a manner similar to adult patients (strong, very low), and initiation of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) should not be delayed because of the concern about coccidioidal immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) (strong, low). All the above recommendations are based on the assumption that the patient has been prescribed potent ART, which is strongly encouraged.

### Coccidioidomycosis in persons infected with HIV type 1 [^305baad8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis is a recognized opportunistic infection among persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Early in the HIV epidemic, most cases presented as overwhelming diffuse pulmonary disease with a high mortality rate. Although these cases are still seen, patients without significant immunodeficiency frequently present with a community-acquired pneumonia syndrome. Diagnosis can be established by cytological staining, culture, or serologic testing. All patients with HIV infection and symptomatic coccidioidomycosis should be treated with antifungal therapy. Severe cases frequently require a combination of therapy with amphotericin B and a triazole antifungal. Therapy for at least 1 year is recommended, but for patients with a focal pulmonary infection and peripheral blood CD4 lymphocyte counts of > 250 cells/microL, it may be reasonable to stop therapy after this time. Other manifestations of coccidioidomycosis require prolonged therapy, and life-long treatment is recommended for persons with meningitis.

Coccidioidomycosis in HIV — prevention of relapse and monitoring: Relapse occurs in 25% to 33% of HIV-uninfected patients who have diffuse pulmonary disease or nonmeningeal disseminated coccidioidomycosis and may occur in HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts ≥ 250 cells/mm3 on potent ART. Continued monitoring during coccidioidomycosis therapy and after such therapy has been discontinued with clinical follow-up, serial chest radiographs and coccidioidal serology every 3 to 6 months should be performed. Because relapses have been reported in 80% of patients with meningitis in whom triazoles have been discontinued, therapy for coccidioidal meningitis should be continued for life (AII).

Coccidioidomycosis — indication for discontinuing primary prophylaxis is CD4 count ≥ 250 cells/μL and with viral suppression while on ART (CIII); restart primary prophylaxis at CD4 count < 250 cells/ μL (BIII). For secondary prophylaxis/chronic maintenance, only for patients with focal coccidioidal pneumonia (AII): clinically responded to ≥ 6 months antifungal therapy, with CD4 count ≥ 250 cells/mm3, and with viral suppression while on ART; patients should continue monitoring for recurrence with serial chest radiographs and coccidioidal serology every 6–12 months. For patients with diffuse pulmonary (BIII), disseminated non-meningeal (BIII), therapy is at least 12 months and usually much longer; discontinuation is dependent on clinical and serological response and should be made in consultation with experts. For meningeal diseases (AII), suppressive therapy should be continued indefinitely, even with increase in CD4 count on ART.

Treatment decisions were determined by the treating physicians, and whether a patient received antifungal therapy before enrollment was recorded (medication name, dose, frequency, duration). After patients were enrolled, physician investigators determined the need to initiate or continue antifungal medication on a case-by-case basis. Patients were assigned to the treatment group if at any time before enrollment through study completion they received any antifungal treatment.

The medical care for coccidioidomycosis was provided by physician investigators and conducted in a standardized fashion. The initial evaluation included a complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, serologic testing for HIV, pregnancy testing, and serologic testing for coccidioidomycosis (by enzyme immunoassay, immunodiffusion, and complement fixation); collection of microbiological specimens, if applicable (mostly sputum for fungal culture); and analysis of chest radiographs. Patients were evaluated clinically, serologically, and radiographically (chest) at enrollment and at 4, 12, 16, and 24 weeks.

### Disseminated coccidioidomycosis in a patient who is immunocompromised in the setting of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [^a932b220]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis is a systemic fungal infection first described in 1892. More than 95% of annual cases occur in Arizona and California. It is an opportunistic infection (OI) transmitted via inhalation of airborne spores (arthroconidia) and rarely via percutaneous inoculation into a tissue or solid organ transplantation in patients who are immunocompromised and with HIV. With the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the incidence of OIs has markedly reduced; however, OIs continue to occur, particularly in patients who present late for medical care or delay ART initiation. In rare cases, immunodeficient individuals may experience a paradoxical worsening or unmasking of OI symptoms, known as the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). We present a case of a 31-year-old man with disseminated coccidioidomycosis affecting the spleen, lymph nodes, lungs, bone marrow, and adrenals who developed IRIS after the initiation of ART.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis — clinical manifestations in HIV: Lack of suppression of HIV replication and lower CD4 cell counts are associated with the severity of the presentation of coccidioidomycosis, and four common syndromes in HIV-infected patients are focal pneumonia, diffuse pneumonia, extrathoracic involvement including meningitis, and positive coccidioidal serology tests without evidence of localized infection. Focal pneumonia is most common in patients with CD4 counts ≥ 250 cells/mm3 and can present with cough, fever, and pleuritic chest pain; coccidioidomycosis may also present with hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, upper lobe infiltrates, night sweats, and peripheral blood eosinophilia, and syndromes other than focal pneumonia usually occur in more immunosuppressed patients. Diffuse pulmonary disease may show severe hypoxemia and serological tests are frequently negative at presentation, and routine bacterial cultures from pulmonary secretions frequently reveal Coccidioides after an incubation time of less than one week. Meningitis presents with a persistent headache and progressive lethargy, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile demonstrates low glucose with elevated protein and a lymphocytic pleocytosis; immunosuppressed patients with HIV infection may also present with elevated coccidioidal serological titers without evidence of disease. In a pre–potent ART era series, 13 patients all had CD4 counts < 350 cells/mm3 and positive coccidioidal serologic tests, and Five patients subsequently developed clinical illness at a median CD4 count of 10 cells/mm3.

Coccidioidomycosis — clinical manifestations in people with HIV include four syndromes: focal pneumonia; diffuse pneumonia; extrathoracic involvement, including meningitis and osteoarticular infection; and positive coccidioidal serology tests without evidence of localized infection, and lack of viral suppression with CD4 count < 250 cells/mm3 is associated with increased severity. Focal pneumonia is most common when CD4 counts ≥ 250 cells/mm3 and can be difficult to distinguish from bacterial or viral community-acquired pneumonia, presenting with cough, fever, and pleuritic chest pain, while hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, upper lobe infiltrates, nodules, peripheral blood eosinophilia, or rash may point towards coccidioidomycosis, particularly with residence, prior residence, or travel to a known endemic area. Diffuse pneumonia and extrathoracic disease usually occur in more apparently immunocompromised patients; diffuse pulmonary disease presents with fever and dyspnea with a diffuse reticulonodular pattern on chest imaging and may be difficult to distinguish clinically from Pneumocystis pneumonia, and hypoxemia may be severe with serological tests possibly negative early. In meningitis, the cerebrospinal fluid profile demonstrates low glucose levels, elevated protein levels, and a lymphocytic pleocytosis, and eosinophils may also be present on cerebrospinal fluid analysis.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^c4165f4c]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis — Primary and secondary prophylaxis in children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) state that routine use of antifungal medications for primary prophylaxis of coccidioidal infections in children is not recommended (BIII). Lifelong antifungal suppression (secondary prophylaxis) with either fluconazole or itraconazole is recommended for children with HIV after disseminated, diffuse pulmonary, and/or meningeal coccidioidomycosis, even if immune reconstitution is achieved with antiretroviral therapy (AII*). Lifelong secondary prophylaxis should be considered for children with mild disease and CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count < 250 cells/mm3 or CD4 percentage < 15% (BIII). Despite immune reconstitution, relapse of coccidioidomycosis may occur in children with HIV with disseminated and meningeal disease, and some experts advise against discontinuing azole prophylaxis (BIII).

Conclusion

Early ART initiation does not increase mortality, AIDS-defining events, IRIS, adverse events, and immunological or virological outcomes in AIDS/PCP patients. These results support the early initiation of ART in patients with moderate to severe AIDS/PCP.

Coccidioidomycosis — monitoring response and managing immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in people with HIV: Monitoring the CF antibody titer is useful to assess response to therapy, which should be measured every 12 weeks, and more than a twofold rise suggests recurrence or worsening and should prompt reassessment. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has been reported infrequently in people with HIV and coccidioidomycosis; in general, delaying initiation of ART while treating coccidioidomycosis may not be necessary (BIII). However, in highly immunosuppressed patients (i.e. CD4 counts < 100 cells/mm3) with disseminated disease, clinical decline may occur with initiation of ART, and it might be prudent to delay ART for 4 to 6 weeks after initiating antifungal therapy in severely immunosuppressed patients who have disseminated central nervous system disease (CIII). ART delay may not always prevent IRIS, including a reported patient treated with fluconazole for 28 days who had worsening symptoms within a week after starting ART; therefore, close monitoring for clinical worsening, particularly if meningitis is present, is essential when treating highly immunosuppressed people who have HIV and disseminated coccidioidomycosis.

HIV-associated cryptococcosis — antiretroviral therapy (ART) timing relative to antifungal treatment: It is prudent to delay initiation of ART at least until after completion of antifungal induction therapy (the first 2 weeks) and possibly until the total induction/consolidation phase (10 weeks) has been completed, and the timing of ART administration should be considered between 2 and 10 weeks after the start of antifungal therapy (BIII). If effective ART is to begin prior to 10 weeks, the treating physicians should be prepared to aggressively address complications caused by IRIS, such as elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). For other forms of cryptococcosis, it would seem prudent to delay initiation of ART by 2 to 4 weeks after starting antifungal therapy (BIII). All the triazole antifungals have the potential for complex, and possibly bidirectional, interactions with certain antiretroviral agents, and Table 5 lists these interactions and recommendations for dosage adjustments, where feasible.

### Initiating antiretroviral therapy within 2 weeks of anti-Pneumocystis treatment does not increase mortality or AIDS-defining events in patients with HIV-associated moderate to severe Pneumocystis pneumonia: results of a prospective observational multicenter study [^899b7c0b]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In 2009, the AIDS Clinical Trials Group reported that AIDS progression and mortality in HIV-infected patients with non-tuberculous OIs are decreased if ART was initiated early (within 14 days of starting acute OI treatment). The preceding study observed that patients with OIs, including PCP, may be able to benefit from early ART initiation. However, another recent study which enrolled 50 AIDS/PCP patients found that there were no significant differences in safety and efficacy between an Early ART initiation arm, and a Deferred ART initiation arm. In concordance with the above study, we found that our Early ART arm had no increase in mortality and AIDS-defining events compared to our Deferred ART arm. These results support Early ART initiation in patients presenting with AIDS/PCP, should there be no major contraindications.

Latest guidelines recommend that ART should be started as soon as possible within 2 weeks of initiating tuberculosis treatment, regardless of CD4+ T-cell count. However, one previous study recommends that tuberculosis patients initiate ART according to different levels of CD4+ T-cell count. We chose to refer to previous tuberculosis guidelines in order to observe whether a different timing of ART initiation should be used for patients with different levels of CD + T-cell count. In the present study, there was no significant difference between the two study arms when different levels of CD4+ T-cell count were considered (Fig. 3). Therefore, it seems that different levels of CD4+ T-cell count do not necessarily require a different timing of ART initiation for AIDS/PCP patients with varying CD4+ T-cell counts.

### HIV-associated talaromycosis: does timing of antiretroviral therapy matter? [^69d84921]. The Journal of Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

No current academic data is available with respect to the optimal timing to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-positive patients with talaromycosis. Our study aimed to evaluate the optimal timing of ART initiation for patients presenting with AIDS-related talaromycosis.

Methods

In this prospective, randomized, open-label multicenter trial, 228 patients from 15 hospitals in China were randomly assigned to an early ART group (initiation of ART within 2 weeks after randomization) and a deferred ART group (initiation of ART 2 weeks after randomization). The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality during the 48 weeks after randomization.

Results

We observed a significant difference in mortality between the early ART group and the deferred ART group (2.2% vs. 8.9%, 95%CI: -0.15 to 14.05, p = 0.049). The composite outcome of AIDS-defining events or death in the early ART group was found to be lower than that in the deferred ART group (3.3% vs. 14.9%; 95%CI: 2.93 to 19.23, p = 0.008).

Conclusions

The prognosis of HIV-infected patients with talaromycosis in the early ART group was more favorable than that of patients in the deferred ART group. These results demonstrate that early ART initiation should be considered in HIV-infected patients with talaromycosis.

### An official ATS workshop report: emerging issues and current controversies in HIV-associated pulmonary diseases [^2afd3b68]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Medium credibility.

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in HIV — definition, risk factors, presentation, timing, and management — is described as a paradoxical worsening of clinical status related to recovery of the immune system after initiation of ART, with mycobacterial infections, particularly M. tuberculosis and MAC, most frequent and fungal (Cryptococcus, PCP) and viral (cytomegalovirus) infections also associated; initiating ART in close proximity to treatment for an acute opportunistic infection increases risk of IRIS, patients who develop IRIS are more likely to be antiretroviral naive at ART initiation, and lower CD4+ cell counts are also associated. Common presenting symptoms consist of fever and lymphadenopathy with chest radiographic patterns including pulmonary infiltrates, nodules or masses, intrathoracic lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion, and diagnosis is essentially one of exclusion of other causes; the majority of IRIS cases occur within the first 1 to 3 months after ART initiation. Most cases are mild and outcomes are generally good with supportive therapy; nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and steroids may be used, patients on ART can continue their regimens, and when to start ART in patients with opportunistic infections remains controversial although early ART may be beneficial, with caution that timing in critically ill patients is not well studied and may carry potential harm from ART-related toxicity or inflammatory reactions.

HIV-associated talaromycosis — timing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation: in a multicenter randomized controlled trial, early ART (< 2 weeks after initiation of talaromycosis treatment, median 11 days, IQR 7–13) was associated with significantly lower mortality and AIDS-defining events over 48 weeks compared to delayed ART (2–4 weeks after initiation, median 21 days, IQR 17–29). In the IVAP trial, median time to ART was 3 weeks (range 1–5 weeks), paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) occurred in 6.4% with itraconazole and 0% with amphotericin B, and ART should therefore be initiated as early as 1 week after the initiation of induction therapy for talaromycosis to improve outcomes (AII).

BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In order to further prioritize therapeutic strategies and reduce mortality, we conducted the present trial which aimed to investigate the optimal timing for ART initiation in AIDS patients with moderate to severe PCP in China. The mortality observed in the present study was 12.7% (46/363). The major strength of our study is that it provides important data for the salient question as to when to initiate ART in the extremely vulnerable group of HIV-infected patients with moderate to severe PCP.

In concordance with one previous study, we noted no differences in median CD4+ T-cell counts between the two study arms of our investigation. A prospective study which enrolled a total of 61 patients, conducted by Schäfer et al. in AIDS patients with toxoplasmosis and PCP observed that there was no significant difference in immunological outcomes between these two cohorts. There was no statistically significant difference in both treatment arms in assessments of virological suppression at week 24 and 48. This is consistent with what usually occurs in acute OIs in HIV-infected patients, as previously reported.

Most adverse events in the present study were mild. Overall, the frequency of adverse events did not differ between the two study arms, and there was no evidence of a difference in effect between the study arms. In our study, Early ART initiation did not result in an increase in adverse events or serious adverse events, compared to the Deferred ART initiation arm.

IRIS was uncommon in the present study (1.4%) although participants had advanced immunodeficiency and had robust increases in CD4+ T-cell counts. The incidence of paradoxical IRIS in the present study was lower than that reported in other published studies. Roade Tato et al. reported 6 cases of IRIS development in a cohort of 123 (4.9%) HIV-infected patients with PCP who started ART. In a published study which enrolled a total of 282 patients with OIs, and including 177 AIDS/PCP patients, the reported incidence of IRIS after ART initiation was 7%. Another prospective study conducted in South Africa observed that 10.4% of HIV-infected patients (44/423) developed IRIS. It is not precisely clear why the rate of IRIS in our trial was as low as was observed. However, our results demonstrate that the risk of IRIS development should not be a reason to defer ART in AIDS/PCP patients.

### Coccidioidomycosis in patients with HIV-1 infection in the era of potent antiretroviral therapy [^44247e70]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Coccidioidomycosis is a common opportunistic infection in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals living in regions where coccidioidomycosis is endemic. However, there have been no studies on its incidence or clinical expression during the era of potent antiretroviral therapy.

Methods

Clinical data were abstracted from the records of all HIV-1-infected patients attending a single clinic in a region where coccidioidomycosis is endemic from January 2003 through May 2008. Additional follow-up was performed through May 2009 for individuals with active coccidioidomycosis. A case-control study was performed that compared all individuals who attended the clinic with individuals who received a diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis.

Results

Among 257 HIV-1-infected patients seen over a 64-month period, 29 cases (11.3%) of coccidioidomycosis were identified. Twelve patients (4.7%) received a diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis during the study period (annual incidence, 0.9%). Patients with less severe coccidioidomycosis were significantly more likely to have an undetectable HIV RNA level and to be receiving potent antiretroviral therapy than were those with more severe disease (for both, P < .01). Five patients with coccidioidomycosis received no antifungal therapy, and 11 others had antifungal therapy discontinued. All were healthy during follow-up. Patients with coccidioidomycosis had significantly lower CD4 T lymphocyte counts than did control subjects (mean ± standard deviation, 285 ± 42 cells/microL vs 477 ± 21 cells/microL; P = 0.003).

Conclusions

The incidence of symptomatic coccidioidomycosis in the era of potent antiretroviral therapy has decreased, and its clinical expression is less severe than it was before the potent antiretroviral therapy era. Severity of coccidioidomycosis was inversely associated with control of HIV-1 infection.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^fe43478a]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation with disseminated MAC in people with HIV: ART should be started as soon as possible after the diagnosis of MAC disease, preferably at the same time as initiation of antimycobacterial therapy in people with HIV and disseminated MAC disease who are not receiving effective ART (BIII). ART is recommended as soon as possible to reduce the risk of further AIDS-defining OIs and to further improve the response to antimycobacterial therapy in the setting of advanced immunosuppression (BIII); if ART has already been initiated, it should be continued, and regimens should be modified when there is any potential for an adverse drug–drug interaction(s) between the antiretroviral (ARV) and antimycobacterial drugs (BIII). People with HIV will need continuous antimycobacterial treatment until ART results in sustained immune reconstitution, as indicated above (CD4 count maintained above 100 cells/mm3 for at least 6 months).

### Clinical overview of valley fever… [^d47e9c37]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know
- About 40% of cases of Valley fever develop lung infection symptoms.
- Infections are usually self-limiting but 5–10% develop complications. Disseminated disease is rare.
- Serologic tests to detect IgM and IgG antibodies are the most common diagnostics.
- Infections are usually treated with fluconazole or amphotericin B. Etiology Two species of Coccidioides cause infection: Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii. Clinical differences between the two species have not been observed. Coccidioide lives in the soil in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico, Central America, and South America. Valley fever is considered highly endemic in southern Arizona and California's southern San Joaquin Valley.

At-risk populations Risk factors for severe or disseminated coccidioidomycosis include:

- African-American race
- HIV/AIDS
- Organ transplant
- Diabetes mellitus
- Pregnancy in women
- Use of immunosuppressive medications Exposure risks In endemic areas, risk factors include occupations and activities that increase exposure to dust, such as:

- Construction
- Agricultural work
- Archaeology
- Military training. How it spreads Coccidioidomycosis is typically acquired via inhalation of airborne arthroconidia. Arthroconidia often become airborne after contaminated soil is disturbed. Disturbance can result from small-scale activities including construction or excavation, or large-scale events such as dust storms and earthquakes. Primary cutaneous coccidioidomycosis, solid organ donor-derived coccidioidomycosis, and fomite-transmitted coccidioidomycosis can also occur but are very uncommon.

Clinical features Symptomatic persons usually present 1 to 3 weeks after exposure. Typical symptoms include fatigue, cough, dyspnea, headache, night sweats, myalgias, and rash. Primary pulmonary disease is often self-limiting. However, approximately 5 to 10% of patients fail to recover and develop complications or chronic pulmonary disease. Disseminated disease occurs in an estimated 1% of cases. Higher rates of dissemination are observed in certain risk groups, with bones/joints, soft tissues, and meninges most commonly affected. In persons who develop progressive, chronic, or disseminated disease, symptoms may persist for months or even longer. Meningitis can lead to permanent neurologic damage. Mortality is high in HIV-infected persons with diffuse lung disease. Diagnosis Serologic tests to detect IgM and IgG antibodies are most often used to diagnose coccidioidomycosis.

Enzyme immunoassay EIA is a very sensitive and commonly used method for diagnosing coccidioidomycosis. Two EIAs for detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies against Coccidioides are currently available:

- Premier ® CoccidioidesEIA – Meridian Bioscience, Inc.
- Enzyme Immunoassay for detection of specific antibodies against Coccidioidesspp – Immuno Mycologics, Inc. Immunodiffusion ID detects IgM antibodies; positive early in the course of infection. Complement Fixation CF etects IgG antibodies and allows for assessment of disease severity. Lateral Flow Assay The Sona Coccidioides Antibody LFA is a rapid test. It detects the presence of total antibodies against Coccidioides spp. Culture can be performed on tissue and respiratory specimens. However, sputum can be difficult to obtain for culture since patients' coughs are often non-productive.

### Testing algorithm for coccidioidomycosis… [^84c882d7]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What to know
- Coccidioidomycosis is an invasive fungal disease that often presents as community-acquired pneumonia in primary and urgent care settings.
- Coccidioidomycosis cannot be reliably distinguished from other causes of respiratory illness by signs or symptoms alone.
- Clinicians in urgent care and outpatient settings can use this algorithm to help make determinations about clinical testing. When to consider testing for coccidioidomycosis Coccidioidomycosis is an invasive fungal disease that often presents as community-acquired pneumonia in primary and urgent care settings. It is endemic in parts of the U. S. and the world. Coccidioidomycosis cannot be reliably distinguished from other causes of respiratory illness by signs or symptoms alone. It is commonly misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated with antibiotics — up to 70% of patients may receive inappropriate antibacterial drugs.

1 In highly endemic regions for coccidioidomycosis, erythema nodosum is commonly the presenting symptom. 2 Testing for coccidioidomycosis may be considered on the initial patient encounter or at a secondary visit, depending on situational factors.

1. Consider testing on an initial presentation of community-acquired pneumonia or erythema nodosum following recent respiratory symptoms who:

- Have a link to known outbreak, or
- Live in or recently traveled to the highlyendemic regions, including
- Desert regions of South-Central Arizona.
- San Joaquin Valley of California.
- Desert regions of South-Central Arizona.

Approximate coccidioidomycosis-endemic areas Health Care Providers: Clinical Overview of Valley Fever. How to test for coccidioidomycosis Recommended test methods We recommend ordering an enzyme immunoassay antibody with immunodiffusion or complement fixation antibody test initially for coccidioidomycosis diagnosis. Initial testing with EIA or ID and CF may depend on availability and performance characteristics of test at facility. EIAs have a quicker turnaround time than ID and CF antibody testing. Results If the EIA is positive, clinicians may consider follow-up testing with ID and CF to rule out false positives and confirm the diagnosis. For patients in highly endemic areas or with highly suggestive clinical findings, clinicians might start management for pulmonary coccidioidomycosis while awaiting results from ID and CF.

If the follow-up testing with ID or CF is negative, consider repeat ID or CF to rule out false negatives. If the initial EIA test is negative, clinicians should consider alternative diagnoses. If a high degree of suspicion remains, progression of illness occurs, or if symptom onset was recent, repeat serology may be considered 2 to 6 weeks after the initial EIA test, or you may consult a specialist in infectious diseases or a pulmonologist. Note that antibody testing may be negative early in the illness course. Antigen testing Antigen testing is available; however, it has primarily been studied in immunocompromised patients with moderately severe or disseminated disease or in meningitis. PCR and LFA can be helpful in diagnosing patients, but it is not readily available in many clinical settings.

BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is caused by a yeast-like fungus, Pneumocystis jirovecii, and is a commonly occurring opportunistic infection (OI) in HIV-infected patients. The incidence of PCP increased rapidly during and after the 1980s, and is currently as high as 75% in HIV-infected patients, especially in those with CD4+ T-cell counts < 200 cells/μL, and results in mortality in up to 40% of patients. Since the mid-1990s, the widespread use of effective PCP prophylaxis and early antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to a substantial decline in the prevalence of PCP among HIV-infected patients.

AIDS-associated PCP remains, however, the predominant OI among AIDS patients. One past study reported that in China the prevalence of PCP in HIV-infected patients who have not initiated ART was 22.4%. The clinical course of treated PCP is associated with 20–40% mortality in individuals with profound immunosuppression. In addition, a cohort study conducted in China from 2009 to 2018, showed that in-hospital mortality among HIV-infected patients who had concomitant PCP remained unacceptably high, at 17.3% (173/1001). PCP thus remains a life-threatening OI, and is the most common cause of death in HIV-infected patients with severe immunosuppression.

The United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines recommend that ART should be initiated within 2 weeks of diagnosis of PCP (AI), and this recommendation is supported by the results of a randomized controlled trial conducted from 2003 to 2006 in Puerto Rico, South Africa, and the United States, which included 282 HIV-infected patients with OIs other than TB. The Chinese guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of HIV/AIDS (2018) also recommends initiating ART within 2 weeks of treatment of PCP. Nonetheless, there remains no recent local high-quality evidence in China to support this recommendation. Therefore, we conducted the present controlled trial, which aimed to investigate the timing of ART initiation in AIDS patients with moderate to severe PCP in China.

### Optimum time to start antiretroviral therapy during HIV-associated opportunistic infections [^6953a88b]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We review recently published literature concerning the optimum time to start antiretroviral therapy (ART) in patients with HIV-associated opportunistic infections.

Recent Findings

In addition to data from observational studies, results from six randomized controlled clinical trials were available by July 2010. The collective findings of these trials were that patients with CD4 cell counts less than 200 cells/μl who start ART within the first 2 weeks of treatment for opportunistic infections including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, serious bacterial infections or pulmonary tuberculosis have lower mortality when compared to patients starting ART at later time-points. Moreover, patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and CD4 counts of 200–500 cells/μl who started ART during tuberculosis (TB) treatment had improved survival compared to those who deferred ART until after the end of treatment. In contrast, in two separate studies, immediate ART conferred no survival benefit in patients with TB meningitis and was associated with substantially higher mortality risk in patients with cryptococcal meningitis.

Summary

Initiation of ART during the first 2 weeks of treatment for serious opportunistic infections has been shown to be associated with improved survival with the exception of patients with tuberculous meningitis and cryptococcal meningitis. Further clinical trials are ongoing.

### Benefits and risks of rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy [^45f8a03c]. AIDS (2018). Low credibility.

As a result of the findings of this review, WHO now recommends that ART is initiated within 7 days following a confirmed HIV diagnosis and clinical assessment, and that ART initiation on the same day as HIV is diagnosed should be offered to those patients who are ready to start.

Accelerated ART initiation is likely to be of particular benefit in those settings where extensive patient preparation prior to starting ART results in long delays, during which patients may be lost to care. Individuals most likely to benefit from this approach include those with advanced HIV disease (to reduce the high risk of mortality in this group), pregnant women, and those with acute HIV infection (to decrease viral load and reduce the risk of virus transmission).

There are some important concerns with respect to rapid ART initiation, notably with respect to the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome; patients should undergo history and clinical examination to look for significant opportunistic infections (e.g. signs and symptoms of TB and those suggestive of meningitis) supported by diagnostic testing [cryptococcal antigen test, Xpert, and lipo-arabinomannan agent (TB-LAM)] where indicated, prior to being offered rapid ART, and ART initiation should be deferred when clinical symptoms suggest TB or cryptococcal meningitis to avoid paradoxical worsening of the existing infection that can be life threatening.

Secondary outcomes

Two of 169 participants in the Early ART arm and three of 194 participants in the Deferred ART arm developed paradoxical PCP/IRIS (p = 1.000). Three participants (1.8%) in the Early ART arm compared to three participants (1.5%) in the Deferred ART arm (p = 1.000) were admitted to ICU. Two participants (1.2%) in the Early ART arm required intubation, compared to one participant (0.5%) in the Deferred ART arm (p = 0.904) (Table 2). We observed no difference in the total number of adverse events between the two arms, i.e. adverse events occurred in 70 of 169 participants in the Early ART arm, and in 72 of 194 participants in the Deferred ART arm (p = 0.465). Adverse events of grade 3–4 were reported in 28 of the 169 participants in the Early ART arm and 34 of 194 participants in the Deferred ART arm (p = 0.919), as shown in Table 2.

Median change in immune indices from baseline to week 48

Median CD4+ T-cell counts increased in both study arms. We recorded no significant differences in changes to CD4+ T-cell counts between the two study arms from baseline to week 48, as shown in Fig. 4.

At week 24, there were 86 participants in the Early ART initiation arm and 108 participants in the Deferred ART initiation arm for the analysis of virological suppression, and the results showed that 67.4% (58/86) of participants in the Early ART initiation arm and 56.5% (61/108) participants in the Deferred ART initiation arm achieved virological suppression (p = 0.159). At week 48, a total of 209 participants presented for HIV RNA testing (101 in the Early ART initiation arm and 108 in the Deferred ART initiation arm), and 81.2% (82/101) of participants in the Early ART initiation arm and 81.5% (88/108) of participants in the Deferred ART initiation arm achieved virological suppression (p = 1.000), as shown in Table 2.

### Antiretroviral treatment of adult HIV infection: 2012 recommendations of the international antiviral society-USA panel [^d525359e]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Context

New trial data and drug regimens that have become available in the last 2 years warrant an update to guidelines for antiretroviral therapy (ART) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults in resource-rich settings.

Objective

To provide current recommendations for the treatment of adult HIV infection with ART and use of laboratory-monitoring tools. Guidelines include when to start therapy and with what drugs, monitoring for response and toxic effects, special considerations in therapy, and managing antiretroviral failure.

Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

Data that had been published or presented in abstract form at scientific conferences in the past 2 years were systematically searched and reviewed by an International Antiviral Society-USA panel. The panel reviewed available evidence and formed recommendations by full panel consensus.

Data Synthesis

Treatment is recommended for all adults with HIV infection; the strength of the recommendation and the quality of the evidence increase with decreasing CD4 cell count and the presence of certain concurrent conditions. Recommended initial regimens include 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (tenofovir/emtricitabine or abacavir/lamivudine) plus a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (efavirenz), a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (atazanavir or darunavir), or an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (raltegravir). Alternatives in each class are recommended for patients with or at risk of certain concurrent conditions. CD4 cell count and HIV-1 RNA level should be monitored, as should engagement in care, ART adherence, HIV drug resistance, and quality-of-care indicators. Reasons for regimen switching include virologic, immunologic, or clinical failure and drug toxicity or intolerance. Confirmed treatment failure should be addressed promptly and multiple factors considered.

Conclusion

New recommendations for HIV patient care include offering ART to all patients regardless of CD4 cell count, changes in therapeutic options, and modifications in the timing and choice of ART in the setting of opportunistic illnesses such as cryptococcal disease and tuberculosis.

### When to initiate antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1-infected adults: a review for clinicians and patients [^35c1406a]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2005). Medium credibility.

One of the most controversial topics in the medical management of HIV disease is the optimal time to initiate highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-1-infected adults. Premature exposure to antiretrovirals may precipitate early evolution of resistance and unnecessary side-effects, whereas remaining off HAART until late in the course of HIV disease may lead to reduced therapeutic benefits and elevated mortality. The lack of a randomised clinical trial to consider this issue has resulted in ongoing revision of expert recommendations and substantial variability between international consensus guidelines regarding the optimal time to initiate therapy. Since this uncertainty is a source of unease for both patients and clinicians, we summarise the latest evidence regarding the optimal time to initiate HAART with consideration of the potential benefits and drawbacks of starting HIV treatment at the different levels presently recommended in leading consensus guidelines.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^6db56b34]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy for persons with acute opportunistic infections (OIs) and malignancies — clinical directives: Initiation of ART in the setting of an acute, AIDS-associated OI or malignancy can improve immune function and potentially enhance treatment success for the OI, and clinicians should refer to the Adult and Adolescent Opportunistic Infection Guidelines for a more in-depth discussion on specific OIs. When no effective therapy exists for the OI (e.g., cryptosporidiosis, microsporidiosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), ART is the only treatment that can improve immune function and clinical outcomes and ART should be initiated without delay. For immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) concerns, for some OIs such as cryptococcal and tuberculosis meningitis, immediate ART initiation may increase the risk of serious IRIS and a short delay before initiating ART may be warranted, and after ART initiation patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms associated with IRIS. For nonmeningeal tuberculosis, initiating ART during treatment for TB confers a significant survival advantage; therefore, ART should be initiated as recommended in Tuberculosis/HIV Coinfection. For people with mild to moderate cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma, prompt initiation of ART alone without chemotherapy has been associated with improvement of cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma lesions, even though initial transient progression as a manifestation of IRIS can also occur. For people with other OIs, after starting treatment for the OI, ART should be initiated as soon as feasible to improve immune function. For patients with malignancies that require chemotherapy, a diagnosis of malignancy should not delay initiation of ART, nor should initiation of ART delay treatment for the malignancy, and although an IRIS-like presentation of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after initiation of ART has been described, ART-mediated viral suppression is associated with longer survival among individuals undergoing treatment for AIDS-related lymphoma.

### When to start antiretroviral therapy: the need for an evidence base during early HIV infection [^c1c6b619]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Summary

When to initiate ART in the course of HIV infection has been debated ever since the first drug was introduced in routine care in 1986. ART contemporarily used is effective and reasonably safe. There is global consensus that the benefits: risk ratio favors use of ART in any HIV+ person with moderate HIV-induced immunodeficiency or whom suffers from severe HIV complications, whereas current evidence makes it uncertain whether this ratio is also favorable if ART is initiated earlier on the course of HIV infection. Strategic use of ART in such situations should be avoided until ongoing research efforts have been completed.

### Optimal timing of antiretroviral therapy initiation for HIV-infected adults with newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^bc57dfb2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) during tuberculosis (TB) treatment remains challenging.

Purpose

To assess evidence from randomized, controlled trials of the timing of ART initiation in HIV-infected adults with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, conference abstracts, and ClinicalTrials.gov (from January 1980 to May 2015).

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials evaluating early versus delayed ART initiation (1 to 4 weeks vs. 8 to 12 weeks after initiation of TB treatment) or deferred ART initiation (after the end of TB treatment).

Data Extraction

Three reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The main outcome measures were all-cause mortality and the TB-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS).

Data Synthesis

The 8 included trials (n = 4568) were conducted in Africa, Asia, and the United States and were generally at low risk of bias for the assessed domains. Overall, early ART reduced mortality compared with delayed ART (relative risk [RR], 0.81 [95% CI, 0.66 to 0.99]; I2 = 0%). In a prespecified subgroup analysis, early ART reduced mortality compared with delayed ART among patients with baseline CD4+ T-cell counts less than 0.050 × 109 cells/L (RR, 0.71 [CI, 0.54 to 0.93]; I2 = 0%). However, a mortality benefit from early ART was not found among those with CD4+ T-cell counts greater than 0.050 × 109 cells/L (RR, 1.05 [CI, 0.68 to 1.61]; I2 = 56%). Early ART was associated with a higher incidence of TB-IRIS than delayed ART (RR, 2.31 [CI, 1.87 to 2.86]; I2 = 19%).

Limitation

Few trials provided sufficient data for subgroup analysis.

Conclusion

Early ART in HIV-infected adults with newly diagnosed TB improves survival in those with CD4+ T-cell counts less than 0.050 × 109 cells/L, although this is associated with a 2-fold higher frequency of TB-IRIS. In patients with CD4+ T-cell counts greater than 0.050 × 109 cells/L, evidence is insufficient to support or refute a survival benefit conferred by early versus delayed ART initiation.

### Early versus delayed antiretroviral treatment in HIV-positive people with cryptococcal meningitis [^3f5349d8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Description of the intervention

The treatment of cryptococcal meningitis is usually initiated with a combination of antifungal agents (induction phase) followed by a single oral antifungal (consolidation phase) (NIH 2017a; NIH 2017b; WHO 2018). The preferred induction regimen is amphotericin B combined with flucytosine, followed by oral fluconazole for the consolidation phase, and until immune reconstitution on ART. Current guidelines recommend initiating ART within four to six weeks after cryptococcal meningitis treatment has commenced (WHO 2018).

How the intervention might work

There remains uncertainty as to when ART should be initiated in people with cryptococcal meningitis. This is related to reports of higher mortality rates among patients who initiate ART early in cryptococcal meningitis treatment (Njei 2013). Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), an exaggerated inflammatory response that can cause a paradoxical clinical deterioration soon after ART initiation, has frequently been described in association with cryptococcal meningitis. Some reports suggest that IRIS may contribute to higher mortality among HIV‐positive people who initiate ART early after a cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis as compared to starting later, however there is no clear evidence of such an association (Bicanic 2009; Müller 2010; Shelburne 2005). Additionally, in many settings where cryptococcal meningitis is prevalent, amphotericin B and flucytosine are unavailable due to resource constraints. In such settings the use of suboptimal cryptococcal meningitis treatment regimens with inadequate fungal clearance may put patients at increased risk of developing relapses and IRIS (Bicanic 2006; Loyse 2013).

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome related to cryptococcal disease has been defined as events occurring within 12 months of ART initiation, reintroduction, or regimen switching after previous failure manifesting clinically as worsening disease with one or more inflammatory manifestations of cryptococcosis (meningitis, lymphadenopathy, intracranial space‐occupying lesion or lesions, multifocal disease, cutaneous or soft‐tissue lesions, pneumonitis, or pulmonary nodules) (Haddow 2010).

Although many recommendations support delaying ART initiation in people with cryptococcal meningitis (NIH 2017a; WHO 2018), delaying ART for long periods may increase the risk of death or the development of other opportunistic infections (Lundgern 2015).

### Early versus delayed initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy for HIV-positive adults with newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis (TB-HAART): a prospective, international, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^4986d376]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

WHO guidelines recommend early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) irrespective of CD4 cell count for all patients with tuberculosis who also have HIV, but evidence supporting this approach is poor quality. We assessed the effect of timing of ART initiation on tuberculosis treatment outcomes for HIV-positive patients with CD4 counts of 220 cells per μL or more.

Methods

We did this randomised, placebo-controlled trial between Jan 1, 2008, and April 31, 2013 at 26 treatment centres in South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. We enrolled HIV-positive patients with culture-confirmed tuberculosis who had tolerated 2 weeks of tuberculosis short course chemotherapy. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to early ART (starting after 2 weeks of tuberculosis treatment) or delayed ART (placebo, then starting ART at the end of 6 months of tuberculosis treatment). Randomisation was computer generated, with permuted blocks of size eight, and stratified by CD4 count (220–349 cells per μL vs ≥ 350 cells per μL). Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation until completion of 6-months' tuberculosis treatment, after which the study was open label. The primary endpoint was a composite of failure of tuberculosis treatment, tuberculosis recurrence, and death within 12 months of starting tuberculosis treatment in the modified intention-to-treat population. Secondary endpoints included mortality. The study is registered with controlled-trials.com (ISRCTN77861053).

Findings

We screened 13,588 patients and enrolled 1675: 834 assigned early ART, 841 delayed ART. The primary endpoint was reached by 65 (8·5%) of 767 patients in the early ART group versus 71 (9·2%) of 771 in the delayed ART group (relative risk [RR] 0·91, 95% CI 0·64–1·30; p = 0·9). Of patients with a CD4 cell count of 220–349 cells per μL, 26 (7·9%) of 331 patients versus 33 (9·6%) of 342 reached the primary endpoint (RR 0·80, 95% CI 0·46–1·39; p = 0·6). For those with 350 cells per μL or more, 39 (8·9%) of 436 versus 38 (8·9%) of 429 reached the primary endpoint (RR 1·01, 95% CI 0·63–1·62; p = 0·4). Mortality did not differ significantly between treatment groups (RR 1·4, 95% CI 0·8–2·3; p = 0·23). Grade 3 and 4 adverse events occurred in 149 (18%) of 834 patients assigned early ART versus 174 (21%) of 841 assigned delayed ART (p = 0·37). 87 (10%) of 834 versus 84 (10%) of 841 had immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (p = 0·56).

Interpretation

ART can be delayed until after completion of 6 months of tuberculosis treatment for HIV-positive patients with tuberculosis who have CD4 cell counts greater than 220 cells per μL. WHO guidelines should be updated accordingly.

### Optimal timing for antiretroviral therapy initiation in patients with HIV infection and concurrent cryptococcal meningitis [^13afdab6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Currently, initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in most patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is based on the CD4-positive-t-lymphocyte count. However, the point during the course of HIV infection at which ART should be initiated in patients with concurrent cryptococcal meningitis remains unclear. The aim of this systematic review was to summarise the evidence on the optimal timing of ART initiation in patients with cryptococcal meningitis for use in clinical practice and guideline development.

Objectives

To compare the clinical and immunologic outcomes for early initiation ART (less than four weeks after starting antifungal treatment) versus later initiation of HAART (four weeks or more after starting antifungal treatment) in HIV-positive patients with concurrent cryptococcal meningitis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases from January 1980 to February 2011: PubMed, EMBASE, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, AEGIS database for conference abstracts, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. A total of 35 full text articles were identified and supplemented by a bibliographic search. We contacted researchers and relevant organizations and checked reference lists of all included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials that compared the effect of ART (consisting of three drug combinations) initiated early or delayed in HIV patients with cryptococcal meningitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and graded methodological quality. Data extraction and methodological quality were checked by a third author who resolved differences when these arose. Where clinically meaningful, we performed a meta-analysis of dichotomous outcomes using the relative risk (RR) and report the 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).

Main Results

Two eligible randomized controlled trials were included (N = 89). In our pooled analysis, we combined the clinical data for both trials comparing early initiation ART versus delayed initiation of ART. There was no statistically significant difference in mortality (RR = 1.40, 95% CI [0.42, 4.68]) in the group with early initiation of ART compared to the group with delayed initiation of ART.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review shows that there is insufficient evidence in support of either early or late initiation of ART. For the moment, because of the high risk of immune reconstitution syndrome in patients with cryptococcal meningitis, we recommend that ART initiation should be delayed until there is evidence of a sustained clinical response to antifungal therapy. However, large studies with appropriate comparison groups, and adequate follow-up are warranted to provide the evidence base for effective decision making.

### Rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy for people living with HIV [^31e3c781]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

At the end of 2017, there were approximately 36.9 million people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide, most of them in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) (WHO 2017). Although expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART) over the last decade has halved HIV‐related mortality (UNAIDS 2018), substantial challenges remain. In 2017, only 59% of PLWH were receiving ART (UNAIDS 2018), with high attrition from HIV services after HIV diagnosis (Govindasamy 2014; Losina 2010; Rosen 2011). This is particularly relevant in sub‐Saharan Africa, where it is estimated that only 57% of those diagnosed with HIV are linked to care (Kranzer 2012). Many affected individuals who disengage from services during this period return only when they have deteriorated clinically and immunologically; resulting in high morbidity and mortality after ART initiation (Fairall 2008; Grinsztejn 2014; HMC 2015). Studies conducted in Ethiopia and sub‐Saharan Africa estimate that PLWH may wait over a month to start ART, once eligibility is established (Bassett 2010; Lawn 2006; Reddy 2016; Teklu 2017). The reasons for these delays are complex and involve a combination of structural, social, and psychological patient factors (Hoehn 2017; Wachira 2014), as well as poor healthcare infrastructure in some settings (Govindasamy 2012).

One proposed intervention for improving linkage and retention of PLWH in HIV care is rapid ART initiation (starting ART as soon as possible after testing HIV‐positive, normally within seven days) (Chan 2016; Pilcher 2017). PLWH previously attended HIV services several times for counselling and medical evaluation before starting treatment. Expediting ART initiation could potentially lead to earlier viral suppression in the medium‐ and long‐term through improved uptake and adherence to ART as well as through improved retention in care (Hoenigl 2016; Pilcher 2017; Wilkinson 2015); what could result in lower overall mortality. Recent guidelines now advocate for ART initiation within seven days of HIV diagnosis (WHO 2018), with same‐day initiation for those patients who feel ready, but ART initiation should be deferred if tuberculosis or cryptococcal meningitis is suspected or confirmed, to avoid paradoxical worsening of the existing infection which can be fatal (Ford 2018; WHO 2018).

### Pulmonary manifestations of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [^e6b639af]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a common occurrence in HIV patients starting antiretroviral therapy (ART), and pulmonary involvement is an important feature of tuberculosis-IRIS and pneumocystis-IRIS. Pulmonologists need an awareness of the timing, presentation and treatment of pulmonary IRIS.

Recent Findings

Case definitions for tuberculosis-IRIS and cryptococcal-IRIS have been published by the International Network for the Study of HIV-associated IRIS (INSHI). A number of studies have addressed validation of clinical case definitions and the optimal time to commence ART after diagnosis of an opportunistic infection in HIV patients. The pathogenesis of IRIS is being assessed at a molecular level, increasing our understanding of mechanisms and possible targets for future preventive and therapeutic strategies.

Summary

Tuberculosis-IRIS, nontuberculosis mycobacterial-IRIS and pneumocystis-IRIS occur within days to weeks of starting ART, causing substantial morbidity, but low mortality. Cryptococcal-IRIS usually occurs later in the course of ART, and may be associated with appreciable mortality. Early recognition of unmasking and paradoxical IRIS affecting the lung allows timely initiation of antimicrobial and/or immunomodulatory therapies.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^30237407]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Histoplasma capsulatum primary prophylaxis in adults and adolescents with HIV is indicated for people with CD4 count < 150 cells/mm3 who are at high risk because of occupational histoplasmosis exposure or who live in a community with a hyperendemic rate of histoplasmosis (> 10 cases/100 person-years) (BI), with itraconazole 200 mg PO once daily (BI) as the preferred therapy. Criteria for discontinuing primary prophylaxis (BIII) are stable antiretroviral therapy (ART), CD4 count ≥ 150 cells/mm3 for 6 months, and undetectable HIV-1 viral load; prophylaxis should be restarted if the CD4 count falls to < 150 cells/mm3 (BIII). It may be reasonable to consider withholding primary prophylaxis if ART can be immediately initiated and there is an accompanying rise in CD4 cell count above the threshold of risk (CIII). Fluconazole has yet to show activity in a prophylaxis setting for histoplasmosis, and the role of screening for Histoplasma antigen to define people at risk for developing infection has not been studied. Data from a prospective, randomized, controlled trial indicate that itraconazole can reduce the incidence of histoplasmosis, although not mortality, in people who have advanced HIV (CD4 counts < 150 cells/mm3) and live in areas where histoplasmosis is highly endemic.

RESULTS

Patients

Seven hundred ten patients met study criteria, of whom 72 were excluded. Of the excluded patients, 51 had a prior diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis with no evidence of relapse. Serum was unavailable in 15 patients with suspected Coccidioides meningitis in whom CSF was stored. The diagnosis could not be confirmed in 6 patients.

One hundred fifty-two patients were diagnosed with an initial episode of coccidioidomycosis and 6 were relapses, for a total of 158 case episodes. A total of 486 control patients were diagnosed with other illnesses, 1 of whom was evaluated during a second illness for a total of 487 control episodes. The case and control episodes will be described as cases and controls for evaluation of diagnostic tests but as individual patients for evaluation of demographics and underlying conditions.

Demographic Characteristics and Underlying Conditions

Characteristics more common in the cases were immunocompromising conditions, male gender, and Asian race/ethnicity (Table 1). The mean age in the cases was 44.2 years and 48.1 years in controls (P = 0.0039). The median age was 43.5 years in the 60 PLWA and 44.5 years in the 92 patients without AIDS. AIDS was more common in cases than controls (Table 2). The proportion of cases with an immunosuppressive condition other than AIDS, treatment with immunosuppressive medications, and other chronic conditions was not different in cases and controls.

Disseminated disease was more common in nonwhite compared with white patients (53.1% [60/113] vs 15.0% [6/40]; P < .0001). AIDS was not a risk factor in nonwhite patients: 54.8% (23/42) of PLWA and 52.1% (37/71) of those without AIDS had disseminated disease (P = 0.8466). AIDS also was not a risk factor in white patients: 29.4% (5/17) of those with AIDS and 5.6% (1/17) of those without AIDS (P = 0.1748) had disseminated disease.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Cryptococcal meningitis and timing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) — trial data — show controversy and risks with very early ART. Optimal timing for ART initiation in patients with acute cryptococcal meningitis is controversial, with one randomized, controlled trial including 35 patients suggesting ART was safe when started within the first 14 days of diagnosis, but another African study finding significantly worse outcomes in 54 patients started within 72 hours compared with delay for at least 10 weeks. In a randomized clinical trial at 2 African sites, starting ART within 1 to 2 weeks (median 8 days) versus deferring until 5 weeks (median 36 days) during induction with deoxycholate amphotericin B (0.7–1.0 mg/kg daily) plus 800 mg of fluconazole daily resulted in a significant increase in 6-month mortality in the early ART group (45% vs 30%, P = 0.03), most pronounced during the first 8 to 30 days (P = 0.007), especially when the CSF white cell count was < 5 cells/μL (P = 0.008). The excess deaths were attributed to cryptococcosis, but whether due to meningitis or immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is unclear.

### Managing advanced HIV disease in a public health approach [^c2903a3e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

The advanced disease package is based on evidence from trials conducted in ART-naive, mainly adult patients in southern Africa.

For children, the major causes of mortality and morbidity among those with advanced HIV disease are TB, severe bacterial infections, and PCP but, in contrast with adults, cryptococcal disease is relatively rare. For this reason, extrapolation from adult studies is not appropriate and further research is needed to determine the components of the package of care for young children and optimal administration and delivery in this age group.

For ART-experienced patients with advanced HIV who have disengaged from care and then return or are failing their current regimen, the key questions relate to choice of ART regimen and timing of any switch. Restarting ART rapidly is of utmost importance, except in the presence of cryptococcal or tuberculosis meningitis. If ART interruption was complete (due, eg, to some travel duties or migration), restarting the first-line ART is possible. If partial ART exposure is suspected or the patient is severely ill, an expedited switch to a new regimen when needed should be facilitated by reducing the time between the first and second viral load test (1–3 months) and by paying increased attention to ensuring rapid turnaround and action on the results. Where rapid viral load testing is not available, the decision to switch should be assessed according to the individual clinical presentation and adherence history of the patient.

Finally, there are important regional differences with respect to coinfections. Fungal infections, notably histoplasmosis and talaromycosis, are associated with advanced HIV disease in specific geographical areas. In some high-income countries, advanced liver disease secondary to hepatitis B and C is among the leading infectious causes of mortality. The advanced HIV disease package should therefore take into account the need for adapting interventions according to local epidemiology.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

The systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and followed a study protocol (available from the corresponding author).

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials, comparative and noncomparative observational studies, and qualitative studies reporting outcomes of accelerated ART initiation (defined as offering three or more antiretroviral drugs as part of combination ART ≤ 14 days post eligibility ascertainment) were included. No language or geographical restrictions were applied. Reasons for exclusions included individuals receiving antiretroviral drugs for reasons other than treatment of HIV infection (e.g. ART for postexposure prophylaxis and preexposure prophylaxis), and studies including patients with coinfections for whom immediate ART is not advised for clinical reasons (e.g. cryptotoccal meningitis). The minimum sample size for inclusion was defined as at least 20 patients.

Using a broad search strategy combining terms for HIV infection, ART, and treatment initiation, two investigators (N.F. Z.S.), working independently and in duplicate, screened titles and abstracts from MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane library, LILACS, and Web of Science from inception to 1 August 2017. Abstracts from the International AIDS Society conferences (from 2012 to 2016) and the Conferences on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (from 2012 to 2017) were also screened to identify studies that have been recently completed but not yet published in full. Ongoing trials were sought via ClinicalTrials.gov. Database searches were supplemented by screening bibliographies of review articles and all included full-text articles. The same investigators scanned all abstracts and full-text articles and achieved consensus on final study inclusions.

Data extraction

The same two reviewers working independently (N.F. Z.S.) extracted data following a predefined protocol and using a standardized and piloted extraction form. Study characteristics included design, year, population, location, ART eligibility, and interventions. Extracted clinical outcomes included the proportion of PLHIV starting ART as well as data on: loss to follow-up, mortality, retention in care, and virological suppression. Information about patient characteristics (age, pregnancy status, and having acute vs. chronic infection) and indicators of study quality (that were used to inform an overall assessment of the certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach) were also extracted.

Regarding specific circumstances for histoplasmosis, more specifically with respect to patients with HIV (secondary prophylaxis), HIV.gov 2025 guidelines recommend to initiate long-term suppressive therapy in patients with any of the following:

- severe disseminated or CNS infection after completing ≥ 12 months of treatment

- relapse despite appropriate initial therapy.

Cryptococcal meningitis in HIV — antiretroviral therapy (ART) timing and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) — is informed by adult data and a cautious directive: a randomized trial reported early combination ART (cART) "within the first 14 days of diagnosis" was "safe and resulted in less AIDS progression/death" versus deferred cART, whereas a Zimbabwe trial showed "higher mortality" when cART began "within 72 hours" compared with waiting "at least 10 weeks". In antiretroviral-naive patients newly diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis or disseminated disease, "delay in potent ART may be prudent until the end of the first 2 weeks of induction therapy (CIII); further delays in initiating cART, especially in resource-poor settings, should be individualized".

### Opportunistic diseases in HIV-infected patients in Gabon following the administration of highly active antiretroviral therapy: a retrospective study [^1e626443]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2014). Low credibility.

Opportunistic diseases cause substantial morbidity and mortality to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) leading to immune reconstitution is the most effective treatment of preventing opportunistic diseases. This retrospective study established an epidemiologic profile of opportunistic diseases 10 years after the introduction of HAART. The HIV antiretroviral therapy-naive patients matching inclusion criteria were included. The primary outcome was the prevalence of opportunistic diseases. From January 1, 2002 to September 30, 2010, 654 opportunistic diseases were identified in 458 patients. Pulmonary tuberculosis, herpes zoster, cerebral toxoplasmosis, oral candidiasis, and severe pneumonia accounted for 22.05%, 15.94%, 14.19%, 14.19%, and 9.39%, respectively. Cryptococcal meningitis and pneumocystosis accounted for 0.44% and 0.21%, respectively. The prevalence of opportunistic diseases in Gabon remains high. New guidelines emphasize the importance of initiating antiretroviral therapy early to reconstitute the immune system, and reduce disease risk, and treat the primary opportunistic infection of pulmonary tuberculosis.

### When to start antiretroviral therapy during tuberculosis treatment? [^b2f1ed52]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Effective treatment exists for tuberculosis (TB) and for HIV, but treating both diseases simultaneously presents several challenges. This review assesses the evidence for the timing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation in patients coinfected with TB.

Recent Findings

Published evidence clearly demonstrates that TB-HIV integration is essential for improved survival, but the question of when to start ART during TB treatment is more complex. Five randomized controlled trials assessed this question: four trials showed no difference in the incidence rates of AIDS or death between TB patients initiating ART within 2 months compared to later during TB therapy, while one trial showed a significant survival gain with ART initiation within 2 weeks of TB therapy start. All five studies found improved AIDS-free survival with earlier ART initiation in TB patients with low CD4 T-cell counts, except among patients with TB meningitis. The survival benefit was, however, accompanied by increased immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome events.

Summary

The trial data support the World Health Organization recommendations on when to start ART in TB-HIV coinfected patients including earlier ART initiation in severely immune-compromised patients. However, several challenges remain in integrating TB and HIV treatment in public healthcare services. Additional research on timing of ART is needed for patients with drug-resistant and extrapulmonary TB, notably TB meningitis.
