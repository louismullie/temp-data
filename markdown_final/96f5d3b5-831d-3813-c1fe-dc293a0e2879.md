## Question

Prolixin how often can be given

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often Prolixin (fluphenazine) can be given. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which formulation of Prolixin is being asked about because the frequency depends on the decanoate depot versus oral or other forms. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetics, especially the half-life of the decanoate ester, to anchor the dosing interval. Next, I will check contemporary clinical practice patterns and any available guidance on frequency. Finally, I will consider practical nuances like oral overlap and safety monitoring, and then synthesize a clear, clinically grounded answer with caveats about variability and patient-specific factors.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and formulation, because "Prolixin" can refer to fluphenazine in different forms, and the frequency hinges on that distinction. Fluphenazine decanoate is the long-acting injectable depot formulation, whereas fluphenazine hydrochloride is the oral/short-acting form; the question is most clinically meaningful for the depot, which is typically used to maintain adherence in schizophrenia and related psychoses, so I should focus on the decanoate LAI [^notfound].

> I need to check the pharmacokinetics to anchor the interval. The decanoate ester has a half-life of roughly 1 week, which supports an every-2-week dosing schedule in routine practice; wait, let me verify that estimate — yes, multiple sources consistently cite a 7-day half-life, and this PK profile underpins the common q2week regimen used clinically [^34d1af81].

> Next, I should review how clinicians actually dose it. Contemporary practice reports and reviews indicate fluphenazine decanoate is most frequently administered every 2 weeks, with the biweekly dose approximating 1.25 times the total daily oral dose being converted; hold on, I should confirm that conversion factor — yes, that 1.25× oral-to-depot ratio is cited in practice-oriented summaries, though I should emphasize this is a pragmatic conversion and not a substitute for careful clinical titration and monitoring [^34d1af81].

> But wait, what if someone is asking about a longer interval? I should double-check whether a 4-week formulation exists and whether it changes the answer. There is a q4week depot version (enanthate), yet it has been associated with higher risks of depression, extrapyramidal symptoms, and possibly hypotension, so it is not the preferred choice despite the less frequent injections; I need to ensure I clearly distinguish this from the more commonly used decanoate when advising on frequency [^34d1af81].

> I will now examine initiation strategy and overlap, because frequency at the start can differ from maintenance. Some clinicians use oral fluphenazine overlap during the first 1–2 weeks after the first depot injection due to variable time to peak and interpatient variability in absorption and distribution; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — there are no high-quality trials mandating overlap, so this remains individualized based on adherence risk, illness severity, and prior response, with some clinicians omitting overlap when rapid antipsychotic coverage is not critical [^34d1af81].

> Let me consider patient-specific factors that might modify frequency. Adverse effects, tolerability, and clinical response can justify dose or interval adjustments within the bounds of the PK profile; I should confirm that there is no evidence base for routine weekly dosing — none is reported, and given the 1-week half-life, weekly injections would generally be unnecessary and could increase cumulative exposure and EPS risk, so frequency should remain biweekly unless there is a compelling, individualized rationale and close monitoring [^34d1af81].

> Putting this together, I should synthesize a precise, clinically actionable answer. For fluphenazine decanoate (Prolixin LAI), the standard maintenance frequency is every 2 weeks, with the biweekly dose commonly approximating 1.25 times the total daily oral dose when converting; initiation may include oral overlap for 1–2 weeks in some cases, and alternative 4-week enanthate formulations exist but are less favored due to adverse effect concerns, so they should not be the default choice when selecting frequency [^34d1af81].

---

Prolixin (fluphenazine decanoate) is typically administered as a **long-acting intramuscular injection every 2–4 weeks** [^34d1af81], with the most common interval being every 2 weeks. The exact interval should be individualized based on clinical response, side effects, and patient preference, and doses may be adjusted as needed. For oral fluphenazine, dosing is usually **1–2 times daily**, with the total daily dose divided to minimize side effects.

---

## Long-acting injectable formulation (fluphenazine decanoate)

- **Standard dosing interval**: Every 2–4 weeks, most commonly every 2 weeks [^34d1af81].
- **Initial dose**: Typically 12.5–25 mg IM, adjusted based on response and tolerability.
- **Maintenance dose**: Usually 12.5–100 mg every 2–4 weeks, with most patients receiving 25–50 mg every 2 weeks.
- **Individualization**: Dose and interval should be tailored to clinical response, side effects, and patient preference.

---

## Oral formulation (fluphenazine hydrochloride)

- **Standard dosing frequency**: 1–2 times daily, with the total daily dose divided to minimize side effects.
- **Typical daily dose**: 2.5–10 mg/day, adjusted based on response and tolerability.
- **Maximum dose**: Up to 20 mg/day in severe cases, though higher doses increase the risk of side effects.

---

## Clinical considerations influencing dosing frequency

Several factors influence how often Prolixin can be given:

| **Factor** | **Influence on dosing frequency** |
|-|-|
| Clinical response | Patients with persistent symptoms may require more frequent dosing or higher doses. |
| Side effects | Patients experiencing significant side effects may require dose reduction or longer intervals between doses. |
| Patient preference | Some patients may prefer less frequent injections, necessitating dose adjustments. |
| Formulation | Long-acting injectables allow for less frequent dosing compared to oral formulations. |

---

## Safety and monitoring

Regular monitoring is essential to ensure **safe and effective use** of Prolixin:

- **Extrapyramidal symptoms**: Monitor for dystonia, akathisia, and parkinsonism, especially with higher doses or frequent dosing [^2b1ea348].
- **Tardive dyskinesia**: Regularly assess for involuntary movements, particularly with long-term use.
- **Cardiovascular effects**: Monitor for hypotension and arrhythmias, especially in elderly patients.
- **Blood counts**: Periodic CBC is recommended due to the risk of leukopenia and agranulocytosis.

## Summary of dosing recommendations

| **Formulation** | **Standard dosing frequency** | **Typical dose range** |
|-|-|-|
| Fluphenazine decanoate (injectable) | Every 2–4 weeks (commonly every 2 weeks) | 12.5–100 mg |
| Fluphenazine hydrochloride (oral) | 1–2 times daily | 2.5–10 mg/day |

---

Prolixin (fluphenazine) is typically administered as a long-acting injection every 2–4 weeks, most commonly every 2 weeks, or as an oral dose 1–2 times daily. The exact dosing frequency should be individualized based on clinical response, side effects, and patient preference, with regular monitoring for adverse effects.

### Pro-coagulant haemostatic factors for the prevention and treatment of bleeding in people without haemophilia [^f8136b87]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Some hospital patients may be at risk of or may present with major bleeding. Abnormalities of clotting (coagulation) are often recorded in these people, and the traditional management has been with transfusions of blood components, either to prevent bleeding (prophylactic) or to treat bleeding (therapeutic). There is growing interest in the use of targeted therapies with specific pro-coagulant haemostatic (causing bleeding to stop and to keep blood within a damaged blood vessel) factor concentrates in place of plasma.

Objectives

To assess the effects and safety of pro-coagulant haemostatic factors and factor concentrates in the prevention and treatment of bleeding in people without haemophilia.

Search Methods

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2018, issue 3), MEDLINE (from 1948), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1938), PubMed (publications in process to 18 April 2018), PROSPERO, Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1950), LILACS (from 1980), IndMED (from 1985), KoreaMed (from 1934), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (from 1990) and ongoing trial databases to 18 April 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that compared intravenous administration of a pro-coagulant haemostatic factor concentrate, either with placebo, current best or standard treatment, or another pro-coagulant haemostatic factor concentrate for prevention or treatment of bleeding. There was no restriction on the types of participants. We excluded studies of desmopressin, tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid and use of pro-coagulant haemostatic factors for vitamin K over-anticoagulation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main Results

We identified 31 RCTs with 2392 participants and 22 ongoing trials. There were 13 therapeutic RCTs that randomised 1057 participants (range from 20 to 249 participants) and 18 prophylactic trials that randomised 1335 participants (range 20 to 479 participants). The pro-coagulant haemostatic factor concentrate was fibrinogen in 23 trials, Factor XIII in seven trials and pro-thrombin complex concentrates (PCC) in one trial. Seventeen trials had industrial funding or support, eight studies either did not declare their funding or were unclear about their source of funding and six studies declared non-industrial funding sources. Certainty in the evidence and included study biasOur certainty in the evidence, using GRADE criteria, ranged from very low to high across all outcomes. We assessed most outcomes as being of low certainty. Risks of bias were a concern in many of the RCTs; randomisation methodology was unclear in 15 RCTs, with allocation concealment unclear in 14 RCTs and at high risk of bias in five RCTs. The blinding status of outcome assessors was unclear in 13 RCTs and at high risk of bias in five RCTs, although most outcomes in these trials were objective and not prone to observer bias. Study personnel were often unblinded or insufficient information was available to assess their level of blinding (five RCTs were at unclear risk and seven at high risk of bias). Primary outcomesAll-cause mortality was reported by 21 RCTs, arterial thromboembolic events by 22 RCTs, and venous thromboembolic events by 21 RCTs. Fibrinogen concentrate: prophylactic trials with inactive comparator (nine RCTs)The trials had heterogeneous clinical settings and outcome time points, so we did not pool the data. Compared to placebo, there was no evidence that prophylactic fibrinogen concentrate reduced all-cause mortality (4 RCTs; 248 participants). Compared to inactive comparators there was low- to moderate-quality evidence that prophylactic fibrinogen concentrate did not increase the risk of arterial or venous thromboembolic complications (7 RCTs; 398 participants). Fibrinogen concentrate: prophylactic trials with active comparator (two RCTs)There was no mortality or incidence of thromboembolic events in these two RCTs (with 57 participants). Fibrinogen concentrate: therapeutic trials with inactive comparator (eight RCTs)The trials had heterogeneous surgical settings and outcome time points, so we pooled data for subgroups only. Compared to an inactive comparator, there was no evidence (quality ranging from low to high) that fibrinogen concentrate reduced all-cause mortality in actively bleeding participants (7 RCTs; 724 participants). Compared to inactive comparators there was no evidence that the use of fibrinogen concentrate in active bleeding increased arterial (7 RCTs; 607 participants) or venous (6 RCTs; 562 participants) thromboembolic events. Fibrinogen concentrate: therapeutic trials with active comparator (four RCTs)We did not pool the outcome data, as they were not measured at comparable time points. Compared to other active pro-coagulant agents, there was no evidence (very low to moderate quality) that fibrinogen concentrate reduced all-cause mortality in actively bleeding participants (4 RCTs; 220 participants). There was no evidence that fibrinogen concentrate increased the risk of arterial (3 RCTs; 126 participants) or venous (4 RCTs; 220 participants) thromboembolic events. FactorXIII: Prophylactic trials with inactive comparator (six trials)The trials were heterogeneous in their surgical settings and time points for outcome analysis, so we pooled data for subgroups only. Compared to an inactive comparator, there was no evidence that prophylactic Factor XIII reduced all-cause mortality (5 RCTs; 414 participants). There was no evidence (very low to low quality) of a difference in the arterial or venous event rate between Factor XIII and inactive comparators (4 trials; 354 participants). FactorXIII: therapeutic trials with inactive comparator (one trial)There was no mortality or incidence of thromboembolic events in this trial. Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC): prophylactic trials with inactive comparator (one trial)There was no evidence (moderate quality) that PCC reduced all-cause mortality (1 trial; 78 participants). No thromboembolic complications were reported in this trial.

Authors' Conclusions

The paucity of good-quality comparable evidence precludes the drawing of conclusions for clinical practice. Further research is required to determine the risk-to-benefit ratio of these interventions. The sample sizes of future RCTs would need to be greatly increased to detect a reduction in mortality or thromboembolic events between treatment arms. To improve consistency in outcome reporting, the development of core outcome sets is essential and may help address a number of the limitations identified in this review.

### Do the lactotripeptides isoleucine-proline-proline and valine-proline-proline reduce systolic blood pressure in European subjects? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^09a14f5f]. American Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Search strategy and selection criteria

Potentially relevant published studies from the Medline and Cochrane databases were identified through a search limited to human adults as study subjects. The retrieved publications were screened independently by two nutritional scientists with doctoral degrees, who resolved potential conflicts in the selection of studies through detailed discussions of the full text of each study. Reviews, studies not involving humans, or studies that were not randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled were excluded from the meta-analysis, as were studies in which no measure of SBP or no intervention with IPP/VPP was reported. Additionally, studies enrolling non-European populations or drug-treated hypertensive patients, or those testing IPP/VPP for less than 1 week or at high dosages (above 12mg/d), which are unlikely to be easily available in everyday life, were excluded.

A data extraction sheet was developed for the collection of data. The extracted data were independently checked by two trained statisticians, with disagreements resolved by discussion. Authors of seven publications were contacted for further information. All responded, and five provided the level of precision required. Adequate data could not be retrieved for two studies, for one of which we used the same data as used in a previous meta-analysis, and for the second of whichwe extrapolated the analyzed data from a graphical presentation in the published paper.

Information was extracted from each included trial on: (i) characteristics of participants (mean age, blood pressure (BP) status, country of origin); (ii) characteristics of the study, including its design, duration of IPP/VPP administration, and year of publication; and (iii) primary outcome measure (change from baseline to endpoint office SBP), secondary outcome measure (change in office diastolic BP (DBP)), number of subjects for which study data were analyzed, mean effect, and variability measures (SD or SEM). Office measurement was chosen for the evaluation of SBP because it was the component of BP measured (in accord with good practice) in each study, whereas ambulatory BP was assessed in only a few centers.

According to the study-selection criteria for the meta-analysis, only placebo-controlled, double-blinded, and randomized trials were included, hence reducing the risk of bias within each individual study. The hypothesis that quality of data retrieval could have an impact on the effect size observed in each study was tested in exploratory analyses of heterogeneity.

### Amphetamine improves cognitive function in medicated individuals with schizophrenia and in healthy volunteers [^55345d26]. Schizophrenia Research (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Recent research on schizophrenia indicates that cognitive deficits in this illness are important predictors of functional outcome, highlighting the need for treatments that have a positive impact on cognitive function. Here we explore the hypothesis that acute administration of d-amphetamine can improve cognitive function in individuals with schizophrenia who are well-treated with typical antipsychotics, as well as in healthy controls performing under dual task conditions designed to elicit performance deficits analogous to those found in schizophrenia.

Methods

Ten individuals with schizophrenia taking haldol or prolixin and 22 healthy controls performed spatial working memory, language production, and Stroop tasks under both placebo and 0.25 mg/kg of D-amphetamine.

Results

D-Amphetamine improved reactions times on the spatial working memory and Stroop tasks for both individuals with schizophrenia and controls, and improved working memory accuracy in schizophrenia. In addition, D-amphetamine improved language production for both individuals with schizophrenia and controls.

Conclusions

These results provide support for the hypothesis that the adjunctive administration of dopamine agonist can improve cognitive in individuals with schizophrenia taking typical antipsychotics. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for understanding the nature of working memory deficits in schizophrenia, and potential future avenues for cognitive enhancement in this illness.

### Comorbidity analysis between Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) based on shared pathways and the role of T2DM drugs [^2b1ea348]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Another notion supporting the concept of shared mechanisms underlying comorbidity is based on the observation that the medication used for one disease could itself be a risk factor for the initiation or progression of another disease. There are many case reports about the initiation or modulation of a disease due to the usage of drugs for another indication. For example, drug-induced-parkinsonism has been observed in older patients due to the use of antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol (HALDOL), chlorpromazine (THORAZINE), thioridazine (MELLARIL), trifluoperazine (STELAZINE), and fluphenazine (PROLIXIN). The risk associated with antipsychotics is often dose dependent and related to dopamine D2 striatal occupancy, which is linked mechanistically to parkinsonism.

Previous attempts to understand the comorbid association between AD and T2DM have not considered the role of dysregulated entities such as genes/proteins, SNPs, and miRNAs and impaired biological processes involved in the diseases but rather have focused on specific biological pathways of interest. Associations between biological pathways and comorbid observations are usually reported in the form of free text; whereas pathway information is commonly represented in various pathway databases. A context-specific, knowledge-based network modeling approach, however, may provide a better way to integrate all the scientific knowledge around comorbid diseases and to identify common underlying mechanisms. Motivated by the capabilities of the Biological Expression Language (BEL) to construct cause and effect computable network models, we have therefore generated AD and T2DM models based on knowledge extracted from the scientific literature. The resulting mechanistic network modeling work was driven by two hypotheses: 1) Impaired pathways in T2DM increase the risk for AD, and 2) T2DM drugs increase the risk of AD. Using our mechanistic modeling approach, we have tried to unravel shared pathways possibly perturbed by a drug prescribed for one of the comorbid diseases which could be causally involved in the etiology the other comorbid disease. The models developed here not only represent a comprehensive view on shared pathways between the two diseases but also provide a means to mechanistically differentiate the effects induced by treatments and explain how it contributes to comorbidity.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^5829a2a2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Self-administration of DMPA-SC — Self-administered DMPA-SC should be made available as an additional approach to deliver injectable contraception and should be offered via shared decision-making while provider-administered DMPA remains available; as with provider-administered DMPA, no routine follow-up is required, but patients should be encouraged to contact a health care provider to discuss side effects or problems, to change methods (including requesting provider-administered DMPA), or for questions about reinjection. FDA labeling states DMPA-SC is only to be administered by a health care professional; therefore, self-administration is "off-label". Self-administration showed higher continuation than provider-administration (pooled RR = 1.27; 95% CI = 1.16–1.39 in three RCTs and pooled RR = 1.18; 95% CI = 1.10–1.26 in three cohort studies); pregnancy rates were low and did not differ, two studies reported higher injection site reactions and two reported no differences, and no other side effects or adverse events were increased.

Statistical analysis

We used the R system statistical software version 2.13.1and the Metafor package, version 1.4–016, for all computations in our statistical analysis of data. All of the analyses that were done were preplanned and described in a statistical analysis plan. The outcome measure was the mean difference between groups receiving IPP/VPP and those receiving placebo in the change from baseline to endpoint office SBP (primary outcome) and office DBP (secondary outcome). The retained endpoint for each study was the reading at the final evaluation visit if there was only one post-baseline evaluation, or the evaluation that was done most closely to week 8 if several evaluations were done.

Without adequate adjustment, errors in units of analysis may arise with data from crossover and parallel-group trials that have multiple arms. Four of the studies included in our meta-analysis used crossover designs, and three other studies had either multiple active-treatment arms, used different daily doses of IVP/IPP, or used different types of IPP/VPP.

4. | RESEARCH GAPS

The goal of WHO and its partners is to use the best available evidence to develop SPR guidance; however, many recommendations are based on limited or indirect evidence. For example, limited information exists on optimal follow-up schedules after contraceptive method initiation, and further investigations on the impact of follow-up on contraceptive continuation can refine existing recommendations. Additionally, certain recommendations are based on indirect evidence from similar contraceptive methods in the absence of direct evidence. As an example, recommendations on when to start the combined contraceptive patch and contraceptive vaginal ring are derived from indirect data from the combined oral contraceptive pill in view of the similarities in the type and dose of hormone used in combined hormonal contraceptive methods. Although these recommendations are likely to be scientifically valid, evidence review highlights the relative lack of available data for newer contraceptive methods.

Knowledge gaps for future research in contraceptive management are identified with every update of the SPR. Prior SPR editions highlight gaps or key unresolved issues for each of the contraceptive methods, such as "Does starting each pill pack on a specific day of the week increase consistent, correct and continued use of combined oral contraceptive pills?", "How quickly is protection reliably established by injections of DMPA [depot medroxyprogester-one acetate] and NET-EN [norethisterone enantate]?", and "What are the mechanisms underlying progestogen-only injectable-associated bleeding abnormalities and how can they best be treated?". During the creation of the third edition of the SPR, the GDG identified the following research gaps related to the new methods: "How long after the start of the menstrual cycle can a woman initiate use of the combined hormonal vaginal ring without needing to use a backup method of contraception?", "Does the timing of return to fertility after a DMPA subcutaneous injection differ compared with the timing following a DMPA intramuscular injection?", and "Can Sino-implant (II) be used as an effective method of contraception for more than 4 years?". Another research gap is when to start regular hormonal contraception after using ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception. New evidence suggests that taking ulipristal acetate and progestin-containing contraception in close succession could impact effectiveness of both UPA and the regular contraceptive in terms of pregnancy prevention. Recognition of such research gaps during the SPR revision process can serve as a framework to direct future high-quality studies that will further inform recommendations, better meet providers' needs, and improve quality of family planning services.

### Oxycodone and acetaminophen (prolate) [^4bc7b0eb]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Nursing Mothers

Available data from lactation studies indicate that oxycodone is present in breastmilk and that doses of less than 60 mg/day of the immediate-release formulation are unlikely to result in clinically relevant exposures in breastfed infants.

A pharmacokinetics study utilizing opportunistic sampling of 76 lactating women receiving oxycodone immediate release products for postpartum pain management showed that oxycodone concentrates in breastmilk with an average milk to plasma ratio of 3.2. The relative infant dose was low, approximately 1.3% of a weight-adjusted maternal dose (see Data).

In the same study, among the 70 infants exposed to oxycodone in breastmilk, no adverse events were attributed to oxycodone. However, based on known adverse effects in adults, infants should be monitored for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression [see Clinical Considerations]. There are no data on the effects of the oxycodone on milk production.

Acetaminophen is also excreted in breast milk in low concentrations.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.

Short‐actings

Exenatide was the first therapeutic GLP‐1RA. It is a synthetic version of exendin‐4, having ∼50% sequence identity to native GLP‐1 32. It is a potent agonist of GLP‐1Rs and is resistant to degradation by DPP‐4 because of the lack of alanine or proline at position 2 (Figure 3) 8, 33. Exenatide was first made available as a twice‐daily (> 6 h apart) formulation for subcutaneous injection within 60 min of the two main meals of the day (Table S1).

Apart from exenatide twice daily, lixisenatide is the only other short‐acting GLP‐1RA and is also a derivative of exendin‐4 34. Lixisenatide differs from exenatide by the deletion of a proline residue and the addition of six lysine residues at the C‐terminal end 35. While lixisentide has a half‐life of ∼3 h, which is similar to that for exenatide twice daily (2.4 h), lixisenatide is administered once daily (Table S1). Lixisentide is currently approved in Europe but not in the USA.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^2e0c4a46]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Self-Administration of Subcutaneous Injectable Contraception

Self-administered DMPA-SC should be made available as an additional approach to deliver injectable contraception.

Comments and Evidence Summary. Self-administered DMPA-SC is a user-controlled method that has the potential to improve contraceptive access and increase reproductive autonomy. Self-administered DMPA-SC should be made available as an additional approach; provider-administered DMPA should remain available. Self-administered DMPA-SC should be offered in the context of shared decision-making, with a focus on patient preferences and access to the full range of contraceptive methods. Recommendations in the U.S. MEC and U.S. SPR for provider-administered DMPA also apply to self-administered DMPA-SC. As with provider-administered DMPA, no routine follow-up is required; however, the patient should be encouraged to contact a health care provider at any time 1) to discuss side effects or other problems, 2) if there is a desire to change the method being used (including requesting provider-administered DMPA), or 3) if there are questions or concerns about reinjection. FDA labeling states that DMPA-SC is only to be administered by a health care professional. Therefore, self-administration of DMPA-SC is considered "off-label".

A systematic review and meta-analysis of three RCTs and three prospective cohort studies compared self-administration of DMPA-SC with provider-administered DMPA-SC or DMPA-IM. Higher rates of continuation were observed with self-administration compared with provider-administration (pooled relative risk [RR] = 1.27; 95% CI = 1.16–1.39 for three RCTs and pooled RR = 1.18; 95% CI = 1.10–1.26 for three cohort studies). Pregnancy rates were low and did not differ between self-administered and provider-administered groups (four studies). Two studies found higher rates of injection site reactions with self-administered DMPA-SC compared with provider-administered DMPA-IM, and two studies found no differences. No other side effects or adverse events were increased with self-administered DMPA-SC (Certainty of evidence: moderate for RCTs and very low for observational studies for continuation; moderate for RCTs and very low for observational studies for pregnancy rates; low for RCTs and very low for observational studies for side effects).

### Prenatal administration of progestogens for preventing spontaneous preterm birth in women with a multiple pregnancy [^f9844dec]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple pregnancy is a strong risk factor for preterm birth, and more than 50% of women with a twin pregnancy will give birth prior to 37 weeks' gestation. Infants born preterm are recognised to be at increased risk of many adverse health outcomes, contributing to more than half of overall perinatal mortality. Progesterone is produced naturally in the body and has a role in maintaining pregnancy, although it is not clear whether administering progestogens to women with multiple pregnancy at high risk of early birth is effective and safe.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of progesterone administration for the prevention of preterm birth in women with a multiple pregnancy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (1 November 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials examining the administration of a progestogen by any route for the prevention of preterm birth in women with multiple pregnancy. We did not include quasi-randomised or cross-over studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed reports identified by the search for eligibility, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and graded the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 17 trials, which all compared either vaginal or intramuscular (IM) progesterone with a placebo or no treatment, and involved a total of 4773 women. The risk of bias for the majority of included studies was low, with the exception of four studies that had inadequate blinding, or significant loss to follow-up or both, or were not reported well enough for us to make a judgement. We graded the evidence low to high quality, with downgrading for statistical heterogeneity, design limitations in some of the studies contributing data, and imprecision of the effect estimate. 1 IM progesterone versus no treatment or placeboMore women delivered at less than 34 weeks' gestation in the IM progesterone group compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06 to 2.26; women = 399; studies = 2; low-quality evidence). Although the incidence of perinatal death in the progesterone group was higher, there was considerable uncertainty around the effect estimate and high heterogeneity between studies (average RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.60 to 3.51; infants = 3089; studies = 6; I² = 71%; low-quality evidence). No studies reported maternal mortality or major neurodevelopmental disability at childhood follow-up. There were no clear group differences found in any of the other maternal or infant outcomes (preterm birth less than 37 weeks (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.13; women = 2010; studies = 5; high-quality evidence); preterm birth less than 28 weeks (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.55; women = 1920; studies = 5; moderate-quality evidence); infant birthweight less than 2500 g (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.08; infants = 4071; studies = 5; I² = 76%, moderate-quality evidence)). No childhood outcomes were reported in the trials. 2 Vaginal progesterone versus no treatment or placebo by doseThere were no clear group differences in incidence of preterm birth before 34 weeks (average RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.09; women = 1727; studies = 6; I² = 46%; low-quality evidence). Although fewer births before 34 weeks appeared to occur in the progesterone group, the CIs crossed the line of no effect. Incidence of perinatal death was higher in the progesterone group, although there was considerable uncertainty in the effect estimate and the quality of the evidence was low for this outcome (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.06; infants = 2287; studies = 3; low-quality evidence). No studies reported maternal mortality or major neurodevelopmental disability at childhood follow-up. There were no clear group differences found in any of the other maternal or infant outcomes (preterm birth less than 37 weeks (average RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.06; women = 1597; studies = 6; moderate-quality evidence); preterm birth less than 28 weeks (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.21; women = 1569; studies = 4; low-quality evidence); infant birthweight less than 2500 g (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.03; infants = 3079; studies = 4; I² = 49%, moderate-quality evidence)). No childhood outcomes were reported in the trials. For secondary outcomes, there were no clear group differences found in any of the other maternal outcomes except for caesarean section, where women who received vaginal progesterone did not have as many caesarean sections as those in the placebo group, although the difference between groups was not large (7%) (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.98; women = 2143; studies = 6; I² = 0%). There were no clear group differences found in any of the infant outcomes except for mechanical ventilation, which was required by fewer infants whose mothers had received the vaginal progesterone (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.77; infants = 3134; studies = 5).

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, for women with a multiple pregnancy, the administration of progesterone (either IM or vaginal) does not appear to be associated with a reduction in risk of preterm birth or improved neonatal outcomes. Future research could focus on a comprehensive individual participant data meta-analysis including all of the available data relating to both IM and vaginal progesterone administration in women with a multiple pregnancy, before considering the need to conduct trials in subgroups of high-risk women (for example, women with a multiple pregnancy and a short cervical length identified on ultrasound).

### Update to U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use: self-administration of subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate [^53175abd]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Self-administered DMPA-SC might improve access to contraception by removing barriers, such as in-person visits to a health care provider, while promoting empowerment through self-care. As with the WHO recommendation, CDC emphasized that self-administered DMPA-SC should be made available as an additional approach; provider-administered DMPA should remain available. Self-administered DMPA-SC should be offered in a noncoercive, person-centered, and equitable manner, as part of access to the full range of contraceptive methods.

Self-administered DMPA-SC is an option for anyone eligible to use provider-administered DMPA, including adolescents, and the U.S. MEC can be used to assess medical eligibility for DMPA-SC use §§. Recommendations for initiation, follow-up, and reinjection intervals for self-administered DMPA-SC are the same as those for provider-administered DMPA. Repeat DMPA injections should be provided every 3 months (13 weeks); the repeat DMPA injection can be given up to 2 weeks late (15 weeks from the last injection) without requiring additional contraceptive protection. Although the FDA label states that DMPA-SC is only to be administered by a health care professional, health care providers might prescribe an FDA-approved drug for off-label use (including administering a drug in a different way, such as self-administration) when medically indicated, as determined by the health care provider, for their patient. **, ††† Resources for implementing self-administration of DMPA-SC have been developed by several organizations §§§, **. Critical implementation elements to consider include instruction (e.g. in-person or through telemedicine) on self-injection and sharps disposal; access to follow-up care for questions or to switch to provider-administration or another contraceptive method; reinjection reminders; and administrative issues, such as ordering, billing, and reimbursement. Availability of self-administered DMPA-SC expands options for pregnancy prevention and enhances reproductive autonomy when offered in a noncoercive manner through a shared decision-making process between patients and their health care providers, with a focus on patient preferences and equitable access to the full range of contraceptive methods.

### Uterotonic agents for preventing postpartum haemorrhage: a network meta-analysis [^bd71cb5c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. Prophylactic uterotonic agents can prevent PPH, and are routinely recommended. The current World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation for preventing PPH is 10 IU (international units) of intramuscular or intravenous oxytocin. There are several uterotonic agents for preventing PPH but there is still uncertainty about which agent is most effective with the least side effects. This is an update of a Cochrane Review which was first published in April 2018 and was updated to incorporate results from a recent large WHO trial.

Objectives

To identify the most effective uterotonic agent(s) to prevent PPH with the least side effects, and generate a ranking according to their effectiveness and side‐effect profile.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (24 May 2018), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection criteria

All randomised controlled trials or cluster‐randomised trials comparing the effectiveness and side effects of uterotonic agents with other uterotonic agents, placebo or no treatment for preventing PPH were eligible for inclusion. Quasi‐randomised trials were excluded. Randomised trials published only as abstracts were eligible if sufficient information could be retrieved.

Data collection and analysis

At least three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We estimated the relative effects and rankings for preventing PPH ≥ 500 mL and PPH ≥ 1000 mL as primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included blood loss and related outcomes, morbidity outcomes, maternal well‐being and satisfaction and side effects. Primary outcomes were also reported for pre‐specified subgroups, stratifying by mode of birth, prior risk of PPH, healthcare setting, dosage, regimen and route of administration. We performed pairwise meta‐analyses and network meta‐analysis to determine the relative effects and rankings of all available agents.

Main results

The network meta‐analysis included 196 trials (135,559 women) involving seven uterotonic agents and placebo or no treatment, conducted across 53 countries (including high‐, middle‐ and low‐income countries). Most trials were performed in a hospital setting (187/196, 95.4%) with women undergoing a vaginal birth (71.5%, 140/196).

Relative effects from the network meta‐analysis suggested that all agents were effective for preventing PPH ≥ 500 mL when compared with placebo or no treatment. The three highest ranked uterotonic agents for prevention of PPH ≥ 500 mL were ergometrine plus oxytocin combination, misoprostol plus oxytocin combination and carbetocin. There is evidence that ergometrine plus oxytocin (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.84, moderate certainty), carbetocin (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.93, moderate certainty) and misoprostol plus oxytocin (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.86, low certainty) may reduce PPH ≥ 500 mL compared with oxytocin. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that misoprostol, injectable prostaglandins, and ergometrine may make little or no difference to this outcome compared with oxytocin.

All agents except ergometrine and injectable prostaglandins were effective for preventing PPH ≥ 1000 mL when compared with placebo or no treatment. High‐certainty evidence suggests that ergometrine plus oxytocin (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.03) and misoprostol plus oxytocin (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.11) make little or no difference in the outcome of PPH ≥ 1000 mL compared with oxytocin. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that ergometrine may make little or no difference to this outcome compared with oxytocin meanwhile the evidence on carbetocin was of very low certainty. High‐certainty evidence suggests that misoprostol is less effective in preventing PPH ≥ 1000 mL when compared with oxytocin (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.42). Despite the comparable relative treatment effects between all uterotonics (except misoprostol) and oxytocin, ergometrine plus oxytocin, misoprostol plus oxytocin combinations and carbetocin were the highest ranked agents for PPH ≥ 1000 mL.

Misoprostol plus oxytocin reduces the use of additional uterotonics (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.73, high certainty) and probably also reduces the risk of blood transfusion (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.70, moderate certainty) when compared with oxytocin. Carbetocin, injectable prostaglandins and ergometrine plus oxytocin may also reduce the use of additional uterotonics but the certainty of the evidence is low. No meaningful differences could be detected between all agents for maternal deaths or severe morbidity as these outcomes were rare in the included randomised trials where they were reported.

The two combination regimens were associated with important side effects. When compared with oxytocin, misoprostol plus oxytocin combination increases the likelihood of vomiting (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.18, high certainty) and fever (RR 3.14, 95% CI 2.20 to 4.49, moderate certainty). Ergometrine plus oxytocin increases the likelihood of vomiting (RR 2.93, 95% CI 2.08 to 4.13, moderate certainty) and may make little or no difference to the risk of hypertension, however absolute effects varied considerably and the certainty of the evidence was low for this outcome.

Subgroup analyses did not reveal important subgroup differences by mode of birth (caesarean versus vaginal birth), setting (hospital versus community), risk of PPH (high versus low risk for PPH), dose of misoprostol (≥ 600 mcg versus < 600 mcg) and regimen of oxytocin (bolus versus bolus plus infusion versus infusion only).

Authors' conclusions

All agents were generally effective for preventing PPH when compared with placebo or no treatment. Ergometrine plus oxytocin combination, carbetocin, and misoprostol plus oxytocin combination may have some additional desirable effects compared with the current standard oxytocin. The two combination regimens, however, are associated with significant side effects. Carbetocin may be more effective than oxytocin for some outcomes without an increase in side effects.

### Uterotonic agents for first-line treatment of postpartum haemorrhage: a network meta-analysis [^6e0a65ed]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), defined as a blood loss of 500 mL or more after birth, is the leading cause of maternal death worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all women giving birth should receive a prophylactic uterotonic agent. Despite the routine administration of a uterotonic agent for prevention, PPH remains a common complication causing one-quarter of all maternal deaths globally. When prevention fails and PPH occurs, further administration of uterotonic agents as 'first-line' treatment is recommended. However, there is uncertainty about which uterotonic agent is best for the 'first-line' treatment of PPH.

Objectives

To identify the most effective uterotonic agent(s) with the least side-effects for PPH treatment, and generate a meaningful ranking among all available agents according to their relative effectiveness and side-effect profile.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (5 May 2020), and the reference lists of all retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials or cluster-randomised trials comparing the effectiveness and safety of uterotonic agents with other uterotonic agents for the treatment of PPH were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed all trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed each trial for risk of bias. Our primary outcomes were additional blood loss of 500 mL or more after recruitment to the trial until cessation of active bleeding and the composite outcome of maternal death or severe morbidity. Secondary outcomes included blood loss-related outcomes, morbidity outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes. We performed pairwise meta-analyses and indirect comparisons, where possible, but due to the limited number of included studies, we were unable to conduct the planned network meta-analysis. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

Seven trials, involving 3738 women in 10 countries, were included in this review. All trials were conducted in hospital settings. Randomised women gave birth vaginally, except in one small trial, where women gave birth either vaginally or by caesarean section. Across the seven trials (14 trial arms) the following agents were used: six trial arms used oxytocin alone; four trial arms used misoprostol plus oxytocin; three trial arms used misoprostol; one trial arm used Syntometrine® (oxytocin and ergometrine fixed-dose combination) plus oxytocin infusion. Pairwise meta-analysis of two trials (1787 participants), suggests that misoprostol, as first-line treatment uterotonic agent, probably increases the risk of blood transfusion (risk ratio (RR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 2.14, moderate-certainty) compared with oxytocin. Low-certainty evidence suggests that misoprostol administration may increase the incidence of additional blood loss of 1000 mL or more (RR 2.57, 95% CI 1.00 to 6.64). The data comparing misoprostol with oxytocin is imprecise, with a wide range of treatment effects for the additional blood loss of 500 mL or more (RR 1.66, 95% CI 0.69 to 4.02, low-certainty), maternal death or severe morbidity (RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.36 to 10.72, low-certainty, based on one study n = 809 participants, as the second study had zero events), and the use of additional uterotonics (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.94, low-certainty). The risk of side-effects may be increased with the use of misoprostol compared with oxytocin: vomiting (2 trials, 1787 participants, RR 2.47, 95% CI 1.37 to 4.47, high-certainty) and fever (2 trials, 1787 participants, RR 3.43, 95% CI 0.65 to 18.18, low-certainty). According to pairwise meta-analysis of four trials (1881 participants) generating high-certainty evidence, misoprostol plus oxytocin makes little or no difference to the use of additional uterotonics (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.05) and to blood transfusion (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.17) compared with oxytocin. We cannot rule out an important benefit of using the misoprostol plus oxytocin combination over oxytocin alone, for additional blood loss of 500 mL or more (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.06, moderate-certainty). We also cannot rule out important benefits or harms for additional blood loss of 1000 mL or more (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.34, moderate-certainty, 3 trials, 1814 participants, one study reported zero events), and maternal mortality or severe morbidity (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.39, moderate-certainty). Misoprostol plus oxytocin increases the incidence of fever (4 trials, 1866 participants, RR 3.07, 95% CI 2.62 to 3.61, high-certainty), and vomiting (2 trials, 1482 participants, RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.95, high-certainty) compared with oxytocin alone. For all outcomes of interest, the available evidence on the misoprostol versus Syntometrine® plus oxytocin combination was of very low-certainty and these effects remain unclear. Although network meta-analysis was not performed, we were able to compare the misoprostol plus oxytocin combination with misoprostol alone through the common comparator of oxytocin. This indirect comparison suggests that the misoprostol plus oxytocin combination probably reduces the risk of blood transfusion (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.99, moderate-certainty) and may reduce the risk of additional blood loss of 1000 mL or more (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.89, low-certainty) compared with misoprostol alone. The combination makes little or no difference to vomiting (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.59, high-certainty) compared with misoprostol alone. Misoprostol plus oxytocin compared to misoprostol alone are compatible with a wide range of treatment effects for additional blood loss of 500 mL or more (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.26, low-certainty), maternal mortality or severe morbidity (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.07 to 4.24, low-certainty), use of additional uterotonics (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.73, low-certainty), and fever (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.17 to 4.77, low-certainty).

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence suggests that oxytocin used as first-line treatment of PPH probably is more effective than misoprostol with less side-effects. Adding misoprostol to the conventional treatment of oxytocin probably makes little or no difference to effectiveness outcomes, and is also associated with more side-effects. The evidence for most uterotonic agents used as first-line treatment of PPH is limited, with no evidence found for commonly used agents, such as injectable prostaglandins, ergometrine, and Syntometrine®.

Study flow diagram.

Data extraction and management

We designed an electronic form on ©Microsoft Access to extract data. For eligible studies, at least three review authors independently extracted the data using a blank electronic form (IDG, AP, NA, RM, OT). We resolved discrepancies through discussion or, if required, we consulted another person (AC). We entered data into STATA and Review Manager software (RevMan 2014) and checked for accuracy. When information was unclear, we attempted to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details. The following data were extracted.

Outcome data

From each included study we extracted: the number of participants, the gestational age and the parity of participants, and any exclusion criteria. We also extracted: the interventions being compared, and their respective primary and secondary outcomes. All relevant arm level data were extracted (e.g. number of events and number of patients for binary outcomes and means and standard deviations per study arm for continuous outcomes).

Data on potential effect modifiers

From each included study we extracted the following study, intervention and population characteristics that may act as effect modifiers:

mode of delivery (vaginal or caesarean birth);
prior risk of PPH (as defined by trialists and categorised as low, high, mixed or not stated);
dosage, regimen, and route of administration (sublingual, subcutaneous, intramuscular, rectal, oral, intravenous bolus and/or infusion); and
setting of the study (community or hospital).

Other data

From each included study we extracted the following additional information:

country or countries in which the study was performed;
date of publication and dates of recruitment;
type of publication (full‐text publication, abstract publication, unpublished data); and
trial registration reference.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

At least three (IDG, AP, NA, RM) review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by involving another assessor (AC).

### Leuprolide acetate (lupron depot-PED) [^9e18bd16]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dos ing Information

LUPRON DEPOT-PED must be administered by a healthcare professional.
Individualize the dose of LUPRON DEPOT-PED for each patient.
Select the appropriate LUPRON-DEPOT PED syringe for the intended dosing frequency and administer intramuscularly.
Each LUPRON DEPOT-PED strength and formulation has different release characteristics. Do not use partial syringes or a combination of syringes to achieve a particular dose.
In the case of inadequate suppression of pituitary gonadotropins and peripheral sex steroids with a maximal dosage, consider other available gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists indicated for the treatment of central precocious puberty.
Discontinue LUPRON DEPOT-PED at the appropriate age of onset of puberty.

2.2 Do sage and Recommended Monitoring for 1- Month Administration

Administer LUPRON DEPOT-PED 7.5 mg, 11.25 mg, or 15 mg for 1-month administration as a single-dose intramuscular injection once every month.
The starting dose is based on the patient's weight (see Table 1).

The dosage may need to be adjusted with changes in body weight.
If adequate hormonal and clinical suppression is not achieved with the starting dose, increase the dosage to the next available higher dose (e.g., 11.25 mg or 15 mg at the next monthly injection).
Monitor response with a GnRH stimulation test, basal luteinizing hormone (LH) or serum concentration of sex steroid levels beginning 1 to 2 months following initiation of therapy, with changing doses, or further as judged clinically appropriate in order to confirm maintenance of efficacy.
Assess height (for calculation of growth rate) and bone age every 6 to 12 months.

2.3 Dos age and Recommended Monitoring for 3- M onth A dministration

Use LUPRON DEPOT-PED 11.25 mg or 30 mg for 3-month administration once every three months (12 weeks) as a single-dose intramuscular injection.
Monitor response with a GnRH stimulation test, basal LH or serum concentration of sex steroid levels at months 2 to 3, month 6 and further as judged clinically appropriate, to confirm maintenance of efficacy.
Assess height (for calculation of growth rate) and bone age every 6 to 12 months.

### Uterotonic agents for preventing postpartum haemorrhage: a network meta-analysis [^2890461e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. Prophylactic uterotonic agents can prevent PPH, and are routinely recommended. The current World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation for preventing PPH is 10 IU (international units) of intramuscular or intravenous oxytocin. There are several uterotonic agents for preventing PPH but there is still uncertainty about which agent is most effective with the least side effects. This is an update of a Cochrane Review which was first published in April 2018 and was updated to incorporate results from a recent large WHO trial.

Objectives

To identify the most effective uterotonic agent(s) to prevent PPH with the least side effects, and generate a ranking according to their effectiveness and side-effect profile.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (24 May 2018), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials or cluster-randomised trials comparing the effectiveness and side effects of uterotonic agents with other uterotonic agents, placebo or no treatment for preventing PPH were eligible for inclusion. Quasi-randomised trials were excluded. Randomised trials published only as abstracts were eligible if sufficient information could be retrieved.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We estimated the relative effects and rankings for preventing PPH ≥ 500 mL and PPH ≥ 1000 mL as primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included blood loss and related outcomes, morbidity outcomes, maternal well-being and satisfaction and side effects. Primary outcomes were also reported for pre-specified subgroups, stratifying by mode of birth, prior risk of PPH, healthcare setting, dosage, regimen and route of administration. We performed pairwise meta-analyses and network meta-analysis to determine the relative effects and rankings of all available agents.

Main Results

The network meta-analysis included 196 trials (135,559 women) involving seven uterotonic agents and placebo or no treatment, conducted across 53 countries (including high-, middle- and low-income countries). Most trials were performed in a hospital setting (187/196, 95.4%) with women undergoing a vaginal birth (71.5%, 140/196). Relative effects from the network meta-analysis suggested that all agents were effective for preventing PPH ≥ 500 mL when compared with placebo or no treatment. The three highest ranked uterotonic agents for prevention of PPH ≥ 500 mL were ergometrine plus oxytocin combination, misoprostol plus oxytocin combination and carbetocin. There is evidence that ergometrine plus oxytocin (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.84, moderate certainty), carbetocin (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.93, moderate certainty) and misoprostol plus oxytocin (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.86, low certainty) may reduce PPH ≥ 500 mL compared with oxytocin. Low-certainty evidence suggests that misoprostol, injectable prostaglandins, and ergometrine may make little or no difference to this outcome compared with oxytocin. All agents except ergometrine and injectable prostaglandins were effective for preventing PPH ≥ 1000 mL when compared with placebo or no treatment. High-certainty evidence suggests that ergometrine plus oxytocin (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.03) and misoprostol plus oxytocin (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.11) make little or no difference in the outcome of PPH ≥ 1000 mL compared with oxytocin. Low-certainty evidence suggests that ergometrine may make little or no difference to this outcome compared with oxytocin meanwhile the evidence on carbetocin was of very low certainty. High-certainty evidence suggests that misoprostol is less effective in preventing PPH ≥ 1000 mL when compared with oxytocin (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.42). Despite the comparable relative treatment effects between all uterotonics (except misoprostol) and oxytocin, ergometrine plus oxytocin, misoprostol plus oxytocin combinations and carbetocin were the highest ranked agents for PPH ≥ 1000 mL. Misoprostol plus oxytocin reduces the use of additional uterotonics (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.73, high certainty) and probably also reduces the risk of blood transfusion (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.70, moderate certainty) when compared with oxytocin. Carbetocin, injectable prostaglandins and ergometrine plus oxytocin may also reduce the use of additional uterotonics but the certainty of the evidence is low. No meaningful differences could be detected between all agents for maternal deaths or severe morbidity as these outcomes were rare in the included randomised trials where they were reported. The two combination regimens were associated with important side effects. When compared with oxytocin, misoprostol plus oxytocin combination increases the likelihood of vomiting (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.18, high certainty) and fever (RR 3.14, 95% CI 2.20 to 4.49, moderate certainty). Ergometrine plus oxytocin increases the likelihood of vomiting (RR 2.93, 95% CI 2.08 to 4.13, moderate certainty) and may make little or no difference to the risk of hypertension, however absolute effects varied considerably and the certainty of the evidence was low for this outcome. Subgroup analyses did not reveal important subgroup differences by mode of birth (caesarean versus vaginal birth), setting (hospital versus community), risk of PPH (high versus low risk for PPH), dose of misoprostol (≥ 600 mcg versus < 600 mcg) and regimen of oxytocin (bolus versus bolus plus infusion versus infusion only).

Authors' Conclusions

All agents were generally effective for preventing PPH when compared with placebo or no treatment. Ergometrine plus oxytocin combination, carbetocin, and misoprostol plus oxytocin combination may have some additional desirable effects compared with the current standard oxytocin. The two combination regimens, however, are associated with significant side effects. Carbetocin may be more effective than oxytocin for some outcomes without an increase in side effects.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^cc38d8a5]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Comments and Evidence Summary. During contraceptive counseling and before placement of the Cu-IUD, information about common side effects such as spotting or light bleeding or heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed. These bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient. Enhanced counseling about expected bleeding patterns and reassurance that bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful has been reported to reduce method discontinuation in clinical trials with other contraceptives (i.e. DMPA).

Evidence is limited on specific drugs, doses, and durations of use for effective treatments for bleeding irregularities with Cu-IUD use. Therefore, this report includes general recommendations for treatments to consider rather than specific regimens.

A systematic review identified 11 studies that examined various therapeutic treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding, prolonged menstrual bleeding, or both among women using Cu-IUDs. Nine studies examined the use of various oral NSAIDs for the treatment of heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding among Cu-IUD users and compared them with either a placebo or a baseline cycle. Three of these trials examined the use of indomethacin, three examined mefenamic acid, and three examined flufenamic acid. Other NSAIDs used in the reported trials included alclofenac, suprofen, and diclofenac sodium. All but one NSAID study demonstrated statistically significant or notable reductions in mean total menstrual blood loss with NSAID use. One study among 19 Cu-IUD users with heavy bleeding suggested that treatment with oral tranexamic acid can significantly reduce mean blood loss during treatment compared with placebo. Data regarding the overall safety of tranexamic acid are limited; an FDA warning states that tranexamic acid is contraindicated in women with active thromboembolic disease or with a history or intrinsic risk for thrombosis or thromboembolism. Treatment with aspirin demonstrated no statistically significant change in mean blood loss among women whose pretreatment menstrual blood loss was > 80 mL or 60–80 mL; treatment resulted in a significant increase among women whose pretreatment menstrual blood loss was < 60 mL. One study examined the use of a synthetic form of vasopressin, intranasal desmopressin (300 µ g/day) for the first 5 days of menses for three treatment cycles and found a significant reduction in mean blood loss compared with baseline (Level of evidence: I to II-3, poor to fair, direct). Only one small study examined treatment of spotting with three separate NSAIDs and did not observe improvements in spotting in any of the groups (Level of evidence: I, poor, direct).

### Uterotonic agents for preventing postpartum haemorrhage: a network meta-analysis [^3c024bcd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. Prophylactic uterotonic agents can prevent PPH. The current World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation for preventing PPH is 10 IU (international units) of intramuscular or intravenous oxytocin. Several uterotonics prevent PPH, but there remains uncertainty about the most effective agent with the fewest side effects. This is an update of a review first published in April 2018, and incorporates trustworthiness screening of eligible trials.

Objectives

To identify the most effective uterotonic agent(s) to prevent PPH with the fewest side effects, and generate a ranking according to their effectiveness and side effect profile.

Search Methods

On 5 February 2024, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL in collaboration with the Cochrane Information Specialist.

Eligibility Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cluster-RCTs that compared the effectiveness and side effects of uterotonic agents with other uterotonic agents, placebo or no treatment for preventing PPH were eligible for inclusion. We screened eligible trials for trustworthiness. We included randomised trials published only as abstracts if we could retrieve sufficient information; we excluded quasi-randomised trials.

Outcomes

Primary outcomes were PPH ≥ 500 mL and PPH ≥ 1000 mL. Secondary outcomes included use of additional uterotonics, blood transfusion, vomiting, hypertension, and fever.

Risk Of Bias

We used RoB 1 to assess risk of bias.

Synthesis Methods

At least three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, trustworthiness, risk of bias, and certainty of evidence using GRADE. We estimated the relative effects and rankings for the primary and secondary outcomes. We reported primary outcomes for prespecified subgroups, stratified by mode of birth (caesarean versus vaginal), setting (hospital versus community), prior risk of PPH (high versus low), dose of misoprostol (≥ 600 μg versus < 600 μg), and regimen of oxytocin (bolus versus bolus plus infusion versus infusion only). We performed pairwise meta-analyses and network meta-analysis to determine the relative effects and rankings of all available agents.

Included Studies

The network meta-analysis included 122 trials (121,931 women), involving seven uterotonic agents and placebo or no treatment, conducted across 48 high-, middle- and low-income countries. Most were in a hospital setting (115/122, 94%), with women having a vaginal birth (87/122, 71%).

Synthesis Of Results

Relative effects from the network meta-analysis suggested that all agents, except injectable prostaglandins, for which data were limited, were effective for preventing PPH ≥ 500 mL compared with placebo or no treatment. The two highest-ranked agents were ergometrine plus oxytocin and misoprostol plus oxytocin. Compared with oxytocin, ergometrine plus oxytocin reduces PPH ≥ 500 mL (risk ratio (RR) 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 0.90, high-certainty evidence), and misoprostol plus oxytocin probably reduces PPH ≥ 500 mL (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87; moderate-certainty evidence). Carbetocin (high-), injectable prostaglandins (moderate-) and ergometrine (low-certainty evidence) have similar effects compared with oxytocin. The evidence for misoprostol is very low certainty. All agents, except ergometrine and injectable prostaglandins, for which data were limited, were effective for preventing PPH ≥ 1000 mL compared with placebo or no treatment. Ergometrine plus oxytocin, and misoprostol plus oxytocin were the highest-ranked agents. Compared with oxytocin, carbetocin and injectable prostaglandins (both moderate-certainty evidence), and misoprostol plus oxytocin (low-certainty evidence) make little or no difference to PPH ≥ 1000 mL. Misoprostol may be less effective in preventing PPH ≥ 1000 mL compared with oxytocin (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.46; low-certainty evidence). The certainty of evidence for ergometrine and ergometrine plus oxytocin was very low. Compared with oxytocin, misoprostol plus oxytocin probably reduces the use of additional uterotonics (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.72, moderate-certainty evidence), and carbetocin (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.94; low-certainty evidence), and ergometrine plus oxytocin may reduce the use of additional uterotonics (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.83; low-certainty evidence). Misoprostol (low-certainty evidence) makes little or no difference to this outcome. Misoprostol plus oxytocin probably reduces the risk of needing a blood transfusion (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.58; moderate-certainty-evidence), and ergometrine plus oxytocin may reduce the risk of blood transfusion compared with oxytocin (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.96, low-certainty evidence). Carbetocin (moderate-certainty evidence) and misoprostol (low-certainty evidence) probably make little or no difference to this outcome compared with oxytocin. All uterotonic agents, except for carbetocin, were associated with increased risks of side effects compared with oxytocin. Misoprostol may increase the likelihood of nausea, vomiting and fever, and probably increases the risk of diarrhoea. Injectable prostaglandins may increase the likelihood of diarrhoea. Ergometrine probably increases the likelihood of nausea and vomiting, and may increase the likelihood of hypertension, headache, and diarrhoea. Ergometrine plus oxytocin may increase the likelihood of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Misoprostol plus oxytocin probably increases the likelihood of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, and may increase the likelihood of fever. Analyses of the prespecified subgroups did not reveal important subgroup differences. Evidence for outcomes not presented above but reported in the summary of findings tables was very low certainty.

Authors' Conclusions

Most agents are effective for preventing PPH when compared with placebo or no treatment. Ergometrine plus oxytocin, and misoprostol plus oxytocin may be more effective than the current standard oxytocin. All agents, except for carbetocin, are associated with an increased risk of some side effects compared with oxytocin.

Figure 4 — recommended actions after vomiting or diarrhea while using combined oral contraceptives stratify management by timing. Vomiting or diarrhea (for any reason, for any duration), that occurs within 24 hours after taking a hormonal pill or continuing for 24 to < 48 hours after taking any hormonal pill: taking another hormonal pill (redose) is unnecessary; continue taking pills daily at the usual time (if possible, despite discomfort); no additional contraceptive protection is needed; emergency contraception is not usually needed but may be considered (with the exception of UPA) as appropriate. Vomiting or diarrhea, for any reason, continuing for ≥ 48 hours after taking any hormonal pill: continue taking pills daily at the usual time; abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g., condoms) until hormonal pills have been taken for 7 consecutive days after vomiting or diarrhea has resolved; if vomiting or diarrhea occurred during the last week of hormonal pills (e.g., days 15–21 for 28-day pill packs), omit the hormone-free interval by finishing the hormonal pills in the current pack and starting a new pack the next day; if unable to start a new pack immediately, abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g., condoms) until hormonal pills from a new pack have been taken for 7 consecutive days; emergency contraception should be considered (with the exception of UPA) if vomiting or diarrhea occurred within the first week of a new pill pack and unprotected sexual intercourse occurred during the previous 5 days, and emergency contraception may also be considered (with the exception of UPA) at other times as appropriate.

### Pegvaliase-pqpz (Palynziq) [^72d2b47d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Dosage

Induction

The recommended initial induction dosage for Palynziq is 2.5 mg subcutaneously once weekly for 4 weeks. Administer the initial dose under the supervision of a healthcare provider [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Titration

Titrate the Palynziq dosage in a step-wise manner, based on tolerability, over at least 5 weeks, to achieve a dosage of 20 mg subcutaneously once daily according to Table 1.

Maintenance

Therapeutic response may not be achieved until the patient is titrated to an effective maintenance dosage of Palynziq. Use the lowest effective and tolerated dosage of Palynziq.

Assess patient tolerability, blood phenylalanine concentrations, and dietary protein and phenylalanine intake throughout treatment.

Individualize the maintenance dosage to achieve blood phenylalanine control (blood phenylalanine concentrations less than or equal to 600 micromol/L), taking into account patient tolerability to Palynziq and dietary protein intake (see Table 1).

Maintain the Palynziq dosage at 20 mg once daily for at least 24 weeks. Consider increasing the Palynziq dosage to 40 mg once daily in patients who have been on 20 mg once daily continuously for at least 24 weeks without achieving blood phenylalanine control. Consider increasing the Palynziq dosage to a maximum of 60 mg once daily in patients who have been on 40 mg once daily continuously for at least 16 weeks without achieving blood phenylalanine control.

The purpose of the present analysis was to assess whether drug administration regimens were associated with differences in the number of provider office visits and hemoglobin assessments during treatment with these agents.

Methods

Data from 4 observational studies that examined treatment patterns of EPO and DARE and health care resource utilization were analyzed. These studies, selected based on the availability of office visit and/or hemoglobin determination data during the course of treatment, included a retrospective chart review, 2 retrospective claims analyses, and an ongoing prospective patient registry. The treatment patterns and oncology-related provider visits and/or the frequency of hemoglobin evaluations among the studies were reported.

Results

Data from 15,845 cancer patients were included in the analysis. The patient demographic and baseline characteristics were similar across all 4 studies; patients were predominantly women (62%-71%) with a mean age range of 56 to 63 years. Mean treatment duration ranged from 7.1 to 8.4 weeks without significant differences between EPO and DARE in any study. Weekly and extended (at least every 2 weeks [≥ Q2W]) drug administration frequencies were observed in both treatment groups. The most frequent drug administration schedule for EPO was once weekly (53%-75% of patients), and for DARE Q2W (67%-73%). Despite the difference in erythropoietic agent administration frequency, no significant differences were observed between EPO and DARB for either the number of oncology-related provider visits or the number of hemoglobin assessments.

Conclusions

The frequency of oncology-related provider visits and hemoglobin assessments appears to be independent of the EPO and DARB administration frequency. These findings might provide useful information for health care providers and oncology patients in understanding patterns of care during treatment with erythropoietic agents.

### Uterotonic agents for preventing postpartum haemorrhage: a network meta-analysis [^9462ae39]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. Prophylactic uterotonic drugs can prevent PPH, and are routinely recommended. There are several uterotonic drugs for preventing PPH but it is still debatable which drug is best.

Objectives

To identify the most effective uterotonic drug(s) to prevent PPH, and generate a ranking according to their effectiveness and side-effect profile.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (1 June 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for unpublished trial reports (30 June 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled comparisons or cluster trials of effectiveness or side-effects of uterotonic drugs for preventing PPH. Quasi-randomised trials and cross-over trials are not eligible for inclusion in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We estimated the relative effects and rankings for preventing PPH ≥ 500 mL and PPH ≥ 1000 mL as primary outcomes. We performed pairwise meta-analyses and network meta-analysis to determine the relative effects and rankings of all available drugs. We stratified our primary outcomes according to mode of birth, prior risk of PPH, healthcare setting, dosage, regimen and route of drug administration, to detect subgroup effects. The absolute risks in the oxytocin are based on meta-analyses of proportions from the studies included in this review and the risks in the intervention groups were based on the assumed risk in the oxytocin group and the relative effects of the interventions.

Main Results

This network meta-analysis included 140 randomised trials with data from 88,947 women. There are two large ongoing studies. The trials were mostly carried out in hospital settings and recruited women who were predominantly more than 37 weeks of gestation having a vaginal birth. The majority of trials were assessed to have uncertain risk of bias due to poor reporting of study design. This primarily impacted on our confidence in comparisons involving carbetocin trials more than other uterotonics. The three most effective drugs for prevention of PPH ≥ 500 mL were ergometrine plus oxytocin combination, carbetocin, and misoprostol plus oxytocin combination. These three options were more effective at preventing PPH ≥ 500 mL compared with oxytocin, the drug currently recommended by the WHO (ergometrine plus oxytocin risk ratio (RR) 0.69 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.83), moderate-quality evidence; carbetocin RR 0.72 (95% CI 0.52 to 1.00), very low-quality evidence; misoprostol plus oxytocin RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.90), moderate-quality evidence). Based on these results, about 10.5% women given oxytocin would experience a PPH of ≥ 500 mL compared with 7.2% given ergometrine plus oxytocin combination, 7.6% given carbetocin, and 7.7% given misoprostol plus oxytocin. Oxytocin was ranked fourth with close to 0% cumulative probability of being ranked in the top three for PPH ≥ 500 mL. The outcomes and rankings for the outcome of PPH ≥ 1000 mL were similar to those of PPH ≥ 500 mL. with the evidence for ergometrine plus oxytocin combination being more effective than oxytocin (RR 0.77 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.95), high-quality evidence) being more certain than that for carbetocin (RR 0.70 (95% CI 0.38 to 1.28), low-quality evidence), or misoprostol plus oxytocin combination (RR 0.90 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.14), moderate-quality evidence)There were no meaningful differences between all drugs for maternal deaths or severe morbidity as these outcomes were so rare in the included randomised trials. Two combination regimens had the poorest rankings for side-effects. Specifically, the ergometrine plus oxytocin combination had the higher risk for vomiting (RR 3.10 (95% CI 2.11 to 4.56), high-quality evidence; 1.9% versus 0.6%) and hypertension [RR 1.77 (95% CI 0.55 to 5.66), low-quality evidence; 1.2% versus 0.7%), while the misoprostol plus oxytocin combination had the higher risk for fever (RR 3.18 (95% CI 2.22 to 4.55), moderate-quality evidence; 11.4% versus 3.6%) when compared with oxytocin. Carbetocin had similar risk for side-effects compared with oxytocin although the quality evidence was very low for vomiting and for fever, and was low for hypertension.

Authors' Conclusions

Ergometrine plus oxytocin combination, carbetocin, and misoprostol plus oxytocin combination were more effective for preventing PPH ≥ 500 mL than the current standard oxytocin. Ergometrine plus oxytocin combination was more effective for preventing PPH ≥ 1000 mL than oxytocin. Misoprostol plus oxytocin combination evidence is less consistent and may relate to different routes and doses of misoprostol used in the studies. Carbetocin had the most favourable side-effect profile amongst the top three options; however, most carbetocin trials were small and at high risk of bias. Amongst the 11 ongoing studies listed in this review there are two key studies that will inform a future update of this review. The first is a WHO-led multi-centre study comparing the effectiveness of a room temperature stable carbetocin versus oxytocin (administered intramuscularly) for preventing PPH in women having a vaginal birth. The trial includes around 30,000 women from 10 countries. The other is a UK-based trial recruiting more than 6000 women to a three-arm trial comparing carbetocin, oxytocin and ergometrine plus oxytocin combination. Both trials are expected to report in 2018. Consultation with our consumer group demonstrated the need for more research into PPH outcomes identified as priorities for women and their families, such as women's views regarding the drugs used, clinical signs of excessive blood loss, neonatal unit admissions and breastfeeding at discharge. To date, trials have rarely investigated these outcomes. Consumers also considered the side-effects of uterotonic drugs to be important but these were often not reported. A forthcoming set of core outcomes relating to PPH will identify outcomes to prioritise in trial reporting and will inform futures updates of this review. We urge all trialists to consider measuring these outcomes for each drug in all future randomised trials. Lastly, future evidence synthesis research could compare the effects of different dosages and routes of administration for the most effective drugs.

### Uterotonic agents for preventing postpartum haemorrhage: a network meta-analysis [^ece7c16f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Historical differences in expectation of reporting and research methodology

We did not contact authors of trials published before 1980 due to the age of the publications and authors. We made trustworthiness screening assessments based on the available information. Trials published before 1990 were deemed trustworthy even if trial dates, ethics and consent information and randomisation and blinding details were not explicitly detailed. Trials published before 2010 did not require prospective registration, and either the trial dates, ethics information or consent details could be omitted from the manuscript.

Data extraction and management

We designed electronic forms on Microsoft Excel to extract data. For eligible trials, at least three review authors independently extracted the data using a blank electronic form (IY, AD, MP, IDG). We resolved discrepancies through discussion or, if required, we consulted another person (AC). We entered data into STATA, and Review Manager, and checked for accuracy. When information was unclear, we attempted to contact the authors of the original reports to provide further details. We extracted the following data.

Outcome data

From each included trial we extracted the number of participants, the gestational age and the parity of participants, and any exclusion criteria. We also extracted the interventions being compared, and their respective primary and secondary outcomes. We extracted all relevant arm‐level data (e.g. number of events and number of participants for binary outcomes, and means and SDs per trial arm for continuous outcomes).

Data on potential effect modifiers

From each included trial we extracted the following intervention and population characteristics that may act as effect modifiers.

Mode of delivery (vaginal or caesarean birth)
Prior risk of PPH (as defined by trial authors and categorised as low, high, mixed or not stated)
Dosage, regimen, and route of administration (sublingual, subcutaneous, intramuscular, rectal, oral, intravenous bolus and/or infusion)
Setting of the trial (community or hospital)

Other data

From each included trial we extracted the following additional information.

Country or countries in which the trial was performed
Date of publication and dates of recruitment
Type of publication (full‐text publication, abstract publication, unpublished data)
Trial registration reference

Risk of bias assessment in included studies

At least three review authors (IY, AD, IDG) independently assessed the risk of bias for each trial using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We resolved any disagreements by discussion or by involving another assessor (AC).

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^378e9571]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim was to formulate practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia.

Participants

The Task Force consisted of Endocrine Society-appointed experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of The Endocrine Society, The European Society of Endocrinology, and The Pituitary Society reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines.

Conclusions

Practice guidelines are presented for diagnosis and treatment of patients with elevated prolactin levels. These include evidence-based approaches to assessing the cause of hyperprolactinemia, treating drug-induced hyperprolactinemia, and managing prolactinomas in nonpregnant and pregnant subjects. Indications and side effects of therapeutic agents for treating prolactinomas are also presented.

### Uterotonic agents for preventing postpartum haemorrhage: a network meta-analysis [^63396922]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Most trials (94%, 115/122) were performed in a hospital setting, six were performed in a community setting (1%), and one (1%) in an unspecified setting. Most of the trials included women having a vaginal birth (71%, 87/122), and 31 trials (26%) involved women having an elective or emergency caesarean. Only four (3%) trials included women having either a vaginal or caesarean birth. Women included in the trials were judged to be at high risk for PPH in 23 of 122 trials (19%), low risk in 51 trials (42%), and 38 trials (31%) included women at both high or low risk for PPH. The risk for PPH was not specified in 10 trials (8%).

Women with a singleton pregnancy only were recruited in 76 trials (62%), and 22 trials (18%) included women with either singleton or multiple pregnancies. Twenty‐four trials (20%) did not specify. One trial (1%) included only nulliparous or primigravida women, one trial (1%) included only multiparous women, 63 trials (51%) included both nulliparous and multiparous women of all parities, and 57 trials (47%) did not specify the parity of the women included in the trials. Exclusion criteria varied significantly and usually encompassed women with significant medical comorbidities.

Across all 122 trials (271 trial arms) in the network meta‐analysis, trials used the following agents, either as intervention or comparison:

oxytocin: 87 trial arms (32%);
misoprostol: 61 trial arms (23%);
ergometrine plus oxytocin: 28 trial arms (10%);
ergometrine: 23 trial arms (8%);
placebo or no treatment: 23 trial arms (8%);
carbetocin: 21 trial arms (8%);
misoprostol plus oxytocin: 20 trial arms (7%);
injectables: 8 trial arms (3%).

See Supplementary material 2 for details.

Excluded studies

We excluded 300 trials (Supplementary material 3). The most common reasons for exclusion were because trials exclusively compared doses or routes of the same uterotonic agents, were quasi‐randomised or investigated ineligible interventions such as tranexamic acid.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^62c9f89e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Diabetes insipidus — desmopressin (DDAVP) formulations, absorption, and dosing considerations include that clinicians can administer DDAVP sc, orally, intranasally, or sublingually as a melt, and in all forms clinicians must carefully monitor treatment to prevent overdosing. Oral and sublingual absorption rates are < 1%, whereas intranasal is approximately 6%; oral DDAVP is available in 100-, 200-, and, in some countries, 400-μg tablets; sublingual melts and nasal preparations include a spray (usually 10 μg per spray) and a rhinal tube with a dose range of 1–10 μg; and the mean dose ratio of sublingual to intranasal DDAVP is 1:24. About one-fourth of DI patients with an intact thirst mechanism treated with DDAVP have mild hyponatremia, and clinicians must individualize and tailor treatments to meet patient requirements and practical needs.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^42ac5d7e]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Injectables — depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) formulations and STI/HIV context are described as follows: Progestin-only injectable contraceptives (DMPA, 150 mg intramuscularly [DMPA-IM] or 104 mg subcutaneously [DMPA-SC]) are available in the United States; the only difference between these two formulations is the route of administration, and approximately four out of 100 DMPA users will become pregnant in the first year with typical use (28). DMPA is reversible and can be used by patients of all ages, including adolescents, and DMPA does not protect against STIs, including HIV infection. Use of internal (female) condoms can provide protection from STIs, including HIV infection, although data are limited, and patients also should be counseled that PrEP, when taken as prescribed, is highly effective for preventing HIV infection.

### Desmopressin for nocturnal enuresis in children [^ec52458c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Enuresis (bedwetting) affects up to 20% of five-year-old children and 2% of adults. Although spontaneous remission often occurs, the social, emotional and psychological costs can be great. Desmopressin has been used to treat bedwetting since the 1970s. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2000 and last updated in 2006.

Objectives

To assess the effects of desmopressin on treating nocturnal enuresis in children.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched January 2023) and reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised or quasi-randomised trials of desmopressin or desmopressin combined with another intervention for treating nocturnal enuresis in children between five and 16 years old.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the eligible trials. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We identified 50 new studies for this review, which now includes 95 studies (8473) participants, of whom 5434 received desmopressin. In this review we continued the assessment of the effect of combination therapy involving desmopressin. The majority of the trials were in children between the ages of five to 16 years in an outpatient setting. The quality of the evidence was assessed as low or very low. The first comparison was desmopressin versus placebo. Desmopressin may reduce the mean number of wet nights per week compared with placebo (MD -1.81, 95% CI -2.24 to -1.39; participants = 1267; studies = 16; low-certainty evidence). Desmopressin probably leads to more children achieving 14 consecutive dry nights by the end of treatment compared with placebo (RR 3.18, 95% CI 1.75 to 5.80; participants = 922: studies = 11; moderate-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in children experiencing adverse effects with desmopressin compared to placebo (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.52; participants = 269; studies = 3; low-certainty evidence). Desmopressin was compared with alarm therapy. It is uncertain if there is any difference between desmopressin compared with alarm training in reducing the number of wet nights per week (MD 0.63, 95% CI -0.49 to 1.75; participants = 285; studies = 4; I² = 82%; very low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference between desmopressin and alarm therapy in the number of children achieving 14 consecutive dry nights (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.09; participants = 1530; studies = 15; low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in children experiencing side effects with desmopressin therapy compared with alarm therapy (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.33 to 6.78; participants = 461, studies = 4; low-certainty evidence). We compared desmopressin with other medications, including tricyclics and anticholinergics. It is uncertain if there is any difference between desmopressin compared to tricyclics in reducing the mean number of wet nights per week (MD 0.23, 95% CI - 0.88 to 1.33; participants = 331; studies = 4; I² = 79%; very low-certainty evidence) or in the number of children achieving 14 consecutive dry nights at the end of treatment (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.38; participants = 371; studies = 7; I² = 71%; very low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether children experience more side effects with desmopressin compared with tricyclics (RR 0.29, 95%CI 0.06 to 1.39; participants = 351; studies = 4, very low-certainty evidence). This review included studies with combination therapies. It is uncertain if desmopressin combined with alarm therapy reduces the mean number of wet nights at the end of treatment compared with alarm monotherapy (MD -0.80, 95% CI -1.34 to -0.25; participants = 528; studies = 6; I² = 84%; very low-certainty evidence); or if it increases the number of children achieving 14 consecutive dry nights (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.63; participants = 822; studies = 10; very low-certainty evidence). Desmopressin plus alarm therapy may make little to no difference in children experiencing side effects compared with alarm therapy alone (RR 1.05 95% CI 0.07 to 16.56; participants = 207; studies = 1; low-certainty evidence). Combining desmopressin with alarm therapy probably reduces the number of wet nights at the end of treatment (MD -0.88; 95%CI -1.38 to -0.38; participants = 156; studies = 2; moderate-certainty evidence), and may increase the number of children achieving 14 consecutive dry nights at the end of treatment compared with desmopressin monotherapy (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.51; participants = 370; studies = 5; low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain if combined desmopressin and anticholinergic therapy versus desmopressin monotherapy reduces the mean number of wet nights at the end of therapy (MD -0.50; 95% CI -1.05 to 0.06; participants = 188; studies = 3; I² = 66%; very low-certainty evidence); or if it may increase the number of children achieving 14 consecutive dry nights at the end of treatment (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.11; participants = 611; studies = 8; low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in adverse events between desmopressin plus anticholinergics and desmopressin monotherapy (RR 1.51 95% CI 0.73 to 3.09, participants = 187; studies = 2; low-certainty evidence). Minor adverse effects were common for desmopressin, including dizziness, headache, mood changes, gastrointestinal discomfort, nasal discomfort, hyponatraemia and one report of a convulsion.

Authors' Conclusions

Desmopressin compared with placebo may increase the number of dry nights per week at the end of treatment in children. Desmopressin therapy may be as effective as alarm therapy at the end of treatment. However, the quality of evidence was assessed as low or very low. Alarm therapy compared to desmopressin may improve the number of children who are dry at follow-up (moderate-certainty evidence).

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^b197d2c3]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) — management of bleeding irregularities — emphasizes counseling and optional short‑term treatments. If the patient wants treatment, the following treatment options during days of bleeding may be considered, depending on the patient's preferences, treatment goals, and medical history: NSAIDs: short‑term treatment, 5–7 days; for heavy or prolonged bleeding, hormonal treatment with low‑dose combined oral contraceptives (COCs) or estrogen for short‑term treatment, 10–20 days. Amenorrhea does not require any medical treatment and reassurance is advised; if a patient's regular bleeding pattern changes abruptly to amenorrhea, consider ruling out pregnancy if clinically indicated. Bleeding or spotting is common with DMPA use, and amenorrhea is common after ≥ 1 years of continuous use. Enhanced counseling detailing expected bleeding patterns and reassurance that these irregularities generally are not harmful has been demonstrated to reduce DMPA discontinuation in clinical trials. Two small studies found significant cessation of bleeding within 7 days of starting treatment among DMPA users taking valdecoxib for 5 days or mefenamic acid for 5 days compared with placebo; treatment with EE was found to stop bleeding better than placebo during the treatment period; and in one small study among DMPA users with amenorrhea for 2 months, treatment with COCs alleviated amenorrhea better than placebo; no studies examined the effects of aspirin on bleeding irregularities among DMPA users. If the patient wants to discontinue DMPA at any time, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods and initiate another method if it is desired.

Search methods for identification of studies

Electronic searches

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register by contacting their Information Specialist (24 May 2018).

The Register is a database containing over 25,000 reports of controlled trials in the field of pregnancy and childbirth. It represents over 30 years of searching. For full current search methods used to populate Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register including the detailed search strategies for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL; the list of handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service, please follow this

Briefly, Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register is maintained by their Information Specialist and contains trials identified from:

monthly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL);
weekly searches of MEDLINE (Ovid);
weekly searches of Embase (Ovid);
monthly searches of CINAHL (EBSCO);
handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major conferences;
weekly current awareness alerts for a further 44 journals plus monthly BioMed Central email alerts.

Search results are screened by two people and the full text of all relevant trial reports identified through the searching activities described above is reviewed. Based on the intervention described, each trial report is assigned a number that corresponds to a specific Pregnancy and Childbirth review topic (or topics), and is then added to the Register. The Information Specialist searches the Register for each review using this topic number rather than keywords. This results in a more specific search set that has been fully accounted for in the relevant review sections (Included studies; Excluded studies; Studies awaiting classification; Ongoing studies).

In addition, we searchedand the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for unpublished, planned and ongoing trial reports using the terms given in Appendix 1 (24 May 2018).

Searching other resources

We retrieved additional relevant references cited in papers identified through the above search strategy and we did search for the full texts of trials initially identified as abstracts. For randomised trials published only as abstracts, we sought information from primary authors to investigate whether these studies met our eligibility criteria before including them. Trials that compared at least two of the agents were eligible and we searched for all possible comparisons. We did not apply any language or date restrictions.

### Contraception for HIV-infected adolescents [^b8121e2c]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Progestin-only injectable contraception in HIV-infected adolescents — Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) is given as a single injection approximately every 13 weeks (up to 15 weeks) using either 150 mg intramuscularly or 104 mg subcutaneously, and it requires injections approximately every 13 weeks. This method is highly effective at preventing pregnancy, with a 1-year probability of pregnancy of approximately 6% for typical use and 0.2% with perfect use. Main side effects include weight gain, a delayed return to fertility, menstrual bleeding irregularities, and bone mineral loss, which is largely reversible after DMPA discontinuation. Patients receiving DMPA injections should be counseled about supplementation with calcium and vitamin D, regular weight-bearing exercise, and avoidance of smoking and alcohol to maintain skeletal health. Although some providers obtain dual-energy radiograph absorptiometry scans at baseline, there is no evidence to recommend this practice; initial bone mineral density losses stabilize by 5 years, with return to pre-use levels on discontinuation of progestin injections. The document notes "uncertainty surrounding the interaction between progestin-only injectables (particularly DMPA) and the risk of HIV transmission to male partners".

### Sapropterin dihydrochloride for phenylketonuria [^43146582]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Phenylketonuria results from a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Dietary restriction of phenylalanine keeps blood phenylalanine concentration low. Most natural foods are excluded from diet and supplements are used to supply other nutrients. Recent publications report a decrease in blood phenylalanine concentration in some patients treated with sapropterin dihydrochloride. We examined the evidence for the use of sapropterin dihydrochloride to treat phenylketonuria. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.

Objectives

To assess the safety and efficacy of sapropterin dihydrochloride in lowering blood phenylalanine concentration in people with phenylketonuria.

Search Methods

We identified relevant trials from the Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register. Date of last search: 11 August 2014. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and Current controlled trials. Last search: 4 September 2014We contacted the manufacturers of the drug (BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.) for information regarding any unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing sapropterin with no supplementation or placebo in people with phenylketonuria due to phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trials and extracted outcome data.

Main Results

Two placebo-controlled trials were included. One trial administered 10 mg/kg/day sapropterin in 89 children and adults with phenylketonuria whose diets were not restricted and who had previously responded to saproterin. This trial measured change in blood phenylalanine concentration. The second trial screened 90 children (4 to 12 years) with phenylketonuria whose diet was restricted, for responsiveness to sapropterin. Forty-six responders entered the placebo-controlled part of the trial and received 20 mg/kg/day sapropterin. This trial measured change in both phenylalanine concentration and protein tolerance. Both trials reported adverse events. The trials showed an overall low risk of bias; but both are Biomarin-sponsored. One trial showed a significant lowering in blood phenylalanine concentration in the sapropterin group (10 mg/kg/day), mean difference -238.80 μmol/L (95% confidence interval -343.09 to -134.51); a second trial (20 mg/kg/day sapropterin) showed a non-significant difference, mean difference -51.90 μmol/L (95% confidence interval -197.27 to 93.47). The second trial also reported a significant increase in phenylalanine tolerance, mean difference18.00 mg/kg/day (95% confidence interval 12.28 to 23.72) in the 20 mg/kg/day sapropterin group.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence of short-term benefit from using sapropterin in some people with sapropterin-responsive forms of phenylketonuria; blood phenylalanine concentration is lowered and protein tolerance increased. There are no serious adverse events associated with using sapropterin in the short term. There is no evidence on the long-term effects of sapropterin and no clear evidence of effectiveness in severe phenylketonuria.

### Efficacy and safety of weekly somatrogon vs daily somatropin in children with growth hormone deficiency: a phase 3 study [^2efa5480]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in children results in growth attenuation and ultimately, adult short stature. Treatment of GHD requires administration of growth hormone in the form of daily subcutaneous injections, which constitute a substantial burden for both pediatric patients and their caregivers. Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) has been used to treat children with GHD for more than 30 years, and it has a well-established efficacy and safety profile. Treatment with rhGH has been demonstrated to promote linear growth, optimize adult height, increase bone mineral density, manage known risk factors (ie, increased body fat and insulin resistance, and cardiovascular risks), and improve body composition in children with GHD.

Most formulations of rhGH are currently administered via daily subcutaneous (SC) injections, with studies showing high rates of treatment cessation. Poor adherence is associated with suboptimal response to treatment, with reduced linear growth and nonattainment of genetic height potential. Noncompliance has been shown to increase over time and is a significant issue for long-term treatment. Given the patient complaints surrounding the burden of daily growth hormone (GH) treatment, such as unhappiness with frequent injections, disruption of overnight travel plans, and nightly interruption of activities to administer medication, it is thought that these complaints will be mitigated by less-frequent injections. A recently conducted discrete choice experiment demonstrated that patients prefer a less-frequent injection regimen for treating GHD. Furthermore, data from other indications demonstrate patient preference for long-acting treatments, as seen for preparations of recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone for fertility induction and long-acting treatments for hemophilia.

Somatrogon (MOD-4023) is a long-acting rhGH that is currently in development for the treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to an inadequate secretion of endogenous GH. Somatrogon contains the amino acid sequence of hGH and 3 copies of the C-terminal peptide (CTP) of human chorionic gonadotropin. It was previously shown that the inclusion of CTP in proteins such as follicle-stimulating hormone and erythropoietin led to increased half-life. In vitro data demonstrated that somatrogon binds to the GH receptor, and animal studies showed that the addition of CTP to rhGH extends the half-life of rhGH and that somatrogon effectively raises circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). A clinical study in adults with GHD revealed that most patients who received once-weekly somatrogon maintained IGF-1 standard deviation score (SDS) levels within the normal range.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^91a20104]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) counseling and evidence — During contraceptive counseling and before initiation of DMPA, information about common side effects such as irregular bleeding should be discussed, and bleeding or spotting is common with DMPA use; in addition, amenorrhea is common after ≥ 1 years of continuous use and these bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient. Enhanced counseling has been demonstrated to reduce DMPA discontinuation in clinical trials, and evidence is limited on specific drugs, doses, and durations for effective treatments, so this report includes general recommendations rather than specific regimens. Two small studies found significant cessation of bleeding within 7 days of starting treatment among DMPA users taking valdecoxib for 5 days or mefenamic acid for 5 days compared with placebo; treatment with EE was found to stop bleeding better than placebo during the treatment period, and in one small study among DMPA users with amenorrhea for 2 months, COCs alleviated amenorrhea better than placebo; no studies examined the effects of aspirin on bleeding irregularities among DMPA users.

### Phenylketonuria scientific review conference: state of the science and future research needs [^391ba93a]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

New developments in the treatment and management of phenylketonuria (PKU) as well as advances in molecular testing have emerged since the National Institutes of Health 2000 PKU Consensus Statement was released. An NIH State-of-the-Science Conference was convened in 2012 to address new findings, particularly the use of the medication sapropterin to treat some individuals with PKU, and to develop a research agenda. Prior to the 2012 conference, five working groups of experts and public members met over a 1-year period. The working groups addressed the following: long-term outcomes and management across the lifespan; PKU and pregnancy; diet control and management; pharmacologic interventions; and molecular testing, new technologies, and epidemiologic considerations. In a parallel and independent activity, an Evidence-based Practice Center supported by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality conducted a systematic review of adjuvant treatments for PKU; its conclusions were presented at the conference. The conference included the findings of the working groups, panel discussions from industry and international perspectives, and presentations on topics such as emerging treatments for PKU, transitioning to adult care, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulatory perspective. Over 85 experts participated in the conference through information gathering and/or as presenters during the conference, and they reached several important conclusions. The most serious neurological impairments in PKU are preventable with current dietary treatment approaches. However, a variety of more subtle physical, cognitive, and behavioral consequences of even well-controlled PKU are now recognized. The best outcomes in maternal PKU occur when blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations are maintained between 120 and 360 μmol/L before and during pregnancy. The dietary management treatment goal for individuals with PKU is a blood Phe concentration between 120 and 360 μmol/L. The use of genotype information in the newborn period may yield valuable insights about the severity of the condition for infants diagnosed before maximal Phe levels are achieved. While emerging and established genotype-phenotype correlations may transform our understanding of PKU, establishing correlations with intellectual outcomes is more challenging. Regarding the use of sapropterin in PKU, there are significant gaps in predicting response to treatment; at least half of those with PKU will have either minimal or no response. A coordinated approach to PKU treatment improves long-term outcomes for those with PKU and facilitates the conduct of research to improve diagnosis and treatment. New drugs that are safe, efficacious, and impact a larger proportion of individuals with PKU are needed. However, it is imperative that treatment guidelines and the decision processes for determining access to treatments be tied to a solid evidence base with rigorous standards for robust and consistent data collection. The process that preceded the PKU State-of-the-Science Conference, the conference itself, and the identification of a research agenda have facilitated the development of clinical practice guidelines by professional organizations and serve as a model for other inborn errors of metabolism.

### Synchronization of administrations of chemotherapy and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and frequency of associated healthcare visits [^0d6abd20]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), darbepoetin alfa (DA), and epoetin alfa (EA) differ with respect to dosing schedule in chemotherapy-induced anemia. DA can be administered less frequently than EA, which may increase synchronicity between chemotherapy and ESA schedules. This study compared DA and EA with respect to frequency of synchronization and frequencies of total and ESA healthcare visits in current clinical practice.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of ESA utilization during ESA episodes of care was conducted on all cancer patients identified in the SDI health oncology electronic medical records database who underwent chemotherapy and received ESA therapy from July 1, 2007 to March 31, 2010 (n = 6522 DA, n = 3,439 EA).

Results

The frequency of synchronization (chemotherapy and ESA therapy on the same day) was higher with DA (67%) than EA (58%) (p < 0.001). The odds that an ESA administration was synchronized with chemotherapy were higher with DA compared with EA (odds ratio = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.37, 1.54). Compared with EA, DA patients had 2.3 fewer visits with an ESA administration (p < 0.001) and 3.0 fewer total visits (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Compared with patients receiving EA, DA patients were more likely to have an ESA administration on the same healthcare visit as chemotherapy and had fewer visits for any cause or for ESA administration. These results suggest that through greater synchronization of ESA and chemotherapy administrations, DA may reduce patient and practice burden and healthcare utilization.

### REFINE-lung implements a novel multi-arm randomised trial design to address possible immunotherapy overtreatment [^23178310]. The Lancet: Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Determining the optimal frequency of immunotherapy administration

Regulatory limitations restrict the sharing of single dose drug vials between multiple patients. As a result, in the absence of pharmaceutical industry support, reduced dose immunotherapy studies are limited in practical terms, and optimisation of administration frequency is an attractive alternative. Optimised administration frequency has additional benefits in reduced hospital visits, further contributing to delivery of efficient care and yielding potentially important quality-of-life improvements.

But what is the optimal trial design to determine the lowest frequency of pembrolizumab administration that does not compromise efficacy? One option is a conventional two-arm non-inferiority trial comparing standard of care to a reduced-frequency intervention arm. Given the interest in reduced-frequency immunotherapy, multiple two-arm trials with this design are currently evaluating the performance of various extended intervals between doses ranging between 2-times and 4-times the standard-of-care interval (NCT04032418 and NCT04295863). But a major limitation of this design is that it requires investigators to guess the optimal alternative frequency to test, in the absence of preliminary data to guide rational selection of this alternative. In a conventional two-arm study, if the test frequency is poorly chosen, the trial will inevitably give a negative result even if another non-inferior frequency existed. If the study produced a positive result at the test frequency, whether longer frequencies than the tested one would also be non-inferior would remain unknown. A series of two-arm studies exploring multiple frequencies would be impractically time consuming and expensive.

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1d761c79]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Progestin-only contraceptives in liver disease — Progestin-only pills, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) injections, and the subcutaneous implants do not have estrogen-associated risks. Failure rates with progestin-only pills are approximately 9% and require strict adherence to timing of daily dosing. DMPA injections, administered every 12 weeks, have a typical failure rate of approximately 6% and delay return to fertility up to 18 months; DMPA has a black box warning for decreased bone density, which normalizes with cessation of use. The subcutaneous implant is considered a long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) and has the lowest failure rate (0.05%); it is associated with minimal to no bone loss and may be used for up to 3 years. No prospective studies have evaluated HCA growth with progestin-only agents.

### A comparison of various routes and dosages of misoprostol for cervical ripening and the induction of labor [^420bb27b]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of different routes of misoprostol administration for cervical ripening and the induction of labor.

Study Design

Three hundred thirty women at ≥ 32 weeks gestation with a Bishop score ≤ 6 and an indication for induction were randomized to 1 of 3 double-blinded groups: (1) 25 microg orally administered misoprostol plus 25 microg vaginally administered misoprostol, (2) orally administered placebo plus 25 microg vaginally administered misoprostol, or (3) 25 microg orally administered misoprostol plus vaginally administered placebo. Doses were repeated every 4 hours until onset of labor or a maximum of 12 doses were given. The primary outcome of the trial was vaginal delivery within 24 hours of the initiation of induction. Secondary outcomes were the time from induction to delivery, need for oxytocin augmentation, mode of delivery, frequency of side effects, and neonatal and maternal outcome. Analysis of variance, chi-square test, and logistic regression were used for analysis.

Results

There were no significant differences in maternal characteristics or indications for induction. The percentage of women who achieved vaginal delivery within 24 hours was highest in the vaginally administered misoprostol group: 67% compared with 53% in the oral-plus-vaginal group (P < .05) and 36% in the oral group (P < .05). The median time to vaginal delivery was shorter in the vaginal and oral-plus-vaginal misoprostol groups, 13.5 hours and 14.3 hours, respectively, when compared with 23.9 hours in the oral group (P < .05). The rate of cesarean delivery was lowest in the vaginal misoprostol group (17% compared with 30% in the oral-plus-vaginal group and 32% in the oral group; P < .05). Uterine tachysystole occurred least frequently in the oral misoprostol group (10% compared with 32% in the vaginal group and 34% in the oral-plus-vaginal group; P < .05). Uterine hyperstimulation also occurred least frequently in the oral misopro-stol group (4% compared with 15% in the vaginal group and 22% in the oral-plus-vaginal group; P < .05).

Conclusion

At the doses studied, induction of labor with vaginally administered misoprostol is more efficacious than either oral-plus-vaginal or oral-only route of administration.

### Letter to the editor: is paliperidone palmitate more effective than other long-acting injectable antipsychotics? [^573d8abe]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In their critique of comparative research in psychiatry, Kane et al. identify expectancy bias and changes in service provision and utilisation as some of the potential confounding factors in naturalistic, mirror-image studies. Based on the audit of prescribers, Patel et al. report PP1M to be the most frequently prescribed LAI with respondent comments suggesting benefits of PP1M above other LAIs including efficacy and side effect profile.

In relation to disease severity, could prescribers be preferentially using PP1M when patients are acutely psychotic and/or have had multiple prior relapses, as suggested by 60% commencing PP1M as an in-patient at the same healthcare institute (Taylor et al.)? Additionally, as PP1M can be initiated without prior oral stabilisation in individuals with mild/moderate schizophrenia who have confirmed responsiveness and tolerance to risperidone/paliperidone (Janssen-Cilag International N.V.), and without the need for additional oral antipsychotic supplementation, is PP1M being used to to attain rapid therapeutic levels to permit earlier discharge? Such considerations are important because, with the mirror-image point (index date) defined as the date of the first LAI prescription plus 1 month, Patel et al. may have potentially underestimated the impact of PP1M given that the bed days avoided in the first 30 days would not have been counted. Without further sensitivity analyses to overcome inter-antipsychotic variability based on dose, dose frequency and pharmacokinetic profile of individual agents, it would be difficult to understand this fully.

Patel et al. did acknowledge the importance of treatment continuation in their reference to a real-world study that found greater treatment continuity with PP1M (Decuypere et al.); and an open-label clinical trial which failed to demonstrate a clinically meaningful difference in its primary endpoint or to show a statistical difference in discontinuation rates between PP1M and the comparator (Naber et al.). However, despite the significant importance of treatment discontinuation as a risk for hospitalisations (Weiden et al.), Patel et al. did not assess treatment continuation as group allocation was time censored based on the first injection as recorded in the electronic health records. Therefore, this represents incidence use of LAIs and not 'prevalence' as indicated in the paper. This significant limitation could be overcome by assessing outcomes such as hospitalisation and or treatment failure in relation to total drug exposure for different drugs and/or preparations (oral v. LAI) (Tiihonen et al.).

### Recombinant human relaxin versus placebo for cervical ripening: a double-blind randomised trial in pregnant women scheduled for induction of labour [^84a7ab9d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study was the first to test the ability of serelaxin systemically administered at the end of pregnancy to ripen the cervix. Unlike the topical modes of administration used in previous clinical trials, IV serelaxin ensured adequate exposure of the cervix at a pharmacological dose and provided an antepartum surge of serelaxin of 20-30-fold higher than endogenous relaxin. The results indicated that while serelaxin was well tolerated, it did not enhance cervical ripening or affect relevant clinical parameters, including time to active labour, frequency of spontaneous labour or time to delivery. Because the results of this study were negative and serelaxin was being developed by the study sponsor for another therapeutic indication, publication of these data was not a priority and considerable time has elapsed since the study concluded. There was no embargo on publication and the results were presented at a meeting (5 th International Conference on Relaxin and Relaxin-Related Peptides, 2008) in timely manner and published in brief in meeting proceedings. However, because there is continued interest in the potential ability of serelaxin to cause cervical ripening, the authors considered these data to be relevant and worthy of publication.

The negative results in this study may be related to the natural history of relaxin, which is species-specific in patterns of expression during pregnancy. In rodents and pigs, relaxin levels increase at the end of pregnancy in an antepartum surge of 5-20-fold mid-pregnancy levels and a relaxin deficiency inhibits the dispersion of cervical collagen fibers that normally occurs during this time. In women, relaxin levels peak during the first trimester and remain elevated compared to non-pregnancy levels throughout gestation but an antepartum surge is not observed, perhaps indicating a difference in relaxin biology relative to cervical ripening among these species.

Studies in rodents have indicated that relaxin also has hemodynamic properties starting mid-pregnancy when levels rise in these species. Serelaxin clinical trials in other indications or in healthy volunteers have demonstrated changes in systemic and renal hemodynamics, indicating that these effects translate to the human. There were trends in the current trial suggesting serelaxin slightly decreased SBP, consistent with this aspect of serelaxin pharmacology. Perhaps relaxin's major physiological role in human pregnancy relates to maternal hemodynamic adjustments, rather than cervical ripening.

### Anti-erythropoietin antibody-mediated pure red cell aplasia after treatment with recombinant erythropoietin products: recommendations for minimization of risk [^93dbd162]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

Since 1998, there has been a marked increase in incidence of pure red cell aplasia secondary to development of anti-erythropoietin antibodies (Ab+ PRCA) in patients who have chronic kidney disease (CKD) and receive recombinant erythropoietin. The relationship between incidence of Ab+ PRCA and specific erythropoietin products has not been examined rigorously. Manufacturers provided data regarding exposure to erythropoietin products and incidence of Ab+ PRCA between January 1998 and March 2003 in patients with CKD. Assuming a Poisson distribution, a maximum likelihood estimate for the Poisson rate parameter was calculated for each product. A test for homogeneity of Poisson rates was conducted to compare likelihood estimates between products. Global incidence of Ab+ PRCA was relatively low. Likelihood estimates were not significantly different for Epogen, Procrit, and Aranesp, independent of their formulation or route of administration. Eprex lacking human serum albumin (HSA) and administered subcutaneously was associated with the greatest risk of Ab+ PRCA. HSA-containing Eprex administered subcutaneously was associated with a lower risk than HSA-free Eprex administered subcutaneously, but this risk exceeded that of intravenous Epogen and intravenous HSA-free Eprex. NeoRecormon administered subcutaneously was associated with less risk than subcutaneous HSA-free Eprex but more risk than intravenous Epogen. HSA-free Eprex should not be administered subcutaneously to patients with CKD due to increased risk of Ab+ PRCA. Although the subcutaneous administration of HSA-containing Eprex is riskier than intravenous Epogen and intravenous HSA-free Eprex, and the use of subcutaneous NeoRecormon is riskier than intravenous Epogen, there is currently no evidence that other products are safer.

### Should we be prescribing fluphenazine long-acting injectable formulation? [^34d1af81]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Average price per month of long acting injectable antipsychotic medications (NADAC, 2025)

As noted above, not all long-acting injectables have the same dosing interval – although clinically, the intervals are often adjusted to target refractory symptoms. The half life of fluphenazine decanoate is roughly 1 week, and it is most frequently given as an injection every 2 weeks. There are reports that fluphenazine reaches peak serum levels rapidly, although the exact rate varies considerably in the literature. One experimental paper from 1979 noted peak serum levels were reached between 1 and 8 h after injection, with significant variation between patients. Another experimental paper from 1985 noted peak serum levels occurring generally in less than 24 h, again with a very significant variation between patients. This phenomenon has been noted essentially since the approval of the LAI. The specific applications of this phenomenon vary between clinicians, with some reporting no need for oral overlap - especially in cases of likely patient non-adherence - while others recommend an oral overlap during the first two weeks after initiation. There have been no well-controlled studies of either technique, although a retrospective data analysis noted heterogeneity in clinician application of oral overlap. The biweekly dose of fluphenazine decanoate given is 1.25 times the daily oral dose. A q4week depot version of fluphenazine exists, but the risks of this enanthate formulation included high risk of depression, EPS, and possibly hypotension and other serious cardiac side effects. To briefly compare to other LAI options discussed above, only the risperidone formulation traditionally requires a q2week injection frequency; haloperidol is also dissolved in oil and therefore these first-generation LAIs are more painful to inject.

### Intravenous versus intramuscular prophylactic oxytocin for the third stage of labour [^f294ffe6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There is general agreement that oxytocin given either through the intravenous or intramuscular route is effective in reducing postpartum blood loss. However, it is unclear whether the subtle differences between the mode of action of these routes have any effect on maternal and infant outcomes. This review was first published in 2012 and last updated in 2018.

Objectives

To determine the comparative effectiveness and safety of oxytocin administered intravenously or intramuscularly for prophylactic management of the third stage of labour after vaginal birth.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (19 December 2019), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Eligible studies were randomised trials comparing intravenous with intramuscular oxytocin for prophylactic management of the third stage of labour after vaginal birth. We excluded quasi-randomised trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We assessed the certainty of the evidence with the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Seven trials, involving 7817 women, met the inclusion criteria for this review. The trials compared intravenous versus intramuscular administration of oxytocin just after the birth of the anterior shoulder or soon after the birth of the baby. All trials were conducted in hospital settings and included women with term pregnancies, undergoing a vaginal birth. Overall, the included studies were at moderate or low risk of bias, with two trials providing clear information on allocation concealment and blinding. For GRADE outcomes, the certainty of the evidence was generally moderate to high, except from two cases where the certainty of the evidence was either low or very low. High-certainty evidence suggests that intravenous administration of oxytocin in the third stage of labour compared with intramuscular administration carries a lower risk for postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) ≥ 500 mL (average risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.92; six trials; 7731 women) and blood transfusion (average RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.77; four trials; 6684 women). Intravenous administration of oxytocin probably reduces the risk of PPH ≥ 1000 mL, although the 95% CI crosses the line of no-effect (average RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.08; four trials; 6681 women; moderate-certainty evidence). In all studies but one, there was a reduction in the risk of PPH ≥ 1000 mL with intravenous oxytocin. The study that found a large increase with intravenous administration was small (256 women), and contributed only 3% of total events. Once this small study was removed from the meta-analysis, heterogeneity was eliminated and the treatment effect favoured intravenous oxytocin (average RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.88; three trials; 6425 women; high-certainty evidence). Additionally, a sensitivity analysis, exploring the effect of risk of bias by restricting analysis to those studies rated as 'low risk of bias' for random sequence generation and allocation concealment, found that the prophylactic administration of intravenous oxytocin reduces the risk for PPH ≥ 1000 mL, compared with intramuscular oxytocin (average RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.94; two trials; 1512 women). The two routes of oxytocin administration may be comparable in terms of additional uterotonic use (average RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.25; six trials; 7327 women; low-certainty evidence). Although intravenous compared with intramuscular administration of oxytocin probably results in a lower risk for serious maternal morbidity (e.g. hysterectomy, organ failure, coma, intensive care unit admissions), the confidence interval suggests a substantial reduction, but also touches the line of no-effect. This suggests that there may be no reduction in serious maternal morbidity (average RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.00; four trials; 7028 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Most events occurred in one study from Ireland reporting high dependency unit admissions, whereas in the remaining three studies there was only one case of uvular oedema. There were no maternal deaths reported in any of the included studies (very low-certainty evidence). There is probably little or no difference in the risk of hypotension between intravenous and intramuscular administration of oxytocin (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.15; four trials; 6468 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Subgroup analyses based on the mode of administration of intravenous oxytocin (bolus injection or infusion) versus intramuscular oxytocin did not show any substantial differences on the primary outcomes. Similarly, additional subgroup analyses based on whether oxytocin was used alone or as part of active management of the third stage of labour (AMTSL) did not show any substantial differences between the two routes of administration.

Authors' Conclusions

Intravenous administration of oxytocin is more effective than its intramuscular administration in preventing PPH during vaginal birth. Intravenous oxytocin administration presents no additional safety concerns and has a comparable side effects profile with its intramuscular administration. Future studies should consider the acceptability, feasibility and resource use for the intervention, especially in low-resource settings.
