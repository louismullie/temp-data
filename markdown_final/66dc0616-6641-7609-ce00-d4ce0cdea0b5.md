## Question

How have these degrees impacted the evolution of the professional roles in nursing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how different nursing degrees have impacted the evolution of professional roles in nursing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical baseline of nursing education and roles. Then, I should verify how baccalaureate education changed practice and outcomes. Next, I will examine the emergence and impact of advanced practice degrees, followed by the rise of the DNP and its practice focus. After that, I need to consider PhD-prepared nurse scientists and their influence. I will then review specialty certifications and their role in defining scope. Finally, I should analyze system-level effects, workforce and equity implications, and synthesize the overall trajectory with supporting evidence.

> Let me first confirm the historical baseline so I don't jump to conclusions. Historically, most nurses were trained in hospital diploma programs, with 92% of new RNs graduating from diploma programs in 1950, whereas by 2001 only 3% did, as associate degree and baccalaureate programs became dominant, marking a fundamental shift toward academic preparation and away from apprenticeship models [^40ad8c0e].

> Wait, let me verify the impact of baccalaureate education on practice and outcomes before attributing causality. Higher proportions of BSN-prepared nurses in hospitals are associated with lower patient mortality and failure-to-rescue, with each 10% increase in BSN or higher nurses linked to a 5% reduction in both outcomes, supporting the push toward BSN as entry-to-practice and the value of academic preparation in improving safety and quality [^40ad8c0e]. I should also note that many RNs with BSN or higher obtained their degrees after initial licensure, indicating educational progression shapes the workforce over time [^40ad8c0e].

> Hold on, I should verify the emergence and impact of advanced practice degrees. Master's-prepared nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists began expanding in the 1960s and have since become integral to primary and specialty care, with evidence showing similar or comparable quality and safety to physician care in many settings, and improved access and continuity, which operationalizes the impact of graduate education on scope and autonomy [^ff83a863] [^d5a3caee]. I need to ensure I distinguish NP from CNS roles: NPs often provide direct, autonomous patient care, while CNSs combine direct care with consultation, education, and system-level practice improvements, both enabled by master's-level preparation [^9be4e5e6].

> Let me consider the DNP specifically, because I recall some confusion about its role. The DNP is a practice-focused doctoral degree that prepares nurses for the highest level of clinical practice, leadership, and quality improvement, and it is increasingly used as entry-level preparation for NPs in some programs, reflecting a shift toward practice doctorates for advanced clinical roles and system leadership rather than research [^74253607] [^34c4b77b]. I should double-check that this aligns with regulatory guidance: yes, contemporary statements emphasize DNP preparation for advanced practice and system-level impact, including in cardiovascular and stroke nursing contexts [^34c4b77b].

> Next, I should review PhD-prepared nurse scientists, because I need to ensure I'm not conflating practice and research doctorates. PhD nurses drive the generation of nursing knowledge, mentor future scholars, and shape evidence-based practice; however, the pipeline is constrained, with fewer than 1% of nurses holding PhDs and declining enrollment in some regions, which threatens research capacity and academic succession planning [^40379893] [^3364bf7e]. I should confirm the workload pressures: nurse scientists often juggle heavy teaching and mentoring loads with grant competition, which erodes research time and contributes to burnout, underscoring the need for institutional support and protected time [^3364bf7e] [^685bb010].

> I will now examine specialty certifications, because degrees alone don't fully define scope. Certifications such as CCRN, CNRN, CNS-BC, and disease-specific credentials operationalize expertise and mark role evolution within specialties like critical care, neuroscience, and infection prevention, often aligning with master's or doctoral preparation and enabling nurses to lead within interprofessional teams [^34c4b77b] [^9072f8f4]. Let me reconsider whether certifications require advanced degrees: many do not mandate them, but in practice, advanced education is common among certified specialists, reinforcing the link between academic progression and specialty leadership [^notfound].

> But wait, what about system-level effects and workforce redesign; I need to check how degrees enable new models of care. Extended nursing roles in dementia care, nurse-led clinics, and virtual nursing models demonstrate that higher education equips nurses to manage complex patients, coordinate care, and substitute for physician services in some contexts, with emerging evidence on cost-effectiveness and access gains, though implementation depends on regulatory frameworks and local acceptance [^6382670f] [^74b496bb]. I should confirm that these models often rely on master's or DNP-prepared nurses to function autonomously and lead quality initiatives, which is consistent with international trends in advanced practice nursing [^6382670f] [^d5a3caee].

> Hold on, I should verify workforce and equity implications so I don't overgeneralize. The nursing workforce is aging, with nearly half of nurses over 50, and educational capacity constraints limit growth, while underrepresentation of men and minorities persists; expanding BSN and doctoral pipelines, and addressing social determinants in curricula, are key policy levers to align degrees with equity and population needs [^40379893] [^f89d4021]. I need to ensure I note that degree requirements and scope-of-practice regulations vary internationally, with some countries still transitioning from diploma to degree entry and facing structural barriers to advanced practice, which shapes how degrees translate into roles on the ground [^215ac3ec] [^dd68f09f].

> Let me synthesize the overall trajectory, and I should double-check that it aligns with the evidence. Degrees have moved nursing from task-oriented, vocationally trained roles to knowledge-driven, autonomous professions with defined specialties and leadership pathways; baccalaureate education improves patient outcomes, master's degrees enable advanced practice and system integration, the DNP elevates practice-focused leadership, and the PhD sustains the evidence base and academic workforce, while certifications codify specialty expertise and facilitate interprofessional recognition [^40ad8c0e] [^ff83a863] [^74253607] [^3364bf7e] [^9072f8f4]. I should confirm that this progression is not linear everywhere: persistent scope-of-practice barriers, faculty shortages, and funding constraints temper the translation of degrees into roles, necessitating policy alignment and institutional investment to realize the full return on educational advancement [^f89d4021] [^40379893] [^3364bf7e].

---

Higher nursing degrees have **transformed nursing from task-based care to autonomous, evidence-based practice** by enabling advanced practice roles, expanding scope, and improving patient outcomes [^f89d4021] [^40ad8c0e]. BSN preparation enhances clinical reasoning and leadership, while master's and DNP degrees produce nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and nurse leaders who manage complex cases, lead teams, and drive quality improvement [^34c4b77b] [^023a6015]. PhD-prepared nurse scientists generate evidence to shape practice and policy, and specialty certifications further define expertise across settings [^157aaf16] [^9072f8f4]. Collectively, these degrees have elevated nursing's professional status, autonomy, and impact on healthcare delivery [^f89d4021].

## Historical evolution of nursing education

Historically, nursing education was primarily hospital-based diploma programs; in 1950, 92% of new RNs graduated from diploma programs, whereas by 2001 only 3% did, as associate and baccalaureate programs became dominant [^40ad8c0e]. This shift reflects a broader movement toward academic preparation, with baccalaureate and higher degrees becoming the standard for professional nursing practice [^f89d4021].

---

## Impact of baccalaureate education

The proliferation of baccalaureate nursing programs has significantly impacted the nursing profession by:

- **Enhanced clinical reasoning**: BSN-prepared nurses demonstrate improved critical thinking, clinical judgment, and decision-making skills, leading to better patient outcomes [^notfound].

- **Leadership development**: BSN programs emphasize leadership, communication, and teamwork, preparing nurses for leadership roles within healthcare organizations [^notfound].

- **Improved patient outcomes**: Hospitals with higher proportions of BSN-prepared nurses have lower patient mortality rates and failure-to-rescue rates, underscoring the link between education and patient safety [^40ad8c0e].

---

## Impact of master's and doctoral degrees

Master's and doctoral degrees have further expanded nursing roles and responsibilities:

- **Advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs)**: Master's and Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degrees prepare nurses for APRN roles, including nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse midwives, and certified registered nurse anesthetists. These roles involve autonomous practice, diagnostic reasoning, prescribing medications, and managing complex patient cases [^34c4b77b] [^74253607].

- **Nurse leadership and administration**: Graduate education prepares nurses for leadership positions, including nurse managers, directors of nursing, and chief nursing officers, enabling them to influence policy, manage healthcare systems, and lead organizational change [^023a6015].

- **Nurse educators**: Master's and doctoral degrees prepare nurses for academic roles, including teaching, curriculum development, and mentoring future generations of nurses [^157aaf16].

---

## Impact of PhD degrees

PhD-prepared nurses, known as nurse scientists, play a critical role in advancing nursing knowledge and practice by conducting **research** that generates evidence to inform clinical practice, policy, and education [^157aaf16]. They also teach and mentor future nurses, contributing to the development of a knowledgeable and skilled nursing workforce [^c9a0ad85]. Additionally, they influence healthcare policy by providing evidence-based recommendations and participating in policy development at local, national, and international levels [^notfound].

---

## Specialty certifications and continuing education

Specialty certifications and continuing education have further defined nursing roles by establishing **standardized competencies** and recognizing specialized knowledge and skills in areas such as critical care, oncology, pediatrics, and geriatrics [^34c4b77b]. They also support career advancement by providing opportunities for professional growth, increased autonomy, and recognition within the healthcare community [^9b538488].

---

## Broader implications for the nursing profession

The evolution of nursing education and degrees has had broader implications for the nursing profession, including **increased professional autonomy** — with advanced education enabling nurses to practice independently, make clinical decisions, and lead healthcare teams [^f89d4021]. It has also elevated the status of nursing, positioning it as a respected, autonomous profession within the healthcare system [^02ca8e56]. Collectively, these changes have improved healthcare delivery by enhancing patient outcomes, reducing medical errors, and increasing access to care, particularly in underserved populations [^40ad8c0e] [^ff83a863].

---

## Challenges and future directions

Despite significant progress, challenges remain, including **workforce shortages**, limited access to advanced education, and persistent barriers to full scope of practice [^40379893] [^f89d4021]. Future directions include expanding access to education, addressing workforce shortages, and advocating for policy changes that recognize and support advanced nursing roles [^f89d4021].

---

Higher nursing degrees have **fundamentally transformed the nursing profession**, enabling nurses to take on advanced practice roles, leadership positions, and research responsibilities. This evolution has improved patient outcomes, enhanced professional autonomy, and elevated the status of nursing within the healthcare system [^40ad8c0e] [^f89d4021].

Health sciences curricula are, by definition, built on a foundation of scientific knowledge and inquiry. Professional programs in fields such as medicine, pharmacy, nursing, physical/occupational therapy, and dentistry purport to provide students with the ability to translate scientific knowledge and understanding into clinical practice, for improving the health and well-being of patients. Indeed, the scientific underpinning of each health profession is a point of pride, a reason these roles exist in the first place and are accorded the prestige of being called a "profession".

### Nursing wellness in academic and clinical cardiovascular and stroke nursing: a Scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^ed8b952e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Nursing is an essential part of our health care system workforce. Cardiovascular and stroke nursing represents one of the largest specialty areas requiring expert knowledge and clinical proficiency to ensure safety and quality patient outcomes. To support the growth and sustainability of the various nursing roles in clinical practice, academia, and research, it is vital to attract, engage, mentor, and retain nurses. However, as the health care needs of the nation rise, staff nurses, advanced practice registered nurses, nursing educators, and nurse scientists are experiencing unprecedented demands, and individual wellness and burnout are being more closely examined at both the university and health care system levels. The goal of this scientific statement is to outline the drivers of burnout or intent to leave the profession that impact wellness specific to academic and clinical cardiovascular and stroke nursing and propose system-level interventions to mitigate and support future and current nurse clinicians, nurse educators, and nurse scientists.

### Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of extended nursing roles in dementia care: results of the cluster-randomized trial inDePendent [^6382670f]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Thus, new healthcare models are needed to ensure individualized, high‐quality medical and nursing care for PlwD. A redistribution of responsibilities within primary care, often referred to as "extended nursing roles", could be one approach to addressing the need for innovative models and care programs.

Internationally, such roles have been formalized through the development of advanced practice nursing, in which graduate‐educated nurses with advanced competencies work collaboratively within healthcare teams and contribute to care delivery, including assessments, diagnostic reasoning, prescribing, and independent patient management. In several countries, nurses with appropriate qualifications complement primary care by acting autonomously, thereby helping to expand care capacities and improve access to timely support.

By 2019, several European countries had implemented nurse prescribing laws supported by formal education and regulatory frameworks. These roles have demonstrated high adaptability, particularly during health crises such as the COVID‐19 pandemic, and have contributed to improved care quality and patient outcomes across various settings. In contrast, the German nursing system has traditionally followed a vocational training model with a low proportion (3%) of academically trained nurses. The majority of nurses complete a 3‐year non‐academic training program and enter practice without a university degree. Although bachelor‐level nursing programs have been introduced in recent years, they are not yet the standard pathway. To address evolving care needs, several national initiatives have explored new competencies for nurses through structured training programs, resulting in extended nursing roles. These roles equip nurses – often through post‐vocational or bachelor‐level training – with skills in areas such as care coordination, needs assessment, and patient counseling. However, unlike nurse practitioner roles in countries such as the United States or United Kingdom, which may include independent prescribing rights, extended roles in Germany are currently legally limited to approved model projects within the statutory healthcare system (§63,3c and §64d Social Code Book V). These legal frameworks include specific predefined tasks in some selected disease areas (such as dementia) and allow piloting extended nursing roles in temporally restricted model projects.

### Clinical academics' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study of challenges and opportunities when working at the clinical frontline [^62679150]. BMJ Leader (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

In the UK, the term clinician refers to a healthcare professional who provides patient care, for example, a doctor, nurse, pharmacist or physiotherapist. Clinical academics usually combine clinical practice with academic research and/or teaching, although the time spent in each role can vary. There are particular differences between medical clinical academics (henceforth MCAs) and nurses, midwives and allied health professionals (AHPs) (henceforth NMAHPs), in that MCAs are usually employed by a university with an honorary hospital trust contract or vice versa, whereas there are usually no such reciprocal arrangements for NMAHPs. Therefore, while MCAs retain clinical aspects of their role alongside their academic responsibilities, many NMAHPs manage complex working arrangements and contracts across NHS and higher education institutions (HEIs). Consequently, maintaining clinical skills/training in an ever-evolving healthcare system can sometimes be challenging. Clinical academic training programmes also differ; MCAs undertake clinical and academic training in tandem, taking time away from clinical practice for research. In contrast, NMAHPs embark on clinical academic training after qualifying clinically, often stepping out of their clinical role to pursue research training. For both MCAs and NMAHPs, combining clinical and academic roles has been shown to be beneficial in many ways, but also prone to challenges such as balancing responsibilities between university and healthcare organisations.

In line with other healthcare staff, many clinical academics have responded to the call for doctors, nurses and AHPs to deliver frontline services during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide urgent patient care and cover staff shortages due to illness or needing to shield. Previous studies exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the research activity and working experience of clinical academics have either focused exclusively on doctors and dentists (MCAs)or single professions (eg, ophthalmology, nursing). However, this empirical research explores the experiences of MCAs and also NMAHPs from a range of professions. The focus is the different experiences of medical and non-MCAs returning full-time to the clinical frontline during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim is to inform recommendations for easing clinical academics' transition back to increased clinical practice when required.

### Developing nursing and allied health professional leaders: the wider impact of a professional development initiative on leadership [^023a6015]. BMJ Leader (2025). High credibility.

Background

Effective leadership is necessary across healthcare systems to ensure person-centred safe and effective care delivered by a workforce that is empowered to flourish. Similarly, research is essential to underpin evidence-based clinical practice to optimise the quality of care provided. It is important to develop the capacity and capability of the healthcare workforce to become effective clinical and research leaders; however, there are challenges. The creation of fellowship programmes such as the Director of Nursing and Allied Health Professions (AHPs) Fellowship was inspired by this need to support the skill development of these clinicians.

Aims

To report the experiences of nurses, midwives and AHPs (NMAHPs) completing the Director of Nursing and AHP Fellowship programme; a 1-year development programme focussing on leadership, research and quality improvement. To describe the broader impact of the fellowship on NMAHP leadership. To consider the implications of the fellowship on the fellows and the wider organisation and healthcare system.

Methods

The evaluation consisted of surveys and focus groups with fellows and mentors supporting them. These included clinical mentors, academic mentors, quality improvement advisors and improvement partners.

Findings

The following four themes were identified from the survey and focus group data: leadership development, networking and relationships, collaborative working and communication. Fellows' development within the programme translated into multiple clinicians securing new job roles in clinical leadership positions, and key learning has been incorporated into future iterations of the programme.

Conclusion

High-quality patient care relies on the support of research and implementation of evidence-based practice. Investment in the leadership of clinicians is key to promoting a culture of high-quality patient care and evidence-based practice. The Director of Nursing and AHP fellowship contributes to the development of nurses and AHPs implementing national priorities optimising patient care.

CRITICAL STATE OF THE NURSING WORKFORCE

Nursing is the largest workforce and plays a critical role in the stability of the health care system. According to the World Health Organization, there are ≈27 million RNs (estimated 3 245 080 RNs in the United States, which accounts for nearly 59% of the global health workforce). With the rising prevalence of chronic disease and an aging baby boomer generation, the use of nurses in the hospital setting will increase 40% by 2025. However, future growth of the nursing workforce is only expected to increase by 6% over the next decade (2022–2032) and will not meet the demand for nursing services. In addition, the nursing workforce is aging, with 47% of nurses aged > 50 years, with half approaching retirement in the next 5 to 15 years. This is not only a striking reduction in numbers, but also a decline in nurses with clinical proficiency, expert knowledge, and mentorship ability.

The implications of an aging nursing workforce extend beyond the clinical environment, with an even greater proportion of nursing faculty nearing retirement, which threatens an already strained educational system. Future growth of the nursing profession depends on a robust output of nursing graduates to ensure adequate numbers are entering the workforce each year. As the stereotypes and stigmas surrounding men in nursing fade, there is an increased number of men entering the profession (2022 [11.2%] versus 2015 [8%]), which could aid in the overall workforce decline. Unfortunately, nursing educational programs lack sufficient capacity and are forced to turn away thousands of candidates each year. In 2022, US entry‐level baccalaureate nursing programs rejected 66 261 qualified applicants due to a lack of clinical placements, preceptors, and shortage of nursing faculty. With > 63% of full‐time nursing faculty aged ≥ 50 years, the nurse‐educator shortage will continue to worsen, further reducing student capacity and restricting the growth of the profession. In addition, this shortage not only impacts clinical practice and academia but also nursing research. With < 1% of today's nursing workforce earning a doctor of philosophy (PhD) degree, nurse scientists are in high demand and are not enough to supply our future academic, research, and leadership positions. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing reports a 14.8% decline in enrollment in PhD programs over the past 10 years.

### Nursing wellness in academic and clinical cardiovascular and stroke nursing: a Scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^157aaf16]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

The academic educator specializes in teaching undergraduate or graduate‐level nursing students at the university or college level where they develop curricula, design instructional materials, and assess the student's progression and competency in the classroom and clinical settings. Some nurse educators may be involved in research. Nurse educators play a crucial role in preparing the next generation of staff nurses and APRNs by providing theoretical and clinical instruction, as well as guidance on best practices, ethics, and patient care. The DNP academic educator is deeply rooted in clinical practice and able to make the connection in the classroom between clinical practice and education.

A nurse scientist is an RN with a PhD degree who conducts scientific research that contributes to the development of new knowledge or contributes to improve patient outcomes. Nurse scientists compete for internal and external research funding and disseminate research findings through presentations at scientific meetings and publications in professional journals. In addition, nurse scientists also mentor DNP, PhD, and postdoctoral students, and early career faculty research activities. Nurse scientists who conduct research have the potential to uncover new information that can change and improve nursing practice. PhD‐prepared faculty are often called on to establish the basis for nursing practice that includes evaluating nursing interventions to prevent illness and disability, enhancing health promotion, improving quality of life through symptom management, increasing patient safety and reducing medical errors, improving the quality of hospital‐based care as well as patient satisfaction with care, preparing patients and their families to manage complex care at home and in long‐term care, and improving palliative and end‐of‐life care.

Although each of these 3 roles (clinician, academic educator, and nurse scientist) have unique responsibilities, many nurses practice within > 1 role, in particular, those with university academic or tenure track roles. These roles require the development of an independent, funded program of research, demonstration of teaching excellence, and service‐related activities (eg, committee chair, program director) at the school or university level and leadership roles in professional organizations. Some nurse scientists also maintain clinical or APRN practices, where practice hours are required to maintain certification and licensure.

Interventions for Nurse Scientists

Challenges to preserving the future growth of nursing science requires that current PhD faculty are balancing the demands of teaching and mentoring a growing number of PhD students, maintaining funding for research programs, fostering the development of new faculty colleagues, providing leadership to the profession, and for some, maintaining clinical practice skills. With the retirement of growing numbers of experienced faculty and the need for more PhD‐prepared graduates, new faculty will need to assume the responsibility of obtaining funding and education of doctoral students earlier in their career.

Institutional mechanisms that support nurse scientists' research productivity include startup funding, an office of research support, interdisciplinary collaboration, a reduced teaching load, and research or teaching assistants. Personal practices that support scholarship productivity include engaging in scholarship to become a better teacher, setting limits around professional activities and with students, experiencing gratification that students succeeded, and publishing with students. Factors predicting research productivity included a match between doctoral student and faculty research agendas, perception of scholarship as improving teaching, and institutional support for research activities. Factors that relate to the positive or negative experiences of new tenure‐track PhD‐prepared faculty have been reported to be the successful transition to academic career, development of a research program, creating work–life balance, and dealing with perceived inequities.

The joint role of nurse scientist and nurse practitioner, between a school of nursing and academic medical center, provides the ability to conduct research and disseminate joint research directly impacting patient populations, translate evidence to practice, develop educational programs for health system nurses, provide scholarly activities among health system nurses, and improve visibility and valuation of the PhD‐prepared nurse. This joint nurse scientist role fosters shared scholarly success across academia and health care systems. Strengthening collaboration between nursing schools and local health care systems can also help to achieve these outcomes.

### Attributes, skills and actions of clinical leadership in nursing as reported by hospital nurses: a cross-sectional study [^9b538488]. BMJ Leader (2023). High credibility.

'Most' important clinical nursing leadership attributes should be promoted at all organisational and clinical levels. Clinical nursing leadership's 'least' important attributes should be defeated to achieve better outcomes. Clinical nursing leaders should use innovative interventions and have skills or actions conducive to a healthy work environment. These interventions include being approachable to enable their staff to cope with change, using open and consistent communication, being visible and consistently available as role models and mentors and taking risks. Hospital administrators must help their clinical leaders, including nursing leaders, to effectively use their authority, responsibility and accountability; clinical leadership is not only about complying with the job description. A good intervention to start with to promote the culture of clinical leadership is setting an award for the 'ideal nursing leaders'. This award will bring innovative attributes, skills and actions.

Moreover, as they are in the front line of communication, nurses and clinical nursing leaders should be involved in policy-related matters and committees. An interventional programme that gives nurses more autonomy in making decisions is warranted. In turn, various patient, nurse and organisational outcomes will be improved.

The study's findings revealed statistically significant differences in the skills and actions of effective clinical leaders, with female nurses scoring higher in many skills and actions. Hence, healthcare organisations must re-evaluate current leadership and staff development policies and prioritise professional development for nurses while also introducing new modes of evaluation and assessment that are explicitly geared at improving clinical leadership among nurses, particularly males.

For education, this study outlined clinical leadership attributes, skills and actions to understand clinical nursing leadership in Jordan better. Nevertheless, nurses and clinical leaders need additional attributes, skills and actions. Consequently, undergraduate nursing students might benefit from clinical leadership programmes integrated into the academic curriculum to teach them the fundamentals of clinical leadership. A master's degree programme in 'Clinical Nursing Leadership' would prepare nurses for this pioneering role and today and tomorrow's clinical nursing leaders. However, all nurses are clinical leaders regardless of their degrees and experience. Conducting presentations, convening meetings, overseeing organisational transformation and settling disagreements are common ways to hone these abilities.

### Wound care nursing: professional issues and opportunities [^922dbf04]. Advances in Wound Care (2012). Low credibility.

As the field of wound care advances and seeks validity as a distinctive healthcare specialty, it becomes imperative to define practice competencies for all related professionals in the arena. As such, the myriad nurses practicing wound care in settings across the continuum should be understood for their unique contribution to the wound care team. Furthermore, the hierarchy of wound care nursing with varying levels of licensure, certification, and scope of practice can be clarified to delineate leadership and reimbursement issues to meet current health care challenges. A review of the role of nursing in wound care from a historical and evolutionary perspective helps to characterize the trend towards advanced practice nursing in the wound care specialty.

### State of nursing in India: persistent systemic challenges [^dd68f09f]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

The 5162 Indian Nursing Council-approved institutions in India train nurses via various courses. Annually, the number of students completing diploma, Bachelor's degree, post-introductory course and Master's degree in India are 134949, 107814, 25485, and 13971 respectively. More colleges are getting approvals every year and the training is also getting more specialised. However, opportunities for employment that utilize their specialist skills has not improved in addition to the overall quality of care. The inevitable stress faced by nurses in delivering the professional duties, and to keep their families fed and clothed, leads to burnout. Despite these challenges, nurses continue to pursue masters' and doctoral degrees to increase their knowledge and experience. However, they do not receive financial assistance most of the time, and they hardly ever receive grants to support their research.

Furthermore, there are only a handful of institutions in India viz. Christian Medical College (Vellore), Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE, Manipal), St John's Medical College Hospital (Bengaluru) and National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS, Bengaluru) which have been supportive of the changing role of nursing in India. However, it is quite challenging for the specialised nurses to locate acceptable work spaces within the healthcare system. They have been bound to serve in poorly structured roles without acknowledging their qualifications and capacities, especially in clinical areas.

Indian nurses go abroad to pursue their dreams, compete internationally and get placed in practitioner programmes. However in India, they struggle to find suitable employment, let alone promotions and positions. There is a strong need of advocacy for nurses at all levels.

Although nurses hold leadership positions, regrettably, they are not getting opportunities for contributing more. As the nomenclature and clinical duties have rarely been upgraded in India, clinical nursing is still battling to shake off the effects of colonialism. The UK and other nations have embraced the services of Indian nurses and thereby enabling high-quality healthcare. The gaps are multifaceted, starting with the level of education and training and extending far into the service industries because many nursing courses do not follow University Grants Commission (UGC) norms. They also include a lack of opportunities for practise, a poor staffing ratio, and a lack of qualification-based structures. Like other professions, nursing also needs to undergo methodical development.

### A new role profile for nurses with expanded competencies promoting person-centered care in long-term care: a mixed-methods intervention development study [^a822f517]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we developed the role profile of nurses with expanded competencies for person-centered care for residents with complex care needs in long-term care facilities following the first six steps of the PEPPA framework. Informed by results of literature reviews, a multiple case study and workshops, we identified four competence areas for nurse specialists: 1. management of chronic diseases, 2. empowerment of and communication with residents, 3. building and maintaining a person-centered care network and 4. (developing the) organization. The role profile addresses interprofessional communication through the implementation of structured communication instruments. As main implementation strategy we developed a curriculum for a 300-h training program for higher qualified nurses taking place at the university and at the workplace. To improve commitment to the implementation of the newly developed role profile, facilities will sign cooperation agreements and participate in target setting meetings. The intervention is adaptable through the integration of optional tasks, allowing participants to place a focus on their institution's specific needs. Finally, we summarized the role profile comprising intervention components, implementation strategies, mechanisms of change and contextual factors in a logic model.

The role profile developed in this study is located at a continuum of increasing competency levels between the registered nurse as a starting point and the advanced practice nurse as highest qualification level.

Internationally, role profiles for graduate nurses in direct care are implemented to a varying degree. In countries with longer tradition of academic education in nursing, advanced role profiles such as nurse practitioner and clinical nurse specialist are more established and role development and specialization focuses on these roles. A review of reviews portraying a global perspective of advanced practice nursing research showed that the majority of studies included originated from the United States and the United Kingdom. In countries with younger history of academic education in nursing, Master nurses are less present in direct care, especially in long-term care settings. Bachelor level nursing education is mostly generalist, specific skills that are related to the respective target group and care setting are not addressed in-depth and roles are blurred. With the increasing complexity of care in long-term care, and a lack of APN with master qualification that provide clinical expertise onsite, the need for specialization and expanded competencies of bachelor qualified nurses becomes evident. This applies to the German long-term care setting, and the intervention we developed addresses this gap.

### Reflections from the bedside: a nursing perspective on three decades of intensive care [^74b496bb]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

The evolution of critical care nursing

Since critical care's inception in the 1950s, nursing has been central in its development. Critical care nurses were and remain essential members of the interprofessional team that deliver direct patient care to critically ill patients. Their role has evolved significantly from being primarily task-oriented to encompassing a multifaceted profession characterized by clinical expertise, technological proficiency, unwavering patient advocacy, and compassionate care. The global COVID-19 pandemic further expedited this shift, accelerating the transformation of critical care nursing into a highly specialized and collaborative discipline. Amid the crisis, critical care nurses emerged as emotional support for isolated patients, providing comfort and connection during the most challenging of times, while also rapidly acquiring new skills to master everything from personal protective protocols to ventilation techniques and end-of-life care in unprecedented conditions.

This period also witnessed rapid changes in the conceptualization and operationalization of critical care nursing; there was the strategic redeployment of nurses from various specialties into ICUs, the inclusion of travel nurses, and the expansion of virtual nursing. These adaptations were crucial to address fluctuating patient volumes during the pandemic, underscoring the need for dynamic staffing models that could adapt to changing demands. Virtual nursing emerged as a valuable resource, empowering critical care teams to provide remote monitoring and support to patients across multiple locations. By leveraging telemedicine, virtual critical care nurses could augment the bedside workforce and deliver specialized care to patients in underserved areas. These staffing models, encompassing team nursing, pairing less experienced nurses with seasoned ICU veterans, flexible staffing ratios based on patient acuity, and virtual nursing, became instrumental in delivering quality care during crises. However, they also brought to the forefront the stark realities of current challenges, including workforce shortages and the pressing need for robust support and continuous professional development within the nursing field.

The rapid implementation of new technologies and practices in response to the pandemic highlights the need for a more evidence-based approach to healthcare innovation. While the use of virtual nursing and other staffing models proved beneficial during a crisis, it is essential to conduct rigorous research to assess their long-term effectiveness and determine the optimal implementation strategies. Staff nurses play a crucial role in this process, providing valuable insights from their frontline experience and expertise in patient care. Moreover, nurse researchers can and should be leading the evaluation, testing and implementation of these staffing models. By actively engaging in research and development, nurses can ensure that new technologies and practices are not only effective but also aligned with the core values and principles of the nursing profession.

### A new role profile for nurses with expanded competencies promoting person-centered care in long-term care: a mixed-methods intervention development study [^cb03c5d2]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Among the reasons for the lack of nurses with Bachelor's degree involved in direct care is the uncertainty of roles and responsibilities for nurses with this qualification, especially in long-term care. Graduates feel a lack of opportunities to integrate their competencies into nursing practice and are more likely to pursue an academic career outside direct care. An increasing number of graduates from 1 st cycle nursing education at university level is expected and they will provide an important human resource to meet current and future care needs in long-term care. Currently their training does not prepare them specifically for the rising complexity of elderly care in long term care. Therefore, to benefit from this resource in practice, a clear definition of the professional tasks that match their competence level and qualification concepts to support their entry in the setting are needed.

Internationally, three levels of nursing as a profession are widely established: registered nurse (RN), specialist nurse (SN) and advanced practice nurse (APN). Basic education is clearly regulated and there are definitions for advanced practice nursing. Post-basic education, especially the "specialist nurse", is less clear. In Europe, the education, certification, regulation and scope of practice of specialist nurses vary greatly. The importance to clarify competencies and the required education for specialization has therefore been emphasized. A policy model of nurses' career pathway from RN to APN from Finland locates specialist nurses on Bachelor's degree with additional education in the specialty and a role emphasis on clinical expertise, patient education and commitment to translate information into practice.

In the Expand-Care project, we strived to develop a role profile with expanded competencies, deepening those of nurses with a generalist Bachelor's degree through a specialization in person-centered care for elderly residents with complex care needs. Expanded competencies can be defined as activities a) not usually carried out in this setting by a registered nurse, or b) that have formerly been undertaken by other professions, or c) that involve new technologies or procedures, or d) require a greater degree of autonomous judgement or intervention.

### A new role profile for nurses with expanded competencies promoting person-centered care in long-term care: a mixed-methods intervention development study [^5c059718]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Research has shown that roles for expanded practice in long-term care are not only needed to improve quality of care, but also to retain qualified workforce in this setting. Working in long-term care seems to be rated second best in comparison to working in hospital by many nurses. Reasons are seen for example in limited opportunities to expand clinical skills, to strengthen professional identity, and to access interesting career pathways. A successful way to expand these competencies can be continuous professional development combining learning opportunities on the job as well as external to the work environment. In this study, we developed a comprehensive training program with blended learning elements onsite and outside of the facility. Our approach is therefore in line with current evidence and can contribute to the development of clinical leadership competencies and the retention of qualified workforce in this field.

New roles for nurses with expanded competencies are often located at hospitals where nurses work closely with physicians. Research suggests that these role profiles can enfold even greater impact in primary care or environments where a physician is not constantly available. Such is the situation in German long-term care facilities that hardly have any onsite physicians. Experiences in the US and Canada showed the benefit of nurse practitioners in long-term care facilities. Importantly, we want to point out that advanced practice nursing (APN) roles such as nurse practitioners require a Master's degree according to international conventions which is not the level addressed by our intervention. Still, we emphasized clinical skills such as management of chronic diseases. To support nurses in specializing and implementing their new role, we developed the comprehensive additional 300-h training program and thus aim to improve care for residents with these conditions.

Strengths and limitations

During the intervention development, we encountered several challenges. It is difficult for health care professionals to anticipate a role profile that currently does not exist and is to be executed by a new generation of nursing professionals whose wider scope of competencies is yet mostly unknown to the majority of stakeholders. Also, to promote improvements through these new roles, it is necessary to concede to pitfalls of today's care provision without belittling the current workforce and quality of care. Therefore, to engage all stakeholder groups in research may be challenging. Through the universities' good local partnerships with care providers, we successfully managed to recruit at least one representative of each group in the multiple case study, advisory board meetings and stakeholder workshops. Still, a higher representation of general practitioners and nurses working at the bedside would have been desirable.

HISTORY AND ROLES OF NURSES IN THE ICU

ICU nursing has evolved considerably since its early origins in the time of Florence Nightingale, when injured British soldiers in the Crimean War of the 1850s were segregated based on acuity to provide more intensive care by special-duty nurses. During the latter 19th century, intensive nursing care of acute hospitalized patients was provided by locating the sickest patients closest to the nursing stations. With advancements in technology in the 20th century, including continuous monitoring and the development of life support devices such as ventilators and newborn incubators, intensive care nursing evolved rapidly. The American Association of Cardiovascular Nurses was founded in 1969 to help educate nurses in the care of critically ill patients, and shortly thereafter, in 1971, the organization became known as the American Association of Critical Care Nurses (AACN). According to the AACN definition, "the scope of critical care nursing is defined by the dynamic interaction of the critically ill patient, the critical care nurse, and the critical care environment". ICU nursing is distinguished from general care nursing by the severity of patient illness, the skill set of the nurse, and the setting where care is provided. The roles and scope of practice for ICU nurses specifically involve providing direct and comprehensive care for acutely or critically ill patients including critical care treatments, oversight of life support equipment and invasive monitoring devices, support for patient- and family-centered care in the ICU, and overall assurance of the delivery of safe and high-quality patient care in collaboration with the interprofessional ICU team (Table 2).

By the late 1960s, the majority of U.S. hospitals with 500 or more beds had an ICU. Similar to the nurse-anesthetist and nurse-midwife programs that had provided specialty education and training for several decades, critical-care education programs in schools of nursing were also developed to support intensive care as a specialty area of nursing practice. Master's degree programs for clinical nurse specialists (CNSs) began in the late 1940s, and the first NP program was opened at the University of Colorado in 1965. Soon thereafter, specialty-focused NP programs evolved and national certification for nurses working in acute and critical care — acute care NPs — began in 1995. More recently, certifications for acute care pediatric NPs and for CNSs working in the ICU have also became available.

### Millennial health care: change you can believe in… [^f163f6e5]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

A millennium is 1,000 years. In little over a decade after the beginning of the new millennium in 2000, remarkable changes have occurred in health-care education and health-care delivery. A new millennial generation of students, trainees, junior faculty, and young practicing physicians has come of age. The numbers of women in medicine have vastly increased. Technology has impacted education with an array of educational content-delivery techniques vastly different from the usual broadcast method of teaching. New curricula have expanded to encompass teamwork with interprofessional education of the entire team. Outcomes of educational efforts now include not only knowledge transfer but also performance improvement. Delivery of health care is also dramatically different. The sentinel driver of the quality and patient safety moment, To Err Is Human, was published only 12 years ago, yet fundamental changes in expectations and measurement for health-care quality and safety have occurred to alter the health-care landscape. Financing health care has become a prime issue in the current state of the US economy. New themes in health-care delivery include teamwork and highly functioning teams to improve patient safety, the dramatic increase in palliative care and end-of-life care, and the expanded role of nursing in health-care delivery. Each issue emanating since the beginning of the millennium does not have a right vs wrong implication. This discussion is an apolitical "environmental scan" with the purpose of illuminating these dramatic changes and then outlining the implications for health-care education and health-care delivery in the coming years.

### Nursing wellness in academic and clinical cardiovascular and stroke nursing: a Scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^34c4b77b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

ROLES OF CARDIOVASCULAR AND STROKE NURSES: CLINICIAN, ACADEMIC EDUCATOR, NURSE SCIENTIST

The nursing workforce comprises staff nurses who work in outpatient, inpatient, or community settings, nurse educators, nurse scientists working in academic and clinical environments, and APRNs who provide direct services to patients. In the United States, on completion of an accredited baccalaureate program, the role of the RN or staff nurse can expand based on advanced education, responsibilities, scope of practice, and work environment. These roles include the APRN (educated with a master's degree or doctor of nursing practice [DNP]), academic educators or teachers (educated with a master's degree, DNP, educational doctorate, or PhD), and nurse scientist (PhD). Many academic nurse scientists will extend their research training through a 2‐year postdoctoral fellowship before accepting a tenure track appointment.

The staff nurse or clinician can specialize in cardiovascular and stroke nursing by obtaining specialty certifications or credentials such as a Cardiac Vascular Nursing Certification through the American Nurses Credentialing Center, or Cardiac Medicine Certification through the American Association of Critical‐Care Nurses, Stroke Certified RN credential through the American Board of Neuroscience Nursing, and Certified Rehabilitation RN through the Rehabilitation Nursing Certification Board, which demonstrates competency for providing rehabilitation, including stroke. The APRN may also specialize and become nationally certified in a variety of roles including nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, certified nurse anesthetist, and certified nurse‐midwife. Furthermore, the APRN may specialize and practice clinically with patients who have various cardiovascular conditions or populations across the life span (eg, preventive cardiology, heart failure and transplantation, electrophysiology, mechanical circulatory assistance, congenital heart disease, or stroke) or hospital units that provide care to patients with cardiovascular and stroke conditions (eg, medical or surgical cardiac or neurosurgical intensive care units, catheterization laboratory, or telemetry units) with direct or indirect physician oversight, or rural and community‐based settings. The DNP‐prepared APRN is prepared to strengthen health care delivery and improve patient outcomes by providing the highest level of competent nursing care.

### Compassionate care: not easy, not free, not only nurses [^76cede0f]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2017). Medium credibility.

The emergence of nursing as a profession was facilitated by now-discarded views of caring as a form of labour to which women were uniquely adapted by their domesticity. Sympathy as much as skill initially sanctioned the professional nurse's entry into homes and hospital wards to replace the stereotypically coarse, uncaring and untrained 'Sarah Gamp' depicted in Dickens' Martin Chuzzlewit'. ursing' and 'caring' remained largely synonymous even as late 19th-century and 20th-century nurse training programmes and literatures demanded ever-increasing levels of knowledge and specialised skills. These changes accelerated with the growing use of complex biomedical and technological interventions, driving up levels of educational and specialist attainment required by employers and regulatory bodies, and displacing the earlier dominance both in training and in practice on bedside or 'direct' nursing. By the 1960s, the nursing literature documented unease with what was perceived as a growing dichotomy at the heart of nursing between the 'supportive, affective' work of the bedside 'mother surrogate' and the 'business-like' efficiency of a 'dispassionate healer'.

In postwar Britain, international trends towards division in the nursing role were further shaped by the distinctive context of a universal comprehensive health service, funded from general taxation, and subject to both national and local control mechanisms. Under these circumstances, and particularly in the past quarter century, political and economic expediency have acted on understandings of nursing. Synchronistically, changes in educational models and pathways to professional advancement have largely demanded and rewarded nurses for specialisation and management roles, while 'skilled bedside nursing' only rarely attracted similar support. However, senior nurses with a more limited bedside role continued to be key in engendering a compassionate culture in terms of role modelling and through philosophical, theoretical and educational support.

Internal markets, managerialism and the corresponding drive to define and then achieve quantifiable levels of quality and efficiency across the health service have promoted greater interest in metricised markers of adequacy and excellence, including in the provision of compassion in nursing. Yet calls to measure compassionate care remain contentious, not least because what this constitutes is ambiguous and dynamic. Moreover, compassion inheres to human interactions, which forms a key part of influential models from nursing, such as Watson's theory of human caring; assessing this relies on subjective experiences of patients and carers, making conventional measurement strategies problematic.

### Pathways to leadership: what accounts for women's (in) equitable career paths in the health sectors in India and Kenya? A scoping review [^04f488f0]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Gendered occupational segregation

In India, there are power differentials between nurses and doctors. Nurses report that nursing is perceived as an 'unskilled' profession. One participant stated 'Leadership grows in social contexts and hierarchical settings, but a nurse is the lowest in this hierarchy'. Even in the women-dominated profession of nursing, women are often not part of decision-making bodies with doctors seen as superior. Similarly in Kenya, nurses reported that medical doctors and clinical officers were preferentially selected for leadership positions even when they had relevant qualifications because of hierarchy issues within the healthcare system.

Gendered occupational segregation is common in the health sector in India. Due to gender stereotypes around women's roles and abilities, women are deemed unsuitable for or are discouraged from, joining certain specialisations.73% of women neurosurgeons faced discouragement to join the field, including from other neurosurgeons or medical professionals and/or their families. Neurosurgery was not considered a suitable field for women due to the long-working hours, long duration of residency with a meagre stipend and the risk of professional demands impacting women's marriage prospects. Other specialties in India, such as cardiology, surgery and orthopaedic surgery, continue to be dominated by men.

Unpaid care work burden

In India, domestic responsibilities, including unpaid care work and household chores, impact women's career aspirations, growth and decisions. Two-thirds of Indian women oncologists reported 'domestic responsibilities' as the main challenge to professional growth. Women ophthalmologists found that 'greater family responsibility' was a key difficulty. Meanwhile 57% of women in academic dentistry managed domestic work alone and 63% of women were solely responsible for childcare, which affected their career development. Further, 49% of these dentists said they compromised on their work due to their family responsibilities. The authors found that women who have 'successful' careers had either delayed starting a family or were single. An analysis of the 2017–18 NSSO survey found that 54% of women with a degree in medicine were out of the labour force because they were engaged in household work.

In Kenya, some employers discriminated against women who were pregnant or had children during the recruitment process for a managerial position because they perceived that mothers would have difficulty balancing work and family obligations and ultimately resort to attending work irregularly. Pregnancy was a key reason why Kenyan student nurses dropped out of training, which rendered them unable to secure good employment.

### Expand nurses' scope of practice, strengthen nursing education to advance health equity, report advises… [^f89d4021]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Stephenson J. Expand Nurses' Scope of Practice, Strengthen Nursing Education to Advance Health Equity, Report Advises. JAMA Health Forum. 2021; 2: e211527. doi:
10. 1001/jamahealthforum.
2021. 1527 A new report from the National Academy of Medicine says that strengthening the nursing profession in several areas over the next decade — including lifting scope-of-practice barriers and expanding nursing education — is needed to promote health equity, develop a skilled and diverse nursing workforce, and protect nurses' health and well-being. "This is a transformational time for the field of nursing. While the pandemic has changed nearly every aspect of health care, the impacts on nursing may be the most profound, as demand for their skills is at an all-time high, " said Mary Wakefield, PhD, RN, visiting professor at Georgetown University and at the University of Texas at Austin and co-chair of the committee that wrote the report, in a statement.

The committee that developed the report recommends that by 2022, "all changes to institutional policies and state and federal laws adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that expand scope of practice, telehealth eligibility, insurance coverage, and payment parity for services provided by and RNs should be made permanent". Increasing the number of nurses with bachelor's and doctoral degrees is another priority cited in the report, with PhD-prepared nurses needed to conduct research aimed at improving clinical and community health, as well as to educate the next generation of nurses. Boosting the number of nurses with a focus on social determinants of health and in certain specialties with existing shortages, including behavioral health, geriatrics, long-term care, maternal health, primary care, and public and community health, is also essential to build the workforce needed in the years ahead.

If nurses are to take on the emotionally taxing work of helping to address the many social determinants of health and advancing health equity, the systems that educate and employ nurses have an obligation to fully support them as they take on these new roles, the committee says. "Policy makers, nurse employers, nursing schools, nurse leaders, and nursing associations all have a role in achieving this goal, " the report says. "Ultimately, the health and well-being of nurses influence the quality, safety, and cost of the care they provide, as well as organizations and systems of care".

### Nursing wellness in academic and clinical cardiovascular and stroke nursing: a Scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^685bb010]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Nurse scientists also engage in nursing education, practice, and service. The academic nurse scientist role encompasses more than moving science forward, often resulting in role strain, role stress, and burnout. A recent systematic review indicated the level of burnout in nursing faculty in the United States was moderate, suggesting that policymakers and administrators address workload, psychosocial well‐being, and support. Nurse scientists report that 58.9% of their time is spent on scholarship such as conducting research, writing papers, giving presentations, grant writing, and conducting evidence‐based research projects, with scholarship time being eroded by teaching and mentoring DNP and PhD degree students. Data suggest that factors related to scholarly productivity among doctoral faculty are demands of teaching across multiple program levels or large enrollment courses, institutional structures and climate for research, and the discipline. The advantages of an academic research career is relative autonomy, flexible schedules, and the opportunity to mentor doctoral students. A national survey of doctoral nursing faculty noted that priorities related to job satisfaction were primarily salary, followed by internal resources for scholarship, teaching load, climate for intellectual discourse, and quality of students. The time commitment to submit highly competitive research grants, increasing expectation of postdoctoral study, higher teaching loads, and pressures of publishing for tenure created job dissatisfaction.

In the United States, the current training capacity of research‐intensive institutions is insufficient to fulfill the national need. A concern when considering the quality of PhD degree education is the ability of doctoral faculty in suboptimally resourced institutions to maintain a program of research through which to mentor doctoral students. Without successful mentorship, doctoral graduates will be ill‐prepared to take on the full academic nursing role that requires securing research grant funding. Research productivity was reported to be the highest in doctoral faculty teaching only in PhD programs and who were working in research institutions.

### Career impact of the national interprofessional fellowship in patient safety: an alumni evaluation [^1fed6147]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This study sought to understand whether alumni were in fact interprofessional, and their perceptions of QPS skill development, QPS skill utilisation and the impact of an interprofessional QPS advanced fellowship on alumni's careers. The demographic descriptors of alumni when they matriculated into the programme suggest that the interprofessional design was successful as diverse professions were represented across alumni. Roughly half were clinicians from varied disciplines such as physician, nurse, pharmacist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, dentist and podiatrist. A similarly sized group were those from non-clinical backgrounds. Many from the non-clinical group had degrees focused on public health or hospital administration; however, some had degrees from non-clinical and non-healthcare backgrounds including engineering, anthropology and organisational psychology. This demonstrates that there is interest across disciplines and professional backgrounds in interprofessional QPS training programmes since individuals from a variety of training backgrounds enrolled in the advanced interprofessional QPS fellowship.

Overall, alumni were highly satisfied with their fellowship experience and reported high degrees of knowledge and expertise regarding patient safety on completing the fellowship. The outcomes regarding career impacts of the fellowship reflect the considerable diversity of alumni's backgrounds and the emergent nature of patient safety as a field. Most notable was the fact that career paths focused on QPS education were the most common overall. As health profession education programmes have begun to include and integrate QPS into their curriculum, alumni of this fellowship have filled critical roles including leadership roles in those efforts. Research post fellowship was also common, with a small number of fellows working as full-time researchers post fellowship, including obtaining external grant support. More notable was that half of the fellows contributed to the academic literature on patient safety after graduation. Conventional roles blending clinical practice and patient safety administration were common, especially for clinician fellows, with about half of those alumni entering that role.

### Standards of nutrition care practice and professional performance for nutrition support and generalist nurses [^6b642c38]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2016). Medium credibility.

Nutrition support nursing (NSN) definition, scope, roles, historical development, and credentialing are summarized as follows: Nutrition support nursing (NSN) is a professional nursing specialty that focuses on the protection, promotion, and optimization of nutritional health and functional abilities and prevention of nutrition-related illness and injury, and NSN works collaboratively with other disciplines in a variety of settings along the continuum of care and across all developmental stages. The historical development of the specialty of NSN focuses on 3 periods: the practice period (1854–1960), the specialty period (1960–2000), and the expansion period (2000–2015). The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) has served as the professional home for NSN since 1976. The scope of practice includes but is not limited to direct patient care; consultation with other healthcare professionals; education of patients/caregivers, students, colleagues, and the public; participation in research activities and performance improvement; and administrative functions. Traditional roles for NSN include working as a member of an interdisciplinary nutrition support service or team, whereas emerging NSN roles for the 21st century focus on 3 major areas: clinical practice, academia/research, and entrepreneur/industry, with specialty emphasis in geriatrics, obesity, surgical specialties, wound ostomy care, pediatrics or neonatal care, transplantation, and infection control. NS nurses interested in demonstrating a commitment to advancing one's knowledge and skill set can opt to obtain certification as a certified nutrition support clinician (CNSC), and the certified nutrition support nurse (CNSN) credential was retired in 2012.

### Factors influencing the development, recruitment, integration, retention and career development of advanced practice providers in hospital health care teams: a scoping review [^d5a3caee]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Increasing demand, growing complexity of healthcare and workforce shortages have led hospitals and healthcare organisations to consider innovative service models and new clinical roles. Advanced practice providers (APPs), including physician assistants/associates (PAs), nurse practitioners (NPs) and other non-physician roles, is a term that has been used for coding and billing purposes by the US Medicare and Medicaid; however, we acknowledge that this term might not be accepted or preferred by all PA and NP professions but use it for convenience here. APPs have a long history, dating back as early as the nineteenth century in low- and middle-income countries. They later emerged in the US in the 1960s and subsequently in many countries of various stages of development. Now PAs exist in over 62 countries under different practice titles, and an estimated 40 countries have well-established NP roles. Both PA and NP roles were first introduced in primary care in the US to address the shortage of primary care physicians, but their roles have evolved and they are now more prevalent in secondary care and across different specialty areas. Despite variable job role titles, APPs often have considerable overlap in their scope of practice, often including providing clinical leadership and enabling collaborations in multi-professional teams.

Previous systematic reviews have provided evidence on the role and contribution of APPs in hospital health care teams, including reduced waiting and processing time, improved patient continuity and satisfaction, similar clinical safety and patient outcomes, and possibly contained cost and enhanced educational experiences of other trainees. There has been less focus on understanding why and how health systems and hospitals develop APP roles as well as how to best integrate and retain them. This is especially important as reconfiguring the workforce and introducing new roles will often lead to professional jurisdiction and boundary tensions, impacting early role development and integration. Additionally, less well-defined career progression pathways beyond entry-level especially for roles like PA could lead to poor retention, worsening workforce shortages and avoidable turnover costs.

In this scoping review, we aim to summarise the factors associated with the development, recruitment, integration, retention and career development of APP roles in secondary care teams. This review can inform regulators, hospital managers and policy-makers on factors to consider while using APPs to address hospital workforce challenges. This is especially important for countries like the UK where the development of PA roles is relatively new and hospitals face significant challenges integrating PA into the workforce with confusion over and contestation around roles.

### Nursing wellness in academic and clinical cardiovascular and stroke nursing: a Scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^2eae0c32]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

DRIVERS OF BURNOUT/STRESS IN CLINICIANS, ACADEMIC EDUCATORS, AND NURSE SCIENTIST ROLES

Each role within cardiovascular and stroke nursing is faced with an array of stressors that may adversely impact practice and nursing wellness. For the hospital‐based staff nurse or clinician, these stressors include excessive workload and long working hours, perceived low compensation, exposure to death and suffering, moral distress (knowing the right course of action but unable to perform due to institutional constraints), and working in high‐pressure or high‐stakes patient environments. These stressors were heightened during the COVID‐19 pandemic, when fear of infectious exposure contributed to an already stressful workplace. Furthermore, the high complexities associated with care of patients with acute cardiovascular and neurovascular conditions can contribute to work‐related stress and burnout early in nursing careers. For academic educators, stressors include growing workload demands secondary to the current nursing faculty shortage, increased teaching assignments resulting in loss of work–life balance, and dissatisfaction with workload, salary, and availability of teaching support. Drivers of stress for nurse scientists include balancing research responsibilities in addition to clinical practice, academic teaching, administrative responsibilities, securing research funding, meeting grant deadlines with limited institutional research support, publication requirements, and mentoring responsibilities while balancing work and professional life. The Figure represents the roles and drivers of stress and burnout in academic and clinical cardiovascular and stroke nursing. Many of these stressors are not unique to cardiovascular and stroke nursing and can be applied across specialties and settings.

### Academic internal medicine hospitalist professional identity development [^45afa4d0]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Academic hospitalists have major roles in medical education, clinical care, and other academic medical center missions. Their professional identity development has implications for vitality, burnout, retention, and patient safety.

Objective

To characterize academic internal medicine hospitalist professional identity and its development.

Methods

Ten focus group interviews were conducted with 31 hospitalists in early-, mid-, and late-career stages at three academic medical centers. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results

Academic hospitalist identity development was characterized by (1) constant core clinician identity, (2) navigating interfaces between different spheres of knowledge, influence, and activity (patients, systems, learners, and multiple medical and psychosocial issues), (3) expanding identities in the "extension zone" outside of patient care, (4) variable and ambiguous academic identity, (5) ongoing negotiation between extrinsic factors (resources, relationships, and validation), intrinsic factors (personal identities and professional values), and identity development, (6) diverse career trajectories, and (7) professional identity driving career decision-making.

Conclusions

In contrast to a "deficit" view of generalists lacking focus on a specific disease or organ system, academic internal medicine hospitalist professional identity encompasses distinct roles and skills. While hospitalists individualize their activities outside the context of patient care, the core clinician identity remains a beacon guiding these activities. Hospitalists' varied and ambiguous concepts of what it means to be academic may contribute to lagging academic progress. Organizations should support hospitalists' unique professional identities, seek clarity around what it means to be academic, and foster ongoing professional identity development.

### Educational levels of hospital nurses and surgical patient mortality… [^40ad8c0e]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

education in 1 of 3 types of programs: 3-year diploma programs in hospitals, associate degree nursing programs in community colleges, and baccalaureate nursing programs in colleges and universities. In 1950, 92% of new RNs graduated from hospital diploma programs, 11 whereas by 2001, only 3% graduated from hospital diploma programs, 61% came from associate. degree programs, and 36% were baccalaureate program graduates. 12 Surprisingly little is known about the benefits, if any, of the substantial growth in the numbers of nurses with bachelor's degrees. Indeed the conventional wisdom is that nurses' experience is more important than their educational levels. Despite the diversity of educational programs preparing RNs, and a logical. that varied in terms of their educational composition on hospital characteristics, including nurse experience and nurse staffing, and patient characteristics.

Logistic regression models were used to estimate the effects of a 10% increase in the proportion of nurses who had a bachelor's or master's degree on patient mortality and failure to rescue, and to estimate the effects of nurse staffing. bachelor's and master's degrees and the risks of both mortality and failure to rescue, both before and after controlling for other hospital and patient characteristics. Each 10% increase in the proportion of nurses with higher degrees decreased the risk of mortality and of failure to rescue by a factor of 0. 95, or by. hospitals' employment of nurses with BSN and higher degrees is associated with improved patient outcomes. Our findings indicate that surgical patients cared for in hospitals in which higher proportions of direct-care RNs held bachelor's degrees experienced a substantial survival advantage over those treated in hospitals in which fewer staff nurses had BSN or higher degrees.

Similarly, surgical patients experiencing serious complications during hospitalization were significantly more likely to survive in hospitals with a higher proportion of nurses with baccalaureate education. When the proportions of RNs with hospital diplomas and associate degrees as their highest educational credentials were examined separately, the particular type of educational credential for nurses with less than a bachelor's degree. seen an upturn. 21, 32 The return of diploma- and associate degree–prepared RNs to colleges and universities after their initial preparation has been an important source of baccalaureate-prepared nurses. About 22% of currently employed hospital RNs with BSN or higher degrees received them after their basic educations. 21 However.

### Radiographers' self-assessed level and use of competencies-a national survey [^7d506af1]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The recent advances in radiological technology and the changed radiographic process and nursing focus have influenced radiographers' clinical competency. Both in- and out-patients require high quality care and support, to either detect a condition or provide relevant medical care (e.g. to a critically ill and unstable patient). It is also necessary to encounter both very young and elderly patients in a professional manner. In some specific clinical situations (e.g. mobile radiography services in primary health care or in homes for the elderly), no routine procedures are possible, which creates a need for flexibility. Furthermore, the recent evolution of molecular imaging has increased the need for additional competency.

In most countries, registered nurses are responsible for nursing care, while a radiological technologist or corresponding professional is in charge of the radiological equipment. However, in Sweden, highly educated specialist registered radiographers, who before 2001 were known as registered nurses in diagnostic radiology, have a unique position due to being responsible for the entire radiographic examination, nursing actions and medical technology, e.g. injections, catheterising and medical technical equipment. There are no differences in training; the different names depend on the terminology of the academic degree. It is essential that radiographers continuously strive to improve their competency both in radiography and nursing care. In view of the recent work-related changes, self-assessments of competency are of importance since they may contribute to a basic understanding of the competency needs in clinical work today. They can be useful for identifying organisational weaknesses, highlighting important educational needs and providing evidence for the development of preceptor courses. Lack of competency due to inadequate education and knowledge may increase the risk of injuries and put patient safety at risk. Furthermore, competence assessments may promote individual professional development. Assessing radiographers' clinical competence is therefore of major importance in all medical imaging departments and a fundamental prerequisite for guaranteeing professional standards in both nursing care and radiography.

Despite the fact that self-assessment has been reported to be the most common form of competence evaluation, no studies defining the modern registered radiographers' self-assessment of clinical competencies were identified, except the one Smith and Fisher conducted in 2011, which focussed on registered nurses who had completed a short course in basic radiography. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to describe radiographers' self-assessed level and use of competencies, as well as how sociodemographic and situational factors are associated with these competencies, particularly in relation to work experience.

### Barriers to advancing women nurses in healthcare leadership: a systematic review and meta-synthesis [^02ca8e56]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Workplace difficulties are a significant additional obstacle; women nurses frequently experience unconscious bias and gender-related discrimination when it comes to leadership positions in nursing, which causes gender inequities within the industry. The convergence of additional factors, such as race, religion, caste, class, and ethnicity, further disadvantage women with more than one marginalized identity. Forging an inclusive and diverse nursing workforce, including addressing cultural ideologies, requires overcoming these obstacles. Another key factor that affects motivation related to the perception of nursing professionalism. Nurses' unique skills and expertise make them valuable healthcare team members, and their leadership can help improve the overall quality of care. Nurses are transforming into an autonomous and well-educated workforce. Nurse education is at least a three-year programme in 97% of countries. However, a lack of recognition and support from other healthcare professionals and organisational leadership demotivates nurses. These barriers were reported as a lack of opportunity, power, and autonomy, which undermine nurses' performances and competencies. A negative image of nursing was detrimental to nurse leaders' participation in leadership activities like health policy development. Despite the advances in nursing education and the evolution of the profession, there is a prevailing perception that nurses primarily provide supportive roles rather than leadership roles. This creates a culture that undervalues nurses' abilities and expertise, affecting motivation and opportunities for career advancement and involvement in decision-making processes.

In terms of opportunity barriers, organisational structural issues have negatively affected nurses' career advancement. Industrial agreement portability of qualification allowances presents financial barriers to career transitions. Clinical nurse specialist role criteria require substantial clinical skills, professional development, and professional behaviour, including support and contribution of quality improvement work and research projects within the area of practice. Moving workplaces may result in losing these roles and grades. These have not been adequately studied or reported and more research is needed. Other barriers to leadership opportunities included prioritisation of full-time over part-time roles. This can be demotivating for part-time nurses who work flexibly. Acute care experience was regarded as a requirement for leadership roles, leaving behind community, sub-acute, and aged care nurses. Additionally, non-permanent staff have been excluded from career advancement opportunities. We confirmed barriers for older nurses, with a lack of opportunities for education and advancement, a lack of acceptance and recognition, and being bullied.

### The national hartford center of gerontological nursing excellence: an evolution of a nursing initiative to improve care of older adults [^b00f083c]. The Gerontologist (2015). Low credibility.

The mission of the John A. Hartford Foundation is to improve the health of older Americans. This mission has been realized throughout the evolution of the National Hartford Center of Gerontological Nursing Excellence-an international collaboration between Schools of Nursing and Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing-whose goal is to support research, education, and practice to provide better nursing care for our aging society. The National Hartford Center is the focus of this supplement and an example of the Foundation's grant-making to prepare the nursing workforce to be competent to care for our aging society. This article traces the innovative origin and inception of the National Hartford Center, first as the Building Academic Geriatric Nursing Capacity (BAGNC) Initiative in 2000 under the leadership of two groundbreaking scholars in nursing and aging sciences: Claire M. Fagin, PhD, RN, and Patricia G. Archbold, DNSc. We continue through to today's leadership and culminate by describing the Center's influence on the gerontological nursing workforce and clinical practice; the paper also includes a brief introduction to the articles, highlighting advances in gerontological nursing science. With funding from the John A. Hartford Foundation, The Atlantic Philanthropies, The Mayday Fund, and a number of creative public and nonprofit partnerships, the National Hartford Center celebrates two decades and its greatest asset-the nearly 300 gerontological nursing leaders, including Archbold nursing pre-docs, Fagin nursing post-docs, and expert faculty, along with its Hartford Centers of Gerontological Nursing Excellence across the country. We trace the transition of BAGNC to the membership-based National Hartford Center and its move to The Gerontological Society of America to become a self-sustaining, autonomous unit. Current needs, challenges, lessons learned, and strategies of the National Hartford Center are examined within the context of sustainability, which has become paramount as Hartford Foundation funding ends in 2016. Despite the auspicious beginnings of the National Hartford Center, system change has been slow. There remains a strong need to continue to grow the field of gerontological nursing and aging sciences. We are working diligently to drive health system reform, and develop and support gerontological nursing leaders and members of the National Hartford Center as exemplars for innovation in care of older adults. The contributing authors of this supplement are from member schools of the National Hartford Center or are current or past program Scholars or Fellows. Herein these authors showcase innovation for older adults through their research that addresses an array of diseases and conditions affecting human systems, embedded in a variety of environments, including in-home care, subsidized housing communities, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, memory care units, and rural community environs.

### Adult cardiothoracic transplant nursing: an ISHLT consensus document on the current adult nursing practice in heart and lung transplantation [^055773f1]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The role of nurses in cardiothoracic transplantation has evolved over the last 25 years. Transplant nurses work in a variety of roles in collaboration with multidisciplinary teams to manage complex pre- and post-transplantation issues. There is lack of clarity and consistency regarding required qualifications to practice transplant nursing, delineation of roles and adequate levels of staffing.

Methods

A consensus conference with workgroup sessions, consisting of 77 nurse participants with clinical experience in cardiothoracic transplantation, was arranged. This was followed by subsequent discussion with the ISHLT Nursing, Health Science and Allied Health Council. Evidence and expert opinions regarding key issues were reviewed. A modified nominal group technique was used to reach consensus.

Results

Consensus reached included: (1) a minimum of 2 years nursing experience is required for transplant coordinators, nurse managers or advanced practice nurses; (2) a baccalaureate in nursing is the minimum education level required for a transplant coordinator; (3) transplant coordinator-specific certification is recommended; (4) nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists and nurse managers should hold at least a master's degree; and (5) strategies to retain transplant nurses include engaging donor call teams, mentoring programs, having flexible hours and offering career advancement support. Future research should focus on the relationships between staffing levels, nurse education and patient outcomes.

Conclusions

Delineation of roles and guidelines for education, certification, licensure and staffing levels of transplant nurses are needed to support all nurses working at the fullest extent of their education and licensure. This consensus document provides such recommendations and draws attention to areas for future research.

### Frailty nurse and GP-led models of care in care homes: the role of contextual factors impacting enhanced health in care homes framework implementation [^9b4f5ddb]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Additional support and education

Due to the evolution from the FN-led to TFN-led model, various support mechanisms were implemented to assist the new trainees in gaining relevant skills and knowledge and in developing the role. Extra support was instigated both in practice settings and through access to university courses leading to the required qualifications.

GP frailty specialists and specialist frailty leads were recruited as part of the TFN support team and facilitated individual personal development plans, peer support mechanisms alongside delivering weekly education sessions to the TFNs. Whilst undertaking this training, TFNs were limited in the clinical activity, such as assessments, they could undertake.

'O nce I've done my clinical skills – my skill level will be higher than that of the current nursing staff. And I will then go and listen to the chests and say, yeah, I'll get the GP to prescribe some antibiotics. But, at the minute, I don't have any more skills than the nursing staff' (FN-led Model, Participant 9: TFN)

TFNs were regularly mentored and for the first 6 months, were supported by the FN Lead to develop their role in context. This was also linked to preparing for future statutory national drives regarding specialty care requirements for the ageing cohort these nurses were working with. This support was helpful to all TFNs and the wider team, given they came to the posts without formal frailty training.

'… Only one of them was from that [frailty] background. But they all have been looking after older people… It was getting one-to-ones, getting team meetings… Making them be safe from a nursing perspective. And… the way that they worked in this medically driven primary healthcare federation world' (FN-led Model, Participant 11: Primary Care Team)

### Proposals for the implementation of a multidimensional platform that allows the advancement of oncology nursing in the latin American environment (the INCREASE proposal) [^9a48552b]. JCO Global Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Cancer constitutes a significant global health challenge, with projections indicating a continued increase in its prevalence in the foreseeable future. This trend is particularly pronounced in Latin America (LATAM), where the cancer burden has increased substantially over the coming decades. Concurrently, nursing, which represents the largest segment of the health care workforce globally, is important for addressing the multifaceted challenges posed by cancer care, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite the essential role of nursing in cancer care, several barriers hinder its optimal contribution, particularly in LMICs. These challenges include professional hierarchy, insufficient educational standards, underfunding for research, and limited representation in decision-making processes.

Methods

To address these challenges, collaborative initiatives, such as the INCREASE Proposal, have emerged, aimed at fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and action in oncology nursing within LATAM. Through focused workshops and agile methodologies, the INCREASE Proposal seeks to identify barriers and formulate solutions across key areas including education, research, clinical practice, and policy implementation.

Results

The outcomes of the INCREASE Proposal underscore the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to strengthen oncology nursing in the LATAM. These strategies include enhancing education and recognition within health care systems, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, leveraging advanced technologies, conducting cost-benefit analyses, and promoting research-academic partnerships.

Conclusion

By addressing these challenges and implementing the proposed solutions, LATAM can advance toward optimized oncology nursing practice, improving cancer care delivery and outcomes across the region.

### A scoping review on determining Australian nurse engagement in eye care settings [^bf5985d6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

As the Australian population grows and ages, the demand for eye care services, and nurses to provide the services, is expected to increase. This will impact nurses, who are Australia's largest health-care provider group. Understanding and mapping the current role and use of nurses in eye care is an essential first step for future health workforce planning and development. To map their engagement, we undertook a scoping review to gain an understanding of the current Australian nurse eye care workforce landscape, to help guide and support future workforce development activities. Secondly, we evaluated if publications in this field incorporated or mentioned the Australian Ophthalmic Nursing Association's National Standards (Practice standards) in their publication. This review also offers other nations and eye care providers the opportunity to evaluate their own health workforce plan and nurse utility.

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a review of academic and grey literature, via various search engines, and an inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Results

We uncovered 11 publications. Of those, five were academic papers examining extended and advanced nursing practice, one was a letter to the editor, two were industry feature reviews, two were industry reports and the final was the Practice Standards. Key themes throughout indicated the benefit of nurse training and nurse involvement in eye care. Overall, there was insufficient information or data to describe nurse deployment, practice and utility. Finally, the Practice Standards were not referenced in any publication.

Conclusion

There is insufficient published information to calculate the level and involvement of nurses, or describe their existing role, advancement or future deployment in eye care in Australia. Without clear information, Australia is unable to develop effective health workforce strategies to attract, train, retain, and appropriately deploy nurses to meet future eye care needs.

### Genetic counselors' professional identity in north America: a scoping review [^4283ea5e]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Medium credibility.

The impact of expanding roles on PI among other health professionals has been documented (Piil et al; Thompson et al.). Thompson et al. conducted a qualitative study of nurses who were working in nursing homes. They described this setting as different from traditional roles since nursing home nurses attended to the social well‐being of their patients rather than only their healthcare needs, which negatively impacted their PI. Similar to findings described within the genetic counseling literature (Groepper et al; Strohmeyer et al; Zetzsche et al.), nursing home nurses expressed feelings of being isolated and excluded — 'us versus them' — from the remainder of the nursing profession (Thompson et al.). Yet, shared characteristics, like training, actions, and values, allowed participants to maintain a sense of professional identity as a nurse: "And I think we're all doing the same training — because we're working, we're doing the same thing. We should be you know, we all have the same goals and the same standards and things like that" (p. 1059).

### Nurse practitioners and physician assistants: building a team and optimizing practice in the medical ICU [^74253607]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

How to Identify the Correct Candidate

Identifying the most appropriate NP and PA candidates for the critical care team is imperative to success. NPs and PAs share similar professional responsibilities; however, understanding each profession's uniqueness is essential for aligning with regulations and optimizing the scope of practice and engagement for the NP or PA.

NPs are registered nurses who receive advanced education at the master's or doctoral level to prepare them for advanced practice as a provider. The DNP, or "Doctor of Nursing Practice", is a practice-focused doctoral degree in which students pursue a focused clinical or administrative track, including an independent scholarly project. NP academic programs include didactic and clinical education based on national standards that focus on attainment of core and population competencies. Graduates must pass the appropriate population-specific national board certification examination that their educational program prepared them for prior to obtaining licensure as an NP. The NP's scope of practice must be aligned with the individual NP's education and certification. The NP and the employer are responsible for ensuring that NP credentials adhere to the designated scope of practice as determined by their graduate-level training, certification, and licensing. All NPs should be credentialed to practice to their full scope.

### Transformation of the education of health professionals in China: progress and challenges [^048fa2ae]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

In this Review we examine the progress and challenges of China's ambitious 1998 reform of the world's largest health professional educational system. The reforms merged training institutions into universities and greatly expanded enrolment of health professionals. Positive achievements include an increase in the number of graduates to address human resources shortages, acceleration of production of diploma nurses to correct skill-mix imbalance, and priority for general practitioner training, especially of rural primary care workers. These developments have been accompanied by concerns: rapid expansion of the number of students without commensurate faculty strengthening, worries about dilution effect on quality, outdated curricular content, and ethical professionalism challenged by narrow technical training and growing admissions of students who did not express medicine as their first career choice. In this Review we underscore the importance of rebalance of the roles of health sciences institutions and government in educational policies and implementation. The imperative for reform is shown by a looming crisis of violence against health workers hypothesised as a result of many factors including deficient educational preparation and harmful profit-driven clinical practices.

### Nursing wellness in academic and clinical cardiovascular and stroke nursing: a Scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^e103f20a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Specific Actions for Nurse Scientists

Nurse scientists have the potential to develop or discover innovative or novel therapeutics to assist the burden of cardiovascular and stroke‐related conditions and the overall general population. Support for nurse scientists has largely fallen on academic universities and health care centers with a research infrastructure that encourages or requires individuals to secure grant funding. Early career nurse scientists are often evaluated for tenure‐track positions based on showing promise to develop an externally funded independent program of research. This potential can be demonstrated by a history of scientific presentations and publications, a record of previous funding, known relationships with successful investigators, contribution to the scientific community, and clear scientific research goals. Dedicated research time in the face of other competing clinical, teaching, and service demands remains the critical barrier to productivity, funding application submissions, and achieving academic tenure or promotions. Institutional research support to ensure reduced teaching assignments or protected time, statistical and publication support, shared research staff and equipment, and allocating travel assistance to conferences to disseminate findings and networking is needed to promote visibility in the scientific community.

### The evolution of the emergency care practitioner role in england: experiences and impact [^048dc196]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The emergency care practitioner (ECP) is a generic practitioner who combines extended nursing and paramedic skills. The "new" role emerged out of changing workforce initiatives intended to improve staff career opportunities in the National Health Service and ensure that patients' health needs are assessed appropriately.

Objective

To describe the development of ECP Schemes in 17 sites, identify criteria contributing to a successful operational framework, analyse routinely collected data and provide a preliminary estimate of costs.

Methods

There were three methods used: (a) a quantitative survey, comprising a questionnaire to project leaders in 17 sites, and analysis of data collected routinely; (b) qualitative interpretation based on telephone interviews in six sites; and (c) an economic costing study.

Results

Of 17 sites, 14 (82.5%) responded to the questionnaire. Most ECPs (77.4%) had trained as paramedics. Skills and competencies have been extended through educational programmes, training, and assessment. Routine data indicate that 54% of patient contacts with the ECP service did not require a referral to another health professional or use of emergency transport. In a subset of six sites, factors contributing to a successful operational framework were strategic visions crossing traditional organisational boundaries and appropriately skilled workforce integrating flexibly with existing services. Issues across all schemes were patient safety, appropriate clinical governance, and supervision and workforce issues. On the data available, the mean cost per ECP patient contact is 24.00 pounds sterling, which is less than an ED contact of 55.00 pounds sterling.

Conclusion

Indications are that the ECP schemes are moving forward in line with original objectives and could be having a significant impact on the emergency services workload.

### Building the evidence for nursing practice: learning from a structured review of SIOP abstracts, 2003–2012 [^3e9a61f3]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The focus of work submitted to an international conference can reflect the changing landscape of a specialty and prove important for identifying trends, uncovering gaps, and providing new directions for nurse-led research and clinical practice. We present an analysis of trends in presentations in the nursing program at the SIOP congress from 2003 to 2012 based on all accepted abstracts.

Procedure

A total of 462 abstracts were analyzed. A data extraction form was used to ensure consistency of data retrieved. Paired researchers were assigned 2 years of abstracts for assessment: approximately 80–100 abstracts each. Data were entered into REDCap data management software.

Results

Most abstracts came from presenters affiliated with institutions in Europe and North America with a noticeably significant under-representation from developing countries. There was an equal representation of papers focused on empirical research with family members and clinical practice focused on the professional role, although this varied in some years. Analysis of research methodology revealed a predominance of surveys, with a recent increase in qualitative and mixed method studies. Out of all abstracts only 18% were subsequently published.

Conclusions

Gaps have been identified, such as the limited involvement of nurses in developing countries, and lack of studies self-reporting from children. Much needs to be done to promote a greater diversity of research frameworks and more dynamic research designs. The small percentage of abstracts from nurses that are eventually published may hinder translation of the findings into clinical practice.

P425 How composition and processes of the interdisciplinary team impacts transition of International Medical Graduates (IMGs) into their ICU fellowship

A Mecklenburg 1, U Najeeb 2, L Rose 3, L Lingard 4, D Piquette 3

1 Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care, University of Toronto, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; 2 Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; 3 Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; 4 Centre for Education Research and Innovation, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, Canada

Introduction: The practice of critical care is complex. The inability or delayed ability of IMGs to adapt to their new training environment and professional roles at the beginning of their ICU fellowship may compromise trainee education and patient care [1]. We explored how the composition and processes of the interdisciplinary ICU team affects this transition.

Methods: We conducted a qualitative single centered study based on 23 individual interviews with 16 IMG fellows enrolled in the Adult Critical Care Fellowship Program at the University of Toronto. Fellow's perceptions of their role and transition within the interdisciplinary ICU team were explored. We used a constructivist grounded theory approach based on purposive and theoretical sampling, inductive thematic coding, and constant comparison to build an iterative, interdisciplinary theoretical understanding of IMG fellows' transition into ICU teams.

Results: Our analysis revealed two main challenges related to the interdisciplinary team: 1) the preponderant role of different team members (e.g. nurses and respiratory therapists), and, 2) the elaborated orchestration of rounds. Early in their fellowship, IMGs had a limited understanding of their role within the interdisciplinary team. As a result, fellows reported experiencing many professional losses regarding their skills, autonomy, appreciation, efficiency, and personal work standards. Combined, these losses threatened fellows' self-confidence. IMGs negotiated this period by relying on various strategies: trusting honed clinical skills, building trust with certain team members, changing own attitudes towards teamwork, or seeking social support.

Conclusions: The interdisciplinary ICU team plays an important role in IMG fellows' transition and the unique composition and processes of the ICU team are instrumental in the dynamic process of collapse and re-construction of IMG fellows professional identity early in their fellowship.

### Confronting power in low places: historical analysis of medical dominance and role-boundary negotiation between health professions in Nigeria [^96f62a2a]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Historical evolution of health professions and health services in Nigeria

Formal health services in Nigeria have deep historical roots in the British colonial legacy of health service organisation. Nigeria inherited colonial hospital models of care which established a hierarchical system of health professions that had medicine at the top, with other professions performing subordinate roles to support service delivery. Some factors consolidated this domination, most notable being the establishment and recognition of self-regulating professional medical associations, the Nigerian Medical Association (in 1960) and the Nigerian Medical Council (in 1963) shortly after independence from British colonial rule in 1960. As the earliest statutory regulatory health organs, their powerful political influence positioned the medical profession as gatekeepers with the jurisdiction to control the scope and practice of the other, less evolved and organised, health professions.

Compared with medicine, the nursing profession in Nigeria evolved more slowly despite a slightly longer history as a self-regulating profession — the Nursing Council of Nigeria was formed in 1947. Nevertheless, the nursing profession also became politically skilful enough to enjoy considerable autonomy within Nigeria's health workforce, using strategies similar to that of the medical profession. Together, these strategies refer to the concept of 'occupational closure', by which occupations use regulation or licensure to secure or consolidate jurisdictions of work. Given their historical head-start, medicine and nursing could be seen as the central health professions in Nigeria, and have for the most part influenced policy framing, formulation and implementation. Similar strategies were, although much later on, being employed by other health professions. The Pharmacists Council of Nigeria was established in 1992, while the Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria was established in 2004.

Human resources for health governance is overseen by the Federal Ministry of Health whose primary functions include central policy development and health-sector coordination. At sub-national levels, human resource for health governance occurs through clinical-administrative decision-making at different levels of governance. At each level, health sector functions are overseen by the medical profession, both clinically and managerially, with medical hierarchy existing alongside subordinate health professionals and administrative staff. Although all health professions have individual hierarchies supervised by individual profession-head, they formally report to a medical director (typically a doctor) with clinical and administrative duties. This arrangement is considered the norm and is reflected in the headship of health ministries and agencies.

### The future of respiratory care: results of a New York state survey of respiratory therapists [^4f315a1c]. Respiratory Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In the current health-care environment, respiratory care may need to make significant changes to academic preparation and clinical practice. The purpose of this research was to assess current needs of respiratory therapists (RTs) in New York State and to understand how RTs perceive their future clinical and academic roles.

Methods

This study employed a descriptive, cross-sectional non-experimental design. Between October and December 2014, a 32-item online survey was distributed via e-mail to the 2,170 members of the New York State Society of Respiratory Care. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize responses, and bivariate analyses were assessed using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests.

Results

The response rate was 22% and resulted in 435 valid surveys returned. Seventy percent of 415 respondents agreed that the practice of respiratory care is at risk of losing practitioners. The most important incentive for retention of practitioners in the field was professional growth and an expanded scope of clinical practice. Specifically, the most important of these roles was gaining the ability to assess patients, develop a plan of care, and receive reimbursement for services. Sixty-four percent of 415 respondents strongly agreed that the minimum academic standard for RTs should be raised to the baccalaureate level. Of 415 respondents, the majority (78%) agreed that it is important for therapists to remain in the profession and to be an active member of the American Association for Respiratory Care (83%).

Conclusions

These data are useful to the profession, notably for academic programs that must meet the need for a more highly prepared and skilled workforce. The findings emphasize that viability of the profession in the current health-care environment calls for the evolution of a more autonomous RT who can be reimbursed for services and obtain salaries that are competitive with other health professions.

### Is healthcare a team sport? Widening our lens on interprofessional collaboration and education in sport and exercise medicine [^1eef1499]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Strengthening roles and responsibilities of exercise science professionals

Another point addressed in the webinar was that the work done by exercise science professionals should be better acknowledged. Various professions (eg, physicians, physiotherapists, nurses, dietitians, biomedical scientists) are involved in SEM, and besides these, exercise sciences professionals play a vital role in this community (eg, physical activity promotion, prevention, therapy or rehabilitation). Thus, exercise science professionals should be recognised as part of the interprofessional SEM healthcare team. To achieve this, policy and health insurances should recognise and support exercise professionals as healthcare providers. In contrast to Switzerland, more accredited exercise physiologists (AEPs) are professionally involved in the Australian healthcare system. These AEPs often work in collaboration with physicians, physiotherapists and other allied health professionals, are recognised as healthcare providers, a professional organisation represents their interests and the services they deliver are covered by health insurance. This leads to more than half of the trained exercise scientists (58%) work in the Australian healthcare system. In comparison, less than 5% of their Swiss counterparts are involved in the Swiss healthcare system. Interestingly, AEPs' practice has a clear and positive financial impact on the Australian healthcare system. It therefore makes sense to transfer existing knowledge from already established AEP programmes (Australia, USA, South Africa, Canada, UK) to further countries. Similarly, in the USA, athletic trainers (AT) as allied health professionals (sport and exercise professionals) are seen as a vital part of the SEM healthcare team. ATs are involved in various roles and responsibilities, such as prevention, emergency care, clinical diagnosis, therapeutic interventions and rehabilitation of injuries and medical conditions. IPE is a mandatory part of AT Master's Degree programme, and there is a high level of attention on IPC in ATs in practice. Including exercise science students, trainees or practitioners in IPE and IPC will help introduce their roles and responsibilities to other healthcare professions and raising the value of their work in healthcare. It is recommended that national sports science organisations and boards reflect on how to implement IPE in their respective curricula. In this regard, it may be beneficial for national sports science organisations to collaborate with existing national boards already focusing on IPE to gain awareness in the interprofessional community and on political-strategic levels. Here, insights and proceedings from Australia and the USA could be helpful to better implement IPE and IPC in countries like Switzerland.

### Preparation and evolving role of the acute care nurse practitioner [^23700346]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Acute care nurse practitioners (ACNPs) are increasingly being employed as members of critical care teams, an outcome driven by increasing demand for intensive care services, a mandated reduction in house officer hours, and evidence supporting the ability of ACNPs to provide high-quality care as collaborative members of critical care teams. Integration of adult ACNPs into critical care teams is most likely to be successful when practitioners have appropriate training, supervision, and mentoring to facilitate their ability to practice efficiently and effectively. Accomplishing this goal requires understanding the educational preparation and skill set potential hires bring to the position as well as the development of an orientation program designed to integrate the practitioner into the critical care team. Pediatric ACNPs are also commonly employed in critical care settings; however, this commentary focuses on the adult ACNP role.

### Developing a neonatal workforce: role evolution and retention of advanced neonatal nurse practitioners [^644f3393]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Over the past decade more than 120 advanced neonatal nurse practitioners (ANNPs) have graduated from the Southampton based ANNP programme.

Objectives

To determine the scope of practice and evolving role of ANNPs and to identify factors that may affect future recruitment and retention.

Method

An open ended structured questionnaire on clinical role, working arrangements, retention and attrition, continuing education, and professional development was sent to 95 ANNPs.

Results

A response rate of 83% was achieved. There was an attrition rate of 14%, with most ANNPs remaining in their original seconding unit. Factors considered to be important for role satisfaction included a well defined role, working within a team of ANNPs, appropriate remuneration, and evidence of unit support for both role definition and continuing professional development.

Conclusions

Although ANNPs are expensive to both train and employ, this evidence suggests that there is a good return on the investment in terms of retention to the unit and the specialty. Their role incorporates many features of advanced nursing practice as well as providing "value added" neonatal care by merging traditional medical and nursing roles and crossing professional boundaries. In 2004 the manpower challenges for neonatal units will be even more acute; these data confirm that there are effective options available but they require long term strategic planning and investment.

### Nurses as substitutes for doctors in primary care [^ff83a863]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Advanced nursing practice roles have been developed worldwide, including in low‐, middle‐, and high‐income countries (Freund 2015; Kooienga 2015; Maier 2016b). The first advanced nursing roles were developed in the USA and Canada in the late 1960s/70s, in the UK in the 1980s, and in other high‐income countries in the 1990s and onwards (Laurant 2009). From the outset, nurses have been utilised to deliver primary care, traditionally in underserved areas and to vulnerable populations. Nowadays, their role has been extended to include other types of services in primary care (Poghosyan 2012), and this change has been implemented in a range of countries around the globe (Freund 2015; Kooienga 2015; Maier 2016b).

Nurses in advanced roles represent a substantial source of human capital to increase quality of care, access to (primary) care, and, as it is sometimes argued, efficiency of care, although recent reviews have not confirmed improvements in efficiency (Martínez‐González 2014a; Martínez‐González 2014b; Martínez‐González 2015a; Martínez‐González 2015b; Martínez‐González 2015c). It is believed that inclusion of nurses in advanced roles can ensure that the demand for healthcare services to address patient needs is properly met. Both practitioners and policy makers believe that to meet the challenges faced by primary care, a more robust healthcare workforce, including both doctors and nurses in advanced nursing roles, is needed (NHS 2016).

Although interest in expanding nursing roles and employing nurses as substitutes for doctors is increasing globally, underlying reasons for these initiatives differ depending on local context and circumstances (Savrin 2009). For example, the Health Resources and Services Administration in the USA, anticipating a shortage of doctors, has increased the amount of money available not only to train doctors but also to prepare nurse practitioners and physician assistants to support the primary care workforce (Petterson 2012). In addition, organisations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) have made several recommendations regarding ways to expand the role of nurses (WHO 2012). To enable policy makers to make informed decisions about healthcare delivery models, we need rigorous evidence on the quality of care, as well as on access and costs, associated with care provided by nurses compared with care provided by doctors.

### Health professional networks as a vector for improving healthcare quality and safety: a systematic review [^c289d314]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2012). Medium credibility.

Another study in a US mental healthcare settingused SNA to compare two rural and four urban care systems for people with severe mental disorders (SMDs). Both rural sites had numerous coordination linkages between the two types of provider groups (SMD and other service providers) for service planning and delivery. Density scores revealed the extent of service dependency when providers coordinated care to people with SMD in rural sites compared with urban sites. Service relationships among all specialised mental health providers were more likely to occur in rural than urban areas.

A study of chief executive officers in all accredited Taiwanese hospitalsexamined the impact of hospital resources, network resources and centrality on hospital performance. Hospital resources and centrality independently affected performance, whereas network resources did not. For that setting, the authors conclude that a hospital should improve performance by exploiting its in-house resources rather than obtaining network resources externally, and should occupy a central position to create a structural niche.

Health professionals and social context

Half of the studies (13) examined health professionals and social context, including six on work climate. Chaseused ethnography in two intensive care units (ICUs) in a US teaching hospital to analyse structure and communication patterns relating to the social context in which the process of critical care clinical judgement occurred from the nurse's perspective. With multiple clinicians involved in ICU patient-care decision-making, parallel hierarchies of nurses and of doctors allowed for checks on judgement both within and across professional lines. Also, rituals (nursing reports, physician rounds, flow sheet use) provided a context to check judgement processes.

Lurie et al applied SNA to three settings in one US clinical institution: team function in the ICU, the interdisciplinary composition of advisory committees, and relationships between key function directors. Researchers used SNA to compare teams on aspects of their clinical team functioning, and to show the degree of inter-disciplinarity of various clinical departments on the advisory committees. SNA identified potential problem areas with gaps in knowledge of functional roles among academic departments.

### Barriers to advancing women nurses in healthcare leadership: a systematic review and meta-synthesis [^cb164fd0]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Perceptions of leadership

The nursing profession faced gender bias and societal expectations, hindering the ability to succeed in leadership roles. Nurse executives often struggled being recognised in leadership roles, especially with "old-guard physicians" (p. 374) who were often change-resistant, yet highly vocal and influential. Limited differentiation of leadership from management also presented barriers with perceptions that nurse managers were simply conduits for more powerful organisational leaders. Likewise, workplace behaviours engendered disempowerment in interactions with nurse executives, leaving nurses feeling isolated, marginalised, bullied, undervalued and silent. Traditional task-oriented work schemes overshadowed the development of leadership among nurses. Overall, societal expectations based on gender stereotypes, translated into informal tracking of women into leadership positions, further perpetuated the cycle of gender bias in the nursing profession.

Lack of awareness of the nature of nursing leadership roles combined with narrow career pathways, contributed to the perception that progressing to leadership would mean giving up clinical roles, which they were reluctant to do. Conversely, organisational systems often delayed career progression, as practical nursing skills and experience were prioritised. Non-nurse managers often viewed nurses in leadership as "ex-nurses", who have abandoned their clinical portfolioand now focused primarily on fiscal matters, rather than on the importance of patient care. Nurses feared that becoming a leader meant losing touch with clinical skills and connection with patients. This is in stark contrast to medical pathways into leadership, where clinicians often retain both leadership and clinical roles.

Hierarchical leadership

Power disparity in healthcare institutions impacted nurses' motivation for career advancement in leadership. Hierarchical leadership structures perpetuated medical dominance in senior leadership roles, with nurses placed in the middle-to-bottom, and nursing voices perceived as lost in the "stratified layers above them" (p. 1936). Nurse leadership position descriptions were lengthier than their medical counterparts, and nurses lacked official authority or participation in decision-making processes. This sense of disempowerment led to tension and conflict between the two professions, and the lack of recognition and respect for nursing expertise and knowledge further perpetuated the perceived subordinate position of nurses within the organisational hierarchy.,

The overrepresentation of men in healthcare leadership further reduced women nurses' motivation to apply for leadership roles. Leadership opportunities were perceived as limited, and there were concerns about a pervasive patriarchal culture favouring men-men partnership in selection processes.

### Academic anaesthesiology: a global perspective on training, support, and future development of early career researchers [^bab9fdeb]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Training

Medical schools in continental Europe traditionally offered a 6-yr undergraduate medical degree(Fig. 1). The Bologna process was an agreement introduced in 1999 to reconcile higher education pathways across the European Union, therefore facilitating mobility and degree alignment between countries. Consequently, multiple countries introduced combined undergraduate and graduate degree pathways with some including research components. An increasing number of medical schools also offer combined MD/PhD degree programmes. However, the planning and implementation of the Bologna process remain controversial; some have argued that it has done little to unify European medical education to date. Considerable differences in residency training models also exist between European countries. Most anaesthesiology residencies consist of a 5- or 6-yr program immediately after medical school, with a varying mixture of formalised and informal experiential training. In some countries, research time spent towards a full doctoral degree or PhD is recognised. The overwhelming majority of postgraduate (post-residency) positions available are clinical, with some employers offering a varying, usually small, fraction of non-clinical research or administrative time. Research-only positions are limited to universities and large university-affiliated hospitals with established research infrastructure. Clinical sub-specialisation occurs between the end of residency and during the first years as a junior specialist. In most countries, no formal fellowship system exists, neither for clinical nor research fellowships, and sub-specialisation is achieved through supervised exposure to clinical cases. For clinician-scientists, access to research groups, resources, time, and funding is often organised in a similarly informal way, through personal communication within departments, specialised groups, meetings, or peer networks. Lack of established routes to, or barriers to entry into, these groups can be a major obstacle for medical students and junior graduates to gain access to research despite their interest. The Section and Board of Anaesthesiology of the European Union of Medical Specialists, an organisation loosely affiliated with the European Commission, publishes a list of European Training Requirements in anaesthesiology and intensive care along with a list of 'generic competencies and roles' for anaesthesiologists. These include the role of an 'Academic scholar', defined as an individual who knows, critically appraises, and contributes to current literature, teaches both clinical, research, and academic presentation skills, and serves to promote the speciality itself. Complementary to this theoretical framework, the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) provides practical resources to achieve some of these goals across Europe. Among these resources are trainee exchange programmes, unified certification (the European Diploma in Anaesthesia and Intensive Care [EDAIC]), courses, a clinical trial network, research mentorship programmes, and research grants.

### Role of the school nurse in providing school health services [^5ee068bc]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement — role of the school nurse in providing school health services — recognizes the important role school nurses play in promoting the optimal biopsychosocial health and well-being of school-aged children, and states that pediatricians can collaborate with, support, and promote school nurses in their communities. The introduction notes that the first school nurse was appointed in 1902 to tend to the health of 8671 students in 4 separate schools in New York City; her early success in reducing absenteeism led to the hiring of 12 more nurses, and within 1 year, medical exclusions decreased by 99%. The role has expanded to include surveillance, chronic disease management, emergency preparedness, behavioral health assessment, ongoing health education, and extensive case management, while the core focus of keeping students healthy and in school remains unchanged, and school attendance is essential for academic success. The statement was reaffirmed July 2023, and policy statements automatically expire 5 years after publication unless reaffirmed, revised, or retired at or before that time. School nurses provide both individual and population health through daily access to large numbers of students, are well positioned to address and coordinate the health care needs of children and adolescents, and understand that the impact of social determinants of health is felt in the school setting and well known to school nurses.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^a5f45255]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Guideline 1.6 — Interdisciplinary team education — Education, training, and professional development are available to the interdisciplinary team (IDT). All members of the IDT have appropriate levels of education, including training in palliative care. Advanced practice registered nurses, physicians, physician assistants, pharmacists, and physical, occupational or speech therapists have relevant graduate degrees and are licensed in their respective disciplines, and nurses have appropriate educational preparation to their license and scope of practice. Social workers have relevant bachelor's and/or graduate degrees and meet state licensing requirements, spiritual care providers have relevant master's degrees and are ideally board certified as a professional chaplain, nursing assistants and personal care attendants meet state licensing requirements, and volunteers, when utilized, must have training relevant to their role. The IDT encourages discipline-specific credentialing and certification, or other recognition of competence including specialized training, and education, resources, and support are available to enhance IDT communication and collaboration. Palliative care staff participate in initial orientation and continuing education focused on the NCP Guidelines and document their participation accordingly. All palliative care clinicians receive training regarding the use of opioids, including safe and appropriate use of opioids, risk assessment for opioid substance use disorder, monitoring for signs of opioid abuse and diversion, managing pain for patients at risk for substance abuse, and safe disposal of opioids in home and community settings.

### Roles and responsibilities of registered nurses in the early recognition and management of sepsis in acute hospital settings: a scoping review [^91779baf]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Using the AACTT framework, this review has specified the various roles and responsibilities of nurses in the early recognition and management of sepsis, with the RN as actor performing actions occurring across all phases of early sepsis care. The context domain impacted on the responsibilities of RNs, revealing an extended range of actions such as initiating blood tests, chest X-rays, IVFs and first-dose antimicrobials in resource-restricted settings.

Several nursing roles were described with dedicated focus on sepsis care identified in the actor domain. An inductive analysis of these roles across the included studies revealed a lack of information regarding professional criteria and formal training requirements.

### Factors influencing the development, recruitment, integration, retention and career development of advanced practice providers in hospital health care teams: a scoping review [^7bd47a65]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Advanced practice providers (APPs), including physician assistants/associates (PAs), nurse practitioners (NPs) and other non-physician roles, have been developed largely to meet changing healthcare demand and increasing workforce shortages. First introduced in primary care in the US, APPs are prevalent in secondary care across different specialty areas in different countries around the world. In this scoping review, we aimed to summarise the factors influencing the development, recruitment, integration, retention and career development of APP roles in hospital health care teams.

Methods

We conducted a scoping review and searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid Global Health, Ovid PsycINFO and EBSCOhost CINAHL to obtain relevant articles published between Jan 2000 and Apr 2023 that focused on workforce management of APP roles in secondary care. Articles were screened by two reviewers independently. Data from included articles were charted and coded iteratively to summarise factors influencing APP development, recruitment, integration, retention and career development across different health system structural levels (macro-, meso- and micro-level).

Results

We identified and analysed 273 articles that originated mostly from high-income countries, e.g. the US (n = 115) and the UK (n = 52), and primarily focused on NP (n = 183) and PA (n = 41). At the macro-level, broader workforce supply, national/regional workforce policies such as work-hour restrictions on physicians, APP scope of practice regulations, and views of external collaborators, stakeholders and public representation of APPs influenced organisations' decisions on developing and managing APP roles. At the meso-level, organisational and departmental characteristics, organisational planning, strategy and policy, availability of resources, local experiences and evidence as well as views and perceptions of local organisational leaders, champions and other departments influenced all stages of APP role management. Lastly at the micro-level, individual APPs' backgrounds and characteristics, clinical team members' perceptions, understanding and relationship with APP roles, and patient perceptions and preferences also influenced how APPs are developed, integrated and retained.

Conclusions

We summarised a wide range of factors influencing APP role development and management in secondary care teams. We highlighted the importance for organisations to develop context-specific workforce solutions and strategies with long-term investment, significant resource input and transparent processes to tackle evolving healthcare challenges.

### Nursing wellness in academic and clinical cardiovascular and stroke nursing: a Scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^3364bf7e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH BURNOUT IN CARDIOVASCULAR AND STROKE NURSES: NURSE SCIENTISTS

Unique to the nursing field is the nationwide faculty shortage, which places a significant burden on nurse scientists to carry heavy teaching loads in addition to research responsibilities. Nurse scientists are most often located within research‐intensive universities in tenure‐track faculty positions. Because the grant funds available to support research are difficult to acquire in a highly competitive environment, nurse scientists face the same pressures and stresses as other scientists to acquire and maintain grant funding or face the possibility of job loss. Federal funding for nursing research is inadequate to address the most pressing US health problems and to support training in doctoral programs in schools of nursing. At least a 5‐fold increase in nursing science funding is needed to expand training in doctoral programs in nursing and to address health problems amenable to nursing care. Despite competing demands of research and teaching, nurses with PhD degrees are needed to conduct rigorous research and to increase the scientific knowledge of the nursing practice to authoritatively change the US health care system.

### Addressing the challenges of knowledge co-production in quality improvement: learning from the implementation of the researcher-in-residence model [^d39df2b3]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

Maintaining academic professional identity

The dual affiliation of a researcher-in-residence can represent a real risk for career development in academia. The required outputs for academic advancement (in particular the publication of academic papers in high-impact journals) can be more challenging to produce for researchers-in-residence because they spend a larger proportion of their time in the field than is the case of traditional researchers. Furthermore, feelings of isolation might also affect the researcher-in-residence's identity, where they might consider themselves more as members of staff of the healthcare organisation and less like academics able to maintain a critical distance.

The researcher working on the WEL evaluation was the one who struggled the most with professional isolation, possibly because she worked alone. In order to deal with this, she had weekly meetings with her academic supervisor with email or telephone contact between and a group of mentors (academic and practitioners) were convened to support her in the role. The UCLH ERT and the Bristol model involved teams of multiple researchers (and local policy-makers (Bristol)), so senior and other team members could provide support through regular meetings (monthly and fortnightly respectively) to discuss and make decisions on various topics. Within Bristol, academic isolation was less problematic as the researchers-in-residence had a 1-day-a-week role at the healthcare policy-making organisation, leaving time at the university for contact with academic colleagues. Nonetheless, although professional isolation was not problematic, the professional progression of the researchers-in-residence was hampered, with less time to publish academic papers.

### Academic anaesthesiology: a global perspective on training, support, and future development of early career researchers [^9d04cd2a]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Editor's key points

- The challenges facing early career academic anaesthesiologists are similar in most well-resourced countries.
- These include long training pathways, variable salary support to provide protected time for academic work, and poor long-term research funding opportunities.
- A focus on mentoring, sponsorship, and diversity is critical to sustaining academic anaesthesiology in the face of overwhelming clinical demands, and to ensure the necessary human capital for innovation and discovery in advancing the specialty to improve patient care.

Anaesthesiology and its related specialities (perioperative, critical care, and pain medicine) have a long history of bold investigations, breakthrough discoveries, and interdisciplinary leadership. Over the last century, academic anaesthesiologists have laid the educational and organisational foundations to establish anaesthesiology as an independent speciality attracting talented individuals. Although recruitment and development of prospective investigators, educators, and administrators are integral to the speciality's future growth and sustainability, numerous challenges and barriers remain. As a global community, we are responsible for providing a fertile ground for future leaders in anaesthesiology. All authors of this paper are early-career anaesthesiologist researchers, primarily British Journal of Anaesthesia Editorial Fellows, and thus well situated to reflect on the current state of academic anaesthesiology and provide perspectives on optimal investigator training and support worldwide.

Careers in academic anaesthesiology are heterogeneous. Although research, teaching, and administration constitute the core of academic anaesthesiology, the proportion of time dedicated to these activities varies across countries, regions, and institutions. Broadly speaking, academic anaesthesiologists are clinicians whose expertise and efforts contribute to the development and expansion of the speciality beyond the provision of routine medical care. Depending on the setting and individual career goals, the focus of an academic anaesthesiologist may be a combination of investigator- or industry-initiated scientific research, supervision of clinical and research training, development of quality improvement programmes, institutional leadership, and policymaking. Achieving eventual success in academia requires the willingness to persevere through setbacks and rejection, which is best fostered through lifelong mentorship and sponsorship. Despite recent initiatives from professional societies and various stakeholders to recognise and develop structured support for academic career development, the road to academic success can appear to be a journey into the unknown, with large differences prevailing between geographic regions (see Table 1). Here, we compare typical academic career paths across selected geographic regions and discuss barriers and opportunities faced by early-career academic anaesthesiologists.

### Systems of career influences: a conceptual model for evaluating the professional development of women in academic medicine [^34de36ad]. Journal of Women's Health (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Surprisingly little research is available to explain the well-documented organizational and societal influences on persistent inequities in advancement of women faculty.

Methods

The Systems of Career Influences Model is a framework for exploring factors influencing women's progression to advanced academic rank, executive positions, and informal leadership roles in academic medicine. The model situates faculty as agents within a complex adaptive system consisting of a trajectory of career advancement with opportunities for formal professional development programming; a dynamic system of influences of organizational policies, practices, and culture; and a dynamic system of individual choices and decisions. These systems of influence may promote or inhibit career advancement. Within this system, women weigh competing influences to make career advancement decisions, and leaders of academic health centers prioritize limited resources to support the school's mission.

Results and Conclusions

The Systems of Career Influences Model proved useful to identify key research questions. We used the model to probe how research in academic career development might be applied to content and methods of formal professional development programs. We generated a series of questions and hypotheses about how professional development programs might influence professional development of health science faculty members. Using the model as a guide, we developed a study using a quantitative and qualitative design. These analyses should provide insight into what works in recruiting and supporting productive men and women faculty in academic medical centers.

### Diet and exercise advice and referrals for cancer survivors: an integrative review of medical and nursing perspectives [^0a8bf353]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Most medical and nursing health professionals consider diet and exercise interventions beneficial to cancer survivors according to the results of our integrative review, consistent with earlier evidence. Even though there is variability of views on their roles and responsibilities in providing advice on diet, physical activity, or exercise to influence behaviour change in cancer survivors, there was overall confidence that their role should be to provide referrals to dietitians and exercise professionals. This suggests that there is a lack of clarity between medical and nursing health professionals regarding their roles and responsibilities in providing dietary and exercise advice. This could be attributed to several factors, including poorly defined roles. Clarifying professional roles can ensure the appropriate implementation of medical and nursing health professionals' role regarding dietary and exercise advice to cancer survivors and therefore ensure better care of the cancer survivor. This could be achieved by using a consensus process to facilitate role clarity and establish consensus between professional groups. Better guidance is required for medical and nursing health professionals, in terms of what advice they should provide and when to provide the advice, as well as how and when to refer cancer survivors to dietitians and exercise professionals.

Medical and nursing health professionals identified that providing dietary and exercise advice to cancer survivors remains an ongoing issue due to various health professional and patient-centred barriers. As a result, additional training is required to assist medical and nursing health professionals to provide physical activity, adequate weight management and dietary and exercise advice as part of routine practice, and resources. This may include continuing professional development (CPD) for medical and nursing health professionals where this type of training could be offered. It is important that these programs and opportunities are evaluated, with outcomes addressing the reaction, learning, behaviour, and results levels. Embedding such additional training within university programs has the potential to improve their dietary and exercise management skills and confidence levels that can positively impact patient health outcomes. Ideally, resources should include clear information on specific dietitians and exercise professionals who can provide proper assessment, programming, and support; and information on referral pathways to reach these specialists or community services. However, significant barriers to undertaking CPD and training at universities exist, including a lack of time, understaffing, competition for time in the existing curriculum, and perceived importance at the faculty level in universities

### Advanced practice nursing in neonatology: clinical report [^d578b526]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical report — advanced practice nursing in neonatology — states that the participation of advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) in neonatal care continues to be supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics and that traditionally, neonatal nurse practitioners and neonatal clinical nurse specialists were the two roles well established within the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). With ongoing shortages of these roles, some institutions have turned toward pediatric nurse practitioners (acute and primary care) and family nurse practitioners to meet patient care needs. The report aims to review the roles, scope of practice, collaboration, and credentialing of these APRN categories with recommendations for the safe and effective utilization of these providers in neonatal care, and it will not address other roles in the NICU, including hospitalists or physician assistants in the NICU. The introduction describes the Neonatal Clinical Nurse Specialist (NCNS) as a neonatal nursing expert who facilitates education, patient advocacy, practice improvements, and quality initiatives, and notes the Board-Certified Neonatal Nurse Practitioner (NNP-BC) has evolved into a master's or doctoral-prepared, defined scope of practice provider caring for the full range of patients in all levels of newborn care.

### Australian nurse engagement in eye care: a national survey [^3fcb81ae]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Respondents identified a task hierarchy, with multiple professionals competing for certain tasks (eg, intravitreal injections) but not so much for other tasks (eg, daily living activities or minor procedures) – and that this competition created interdisciplinary tension. They believed that if professions were compensated for tasks, and involvement was planned carefully and safely in shared-care models, then services could be effectively adapted to meet the needs of the community/population rather than being based on where the professional was employed. They supported the evolution and shifting of tasks if training was available, and the service was ready to provide wholistic and integrated shared care services.

Respondents believed that without careful planning and rationale, the sector would only be "shuffling" professionals around rather than addressing the core issues of adequate healthcare staffing numbers. They believed task-shifting needed to be allocated on the fundamental need to reduce demand through prevention and advanced treatment options. They indicated that task-shifting in either direction required transition planning to ensure the role of the nurse was not undermined or devalued, they were not "dumped" with tasks others did not want to perform, and they were positioned to attract and retain nurses into the field. For example, it was stated that nurses were already being replaced by other eye care professionals in some parts of Australia – especially in the Northern Territory and Victoria, and that this had a negative impact on the attraction of nurses into eye care in those locations. The "to" and "from" task-shifting responses are outlined in further detail in.

Other

There were "other" comments from n = 85/238(36%) participants. They highlighted that to attract and retain nurses into the field and make effective long-lasting change, that the nursing community must nationalise and professionalise AONA. As one entity, AONA could encourage universities, governments and employers to increase exposure and opportunity to eye care for early-career nurses, increase nurse-led research and engagement in national debate, fund more nurse training and research, improve interaction with other healthcare providers to strengthen shared care modelling, support each other to advance together, create clear paths into eye care, take self-responsibility for the training and advancement of nurses (not just expecting ophthalmologists to train nurses). Other ideas included the value of importing eye care nurses from other countries and using inter-departmental rostering strategically to expose more nurses to eye care.

### The implication of diabetes-specialized nurses in aiming for the better treatment and management of patients with diabetes mellitus: a brief narrative review [^07ea632d]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is considered one of the most pressing public health challenges of the 21st century. It has emerged as a growing epidemic since the last century, coinciding with the exponential increase in obesity rates. Today, it stands as one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. According to World Health Organization (WHO) statistics, over 537 million adults worldwide were suffering from DM in 2021, and a continuous rise has been noted during the past recent years. DM is believed to have a major impact not only in terms of clinical effects but it also has a great impact on the worldwide economic burden. The current global healthcare expenditures estimates due to DM have already reached US $376 billion and are expected to rise further to US $490 billion by the year 2030.

Specialist nurses are registered nurses who have worked for a significant period in a specialized field of nursing with additional nursing qualifications and have been granted permission to practice as a specialist with advanced expertise in a clinical specialty to involve in clinical practice, teaching, consultation, and research. The minimum qualification for a diabetes specialist nurse (DSN) has been set at post-graduate diploma level. A bachelor's degree in nursing offers a foundation that typically includes knowledge of biology and chemistry. Becoming licensed as a registered nurse requires passing a licensure exam offered by an organization such as the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN). Pursuing an advanced degree such as a Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) or a post-master's nursing certificate can prepare nurses for advanced and specialized roles, such as that of diabetes nurse specialist. In Australia, registered nurses undertook an accredited Australian Diabetes Educators Association course in order to become an expert in the management of patients with DM.

DSNs are central to good patient care and outcomes including confident self-care management. Evidence shows that DSNs are cost-effective, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce the length of hospital stays.

While it is the doctors who are responsible for medical decisions, specialized nurses contribute something new to patient management and can help facilitate the tasks of the doctors, which this review will discuss. Therefore, in this brief narrative review, we aim to describe the roles of DSNs and their contribution in the treatment and management of patients with DM.

### Distinct journeys and unique stories: how individuals from multiple professions cultivate careers in healthcare leadership [^326995e6]. BMJ Leader (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Strong hospital leadership is critical to navigating the challenges of the Canadian healthcare system. Currently, physicians and nurses tend to be selected to fulfil hospital executive roles. To date, we found only limited research exploring who else could or should be in these roles, or how more diverse groups of professionals navigate the journey into these roles. We sought to interview leaders from multiple professional backgrounds to understand how their career journey led them to their executive role.

Methods

We purposively sampled Canadian hospital executives with diverse professional and educational backgrounds. Through semistructured interviews, we explored their individual leadership journeys, and their experiences working with others along the way. Our team worked together to analyse data using a phenomenographic approach.

Results

Fourteen executive-level leaders from diverse professional backgrounds were interviewed. Overall, we noted three main trajectories for people to become hospital leaders: the achievement journey, the unexpected journey and the practical journey. These journeys corresponded to three main identities the champion leader, the discovered leader and the pragmatic leader, respectively. We found that some individuals had multiple trajectories and identities.

Conclusions

Improved diversity in executive hospital leadership may support transformational change in healthcare; however, this promise may not be automatically realised. Critical reflection on current hiring processes, career development and mentorship is warranted to support those with diverse and distinct backgrounds to enter and thrive in these roles.

### Comparison of competency priorities between UK occupational physicians and occupational health nurses [^62721676]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Occupational health (OH) is a well-established discipline in the UK. Persisting practice challenges include improving workforce access to such services, matched with a shortage of OH professionals, notably physicians. Despite these challenges, OH is rapidly evolving with advances in technology, workplace/workforce changes and socioeconomic factors. Modern UK OH teams are often multidisciplinary with a range of practitioners including physicians, nurses, hygienists, technicians, physiotherapists, psychologists and ergonomists. It has been advocated that, given restricted workforce access to OH services and shortfalls in OH resources, OH professional's skills and competencies should be examined to determine who can do what and to ensure the appropriate use of resources.UK occupational health nurse (OHN) roles have expanded over time with the first OHN consultant post in 2002, many OHNs leading services and a UK Faculty of Occupational Health Nursing (FOHN) being established. By nature, there is a degree of overlap in clinical activity between OH professionals but service provision models have also developed where certain tasks traditionally only performed by doctors (eg, management referrals) are now being undertaken by nurses. Conversely, certain nursing tasks (eg, routine health surveillance) are now being undertaken by technicians. This may be driven by financial reasons or may illustrate the Abbott model 'interdependency' concept, where professions working together overlap as they compete for jurisdiction, as new knowledge and skills are acquired and as particular service demands increase or decrease with the changing workplace. In any multidisciplinary OH team, a close working relationship between occupational physicians (OPs) and OHNs is required, and their competencies understood. This is important for clinical governance and identifying ongoing training requirements. OP and OHN competency requirements separately have been studied in various countries, but little research has made direct comparisons between these two professional groups. A global survey comparing work jurisdiction of OH professionals demonstrated substantial differences for OPs and OHNs in required competency sets, although this was undertaken over a decade ago.

OH practice evolution with expanding and overlapping OP and OHN roles make it imperative that up-to-date competencies reflective of practice are established. The aim of this study was to compare current competency priorities between UK OPs and OHNs. A literature review has not identified any study (UK or internationally) specifically assessing competency priorities between these two groups.

### SHEA / APIC / IDSA / PIDS multisociety position paper: raising the bar: necessary resources and structure for effective healthcare facility infection prevention and control programs [^9072f8f4]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

IPC personnel competencies

Recommendation

Healthcare facility leaders and regulatory partners should ensure that IPC program personnel are trained and have the core competencies outlined for these specific roles, including providing expectations and support for training when needed.

Essential to the structure and effectiveness of the IPC program is ensuring that the members of the IPC program demonstrate the core competencies and skills necessary for their roles. For the two main groups of IPC personnel, physician and IP, there are previously outlined competencies (see Tables 1 and 2) that should be expected for individuals serving in these roles. In addition, such training should be ongoing throughout the individual's career to incorporate the emerging knowledge and science around infection prevention. Importantly, some individuals hired into the IPC program may have a background or understanding around some of these competencies but lack a complete understanding and training in all the essential skills and competencies. For example, an ID physician may understand the clinical management of infectious diseases yet still needs further training in epidemiology and infection prevention practices to effectively function in an IPC role. Likewise, an IP with a nursing background will need training in other aspects of the IP role such as surveillance methodology, microbiology, and epidemiology. As such, facility leaders should set expectations for and support training for such individuals to attain the full range of these skills and competencies.

Table 2.
The Association of Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology infection preventionist (IP) competency domains –

For physician IPC personnel, SHEA has outlined roles and associated competencies, knowledge expectations, and skills. These are briefly summarized in Table 1 but are outlined in detail in the position paper by Kaye et al. A certificate in healthcare epidemiology and IPC is also available through a SHEA/CDC training course. This course, or its equivalent, is taken by many IPC program physicians, and some facilities and states have required such training for their physician IPC personnel as a measure of IPC competency.

Likewise, APIC has developed a set of competencies outlining the essential knowledge and skills for an IP. This competency model was first described in 2012 62 and has been updated (most recently in 2019) as the field has evolved. – The model includes six domains meant to guide IPs in their career and leadership development (see Table 2). Subdomains are included in each domain which expand the specific skills, knowledge, and training required. IP specialty training typically occurs on the job; however, there are some academic programs that offer IPC degrees, diplomas, and certificates. Future academic pathways to the IPC profession are currently in development by APIC.

### The shifting dynamics of social roles and project ownership over the lifecycle of a community-based participatory research project [^293c54cd]. Family Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Background. Community based participatory research (CBPR) is often initiated by academic researchers, yet relies on meaningful community engagement and ownership to have lasting impact. Little is understood about how ownership shifts from academic to community partners.

Objectives. We examined a CBPR project over its life course and asked: what does the evolution of ownership look like from project initiation by an academic (non-community) champion (T1); to maturation-when the intervention is ready to be deployed (T2); to independence-the time when the original champion steps aside (T3); and finally, to its maintenance-when the community has had an opportunity to function independently of the original academic champion (T4)?

Methods. Using sociometric (whole network) social network analysis, knowledge leadership was measured using 'in-degree centrality'. Stakeholder network structure was measured using 'centralisation' and 'core-periphery analysis'. Friedman rank sum test was used to measure change in actor roles over time from T1 to T4.

Results. Project stakeholder roles were observed to shift significantly (P < 0.005) from initiation (T1) to project maintenance (T4). Community stakeholders emerged into positions of knowledge leadership, while the roles of academic partners diminished in importance. The overall stakeholder network demonstrated a structural shift towards a core of densely interacting community stakeholders.

Conclusion. This was the first study to use Social network analysis to document a shift in ownership from academic to community partners, indicating community self-determination over the research process. Further analysis of qualitative data will determine which participatory actions or strategies were responsible for this observed change.

Strategies to improve transplant nursing retention — proposals targeted workload and professional development: "Given the intensity of the training, expertise and workload of transplant nurses, proposals were made to improve their retention", including that "the use of donor call teams to decrease call expectations for transplant coordinators was a common proposal". Additional measures "may involve the establishment of mentoring programs for transplant nurses; flexible hours (e.g., four 10-hour days) to support work and life balance; support for tuition to achieve advanced nursing degrees; encouraging nurses to participate in research; and the existence of supportive leadership (both nurse and physician) open to suggestions to improve processes that have an impact on role performance of transplant coordinator/nurses".

### Examining the clinical role and educational preparation of heart failure nurses across europe. A survey of the heart failure association (HFA) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the association of cardiovascular nursing and allied professions (ACNAP) of the ESC [^a67db4dd]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

All healthcare professionals within the MDT play a vital role in promoting the self‐care of patients with HF. They need to educate and inform patients about their HF condition, teach skills, personalize treatment plans, support individual needs and abilities, as well as engage with patients and their caregivers to make shared decisions regarding ongoing treatment. As digital technology advances, different tools and platforms are being used as a beneficial 'add‐on' for patients, caregivers, healthcare professionals and the economy to support long‐term follow‐up.,

As the landscape of HF care continues to evolve, insights from current practices of HF nurses are key to shaping new curricula. The Association of Cardiovascular Nursing and Allied Professions (ACNAP) published a core curriculum for cardiovascular nurses and allied professionals in 2023. The most recent curriculum for HF nurses was published by the Heart Failure Association (HFA) of the ESC in 2016. Over the last 8 years there has been significant advancements in HF treatment, with a parallel increase in the number of nurses in advanced clinical practice roles. An update is urgently needed to equip these nurses with the knowledge and skills necessary to meet the challenges of modern HF management. It is timely to evaluate the daily clinical practice and educational preparation of HF nurses within 'real‐world' settings to ensure future clinical developments and educational initiatives are appropriate to advance practice. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the clinical practice and educational preparation of HF nurses across Europe and determine key differences between countries.

### Exploring the competencies of inflammatory bowel disease nurses in Italy: a cross-sectional survey [^ffc7f7c2]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The core competencies that registered the highest averages were the ability to establish an empathic relationship with patients and the awareness of the emotional and social impact these pathologies have on patients' lives, as already demonstrated in other studies. The core competence with the lowest score was related to the knowledge and management of perianal disease. This result is worthy of further investigation, but it is also in line with the rest of Europe, where the role of the nurse in the management of perianal disease often consists of facilitating communication between the patient, gastroenterologist and surgeon, representing the patient's interests in multidisciplinary meetings and exercising an educational role in the prevention of sepsis. The participation of the IBD nurse in multidisciplinary discussions is, therefore, an essential source of learning and increased knowledge in managing these diseases. On the other hand, as previously mentioned, the competencies perceived as more complex, particularly those related to advanced clinical skills, showed greater variability in responses, suggesting differences in training, exposure, or institutional roles that may influence nurses' confidence and proficiency in these areas.

Interestingly, the advanced skill for which the highest average was recorded was the educational role of caregivers, a further sign that the academic role is predominant in nursing.

Another preponderant role is communication. Indeed, the other advanced competence that reached higher averages was collaborating with colleagues of different specialties to provide multidisciplinary care to patients. This was followed by the one related to educating the patient in developing coping strategies. Empathic communication, a core competence in which high averages were recorded, is a characteristic of the nursing profession that enables these professionals always to protect the interests of patients when necessary.

Interestingly, the inferential analysis revealed a significant correlation between work experience in IBD units and a good percentage of core and advanced skills, with a strong component of communication skills. In particular, the 2 core skills that correlated most strongly with unit-specific years of service were those related to understanding the social and work impact of these diseases on patients' lives, and those associated with managing biological therapies. This confirms the need for a prolonged presence in the service in order to better understand the type of patient, and how to manage the various aspects of the pathology in a correct and timely manner.

### Evolution, current structure, and role of a primary care clinical pharmacy service in an integrated managed care organization [^535ce74d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

The impact of the declining number of primary care physicians is exacerbated by a growing elderly population in need of chronic disease management. Primary care clinical pharmacy specialists, with their unique knowledge and skill set, are well suited to address this gap. At Kaiser Permanente of Colorado (KPCO), primary care clinical pharmacy specialists have a long history of integration with medical practices and are located in close proximity to physicians, nurses, and other members of the health care team. Since 1992, Primary Care Clinical Pharmacy Services (PCCPS) has expanded from 4 to 30 full-time equivalents (FTEs) to provide services in all KPCO medical office buildings. With this growth in size, PCCPS has evolved to play a vital role in working with primary care medical teams to ensure that drug therapy is effective, safe, and affordable. In addition, PCCPS specialists provide ambulatory teaching sites for pharmacy students and pharmacy residents. There is approximately 1 specialist FTE for every 13,000 adult KPCO members and every 9 clinical FTEs of internal medicine and family medicine physicians. All clinical pharmacy specialists in the pharmacy department are required to have a PharmD degree, to complete postgraduate year 2 residencies, and, as a condition of employment, to become board certified in an applicable specialty. The evolution, current structure, and role of PCCPS at KPCO, including factors facilitating successful integration within the medical team, are highlighted. Patient and nonpatient care responsibilities are described.

### The future of the psychiatric mental health clinical nurse specialist: evolution or extinction [^fed253ea]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The role of the psychiatric mental health clinical nurse specialist (PMHCNS) is now in a precarious position. At first glance, some may say it is on the verge of extinction. In this article, a brief history of the role of the PMHCNS is reviewed along with current education, practice, role, and American Nurses Credentialing Center certification of the PMHCNS. The future implications and considerations of the unique functions of the PMHCNS for an advanced practice registered nurse with a psychiatric mental health specialization are discussed.

### Advanced practice nurse-led early palliative care: a novel model for improved access to care [^9be4e5e6]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

The role of the clinical nurse specialist

Early in this initiative, we were met with the commonly encountered lack of understanding of the role of the CNS and the novel use of a nurse-led clinic, identifying an opportunity for education around the roles and expertise of different advanced practice nurses. The value and expertise specific to the CNS role is not commonly understood and stakeholders are likely to require clarity in the different nursing roles, such as a general duty nurse, a CNS, and a nurse practitioner. As a master or doctoral prepared nurse, a CNS was chosen for this seminal role due to the multifaceted nature of their expertise in (1) comprehensive direct complex clinical care in a specialty area, (2) consulting for all stakeholders to promote positive outcomes and system change, (3) education for patients and providers while championing evidence-informed practice, (4) research contribution both in the generation and application of new evidence, and (5) leadership at all levels, including nursing practice, advocacy and advancement, and program development and evaluation. Although formal evaluation and reporting are underway, informal surveys of healthcare providers after the first 6 months of EPC implementation showed improved patient symptom management and preparation for medical oncology consults. As stakeholders began to see the value of the CNS expertise, the positive impact on patients, and the potential cost savings to the system, support and endorsement of the EPC clinic and the role of the CNS grew exponentially. Any additional hesitation by other healthcare providers was reduced over time with ongoing collaboration and through the advocacy of colleagues.

Educating stakeholders on the CNS role and using evidence of the outcomes of CNS practice to support this role may help overcome this barrier. Some evidence-based recommendations for the use of the CNS role in oncology include (1) CNS-led clinics for complex diagnostic workup, improving access to care and care coordination, (2) identifying, developing, and supporting complex clinical roles, programs, and teams around specialty practice, (3) providing mental health services, and (4) providing complex care within the Adolescent Young Adult population. The novel initiation of a nurse-led clinic may encounter hesitancy in a physician-centric organization due to entrenched cultural values, a lack of familiarity and acceptance of processes, roles and responsibilities, and insufficient knowledge of nurse-led clinic outcomes. Support for this model includes cost savings in reducing hospital readmissions and other outcomes, enhanced coordination of care and quality outcomes, improved patient outcomes, and patient flow.

### The department of medicine in 2030: a look ahead [^1546f056]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The authors described the features of a hypothetical academic Department of Medicine in 2030 that would be most effective in improving the public health. Future departments of medicine will be compelled to respond to a projected shortage of physicians through augmented training strategies. The clinical programs will be more decentralized and responsive to patient preferences while demonstrating greater value. Departments will create adaptable, accountable structures in which clinicians working in interdisciplinary teams continuously improve processes and outcomes of care, and clinician and patient satisfaction. The restructuring of health care will afford exciting opportunities to align clinical and scholarly activities. The growing ability to link biological and clinical phenotypic information will lead to more effective and efficient clinical care. In view of the funding constraints and the remarkable opportunities for high-impact research, departmental research programs will become increasingly disciplined. Successful research programs will require durable investments in faculty career development, enabling infrastructure, interdisciplinary research teams, and diverse funding sources. The educational programs will demonstrate proficiency of trainees in the 6 current core competencies, as well as in additional areas critical to health care transformation. To improve organizational effectiveness, departments will create more nimble organizational structures led by individuals with diverse backgrounds. Chairs of departments of medicine will be expected to continuously expand their capacity to meet the evolving needs of their departments and institutions. Members of departments of medicine will be continuously fortified by the privilege and obligations of our profession while embracing the risks necessary to meet the extraordinary opportunities in 2030.

### The emerging role of nurse practitioners and physician assistants in liver transplantation [^d7b63ce2]. Liver Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

The evolving role of nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) in the United States continues to progress. NP and PA responsibilities have expanded from primary care practices to medical and surgical specialties. They provide acute care in hospitals and intensive care units, and they serve as educators, lobbyists, and researchers. Questions have arisen from NP/PA leaders, physician leaders, and administrators on how to best implement a successful NP/PA model within their practice. This article reviews some common themes in the literature by looking at the current state of NP/PA practice, outlines some practice models established therein, and provides recommendations for implementing a successful NP/PA model in a liver transplant practice.

### The certified nurse-midwife / certified midwife workforce and factors affecting its growth [^13cec77c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

In this article, about the certified nurse-midwife and certified midwife workforce, we describe education, credentialing, licensure, and regulation; the current workforce and their practice; and the historical context that led to a small midwifery workforce with limited integration into the health care system in the US. Finally, we outline multi-level barriers to growing the midwifery workforce and provide recommendations to overcome those barriers. Barriers include state-level and organization-level inconsistent and restrictive regulations that prevent midwives from being able to fill gaps in low-resourced and rural regions, the high cost of midwifery education, and unsustainable work-life balance coupled with low salaries.

### Neonatal provider workforce [^9d46c857]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP) workforce development — strategies to increase the NICU provider workforce have mostly concentrated on increasing the use of pediatric hospitalists, NNPs, and physician assistants (PAs), with workforce surveys by the NANNP delineating existing and future NNP needs and noting that education, recruitment, and retention were key areas of focus to increase supply. Education for NNPs has evolved over 5 decades from certificate programs to bachelor's and master's degrees in nursing to the doctorate of nursing practice degree, which could slow the NNP pipeline further; barriers include lack of higher degree programs, funding of faculty, access to preceptors, and federal and state regulations, and regulations posed by the US Department of Education related to long-distance learning have contributed to a drop in enrollment in states with significantly restrictive requirements. Collaboration among educational institutions may overcome restrictive regulations and minimize costs and faculty needs, and locally neonatal programs and hospitals can increase efforts to recruit more neonatal nurses to pursue NNP education with tuition reimbursement or scholarships. A shortage of university nursing faculty limits enrollment, and the NANNP has led a strategy to prepare expert NNP clinicians to become educators, with the hope that increasing faculty will enable larger student cohorts and increase the numbers of newly graduated NNPs. Recruitment actions include that practicing NNPs should contribute by serving as clinical preceptors; mentoring programs and longer orientation or residency programs are attractive to new graduates, and retention is critical because with an aging workforce, burnout and early retirement will compound the workforce deficit and increase demand.

### Advanced practice nursing in neonatology: clinical report [^59f9f00d]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Licensure, accreditation, certification, and education (LACE) — APRN regulatory alignment and NICU-practicing roles are defined with "In 2008, the APRN Consensus Work Group and the National Council of State Boards of Nursing APRN Advisory Committee published the LACE Consensus Model for APRN Regulation". "LACE stands for licensure, accreditation, certification, and education and outlines the necessity of having these four elements in alignment to define and support the APRN scope of practice". To practice safely, "the patient population they care for 1) must have been covered in their formal academic education (by an accredited institution), 2) the APRN must pass a national board certification that includes testing of the knowledge on that patient population, and 3) the APRN be granted state licensure, which verifies that the individual has completed the necessary education, clinical training, and certification giving them the authority to practice in their specialty as outlined in the LACE guidelines". Scope is also shaped as "there are individual state nursing laws and rules that define the scope of practice for APRNs". NICU APRN types include that "The CNS (clinical nurse specialist) and CNP (certified nurse practitioner) are two types of APRNs that practice in the NICU", and preparation expectations note "APRNs are required to complete a graduate-level education program of study and supervised practice beyond the level of the Registered Nurse (RN)", with variability as "there are different course requirements, clinical hours, and patient experiences to ensure the provider has trained appropriately in the corresponding neonatal or pediatric patient population".

### A double-edged sword: a qualitative study of the minority tax in academic emergency medicine faculty [^78a0ae60]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The "minority tax", also known as the "diversity tax" refers to the additional burden placed on minoritized individuals in advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Although DEI efforts have evolved over time, evidence on its emotional, professional, and institutional impacts in academic emergency medicine (EM) is limited. We examined the various impacts of the minority tax in this population.

Methods

We conducted a qualitative study using a descriptive phenomenological framework to explore the lived experiences of 21 academic EM faculty leaders engaged in DEI work. Participants were purposively sampled across U.S. regions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted (March-May 2023), transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis informed by both inductive and deductive coding strategies. We explored personal and professional impacts of DEI engagement, experiences with the minority tax, and strategies for mitigation.

Results

Participants described their DEI roles as a "double-edged sword", balancing meaningful engagement with substantial emotional and professional costs. Sixteen of 21 participants identified direct experiences with the minority tax, including expectations to serve as cultural representatives, provide uncompensated labor, and experiences of institutional marginalization. Despite these challenges, many participants found personal fulfillment in their work and emphasized mentorship as both a key source of support and a driver of career advancement. Suggested strategies for addressing the minority tax included stronger institutional support, appropriate compensation for DEI contributions, and equitable distribution of DEI responsibilities across all faculty, regardless of identity.

Conclusions

The minority tax in academic emergency medicine presents a complex challenge that carries significant emotional and professional costs even as DEI work can provide personal meaning and career advancement. Addressing this burden requires systemic changes, including recognition of DEI efforts in career progression and shared responsibility across all faculty demographics.

### Implementing the baby one program: a qualitative evaluation of family-centred child health promotion in remote Australian aboriginal communities [^1b0b8c97]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Working towards a team approach

The BOP arose from Apunipima's strategic decision to realign maternal and child health into a family-centred, Healthworker-led service.

There was divided opinion about involvement of Healthworkers in development of the program. Whilst one staff member believed that the BOP manual was "… literally dumped… on the Healthworkers, implement it, and own it" (P-S), an Indigenous Healthworker said "from the time that I first started, Healthworkers have a real good influence on how the [program] is delivered and how the education… is given to communities".

The focus on Healthworker leadership meant that some nurses and midwives felt excluded. A health practitioner said it seemed like, "they didn't want the RNs [Registered Nurses] involved". (R-S). An Indigenous Healthworker said there was a "big divide between a Healthworker and nurses… even though we don't have a university degree, we have all this other knowledge that probably can't be written on paper".

A quality improvement approach and new ideas resulted in evolution of the program's structure and content. Indigenous Healthworkers and midwives reported that their work roles became more clearly defined. A health practitioner commented:

"We know that it is Healthworker-led… If the Healthworker is struggling and wants assistance, then yeah, they can ask and we can do that… " (R-S).

A manager acknowledged early confusion over professional roles and reported the steps made to address the concern. "When a new Healthworker comes on, the midwife is part of that learning journey, so even though it's… being led by the Healthworker through the cultural expertise, and the midwife as the expert in the clinical… we are walking together". (P-S).

### Frailty nurse and GP-led models of care in care homes: the role of contextual factors impacting enhanced health in care homes framework implementation [^ff43a930]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Misaligned role expectations

The evolution of the 'trainee' role led to misalignment and confusion regarding what the FN role entailed, leading to temporary unintended consequences. There was a general uncertainty about the TFN role, which was often compared to a GP role. The narratives below illustrate staff perceptions regarding role expectations and TFN duties, and it is interesting to note that the care home manager in the second quote seems not to understand, or is unaware, that the TFN is already a registered nurse:

' The very first time I [met the FN I] didn't really understand what [the role] was. The next time I think it was… She explained what it is. that it's not a GP, but it's sort of a high… Like, she used to be a nurse. But then they do something like 98% of what a GP does or something' (FN-led Model, Participant 22: Care staff)

'[The FN] cannot put in any real input into the home… It's a misleading perception to everybody… Frailty Nurses… The contents don't do what the tin says. And for me… I find it misleading because if you went into a hospital and someone had on their badge that they were a nurse, and they were actually a carer. You know, they were working towards being a nurse, and you thought that person was a nurse - how would you feel about that?' (FN-led Model, Participant 15: Care Home Manager)

Care staff from the TFN-led model felt misinformed about the role, remit, and responsibilities of the TFNs, which made them feel less trusting of decisions and judgments regarding residents' care. Staff were mostly unaware of the educational and developmental requirements within the trainee's role, and this led to unintended consequences of uncertainty and confusion. Some care staff expressed a preference for a GP-led model, as they perceived GPs as having the ability to provide immediate treatment and being unable to refuse requests to visit residents.

### Nurse staffing and inpatient mortality in the english national health service: a retrospective longitudinal study [^c61e4af5]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2023). High credibility.

Exploration of the role of different types of human capital has been undertaken in various settings outsideand insidehealthcare. Related research has examined skill-mix, an element of human capital, in the nursing context. This has typically been done by distinguishing between two groups: registered nurses (RNs) and healthcare support workers (HCSWs). RNs are fully qualified nurses on the Nursing and Midwifery Council register, who have completed formal training and typically hold a university diploma or degree-level qualification. HCSWs are personnel who report to RNs and support the delivery of nursing care, but do not have professional registration. Griffiths et al used routine data from an e-rostering system to examine RN and HCSW staff levels on patient mortality, controlling for confounders such as patient acuity, patient turnover and ward-level factors. The authors found that the risk of death increased when either RN or HCSW levels fell below the ward mean. There was also some indication that patient risk of death increased when HCSW levels were above the ward mean. This may either suggest that diluting the skill-mix by incorporating additional HCSWs can have negative impacts on patient mortality, or it may indicate that extra HCSWs are brought in when patients are sicker. In a related study, Smith et al examined a mechanism through which nurse staffing levels affect patient outcomes. The authors found that RN, but not HCSW, staffing levels affected the rates of failure to respond to the deterioration of the most acutely ill patients. Dall'Orra et al examined the role of temporary nurse staffing and patient mortality and found that heavy reliance on temporary staff — who are likely to have less firm-specific capital — was associated with a higher risk of a patient death.

### Analysis of social mission commitment at dental, medical, and nursing schools in the US [^a9501d72]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

This survey study found that it was possible to measure a wide range of social mission–advancing activities with an interdisciplinary approach on a national scale. The participation of more than 240 schools, despite the substantial time commitment at the senior leadership level, revealed that schools were eager to measure their social mission commitment and understand their relative performance compared with other institutions.

Our results highlighted many positive findings about the state of social mission commitment in health professions schools. For example, almost all participating schools included important social mission content areas, such as social determinants of health and health disparities, in their curriculum. However, there is still progress to be made; it was less common for these content areas to be integrated across all years of study, despite recommendations to teach this topic within a longitudinal framework. There was also substantial room for improvement in explicitly aligning curriculum with local community needs. The Association of American Medical Colleges has advocated for the incorporation of a local community health needs assessment into the curriculum at academic health care centers. However, only 49.3% of schools with access to such a tool reported that it moderately or substantially informed their curriculum. Health professions schools are not yet rising to the challenge of ensuring that graduates are well prepared for clinical practice, regardless of discipline, while acknowledging and enhancing their role in improving local community health.

Although academic health disciplines are diverse and distinct from one another in function, history, and training, all share a common goal of improving health. This study's intent was to bring awareness and create synergies across the school types in the pursuit of social mission engagement and performance. Patterns were observable in the data that may be beneficial for various stakeholders to note. For example, the better social mission performance observed in many areas among public schools, R1 doctoral universities, and special focus institutions warrants further investigation into factors associated with those differences. Certain differences between disciplines may be at least partially explainable by external pressures. For example, it was not unexpected that medical schools scored higher than dental and nursing schools in area 11 (pathway and pipeline programs) given that the Liaison Committee on Medical Education is the only major accrediting institution across the 3 disciplines assessed that specifically includes pipeline programs in its standards. Accreditation may be a useful incentive to further the widespread advancement of social mission in health professions schools. Ongoing analyses that examine the association of survey data with institutional characteristics and external outcome measures may elucidate additional reasons for these patterns and identify mechanisms for further transforming health professions education to meet societal needs.

### Exploring the availability of specialist health workforce education in east and Southern Africa: a document analysis [^215ac3ec]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

A critical concern is the limited number of specialist programmes in allied health science professions and the skewed nature of government investment in increasing doctors and nursing specialists at the expense of the allied health professions. Lack of faculty to train is a key contributory factor. The limited number of allied health workers with a specialist or advanced qualifications in each country in the ESA may also contribute to the limited specialist opportunities or specialist pathways for health professionals within allied health. Prioritising strategies to enhance opportunities for specialisation pathways for graduate allied health professionals is thus urgent. This may include specific national strategic objectives to establish programmes, recruit appropriate faculty and enrol potential candidates. Allied health professionals are critical part of the health workforce that supports the health system in all its functions, countries need to pay critical attention to their categories to manage emigration.

Although all the professions start specialisation after a first degree, nursing specialisation was found at both postgraduate and diploma levels. This could be attributed to the historical legacies aligned with the establishment of nursing as a profession in Africa, including static policies, which have positioned the entry into the nursing profession still at the Diploma level several years after the many organisations have advocated for bachelor's degree as entry level into professional nursing. In addition, health service administration and public service remuneration are driven towards recognising and paying diploma-trained specialists as they are relatively cheaper than nurses with advanced qualifications. A 1-year training is usually more attractive to employers than a 2-year or 3 years of specialist training at the master level. Therefore, nurses may have a better chance at funding and study leave opportunities when they specialise through a year-long post-basic diploma programme. A challenge for the future is harmonising nursing qualifications to allow for regional integration and specialist recognition that sets apart master qualification and diploma specialisation. With the thrust towards professionalisation of nursing, a possibility of strengthening master's level qualification as the only route for specialisation arises through embedding competence-based education philosophy within such qualifications.

### Core competencies for UK occupational health nurses: a Delphi study [^5a1c6b2c]. Occupational Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Occupational health nurses (OHNs) play a key role in occupational health (OH) services globally and are the single largest healthcare profession involved in workplace health management in Europe. Working at the interface between the workforce and management and as the first contact point for many health-related problems, they need to be able to respond to a wide range of health issues and questions, and require skills to meet the workforce's physical and psychosocial needs. The scope of OH nursing practice is broad, although to some degree context specific to individual workplaces and requirements. OHNs can have varying roles including clinician/practitioner, educator, manager/administrator and consultant with functions within these roles expanding due to economic, sociopolitical and technological demands. Nursing bodies including the World Health Organization (WHO) — European Member States, American Association of Occupational Health Nurses (AAOHN), Australian College of Occupational Health Nurses (ACOHN), and the UK Royal College of Nursing (RCN), have defined key OHN functions as guidance and a foundation of practice, leading to the development of specific core competencies. In some countries, these are based on levels of achievement (competent, proficient/experienced, expert); in others, they are classified into 'traditional role' and 'emergent role' activities with substantial overlap in the competencies required.

UK OH nursing is highly developed, comprising both registered and specialist nurses, the latter undertaking additional formal OH studies. A competency framework for OHNs was published by the RCN UK in 2011 to provide a benchmark in planning developments for practice. The original 2004 publication used competencies identified through consultation with UK OHNs and allied professions. Currently, there are ~3400 OHNs on the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) register and there may be other non-OH qualified nurses working in the field, to whom these competencies would apply. The first OHN consultant post was established in 2002 and a Faculty of Occupational Health Nursing (FOHN) is currently being established to provide a unified voice for the profession. Its vision is 'to promote excellence in the education, research and evidence-based practice of all OHNs for the benefit of the working population'.

### Exploration of the representation of the allied health professions in senior leadership positions in the UK national health service [^82140cb0]. BMJ Leader (2024). High credibility.

Although AHPs are the third largest workforce in the NHS, traditionally strategic leadership positions for AHPs within the NHS have been relatively small in number. The majority of NHS leadership positions have historically been filled by medical professionals. As healthcare providers adapt to the changing health requirements of the nation, AHPs have been identified as ideally placed to meet these needs and drive change. Since 2017, NHS England has published documents promoting the benefits of professional diversity at the executive board level and the recommendation of a chief AHP role in each Trust to help use the potential of this workforce.

The lack of leadership within the allied health professions is not specific to the UK and current literature, is unequivocal in identifying this issue. Previous reports focus on local leadership, leadership in multidisciplinary teams and leadership education. Information is lacking on AHP strategic leadership at the executive board level, such as Chief AHPs. There are a multitude of reasons why strategic leadership for AHPs is essential. Clinical leaders in healthcare are at the forefront of decision-making and have significant responsibilities such as organisational planningand deciding how limited funding is spent. They ensure that an organisation is ready to meet future healthcare challengesand have the power to drive change and facilitate the work of their colleagues. Leadership from those who understand the capabilities of the workforce they represent are essential to influence decision-making within strategic leadership.

Furthermore, effective strategic leadership has been shown to improve performance and quality of care and promote efficient use of resources. It also ensures that represented professions can compete for the resources they require. Competent leadership may also improve AHP visibility, influence, profile, and status, improving job satisfaction, engagement, and motivationand subsequently improving staff retention rates. Therefore, representation within strategic leadership roles is key in demonstrating the value of AHPs.

In England, NHS Trust executive boards are required to include a medical and a nurse director, but there is no obligation to include clinicians from other professions. As a result, board-level accountability for AHPs is the responsibility of the director of nursing or chief nurse. This differs in Wales where, since 2009, boards must include an officer responsible for therapies and health sciences. The lack of diversity within senior leadership roles hinders the ability of AHPs to develop and demonstrate the skills required to become leaders at the executive board level. In turn, this shortage of AHP leaders in strategic roles creates a lack of role models and mentors to inspire and give AHP clinicians the confidence to pursue leadership opportunities.

### Adult cardiothoracic transplant nursing: an ISHLT consensus document on the current adult nursing practice in heart and lung transplantation [^7cb5d7fc]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2015). Medium credibility.

Minimal specialty experience and education qualifications — entry and credentialing expectations were specified: "we recommend the following: a minimum of 2 years of general nursing experience should be required for entry into the role of transplant coordinator, clinical nurse specialist or NP", and "Previous critical care experience is preferred but not required". Educationally, "it was generally agreed that a baccalaureate in nursing is the minimum entry level required for the transplant coordinator role with at least a master's in nursing for an APN role", and "In the USA specifically, a transition to the DNP degree as a minimum requirement for the APN role is planned by 2015". The group stated that "non-RN transplant coordinators were not appropriate for the transplant coordinator role", that "it was highly recommended that coordinators seek specialty certification", and that "Currently, the CCTC qualification or international equivalent is the standard", noting "By consensus, these recommendations were also considered appropriate for international transplant nursing".
