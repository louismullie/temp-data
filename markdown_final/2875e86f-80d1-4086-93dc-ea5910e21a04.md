## Question

Pubic symphesis pain pregnancy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pubic symphysis pain in pregnancy, including how to define it, how to diagnose it, what imaging is appropriate, how to treat it, what the prognosis is, and what special scenarios and red flags to consider. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying terminology and pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the clinical presentation and how it differs from low back pain. Next, I will review the diagnostic approach and imaging. After that, I should evaluate treatment options, including belts, exercise, manual therapy, and medications. I will then examine prognosis and recurrence, consider special scenarios like postpartum diastasis and infection, and finally ensure safety, monitoring, and follow-up are addressed with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the terminology and basic framework. Pubic symphysis pain in pregnancy is best situated within pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPGP), a musculoskeletal pain syndrome localized between the posterior iliac crest and the gluteal fold that can involve the sacroiliac joints and/or the pubic symphysis; when anterior and symphyseal, it aligns with the symphysiolysis subtype of PPGP, and this is the preferred construct over older, inconsistent labels like "symphysis pubis dysfunction" [^112fYZVg] [^115Xk85Q] [^112J3WDT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology. I need to check the pathophysiology signals. The dominant contributors appear to be hormonal ligamentous laxity and biomechanical changes rather than a single hormone driver; while relaxin is often implicated, high-quality studies have not consistently linked relaxin levels to PPGP, and altered motor control and kinematics have moderate evidence for association, suggesting a multifactorial model rather than a purely hormonal one [^117LUKkf] [^114JyoxR] [^115wHLwV] [^114HdnMi].

> I will now examine the clinical presentation to anchor bedside recognition. Pain is typically suprapubic and may radiate to the groin, inner thigh, perineum, or posterior pelvis; provocative activities include walking, stair climbing, weight-bearing, hip abduction, and rolling in bed; a positive active straight leg raise test and reproduction of pain with palpation over the symphysis are supportive, though no single test is pathognomonic, and ASLR correlates better than passive hip tests in PPGP cohorts [^112J3WDT] [^113vLo6M] [^115Xk85Q].

> Wait, let me verify the differential diagnosis and the need to exclude other causes. I should confirm that we exclude lumbar radiculopathy, genitourinary or gastrointestinal pathology, infection, and trauma. Importantly, a red flag pathway is necessary, and when red flags are present, targeted imaging becomes appropriate to rule out infection, tumor, fracture, or other serious pathology, even though routine imaging is not recommended for straightforward PPGP [^116U93pb] [^115Xk85Q].

> Next, I should review imaging choices with fetal safety in mind. For routine PPGP without red flags, imaging is not indicated. When imaging is needed, ultrasound is first-line for acute pelvic pain in pregnancy, and MRI without gadolinium is preferred if ultrasound is nondiagnostic or red flags persist. X-rays are generally avoided in pregnancy but may be considered in exceptional circumstances after counseling on risk–benefit. Single-leg stance (flamingo) radiographs can help quantify physiologic versus pathologic symphyseal motion postpartum or when instability is suspected, with up to about 5 mm translation considered physiologic in asymptomatic individuals [^11573uN4] [^117LZkbW] [^116jKK6x].

> Let me consider first-line conservative management, because I need to ensure the foundation is solid. Patient education and reassurance are central; activity modification to avoid unilateral loading and provocative movements is prudent; supervised, individualized exercise programs emphasizing pelvic floor and deep abdominal stabilization, and avoidance of maladaptive movement patterns, have supportive evidence and are recommended in guidelines, with benefits on pain, function, and sick leave [^115Xk85Q] [^115Vr14o] [^116EaM16] [^115jc56N].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there was high-quality evidence for pelvic support belts, but I should double-check the level of evidence. The best available data are from a small randomized pilot comparing a flexible versus rigid belt, showing improved function across both belts and a modest pain reduction favoring the flexible belt; while promising, this is low-credibility evidence, and belts are best viewed as an adjunct to exercise-based care rather than a stand-alone solution; average daily use around 5 hours was reported, and adherence and comfort matter for effectiveness [^112EvuQS] [^1143W9hu] [^117AtPnD] [^114TcjAN].

> I need to check complementary modalities. Acupuncture has moderate-quality evidence for reducing evening pelvic pain and improving function when compared with usual care or exercise, and can be considered particularly when pain is persistent; osteopathic manipulative treatment and multimodal programs combining manual therapy, exercise, and education have also shown benefit in single studies, though heterogeneity limits pooling and generalizability [^113cqn3X] [^115jc56N].

> But wait, what about medications during pregnancy. I should confirm safe options. Paracetamol is generally acceptable in standard doses after discussing risks and benefits; NSAIDs are avoided after 20 weeks gestation; opioids are reserved for severe refractory pain with careful obstetric input; in select cases, local corticosteroid injection into the symphysis has been described, but evidence for meaningful benefit is limited and not specific to pregnancy, so it should be individualized and used cautiously [^notfound].

> I should review prognosis and recurrence risk to set expectations. Most women improve postpartum, but a meaningful minority have persistent pain up to 6–18 months or longer. Recurrence in subsequent pregnancies is high, estimated roughly 85–95%, and women with higher disability scores in pregnancy are more likely to have persistent pain. A history of low back or pelvic pain and positive provocation tests increase risk of chronicity, reinforcing the value of early, active management [^115Vr14o] [^112mYp9M] [^1148qrdc] [^111uYSg2].

> Now, I will examine special scenarios that change management. Symphyseal diastasis or rupture, though rare, may require more intensive support, including pelvic binders, assistive devices, and staged rehabilitation; most cases heal conservatively over weeks to months, but persistent instability or combined posterior ring lesions may eventually require orthopedic input; large separations greater than about 9–10 mm warrant close follow-up and may signal a higher risk of chronic instability [^114Eb2YT] [^111SU8MW] [^117LUKkf].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags for infection. Septic arthritis or osteomyelitis of the pubic symphysis is rare but serious. Features such as fever, elevated inflammatory markers, disproportionate pain, or atypical course should prompt urgent evaluation with MRI and culture-directed therapy. MRI is the modality of choice for osteomyelitis in pregnancy and can identify marrow changes, abscess, and joint involvement, enabling timely source control and antibiotics to protect maternal–fetal outcomes [^112tYnUc] [^111hPLe9] [^111FYFfN].

> Let me think about obstetric implications and delivery planning. There is no robust evidence that PPGP mandates a specific mode of delivery; individualized planning is appropriate, and in severe symphyseal separation or post-fixation scenarios, some clinicians favor cesarean to minimize mechanical stress, but decisions should be made collaboratively with obstetrics and orthopedics, recognizing that many women with prior separation have gone on to uneventful subsequent deliveries [^115r5rJ4] [^111Q2N6D].

> I should confirm the safety monitoring plan. Routine prenatal care suffices for most with PPGP. In those using support belts, check for skin irritation and ensure proper fit and comfort. With any escalation of pain, new fever, neurologic deficits, or inability to ambulate, reassess urgently and widen the differential, employing MRI when infection or fracture is suspected. Consider referral to pelvic floor physical therapy and pain specialists if symptoms persist beyond the early postpartum period [^11573uN4] [^115Xk85Q] [^111fHm3Y].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and follow-up capture functional impact. Using validated measures such as the Patient-Specific Functional Scale and pain ratings helps track clinically meaningful change; a 2-point improvement on PSFS is considered a minimal clinically important difference, which can guide whether current interventions are effective or whether to escalate care or introduce new modalities like acupuncture or targeted injections in refractory cases [^111Yk3Nb] [^111zaU1y].

Pubic symphysis pain in pregnancy is most often due to **hormonal and biomechanical changes** that increase joint laxity and asymmetry, causing anterior pelvic pain worsened by weight-bearing and stair climbing [^117LUKkf] [^114XCnKo]. Diagnosis is **clinical**, supported by palpation and provocation tests (ASLR, Patrick's, Trendelenburg) [^115Xk85Q]; MRI is reserved for severe or atypical cases to exclude fracture or infection [^11573uN4]. First-line management is **conservative**: pelvic support belts, supervised physiotherapy, activity modification, and acetaminophen [^115jc56N]; most improve postpartum, but some have persistent symptoms [^116U93pb]. Rare complications include symphyseal separation or septic arthritis, which require urgent imaging and multidisciplinary care [^114Eb2YT] [^112tYnUc].

---

## Pathophysiology

Pubic symphysis pain in pregnancy arises from **multifactorial mechanisms**:

- **Hormonal changes**: Increased relaxin, estrogen, and progesterone soften ligaments, increasing joint mobility and instability [^116bCdE2].

- **Biomechanical changes**: Altered center of gravity, gait, and posture increase mechanical stress on the symphysis [^113ZpzEj].

- **Mechanical stress**: Fetal growth and maternal weight gain add load, worsening instability and pain [^114XCnKo].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include:

- **Pain location**: Suprapubic region, radiating to groin, inner thigh, or posterior pelvis [^112J3WDT].

- **Pain characteristics**: Worse with weight-bearing, stair climbing, ambulation, and position changes; relieved by rest [^114Eb2YT].

- **Functional impairment**: Difficulty walking, climbing stairs, or performing daily activities [^114HdnMi].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, with imaging reserved for atypical or severe cases:

| **Diagnostic method** | **Role in evaluation** |
|-|-|
| Clinical history and examination | - Central to diagnosis <br/> - Palpation and provocation tests (ASLR, Patrick's, Trendelenburg) reproduce pain [^115Xk85Q] |
| Ultrasound | - First-line for acute pelvic pain in pregnancy <br/> - No radiation <br/> - Limited for symphysis assessment [^11573uN4] |
| MRI | - High sensitivity/specificity for infection, fracture, or severe separation <br/> - No radiation <br/> - Avoid contrast [^111hPLe9] |
| X-ray/CT | - Rarely used due to radiation <br/> - Consider for severe trauma or surgical planning [^117LZkbW] |

---

## Management strategies

Management is **multimodal and conservative**:

- **Pelvic support belts**: Reduce pain and improve function; flexible belts are better tolerated than rigid [^112EvuQS] [^1143W9hu].

- **Physiotherapy**: Supervised pelvic floor and core stabilization exercises improve pain and function [^115Vr14o] [^116EaM16].

- **Activity modification**: Avoid unilateral loading, stair climbing, and prolonged standing; use assistive devices as needed [^115y51Ph] [^111SU8MW].

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Acetaminophen is first-line; NSAIDs are avoided after 20 weeks [^notfound].

- **Patient education**: Reassurance and ergonomic counseling improve adherence and outcomes [^116EaM16].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Most women improve within 3–6 months postpartum, but 5–8% have persistent pain beyond 2 years; recurrence is common in subsequent pregnancies, especially with prior PPGP or symphyseal separation [^1148qrdc].

---

## Potential complications

Although rare, **significant complications** can occur:

- **Symphyseal separation**: Diastasis > 10 mm; managed conservatively with belts and physiotherapy; surgery reserved for refractory cases [^114Eb2YT].

- **Septic arthritis**: Rare infection requiring urgent MRI, aspiration, and prolonged antibiotics [^112tYnUc].

- **Persistent pain**: Chronic pelvic pain impacting quality of life and daily function [^111xgeWi].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies focus on **core stabilization and pelvic floor exercises**, **weight management**, and **ergonomic education** to reduce mechanical stress on the symphysis.

---

Pubic symphysis pain in pregnancy is common and multifactorial; **conservative care is effective** for most, but persistent or severe cases need targeted imaging and multidisciplinary management.

Twenty of the 21 women diagnosed with PPSS, had a valid address, and received a postal invitation to participate in the study. The letter, mailed in March 2018, contained information about the study, a previously used questionnaire about long-term follow-up in women with PGP and a written informed consent form. The questionnaire was based on a reliable and validated instrument to assess lumbo-pelvic pain (LPP) that was used in an earlier longitudinal follow-up study of women with PGP during pregnancy. Two reminders were sent.

### Adherence, tolerance and effectiveness of two different pelvic support belts as a treatment for pregnancy-related symphyseal pain-a pilot randomized trial [^112xRhHe]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pregnancy-related pubic symphysis pain is relatively common and can significantly interfere with daily activities. Physiotherapist-prescribed pelvic support belts are a treatment option, but little evidence exists to support their use. This pilot compared two pelvic belts to determine effectiveness (symptomatic relief), tolerance (comfort) and adherence (frequency, duration of use).

Methods

Unblinded, 2-arm, single-center, randomized (1:1) parallel-group trial. Twenty pregnant women recruited from the community (Dunedin, New Zealand), with physiotherapist-diagnosed symphyseal pain, were randomly allocated to wear either a flexible or rigid belt for three weeks. One author, not involved in data collection, randomized the allocation to trial group. The unblinded primary outcome was the Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS). Secondary outcomes were pain intensity during the preceding 24 hours and preceding week (visual analogue scale [VAS]), and disability (Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire [MODQ]). Duration of use (hours) was recorded daily by text messaging. Participants were assessed at baseline, by weekly phone interviews and at intervention completion (three weeks). To assess comfort, women wore the alternate belt in the fourth week.

Results

Twenty pregnant women (mean ± SD age, 29.4 ± 6.5 years; mean gestation at baseline, 30.8 ± 5.2 weeks) were randomized to treatment groups (flexible = 10, rigid = 10) and all were included in analysis. When adjusted for baseline, PSFS scores were not significantly different between groups at follow up (mean difference −0.1; 95% CI: −2.5 to 2.3; p = 0.94). Pain in the preceding 24 hours reached statistical significance in favor of the flexible belt (VAS, p = 0.049). Combining both groups' data, function and pain were significantly improved at three weeks (mean difference −2.3; 95% CI: 1.2 to 3.5; p < 0.001). Belts were worn for an average of 4.9 ± 2.9 hours per day; women preferred the flexible belt. No adverse events were reported.

Conclusion

These preliminary results suggest the flexible pelvic support belt may be more effective in reducing pain and is potentially better tolerated than a rigid belt. Based on these data, a larger trial is both feasible and clinically useful.

### Risk factors for pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain: a scoping review [^114p6FqM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This scoping review presents an overview of current literature on risk factors for PPGP. A total of 148 factors were examined in the included studies, but issues of varying definitions and measurement methods, and a lack of replication were identified, which makes meta-analysis impossible. This review provides a basis to guide future systematic reviews and research on the development of PPGP. In conclusion, the literature on risk factors for PPGP is incomplete and statements regarding such risk factors should reflect current limitations and uncertainty.

### Risk factors for pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain: a scoping review [^112ttseS]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This review represents a comprehensive overview of the available evidence on risk factors for PPGP. A very large number of factors, 148 in total, were examined in 24 studies, yet only 14 factors were examined in more than one study. Definitions of PPGP varied across studies and only three studies included a physical examination despite it being recommended to differentiate PPGP from low back pain. There is an urgent need for consistency in PPGP measurement to allow pooling of data in future systematic reviews. We recommend adhering to the definition of PGP outlined in the European Guidelines and including a physical examination as per the guidelines.

Based on the findings of this scoping review, we recommend that systematic reviews are performed on factors that were examined in multiple studies, in particular the factors age, BMI, parity, and smoking, which have been examined in more than five studies. This scoping review can also provide a basis to design robust prospective observational studies to increase our understanding of the development of PPGP. Considering the susceptibility of observational research to bias, repetition of studies is required to draw strong conclusions. This is currently lacking for most of the risk factors examined in the literature, making pooling of multiple studies impossible. Issues to consider include the consistency of the association across studies, and, if present, the strength and timing of the association, and the dose-response relation where appropriate. Such research can provide strategies to improve management of this common condition. This is particularly important given the clinical implications of persistent PPGP, which causes new mothers considerable pain and difficulty, sometimes for up to two years postpartum. Other concerns in some existing studies that should, where possible, be avoided in future are: small sample sizes, a lack of robust multivariable analysis, and incomplete reporting (of the response rate, assessment procedure, the findings and analysis). Prospective registration of observational studies would also help address some of these issues. Recommendations for future research are summarised in Table 7.

Limitations

We conducted a scoping review of the literature on risk factors for PPGP and thus did not conduct a risk of bias assessment. Ideally, this study will be followed by systematic reviews on specific, potential risk factors that have been examined in more than one study to include a risk of bias assessment before synthesising the literature.

### Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain: an update [^117LUKkf]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Aetiology

The exact mechanisms that lead to the development of PPGP remain uncertain. A variety of approaches have been proposed that suggest hormonal, biomechanical, traumatic, metabolic, genetic and degenerative etiologic implications.

On the basis of all of these hypotheses, the accumulated evidence advocates in favour of a multifactorial condition during pregnancy and postpartum. The effect of the levels of relaxin and progesterone to the pelvic girdle ligaments is established; however, no consensus of its association with the symptoms of PPGP has been reached. This discrepancy can be attributed mostly to methodological differences, as well as to the presence of unspecified cofactors altering the clinical presentation. The biomechanical theory and its advocates have highlighted the separation of the pubic symphysis (≥ 10 mm) as an important threshold. However, this was not proven to be consistent and does not apply to patients with symptoms mostly localised at the posterior pelvic girdle. Moreover, other mechanical theories based on body habitus and lumbar spine stance, as well as foetal size and weight, have also been proven incompatible with all the cases. The role of genetics is still largely unknown, and current knowledge is based on epidemiological indications between first-degree relatives.

Risk factors

Among a large number of potential factors, those of strenuous work (twisting and bending the back several times per hour), a history of low-back pain, pelvic girdle pain or previous trauma to the bony pelvis were identified as being strongly related to PPGP. Conversely, in the same epidemiologic observational studies, factors such as the time from previous pregnancies, smoking habits, use of contraception, epidural anaesthesia, maternal ethnicity, body mass index, number of previous pregnancies, bone density, foetal weight and age were not linked with increased risk of PPGP development.

### Acute abdominal and pelvic pain in pregnancy: ESUR recommendations [^117LZkbW]. European Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain in pregnancy presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Standard imaging techniques need to be adapted to reduce harm to the fetus from X-rays due to their teratogenic and carcinogenic potential. Ultrasound remains the primary imaging investigation of the pregnant abdomen. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of gynaecological and obstetric problems during pregnancy and in the setting of acute abdomen during pregnancy. MRI overcomes some of the limitations of ultrasound, mainly the size of the gravid uterus. MRI poses theoretical risks to the fetus and care must be taken to minimise these with the avoidance of contrast agents. This article reviews the evolving imaging and clinical literature on appropriate investigation of acute abdominal and pelvic pain during established intrauterine pregnancy, addressing its common causes. Guidelines based on the current literature and on the accumulated clinico-radiological experience of the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) working group are proposed for imaging these suspected conditions.

### Diastasis recti abdominis during pregnancy and 12 months after childbirth: prevalence, risk factors and report of lumbopelvic pain [^115fe9nT]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Prevalence of mild DRA was high both during pregnancy and after childbirth. No obvious risk factors were found, and there was no difference in report of lumbopelvic pain between the group with and without DRA 12 months post partum. There is a need for more research on the influence of DRA on abdominal strength and lumbopelvic pain, and the effect of preventative and treatment programmes.

What are the findings?

Prevalence of diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) among first-time pregnant Scandinavian women were 33.1%, 60.0%, 45.4% and 32.6% at gestation week 21, 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post partum, respectively.
Age, height, mean weight before this pregnancy, weight gain during pregnancy, caesarean section, baby's birth weight, benign joint hypermobility syndrome, and level of abdominal and pelvic floor muscle exercise training and general exercise training 12 months post partum were not found to be risk factors for DRA.
Women with DRA were not more likely to report lumbopelvic pain compared with women without DRA 12 months after childbirth.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?

Given the high prevalence of mild diastasis recti abdominis, coaches and healthcare providers should assess whether the condition is present in post partum women.
This study indicates that mild diastasis is not associated with lumbopelvic pain, which is important information to give to women with this condition.

### Adherence, tolerance and effectiveness of two different pelvic support belts as a treatment for pregnancy-related symphyseal pain-a pilot randomized trial [^111Yk3Nb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Follow up

At the conclusion of the intervention (three weeks), the un-blinded researcher (NF) met with participants to reassess the PFSF, and each woman self-completed the MODQ and VAS. Participants were then fitted with the alternate belt to wear for one week. Following this (week 4), a final phone interview was conducted which included the same questions as weeks 1 and 2, respectively, and participants were asked about belt preference (the proforma for the phone interviews is shown in Additional file 3).

Outcomes

The primary outcome measure was the PSFS and the primary endpoint was three weeks. The PSFS has been shown to be a reliable and valid test for assessing disability and change in disability, and a 2-point difference in scores may be considered a minimal clinically important change. For each group, mean scores for all outcome measures were calculated at baseline and at the end of week 3. Data were then transformed as described by Westaway et al. Secondary outcome measures were pain intensity rated on the 10 cm VAS for worst pain over the preceding 24 hours and the preceding week, and functional status determined by the MODQ score, interpreted using the specified guidelines.

Sample size

Before a multi-center trial of pelvic support belts can be launched, it is essential to gather data on the most appropriate type of belt, symptomatic effectiveness, comfort, and adherence as well as to provide estimates of anticipated variability and correlations between repeated measures. Having 10 participants in each arm of this study was considered sufficient to obtain preliminary data to help with estimating power for a larger subsequent study.

### Chronic anterior pelvic instability: diagnosis and management [^115y51Ph]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic anterior pelvic ring instability can cause pain and disability. Pain typically is localized to the suprapubic area or inner thigh; often is associated with lower back or buttock pain; and may be exacerbated by activity, direct impact, or pelvic ring compression. Known etiologies of chronic anterior pelvic ring instability include pregnancy, parturition, trauma, insufficiency fractures, athletics, prior surgery, and osteitis pubis. Diagnosis often is delayed. Physical examination may reveal an antalgic or waddling gait, tenderness over the pubic bones or symphysis pubis, and pain with provocative maneuvers. AP pelvic radiographs may demonstrate chronic degenerative changes at the pubic symphysis or nonhealing fractures. Standing single leg stance (flamingo view) radiographs can demonstrate pathologic motion at the pubic symphysis. CT may be useful in assessing posterior pelvic ring involvement. The initial management is typically nonsurgical and may include the use of an orthosis, activity modification, medication, and physical therapy. If nonsurgical modalities are unsuccessful, surgery may be warranted, although little evidence exists to guide treatment. Surgical intervention may include internal fixation alone in select patients, the addition of bone graft to fixation, or symphyseal arthrodesis. In some patients, additional stabilization or arthrodesis of the posterior pelvic ring may be indicated.

### The management of nonobstetric pains in pregnancy [^115zFZ5G]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Nonobstetric pain in pregnancy is usually managed with simple analgesia and reassurance that the condition will be self-limiting. However, sometimes such pain can be severe enough to warrant a different approach. We present 3 cases of uncontrolled pain in pregnancy, which were treated with nerve block techniques.

Case Report

The first patient had a recurrence of pain similar to that experienced during her first pregnancy related to stretching of her lower ribs; this was relieved completely by injection of bupivacaine 0.5% and triamcinolone. Another patient had symphyseal pain, which had required induction of labor during her previous pregnancy due to its severity. She had only brief relief on injection. The third patient experienced severe pain related to a Pfannenstiel incision scar from a previous cesarean delivery, which was completely relieved by injection. A review is presented of nonobstetric pains and their treatment options that may occur in pregnancy, including neurogenic, musculoskeletal, neuropathic, and referred pains.

Conclusion

We conclude that a single bolus injection of local anesthetic and steroid, when performed carefully by a pain management specialist, is a safe and potentially effective alternative to conventional analgesic treatment of somatic pain associated with the uterine enlargement of pregnancy.

### Peripartum pubic symphysis separation – current strategies in diagnosis and therapy and presentation of two cases [^114Eb2YT]. Injury (2015). Low credibility.

Background

During spontaneous vaginal delivery, pubic symphyseal widening is normal. Common changes are reversible after complication-free birth. However, cases of peripartum symphysis separation are rare. There is no consensus in the literature on how to treat pregnancy-related pubic symphysis separation.

Methods

This review used a literature-based search (PubMed, 1900–2013) and analysis of 2 own case reports. Studies with conclusions regarding management were particularly considered.

Results

Characteristic symptoms, suprapubic pain and tenderness radiating to the posterior pelvic girdle or lower back, may be noted 48 h after delivery. Pain on movement, especially walking or climbing stairs, is often present. Conservative treatments, such as a pelvic brace with physiotherapy and local interventions such as infiltration, are successful in most cases. Symptom reduction within 6 weeks is the most common outcome, but can take up to 6 months in some cases. Surgical intervention is needed in cases of persistent separation. Anterior plate fixation is offered as a well-known and safe procedure. Minimally invasive SI joint screw fixation is required in cases of combined posterior pelvic girdle lesions.

Summary

Postpartum symphyseal rupture can be indicated with the rare occurrence of pelvic pain post-delivery, with sciatica or lumbago and decreased mobility. The diagnosis is made on clinical findings, as well as radiographs of the pelvic girdle. Conservative treatment with a pelvic brace is the gold standard in pre- and postpartum cases of symphysis dysfunction.

### The effects of pelvic belt use on pelvic alignment during and after pregnancy: a prospective longitudinal cohort study [^113ZpzEj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

During and after pregnancy, joint laxity and swelling of the abdomen are associated with the fetal growth changes the pelvic alignment of women. For example, softening of the ligaments that join the pelvis occur because of pregnancy-related hormones such as relaxin which function to make space for fetal growth. In addition, the pelvis widens as the abdomen enlarges with the advancing pregnancy and to facilitate the forthcoming labor and delivery. Although widening of the pelvis is necessary for fetal growth and childbirth, significant problems such as separation of the pubic symphysis can occur when pelvic widening exceeds the limits of its range of motion and pelvic joint flexibility. Pelvic asymmetry alters the body's mechanics, placing strain on various body segments, which subsequently contributes to musculoskeletal pain. A difference in the amount of change on left and right sides of the body could cause maladaptive responses, such as altered movement patterns that can result in pain. Since pelvic asymmetry is considered to be a cause of lumbopelvic pain among pregnant women, it can be said that this asymmetry causes definite discomfort. According to a study that investigated the differences in pelvic alignments among women, the anterior widths of the pelvises of pregnant and postpartum women were greater than those of never-pregnant women. In other words, changes in pelvic alignment that occur in pregnancy might persist after pregnancy. As such, pelvic belts are popular among these women as a tool to prevent changes in pelvic alignment in addition to reduce lumbopelvic pain. The pelvic belt helps to stabilize the pelvis and is thought to be effective for relieving lumbar and pelvic pain. It has been suggested that hip adduction forces in patients with pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain is increased, the intensity of pelvic pain is reduced, and that daily activities are improved with pelvic belt use. These effects are thought to occur because the belts, which compress the pelvis externally, are thought to augment pelvic stability via additional closure forces in lumbopelvic disorders where stability is compromised. This function of the pelvic belt might affect the width of the pelvis. Moreover, this pelvic compression function inhibits excessive movement of the pelvis joint and might also correct pelvic asymmetry.

### Knowledge mapping analysis of research on pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPGP) from 2002 to 2022 using bibliometrics [^112V9BYX]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Amidst the references bearing significant co-citations, greater emphasis was placed upon the examination of the frequency and determinants of PPGP, alongside the therapeutic capacity of exercise in mitigating PPGP. Hanne A proposes subgroups within pelvic girdle pain during pregnancy: sacroiliac joint separation, unilateral sacroiliac syndrome, and bilateral sacroiliac syndrome have good postpartum outcomes, while pelvic girdle syndrome has a poorer prognosis compared to the first three. In 2002, the association between the highest relative risk of chronic pain was linked to a high number of positive tests and a low activity index. In 2022, The Academy of Pelvic Health Physical Therapy (APHPT) has determined that the following factors may be linked to the development of PP-PGP: pain in the posterior pelvic area, discomfort while lying down and bearing weight, multiple pregnancies, cesarean delivery, symptoms of depression, elevated pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), work-related factors, and position during breastfeeding. It is important to carefully consider patient information regarding PPGP, as the underlying cause and progression of the condition are still not fully understood.

It is noteworthy that the guidelines and statements issued by the Academy of Pelvic Health Physical Therapy (APHPT) under the purview of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) is widely acknowledged as the epitome of excellence in guiding clinical practice pertaining to the administration of PPGP. Moreover, an ascendant curiosity has been engendered in the realm of investigations concerning the enduring nature and far-reaching ramifications of pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPGP), as evidenced by high co-citation of references and strong citation bursts in recent years. Most of the long-term PPGP can apparently be early identified and predicted by a history of low back pain and positive pain provocation tests. Early recognition and personalized treatment intervention are emphasized as crucial for preventing long-term pain. A study by Virgara R highlights the importance of considering both the physical and mental health of women during the third trimester of pregnancy. The findings suggest that women with higher symptoms of depression and anxiety may experience a greater degree of functional disability related to their LBPP, highlighting the need for increased attention to both the physical symptoms of PGP and the psychological well-being of pregnant women.

### Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain: an update [^112fYZVg]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Definition

Many terms have been used to describe PPGP syndrome on the basis of causative hypotheses (pelvic joint arthropathy, relaxation, insufficiency, instability), presenting symptoms (pelvic pain, and/or low-back pain, pelvic joint pain) or related topography (posterior pelvic pain, osteitis pubis, symphyseal pelvic dysfunction, low-back pain) (Table 1).

All of these attempts to define the problem have been unsuccessful either because they narrowed the spectrum of this pain syndrome or because they confused its nature by blending it with the syndrome of chronic low-back lumbar pain. There is an existing consensus that pregnancy-related low-back pain is a distinct entity that needs to be excluded before the diagnosis of PPGP is made.

While the responsible pathophysiological mechanisms remain obscure, this clinical syndrome is best defined descriptively by its presentation and topography. With regard to its onset, it has been associated with symptoms beginning between the first trimester, at labour or even during the postpartum period. Thus, terms limiting PPGP to a certain phase pregnancy appear insufficient to cover the whole spectrum of the clinical problem. With regard to this concept, the European Guidelines are based on the musculoskeletal type of the resulting pain (excluding gynaecological and/or urological causative pathologies) localised from the level of the posterior iliac crest and the gluteal fold over the anterior and posterior elements of the bony pelvis. In 2005, the term pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain, or PPGP, was introduced and appears to be the most accurate compared with previous definitions.

### History of pain around the lumbopelvic region during perinatal period: a prospective cohort study [^1121NLNK]. European Spine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Many women experience pain around the low back and pelvic girdle during/after pregnancy. These pains have different risk factors and require independent management strategies. Therefore, an epidemiological database is required to understand when each type of pain occurs, and how serious it could be. Thus, the history of pain in the lumbopelvic region throughout the perinatal period was investigated.

Methods

The information of 170 women recruited at the obstetrics and gynecology clinics in Japan was collected at 12, 24, 30, and 36 weeks of pregnancy, in the early days after childbirth, and one month after childbirth. The presence and severity of sacroiliac joint pain, pubic pain, groin pain, and low back pain were assessed using a numerical rating scale. Descriptive statistics were used to determine changes in the prevalence of pain. In addition, the change in the severity of each type of pain was observed through descriptive statistics, by including only those who had pain.

Results

The sacroiliac joint pain showed a twofold increase from 12 to 24 weeks, while the pubic pain suddenly increased after 24 weeks. The severity of pubic and groin pain increased sharply during pregnancy. Regarding low back pain, the change in the severity was lesser than the other pains. The sacroiliac joint pain was the highest among the four pains during pregnancy.

Conclusion

Each type of pain had a different incidence rate and a different time of onset and aggravation. These results help women and health professionals to manage, and prevent these harmful symptoms.

### Pain management for postpartum pain: a narrative review [^1148qrdc]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Pelvic Girdle Pain (PPGP)

Postpartum pelvic girdle pain (PPGP) is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder during and after pregnancy, often progressing to chronic pain if left unmanaged. Prevalence varies due to inconsistent diagnostic criteria. A study by Vermani et alreported that approximately 45% of pregnant women experience pelvic girdle pain during pregnancy, with the majority recovering spontaneously within three months postpartum. Notably, approximately 19% of women still experience PPGP 12 years after delivery.

The pathophysiology remains unclear but is thought to involve mechanical strain and hormonal effects, particularly elevated relaxin levels, which increase ligament laxity and pelvic joint mobility. This instability is considered a major contributor to pain.

Risk factors include a history of LBP, BMI > 25, antepartum PPGP, depression, heavy labor, and the need for mobility aids during pregnancy.

In terms of management, PPGP is typically addressed through multimodal interventions, primarily involving non-pharmacological therapies such as physical therapy and exercise training. A study by Gutke et alprovided strong evidence supporting the beneficial effects of acupuncture and pelvic support belts in the treatment of PPGP. Furthermore, a systematic review by Franke et aldemonstrated that osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) significantly improves pain levels and functional status in women with PPGP. In addition, research by Vleeming et alconcluded that the current body of scientific evidence is sufficient to recommend appropriate exercise during pregnancy to alleviate or prevent the onset and progression of PPGP.

### A retrospective study on the efficacy of pubic symphysis corticosteroid injections in the treatment of pubic symphysis pain [^112e9mYA]. Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To report immediate and follow-up pain intensity outcomes of fluoroscopically guided contrast- enhanced pubic symphysis corticosteroid injections for patients with pubic symphysis pain (PSP).

Design

Retrospective medical record review.

Setting

Outpatient rehabilitation clinic.

Subjects

Patients with PSP who underwent pubic symphysis corticosteroid injection (PSI).

Intervention

Pubic symphysis corticosteroid injection.

Outcome Measures

Pain intensity as measured by numeric rating scale (NRS).

Results

Fourteen patients (4 men and 10 women) underwent PSI. Five patients had PSP for less than 6 months, nine had chronic pain (> than 6 months). In 7 of the 10 women the pain was pregnancy related. All patients received other treatments prior to injection. Pubic symphysis tenderness was the most common physical examination finding (13/14 patients). Follow-up pain intensity (PI)-NRS improvement of greater than 2 points was considered clinically significant. At follow-up, improvement was not statistically significant (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, z = 1.62 P = 0.10). Patients with pain < 6 months did not have a greater likelihood of benefit at follow-up compared with those with pain for > 6 months (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.775).

Conclusions

PSIs do not provide clinically or statistically significant relief at follow-up in patients with PSP.

### Adherence, tolerance and effectiveness of two different pelvic support belts as a treatment for pregnancy-related symphyseal pain-a pilot randomized trial [^113bU7Pb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

The flexible belt was the favored belt in terms of comfort (82%). In contrast, Depledge et al. reported that only 27% of individuals who wore the rigid belt found it uncomfortable, compared to 43% of those who wore the flexible belt, suggesting that the rigid belt was better received. However, as participants in the study by Depledge et al. trialed only one type of belt, they were unable to make an individual comparison. Other intervention studies have only explored the effects of a single type of pelvic support belt or garment. The practicalities highlighted by the participants in the current study, such as being able to keep the belt in place when getting up from sitting and making sure that it is comfortable to wear while sitting, should be considered when choosing the most suitable belt for a larger investigation into their effect in pregnancy-related PSP symptoms.

The present study has some limitations. Given that this was a pilot study, interpretation of the data is somewhat limited by the small number of participants and the consequently wide confidence intervals. This restriction should be taken into account when interpreting results. Another limitation is the lack of a control group as it was intended only to directly compare flexible and rigid belts. Consequently, changes in mean PSFS scores (2.3 lower at follow-up) and mean pain VAS over the preceding week (12.8 mm lower at follow-up) need to be interpreted with caution. However, it is unlikely that such a decrease in PSFS (greater than the clinically meaningful change of 2 points suggested by Westaway et al.) would have occurred in the absence of any intervention given the typical gestational age of the participants (mean 30.8 weeks). The design of our study preceded the recent publication of the Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire and therefore this outcome measure could not be incorporated.

### Adherence, tolerance and effectiveness of two different pelvic support belts as a treatment for pregnancy-related symphyseal pain-a pilot randomized trial [^112i1iUd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Data were entered into a spreadsheet. Appropriate descriptive statistics were derived for all variables. Linear regression models were used to examine differences in follow-up values between the two groups (flexible and rigid belts) after adjusting for baseline values. Model assumptions were assessed using histograms of residuals, plots of residuals against fitted values, and Levene's test for equality of variance between groups. Where model residuals were positively skewed or demonstrated heteroscedasticity, natural logarithmic transformations were investigated, after adding one in the case of measures that included zero values. Overall changes (across both groups) in measures were examined using paired t-tests where there was no evidence of differences in change between groups and regression models using follow-up values while controlling for baseline values were used to assess any association with compliance. Stata 13.1 was used for all statistical analysis and all tests were performed using two-sided p < 0.05 as indicating statistical significance.

### Symphysiolysis: acupuncture therapeutic benefits: a randomized… [^1147uEVn]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Overview a randomized, observer blind and placebo-controlled cross-over study in which true acupuncture was compared to "placebo" acupuncture. the investigators evaluate the effect of the acupuncture on the pain and the ability of the pregnant patient. the investigators recruit women who diagnose with symphysiolisis by having 2 out of 3 of the follow:

- Examine for pain or sensitivity to touch on pubic symphysis joint.
- Modified Trendelenburg's test
- Active straight leg raise test The trial doctor will mark the woman's chart with a continuous number that will become her number in the trial, and she will then be referred to the acupuncturist. The treatment will be conducted by one of the acupuncturists on staff at the integrative medical center. All the acupuncturists have many years of experience in treating pregnant women with Chinese medicine. The acupuncture will be carried out with 0. 18/40mm single use needles.

Point selection and numbers of points used will be determined following the evaluation of the acupuncturist according to the accepted standards of in Chinese medicine. Approximately 30 minutes after the acupuncture treatment began, the woman will be asked once again to assess her level of pain. An improvement of 1. 5 marks on the NRS scale is considered a positive response. Women whose response after 30 minutes of acupuncture is less than this will be given the opposite acupuncture treatment. Those who received V acupuncture will receive P acupuncture and those who received P acupuncture will receive V acupuncture. A woman will be called our team if her pain is significantly worse. She will then receive the treatment that has been found most effective between the two acupuncture treatments she received previously. Participation Criteria For general information about clinical research, read Learn About Studies.

Inclusion Criteria:

- Women > 18 years
- Single embryo pregnancy in week 24–42

### Symphyseal separation [^111SU8MW]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Separation of the pubic symphysis up to 1 cm during pregnancy and delivery occurs frequently. This report presents a woman who experienced a large symphyseal separation.

Case

Following delivery, a 35-year-old primipara complained of hip and groin pain associated with leg movement. An anterior-posterior pelvic X-ray showed a pubic separation of 9.5 cm and a 3–5 mm widening of the sacroiliac joints. She was treated with a pelvic binder, walker, and physical therapy. The diastasis has since undergone progressive reduction.

Conclusion

Separation of the pubic symphysis during pregnancy and delivery is normal. However, a large separation is a potential complication requiring treatment and follow-up. Conservative management including analgesia, rest, and a pelvic binder is a reasonable method of management.

### Imaging for acute pelvic pain in pregnancy [^11573uN4]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Acute pelvic pain in pregnancy presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Standard imaging techniques need to be adapted to reduce harm to the foetus from X-rays because of their teratogenic and carcinogenic potential. Ultrasound remains the primary imaging investigation of the pregnant abdomen. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of gynaecological and obstetric problems during pregnancy and in the setting of acute abdomen during pregnancy. MRI overcomes some of the limitations of ultrasound, mainly the size of the gravid uterus. MRI poses theoretical risks to the foetus and care must be taken to minimise these with the avoidance of contrast agents. Teaching Points
- Ultrasound and MRI are the preferred investigations for acute pelvic pain during pregnancy.
- Ultrasound remains the primary imaging investigation because of availability and portability.
- MRI helps differentiate causes of acute pelvic pain when ultrasound is inconclusive.

### Septic arthritis of the pubic symphysis in pregnancy [^112tYnUc]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Septic arthritis of the pubic symphysis is a rare but serious entity which can be difficult to distinguish from common pregnancy-related problems. The following highlights the risk factors and clinical features of this uncommon condition and describes its diagnosis and management. The patient is a 26-year-old gravida 2 para 1 (second pregnancy that lasted > 20 weeks and one prior term delivery) who presented to the labour and delivery triage unit of a tertiary care centre at 23 weeks' gestation with pelvis and hip pain. The patient had elevated inflammatory markers and Staphylococcal bacteraemia. MRI demonstrated pubic symphyseal septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. The patient underwent two fluoroscopy-guided joint aspirations; synovial fluid contained abundant neutrophils and grew colonies of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus She then completed 6weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy. Repeat MRI of the pelvis at 31 weeks' gestation was favourable. The patient underwent caesarean delivery at 39 weeks' gestation without complication. Pelvic pain is common in pregnancy. However, abnormal musculoskeletal exam findings, historical elements and elevated inflammatory markers may suggest septic arthritis or osteomyelitis of the pubic symphysis. Accurate microbial identification, aggressive source control and multidisciplinary treatment are essential to optimal maternal and pregnancy outcomes.

### Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain: an update [^116U93pb]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Incidence

Among all the relevant studies, the incidence of PPGP ranges from 4% to 76.4% depending on the definition used, the diagnostic means utilised (for example, patient history, pain questionnaires, clinical tests) and the design of the studies (retrospective or prospective).

As reported by Wu et al. on average, doctors' files verify the syndrome in about 20% fewer cases than patients' reports. The apparent geographical variation of reported PPGP incidence and severity, with higher rates in Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands, should be attributed to the increased awareness regarding this condition by healthcare providers and the public. However, the reported cases are spread among a wide variety of countries (Table 1) and across all continents, indicating that PPGP is a universal problem.

Using the definition described above and including only prospectively designed studies of large series of patients with objectively verified symptoms, the prevalence of PPGP is between 16% and 25%. Over the same large samples of pregnant women, the clinically persistent PPGP from the postpartum stage to 2 years after childbirth has a reported incidence of 5% to 8.5%.

Differential diagnosis

The PPGP diagnosis should be considered after the exclusion of painful visceral pathologies of the pelvis (urogenital, gastrointestinal), lower-back pain syndromes (lumbar disc lesion/prolapsed, radiculopathies, spondylolisthesis, rheumatism, sciatica, spinal stenosis or lumbar spine arthritis), bone or soft tissue infections (typical or atypical such as tuberculosis or syphilitic lesions of pubis), urinary tract infections, femoral vein thrombosis, obstetric complications (preterm labour, abruption, round ligament pain, chorioamnionitis), rupture of symphysis pubis, and bone or soft tissue tumours.

A thorough medical history, physical examination and appropriate laboratory tests should always be performed to successfully reach the diagnosis of PPGP. Obviously, a multidisciplinary approach and consultation may be needed, as this syndrome expands to a wide field of anatomically related medical specialties. An algorithm of the necessary diagnostic workup is presented in Figure 1.

### Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain: an update [^114kTSWj]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

A large number of scientists from a wide range of medical and surgical disciplines have reported on the existence and characteristics of the clinical syndrome of pelvic girdle pain during or after pregnancy. This syndrome refers to a musculoskeletal type of persistent pain localised at the anterior and/or posterior aspect of the pelvic ring. The pain may radiate across the hip joint and the thigh bones. The symptoms may begin either during the first trimester of pregnancy, at labour or even during the postpartum period. The physiological processes characterising this clinical entity remain obscure. In this review, the definition and epidemiology, as well as a proposed diagnostic algorithm and treatment options, are presented. Ongoing research is desirable to establish clear management strategies that are based on the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the escalation of the syndrome's symptoms to a fraction of the population of pregnant women.

3.4 Pregnancy‐Related Complications

Among the 111 participants, 32% (n = 36) reported symphysis pubis dysfunction and 26% (n = 29) reported severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (hyperemesis gravidarum). Other complications included chronic daily headaches (29%, n = 32), while 14% noted an improvement in pre‐existing headaches. Additionally, 31% (n = 34) reported other pregnancy‐related complications, including preeclampsia (10%, n = 11), gestational hypertension (2%, n = 2), gestational diabetes mellitus (5%, n = 5) and preterm premature rupture of membranes (2%, n = 2).

A significant association was identified between hyperemesis gravidarum and worsening FND symptoms: Women who reported hyperemesis gravidarum during the first pregnancy (28%, n = 15) were much more likely to report worsening FND than those without hyperemesis gravidarum (n = 39, 72%): They were more likely to report FND symptoms worsening during labour (83% vs. 32%, p = 0.01) and in the postpartum period (62% vs. 21%, p = 0.04).

Additionally, a trend towards significance was observed between daily headaches and worsening FND symptoms in the third trimester of the first pregnancy (11 out of 17 women with daily headaches worsened (65%, p = 0.05)). A significant association was also noted between daily headaches and worsening symptoms in the first trimester of the second pregnancy (5 out of 7 women with daily headaches reported worsening (71%, p = 0.01)). No significant associations were found for third pregnancies.

3.5 Mental Health During Pregnancy

Thirty‐eight women (34%) reported being seen by a mental health professional during pregnancy or within 3 months postpartum. Of these, over half (55%, n = 21) sought care for a pre‐existing mental health condition and 17 (45%) were treated for newly developed symptoms. The most common diagnoses were anxiety disorder (19%, n = 21), depression (16%, n = 18) and PTSD (9%, n = 10).

### A systematic review of randomised controlled trials on the effectiveness of exercise programs on lumbo pelvic pain among postnatal women [^113Smu44]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Changes in physical mobility was reported by Mens et al. using radiographic examination to assess mobility of the pubic symphysis on left and right lower extremities at 8 weeks after the intervention. Although there was an overall improvement in physical mobility among participants at 8 weeks of intervention compared to baseline, there was no statistically significant difference between the experimental and comparison groups. Another study reported marked improvement in mobility dependence among the experimental group compared to control group after following core stabilisation exercises and postural correction.

Changes in physical endurance was reported based on physical examinations and tests such as Sorensen Test and Active Straight Leg Raising (ASLR) test and muscle function test. Stuge et al. used Sorensen Test and ASLR test at the time of entry, within one week after intervention and one year after delivery and found improvements in physical endurance with statistically significant differences between the groups in favour of the intervention. Gutke et al. found significant difference between the intervention and control groups for the mean hip extension remaining at 3-month follow up. Within-group comparisons in the same study also showed improvements in both groups in several global muscles, but not in the pelvic floor muscles at 3- and 6-months follow up compared to baseline.

### Pelvic pain during pregnancy: a descriptive study of signs and symptoms of 870 patients in primary care [^113vLo6M]. Spine (2004). Low credibility.

Study Design

The authors conducted a cross-sectional analysis.

Objective

The objective of this study was to describe the signs and symptoms of pregnant women with pain and dysfunction in the pelvic area.

Summary Of Background Data

Pelvic pain during pregnancy is common with incidence rates of 48% to 56%. The exact cause of pelvic pain during pregnancy is still unclear. Also unclear is the association between physical examination and the occurrence of pelvic pain during pregnancy.

Methods

Pregnant women with pelvic pain were sent for treatment to 2 physical therapy practices between January 1997 and January 2002. A standardized clinical examination protocol and an extensive questionnaire were used to obtain relevant clinical and demographic characteristics.

Results

In total, 870 women were included. The average score of the overall severity of the complaints was 7.8 (scale 0–15). Main complaints were located around the sacroiliac joints (76.6%) and the pubic symphysis (57.2%). The area of pain was not related to positive signs in passive hip movements and sacroiliac tests. The highest positive test results were found for Patrick sign (71.7%), active straight leg raise (ASLR) test (66.4%), resisted adduction (54.4%), and passive hip abduction (36.9%). Overall severity of complaints was related to age, number of weeks pregnant, passive hip flexion and internal rotation, and swimming. The total explained variance of these factors was 15.9%. No relationship was found between overall complaints and sacroiliac tests, pelvic pain during a previous pregnancy, extremely painful or type of previous deliveries.

Conclusions

Pregnant patients with pelvic pain show a considerable level of complaints. The overall severity of complaints is not related to previous peripartum pelvic pain or type of deliveries or to commonly used tests. Further study on the role of clinical examination, including passive flexion and internal rotation of the hip joints, is recommended.

Materials and Methods

Data Acquisition and Retrieval Strategy

The search for publications related to pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPGP) was conducted using the Web of Science (WoS) repository. On January 18, 2023, the search strategy was executed by LLX and YCL. WoS, a widely recognized repository, was chosen for its comprehensive coverage of scholarly literature.

The specified search terms included variations of "pelvic girdle pain", "PGP", "symphysis pubis dysfunction", "SPD", "pelvic Instability", "pelvic Joint Instability", "pregnancy-related pelvic pain", "sacroiliac joint dysfunction", "pregnancy pelvic pain", "low back pain" along with relevant terms like "postpartum period", "after delivery", "after childbirth", "pregnancy", "gestation", "maternity". The search encompassed the extensive WoS Core Collection, including SCI-EXPANDED, with no language restrictions applied. Within the WoS Core Collection, we specifically included SCI-EXPANDED, which stands for Science Citation Index Expanded. SCI-EXPANDED is a citation index within the Web of Science that covers a wide range of scientific disciplines, including life sciences, physical sciences, health sciences, and more. It includes a vast collection of high-impact journals and provides valuable citation information for the articles indexed. Importantly, there were no language limitations imposed during the search, ensuring inclusivity of relevant literature regardless of the language of publication. Articles were identified from January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2022, based on the relevance of titles and abstracts to the study's focus on PPGP.

Inclusion criteria comprised articles addressing pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPGP), available in the English language, and conducted between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2022. Exclusion criteria included articles unrelated to PPGP, publications in languages other than English, and studies conducted outside the specified time frame. Subsequently, full-text screening was conducted to assess eligibility according to the established criteria. In cases of duplicate identification, only the most relevant and complete version of the publication was retained to eliminate redundant data.

Any discrepancies or uncertainties were resolved through team discussion. Ultimately, articles, including prospective studies and reviews, were retrieved and subjected to analysis. For the detailed search strategy, please refer to. The seach process is shown in Figure 1.

### Severe separation of the pubic symphysis and prompt orthopedic surgical intervention [^112UPzFS]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of pubic symphysis separation during delivery is 1 in 300 to 1 in 30,000 pregnancies, and it can cause a variety of problems such as pain, bladder dysfunction, and difficulty ambulating. There is no consensus on how to treat pregnancy-related pubic symphyseal separation.

Case

A patient, gravida 1 para 1, who underwent vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery was found to have a severe vaginal sidewall laceration and a 6.2-cm symphyseal disruption. The patient was treated with external fixation of an open book pelvis and physical therapy. She was discharged to home on postpartum day 4, voiding spontaneously and ambulatory with a walker.

Conclusion

Aggressive treatment of severe pubic symphysis separation with external fixation resulted in early ability to ambulate, void, and care for self and baby.

### Adherence, tolerance and effectiveness of two different pelvic support belts as a treatment for pregnancy-related symphyseal pain-a pilot randomized trial [^117KZpLQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Randomization

Using a computer-generated random number table and block sizes of 4 (produced by MS and concealed in sealed opaque envelopes, sequentially numbered), participants were assigned in a 1:1 allocation to either flexible or rigid belt. Following assessment and enrolment into the study, NF drew and opened the next sequentially numbered envelope and then communicated with SW about which belt each participant would be using.

Intervention: Women were randomized to three weeks wear of either a wide, flexible neoprene support belt (Smiley Belt, Havelock North, New Zealand; NZD $58.00) or a thinner, more rigid belt made of nylon webbing with foam lining (LC symphysis pubis belt, The Orthotic Center New Zealand Limited, Greenlane, Auckland, New Zealand; NZD $21.30). Participants were shown by a physiotherapist (SW) how to wear the belt, aligned over the pubic symphysis (the so-called 'low position', Figure 2) and were advised to wear it whenever possible during waking hours.

Figure 2
The two types of pelvic support belts trialed in this study. (a) Wider, more flexible "Smiley" belt made of neoprene material (Smiley Belt, Havelock North, New Zealand. (b) Thinner, more rigid belt made of nylon webbing and lined with foam (LC symphysis pubis belt, The Orthotic Center New Zealand Limited, Greenlane, Auckland, New Zealand). Both belts were worn in the "low" position over the level of the pubic symphysis. Specific consent was given by the woman pictured, for these photographs to be published in this article.

Women were sent automated standardized daily text messages and asked to respond on the number of hours the belt had been worn, whether pain had decreased (yes/no/sometimes) and if functional activities were easier to perform (yes/no/sometimes). Responses to daily text messages were recorded. Weekly phone interviews were conducted (NF) to complete the PSFS and determine adherence (frequency and duration of use) and tolerance (comfort) of the belt.

### Gait in pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain: amplitudes, timing, and coordination of horizontal trunk rotations [^115dfuss]. European Spine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Evidence is growing that Pregnancy-related Pelvic girdle Pain (PPP) is a distinct clinical entity, the exact causes of which still remain unknown. Total prevalence of PPP during pregnancy has been estimated at 22.5%, with 10% of patients having mild symptoms only, 10% deserving at least some medical attention, and 2.5% having serious pain and/or disability.

Women with PPP suffer from deep gluteal pain, pain during provocation tests, and pain in a variety of locations that often change over time in the individual patient. There is strong evidence that strenuous work, previous low back pain, and previous PPP are risk factors for the emergence of PPP, which appears to suggest a causal role for mechanical trauma (or microtraumata), quite possibly related to the loosening of the connective tissues by the pregnancy hormone relaxin. Indeed, several structural abnormalities have been observed, e.g. vertical displacement of a pubic bone ("symphyseal step") was reported while patients were standing on one leg, and laxity of the sacroiliac joints appeared to be asymmetric, probably related to painful tension in the long dorsal ligaments. Still, in different patients, and in the same patient at different times, different structures appear to be involved, and the aetiology of PPP is probably multifactorial.

Management

Because of the large heterogeneity of the published studies and the inconsistent quality of the reviewed articles (ranging from large, randomised, controlled trials to uncontrolled case series and case reports), no strong comparative evidence regarding the utilised methods of treatment is possible. Management of the PPGP syndrome as reported during the past few decades involves a variety of clinicians and specialities, as well as a combined interdisciplinary approach.

Before labour, the available options for its management are limited by the presence and the potential hazards to the foetus. Also, the majority of symptomatic patients appear to recover gradually after the first few months postdelivery. For these reasons, a proposed algorithm of management should differentiate between pre- and postpartum cases (Figure 2). Bed rest and symptomatic care appear to be the mainstay of PPGP therapy, at least at its initial stages. Water gymnastics and pelvic tilt exercises, with avoidance of maladaptive movements, as well as acupuncture and physical fitness exercises at early pregnancy have been identified as beneficial on the basis of the level of reported pain and have been associated with a decrease of the sick leave taken by prepartum patients.

(C) Radiological confirmation (anteroposterior, inlet and outlet views) of healing of all fusion sites 7 months postoperatively. The patient mobilized independently, experienced significant pain relief and returned to work.

Regarding the cases that remain symptomatic postdelivery, it has been shown that treatment based on specific stabilising exercises offers significant advantages over pain management, functional recovery and generalised health-related quality of life and physical status. Individually tailored, supervised physical therapy is reported to be more effective than general back and/or pelvic pain therapies.

### Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPP), I: terminology, clinical presentation, and prevalence [^113Vp6hh]. European Spine Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain has puzzled medicine for a long time. The present systematic review focuses on terminology, clinical presentation, and prevalence. Numerous terms are used, as if they indicated one and the same entity. We propose "pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPP)", and "pregnancy-related low back pain (PLBP)", present evidence that the two add up to "lumbopelvic pain", and show that they are distinct entities (although underlying mechanisms may be similar). Average pain intensity during pregnancy is 50 mm on a visual analogue scale; postpartum, pain is less. During pregnancy, serious pain occurs in about 25%, and severe disability in about 8% of patients. After pregnancy, problems are serious in about 7%. The mechanisms behind disabilities remain unclear, and constitute an important research priority. Changes in muscle activity, unusual perceptions of the leg when moving it, and altered motor coordination were observed but remain poorly understood. Published prevalence for PPP and/or PLBP varies widely. Quantitative analysis was used to explain the differences. Overall, about 45% of all pregnant women and 25% of all women postpartum suffer from PPP and/or PLBP. These values decrease by about 20% if one excludes mild complaints. Strenuous work, previous low back pain, and previous PPP and/or PLBP are risk factors, and the inclusion/exclusion of high-risk subgroups influences prevalence. Of all patients, about one-half have PPP, one-third PLBP, and one-sixth both conditions combined. Overall, the literature reveals that PPP deserves serious attention from the clinical and research communities, at all times and in all countries.

Risk factors for PPGP examined in more than one study

Eleven physical and three socio-demographic potential risk factors were examined in more than one study (Table 3). Findings are also provided in extended tabular format in additional file 2.

Table 3
Risk factor for PPGP examined in more than one study

A history of low back pain was a risk factor for PGS and for PPGP. Low back pain and pelvic girdle pain in previous pregnancies were also positively associated with PPGP. Women with an older age of menarche were at increased risk of PGS and PPGP. Nine studies examined parity as risk factor and all but two studies found that parous women were more likely to have PPGP. Eight studies examined the relationship between smoking and PPGP and findings were conflicting with most studies finding no statistically significant association. Eight studies examined Body Mass Index (BMI) as a risk factor, with conflicting results. The relationship between pre-pregnancy weight and PPGP was conflicting but it was positively associated with PGS (n = 1880; AOR 1.03; p < 0.05) and symphysiolysis ("pain at the symphysis pubis") (n = 1771; AOR 1.04; p < 0.05); however, only three studies examined this factor. Two studies (n = 2224; n = 1149) found that maternal height was not a risk factor (p > 0.05). The evidence concerning the association between PPGP and the weight of the newborn was conflicting.

### Management of pelvic injuries in pregnancy [^115r5rJ4]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Pelvic fractures in pregnant women are usually high-energy injuries associated with risk of mortality to both mother and fetus. The mother's life always takes priority in the acute setting as it offers the best chance of survival to both the mother and the fetus. Indications for operative intervention of acute pubic symphysis rupture depend on presence of an open disruption, amount of displacement, and degree of disability. Chronic symphyseal instability related to pregnancy is a challenging problem and the first line of treatment is nonoperative care. A previous pelvic fracture is not a contraindication by itself to vaginal delivery.

### Postpartum pubic symphysis diastasis resulting in a prepubic abscess and osteomyelitis [^114u82Ad]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Postpartum pubic symphysis diastasis (PSD) refers to an abnormal widening of the pubic symphysis after delivery. It is a rare and underdiagnosed condition that causes severe pain and can be complicated by osteomyelitis and abscess formation. This article reports a case of a para 4 woman in her 30s with postpartum PSD after vaginal delivery who presented with a prepubic abscess. Multimodal treatment consisted of incision and drainage, physiotherapy and prolonged antibiotic treatment.

### Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain: an update [^112J3WDT]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Presentation, classification and diagnosis

PPGP, as defined previously, has been associated with pain (stabbing, dull, shooting, burning) located at the general area of pelvic girdle, either posteriorly close to the sacroiliac joints and extending to the gluteal area or anteriorly to the vicinity of the symphysis pubis. It may radiate to the groin, perineum or posterior thigh, lacking a typical nerve root distribution. A precise localisation of the pain is often impossible and may also change during the course of the pregnancy.

Current classification systems of PPGP are based on pain localisation. They include five subtypes: (1) type 1 or "pelvic girdle syndrome", comprising symptoms of anterior and posterior pelvic girdle, symphysis pubis and bilateral sacroiliac joints; (2) type 2 or "double-sided sacroiliac syndrome", comprising symptoms of the posterior pelvic girdle and bilateral sacroiliac joints; (3) type 3 or "single-sided sacroiliac syndrome", comprising symptoms of the posterior pelvic girdle and unilateral sacroiliac joint; (4) type 4 or "symphysiolysis", comprising symptoms of the anterior pelvic girdle and pubic symphysis; and (5) type 5 or "miscellaneous", comprising inconsistent findings of the pelvic girdle.

### Interventions for preventing and treating low-back and pelvic pain during pregnancy [^115jc56N]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

More than two-thirds of pregnant women experience low-back pain and almost one-fifth experience pelvic pain. The two conditions may occur separately or together (low-back and pelvic pain) and typically increase with advancing pregnancy, interfering with work, daily activities and sleep.

Objectives

To update the evidence assessing the effects of any intervention used to prevent and treat low-back pain, pelvic pain or both during pregnancy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth (to 19 January 2015), and the Cochrane Back Review Groups' (to 19 January 2015) Trials Registers, identified relevant studies and reviews and checked their reference lists.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any treatment, or combination of treatments, to prevent or reduce the incidence or severity of low-back pain, pelvic pain or both, related functional disability, sick leave and adverse effects during pregnancy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.

Main Results

We included 34 RCTs examining 5121 pregnant women, aged 16 to 45 years and, when reported, from 12 to 38 weeks' gestation. Fifteen RCTs examined women with low-back pain (participants = 1847); six examined pelvic pain (participants = 889); and 13 examined women with both low-back and pelvic pain (participants = 2385). Two studies also investigated low-back pain prevention and four, low-back and pelvic pain prevention. Diagnoses ranged from self-reported symptoms to clinicians' interpretation of specific tests. All interventions were added to usual prenatal care and, unless noted, were compared with usual prenatal care. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low, raising concerns about the confidence we could put in the estimates of effect. For low-back painResults from meta-analyses provided low-quality evidence (study design limitations, inconsistency) that any land-based exercise significantly reduced pain (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.03 to -0.25; participants = 645; studies = seven) and functional disability (SMD -0.56; 95% CI -0.89 to -0.23; participants = 146; studies = two). Low-quality evidence (study design limitations, imprecision) also suggested no significant differences in the number of women reporting low-back pain between group exercise, added to information about managing pain, versus usual prenatal care (risk ratio (RR) 0.97; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.17; participants = 374; studies = two). For pelvic painResults from a meta-analysis provided low-quality evidence (study design limitations, imprecision) of no significant difference in the number of women reporting pelvic pain between group exercise, added to information about managing pain, and usual prenatal care (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23; participants = 374; studies = two). For low-back and pelvic painResults from meta-analyses provided moderate-quality evidence (study design limitations) that: an eight- to 12-week exercise program reduced the number of women who reported low-back and pelvic pain (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.97; participants = 1176; studies = four); land-based exercise, in a variety of formats, significantly reduced low-back and pelvic pain-related sick leave (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94; participants = 1062; studies = two). The results from a number of individual studies, incorporating various other interventions, could not be pooled due to clinical heterogeneity. There was moderate-quality evidence (study design limitations or imprecision) from individual studies suggesting that osteomanipulative therapy significantly reduced low-back pain and functional disability, and acupuncture or craniosacral therapy improved pelvic pain more than usual prenatal care. Evidence from individual studies was largely of low quality (study design limitations, imprecision), and suggested that pain and functional disability, but not sick leave, were significantly reduced following a multi-modal intervention (manual therapy, exercise and education) for low-back and pelvic pain. When reported, adverse effects were minor and transient.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low-quality evidence that exercise (any exercise on land or in water), may reduce pregnancy-related low-back pain and moderate- to low-quality evidence suggesting that any exercise improves functional disability and reduces sick leave more than usual prenatal care. Evidence from single studies suggests that acupuncture or craniosacral therapy improves pregnancy-related pelvic pain, and osteomanipulative therapy or a multi-modal intervention (manual therapy, exercise and education) may also be of benefit. Clinical heterogeneity precluded pooling of results in many cases. Statistical heterogeneity was substantial in all but three meta-analyses, which did not improve following sensitivity analyses. Publication bias and selective reporting cannot be ruled out. Further evidence is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect and change the estimates. Studies would benefit from the introduction of an agreed classification system that can be used to categorise women according to their presenting symptoms, so that treatment can be tailored accordingly.

### Rupture of the symphysis pubis during vaginal delivery followed by two subsequent uneventful pregnancies [^111Q2N6D]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Rupture of the symphysis pubis during vaginal delivery is a rare but debilitating complication. Factors contributing to rupture are poorly defined.

Case

A healthy primigravida suffered a rupture of her symphysis pubis during an otherwise uncomplicated vaginal delivery. She experienced significant pain and difficulty walking for 6 months after the injury. Her 5-cm symphyseal separation was managed successfully with physical therapy and activity restriction. The patient's two subsequent deliveries (one vaginal and one via cesarean delivery) were uneventful.

Conclusion

Severe symphyseal rupture during vaginal delivery can be managed without surgery. Risk factors for rupture are not well defined. Based on a literature review, there is a significant risk of repeat symphyseal rupture with subsequent vaginal delivery.

### Prolonged abdominal pregnancy incidentally discovered during cesarean section: a case report [^1135cdM5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal problems such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, subocclusion,
Abdominal and pelvic pain coinciding with fetal movements accompanied by or without metrorrhagia,
Anaemia with poor overall health condition.
A foetus in a superficial position, often in an atypical, high transverse position, was observed.
A second pelvic mass corresponding to the enlarged but empty uterus was palpable.
During vaginal examination, the cervix was often found to be fixed under the pubic symphysis, and it was hard and long.
Sometimes, the presentation was complicated by the onset of various symptoms such as internal or external bleeding, anaemia, jaundice, oliguria, or a toxic-infectious syndrome.

Some of these signs were present in our patient.

Although the obstetric follow-up was conducted by a midwife, her presumptive signs were overlooked. It is important not to overlook the possibility of other serious causes, such as pancreatic cancer, despite this symptomatology. Pancreatic cancer is uncommon during pregnancy, but it can be severe and typically presents with symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, weight loss and jaundice.

### Diagnosing osteitis pubis: a case report and review… [^1116bdiM]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Osteitis pubis is a disorder of the pubic symphysis. Andrews and Carek describe a case report and review the features and diagnosis of this disorder. The differential diagnosis of pain in the pubic symphysis includes muscle strain, prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, fracture and osteitis pubis. Other causes include ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter syndrome, urolithiasis and hyperparathyroidism. Osteitis pubis was first described in 1924 by a urologist who noted the condition in patients who had undergone suprapubic surgery. It has subsequently been diagnosed in athletes and in patients who have had urologic or gynecologic surgery. There is some speculation that osteitis pubis may be caused by trauma or infection. However, radiographic evidence does not indicate avulsion or other trauma to the pubis.

Some patients describe localized pain about one month after surgery, and these patients may be found to have infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus. In some cases of infection the leukocyte count is normal, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is only slightly increased and blood cultures are negative. Bone biopsy may be required to determine the organism involved. Usually, osteitis pubis is considered to be an inflammatory condition. It is self-limited and occurs more often in men who are in their 20s or 30s. It may cause pain localized to the pubic, groin or abdominal areas. The patient may experience pain with activity. This pain may occur in the perineal, testicular, suprapubic or inguinal areas. Patients may also experience postejaculatory scrotal or perineal pain. Range of motion may be decreased in one or both hips. Plain films of the pubis may be normal or may show sclerosis and irregular cortical margins.

Radionuclide studies will show unilateral uptake of the pubic symphysis. Osteitis pubis can be treated with rest, ice, physical therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. After the initial treatment, efforts should be made to strengthen hip flexors and pelvic muscles. It generally takes about three to six months for patients to resume a premorbid functioning level. Osteitis pubis recurs in approximately 25 percent of patients.

### Knowledge mapping analysis of research on pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPGP) from 2002 to 2022 using bibliometrics [^116j8sqF]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Moreover, due regard should be accorded to the safety aspects inherent in the implementation of all-encompassing therapeutic regimens. Improvement in patient pain and life status as well as treatment approach is a key factor affecting patient outcomes. Treatment options for PPGP include structured physical therapy, acupuncture, and exercise, all of which have a small body of evidence to support their efficacy, while acupuncture and exercise stabilization are effective complements to standard treatment for women with PPGP. As Ergonomics and Rehabilitation Medicine evolve, many new techniques are being developed, including the use of supportive devices, such as pelvic support belts, to relieve stress on the lower back, hips, and pelvis. The use of manual therapy techniques, such as manual pelvic mobilization and chiropractic care, to improve the function of the pelvic girdle and reduce pain and discomfort. The salience of exercise and physical therapy in the governance of PPGP lies in their instrumental function, replete with an unwavering focus on enhancing fortitude, equilibrium, and malleability within the confines of the pelvic girdle and lumbar realm. The use of pain management techniques, such as medication, acupuncture, and massage, to help alleviate symptoms of PPGP. One of the principal perils associated with movement therapeutics resides in the potential for modifications in intensity and exercise physiology to detrimentally exacerbate or instigate injury to the delicate pelvic floor muscles subsequent to childbirth. In turn, inherent damage of pelvic floor structure can be incorporated into factors limiting exercise, introducing a potential risk to the exercise therapy of PPGP. In contrast to exercise and standardized physiotherapy, acupuncture exhibits a diminished degree of riskand may be comparatively more secure. Nevertheless, our comprehension remains incomplete, necessitating further investigations to juxtapose the safety of individual PPGP physiotherapeutic interventions and their potential risk factors. A burgeoning acknowledgment of the significance surrounding the resolution of physical, psychological, and social determinants that may engender PPGP symptoms, and the development of multidisciplinary care models that bring together healthcare professionals from different specialties to provide comprehensive and integrated care. There is limited research available on the effectiveness of different treatments for PPGP, and further research is needed to better understand this condition and develop more effective treatment options.

### Transient osteoporosis of the hip in pregnancy: the orthopaedic management of bilateral neck of femur fractures in the third trimester [^113gbdiV]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

The incidence of bilateral neck of femur fractures in TOH of pregnancy is low. Although a handful of cases have been described in literature, to our knowledge only one other reports this pathology diagnosed antenatally. A recent case control study reported that of 52 patients with confirmed TOH in pregnancy, 12.1% presented with a fracture. The aetiology is unclear. Suggested risk factors include: previous trauma, viral infections, femoral venous stasis caused by pressure from the gravid uterus and complex regional pain syndrome. Both pelvic and hip pain are frequent complaints in the later stages of pregnancy, therefore rare pathologies such as TOH may be easily misdiagnosed. This hypothesis is supported by our case, as the patient presented twice with pelvic pain, which was dismissed as symphysis pubis dysfunction, prior to sustaining her fractures.

Brodell et al suggested that the benefit of radiographic imaging may outweigh potential risks in the third trimester of pregnancy. Furthermore, MRI is considered to be low risk at this gestation, and is a sensitive tool to distinguish TOH from other hip pathologies. As such, it should be considered the optimal investigation for persistent hip pain in the later stages of pregnancy and post partum. In this case, MRI was not conducted preoperatively, as safe delivery of the baby became the clinical priority. Fracture fixation was also carried out at this time, to reduce the risk associated with an additional general anaesthetic. Furthermore, within the confines of a District General Hospital that did not have access to 24 hours MRI facilities, delaying definitive intervention to conduct imaging was not in the best interests of mother or baby. Postoperatively, MRI was relatively contra-indicated due to implantation of new metalwork and the limited clinical information likely to be gained after reaming of the femoral neck and head to insert the DHS.

### Adherence, tolerance and effectiveness of two different pelvic support belts as a treatment for pregnancy-related symphyseal pain-a pilot randomized trial [^112EvuQS]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The results of the current pilot study suggest that in general, pelvic support belts may have the potential to reduce pain and improve function in pregnant women with pubic symphyseal pain and that the flexible belt may be more effective and more comfortable. A larger study would be needed to definitively confirm these findings and to assess the potential benefits of pelvic support belts alongside other therapeutic interventions such as exercise regimens.

### Osteomyelitis of the pubic symphysis in pregnancy [^1178YNiL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Pubic symphysis osteomyelitis during the antepartum period of pregnancy is rare.

Case

We report a patient in the third trimester who presented with pubic pain, low-grade fever, and altered gait. She was found to have a retropubic abscess at the time of cesarean delivery. Radiologic imaging showed findings consistent with osteomyelitis of the pubic symphysis and multiple pus collections in the pelvis and labia. The patient was treated with surgical debridement of the affected bone and placement of antibiotic-impregnated beads.

Conclusion

Osteomyelitis of the pubic symphysis can have serious complications. The diagnosis should be considered in pregnant patients with clinical findings unusual for pubic symphysis diastases. It can be treated with antibiotic-impregnated beads.

Risk factors for PPGP in the third trimester of pregnancy examined in one study

Forty-two physical factors, nine psychological factors and two socio-demographic potential risk factors for PPGP in the third trimester of pregnancy were examined in ten studies (Table 5). Findings are also provided in extended tabular format in additional file 3.

Table 5
Risk factor for PPGP in the third trimester examined in only one study

A history of postpartum low back pain, was positively associated with PPGP in the third trimester (n = 1164; OR 2.0 [1.4–2.8]; p = 0.0002). Women who had physically demanding work (4-point likert scale) were more likely to have PGS (n = 68,872; AOR 1.4 [1.4–1.5]; p < 0.001). A heavy or very heavy physical workload (n = 513; OR 1.9 [1.1–3.3]; p < 0.05) and a heavy or very heavy physical workload including lifting movements (n = 513; OR 1.9 [1.2–3.0]; p < 0.05) were also associated with an increased risk of symphysiolysis. Women with pubic symphysis pain reported higher pain (n = 268; AOR 35.5 [19.7–51.1]; p < 0.001) and disability (n = 268; AOR 11.8 [2.3–21.2]; p = 0.03) than women with posterior pain only, as did women with combined pubic symphysis and posterior PPGP (n = 268; AOR (pain) 16.5 [1.8–31.1]; p < 0.001). Kovacs et al. found women who had had instrument-assisted birth (n = 1164; OR 1.9 [1.4–2.6]; p < 0.0001) or epidural in previous birth (n = 1164; OR 1.5 [1.2–2]; p = 0.004) to be more likely to have PPGP. Disability in early pregnancy was a predictor of PPGP-related disability in the third trimester (n = 268; AOR 0.5 [0.3–0.6]; p < 0.001). Albert et al. found that a history of back trauma was positively associated (n = 2224; AOR 2.8; p < 0.001) with all subgroups of PPGP except symphysiolysis (n = 1771; p > 0.05).

### Low back pain and pelvic girdle pain in pregnancy [^114XCnKo]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Pregnancy has a profound effect on the human body, particularly the musculoskeletal system. Hormonal changes cause ligamentous joint laxity, weight gain, and a shift in the center of gravity that leads to lumbar spine hyperlordosis and anterior tilting of the pelvis. In addition, vascular changes may lead to compromised metabolic supply in the low back. The most common musculoskeletal complaints in pregnancy are low back pain and/or pelvic girdle pain. They can be diagnosed and differentiated from each other by history taking, clinical examination, provocative test maneuvers, and imaging. Management ranges from conservative and pharmacologic measures to surgical treatment. Depending on the situation, and given the unique challenges pregnancy places on the human body and the special consideration that must be given to the fetus, an orthopaedic surgeon and the obstetrician may have to develop a plan of care together regarding labor and delivery or when surgical interventions are indicated.

Results

We identified 5090 records from database searches. After duplicate removal, 3899 records were screened by title, 390 records by abstract, and 261 by full-text, of which 24 records met the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1). A total of 1077 records were identified from ClinicalTrials.gov one of which was eligible for inclusion but was a duplicate. Studies excluded at full text are listed by reason for exclusion in Additional file 5.

Fig. 1
Flow chart of search results and study selection

Five of the 24 included studies involved the same cohort, but because different risk factors were examined and reported in the publications, they were all included in the review. The characteristics of the 24 included studies are presented in Table 2. Twelve prospective cohort studies, three retrospective studies and nine cross-sectional studies, published between 1995 and 2015 in Norway (n = 13), Sweden (n = 3), Denmark (n = 2), Japan (n = 1), Israel (n = 1), United Kingdom (n = 2), Brazil (n = 1) and Spain (n = 1), were included. All but one study included both nulliparous and multiparous women, and only one study reported results separately for first-time mothers. Eight of the 24 records examined the outcomes of low back pain or lumbopelvic pain during pregnancy in addition to PPGP outcomes, but only PPGP data were included as per review scope. Participants of 20 included studies completed self-reported questionnaires, three studies collected data from medical records and one study conducted structured interviews with women. Three studies also included a physical examination to assess for PPGP. Seven studies examined the outcome Pelvic Girdle Syndrome (PGS), which is considered a subgroup of PPGP, defined as experiencing pain in the symphysis pubis and both sacro-iliac joints. Seven studies examined pain at the anterior pelvic girdle as outcome, using the terms symphysiolysis, symphysis pubis dysfunction or pubis pain. Due to these differing inclusion criteria, methods of study, and stages of pregnancy or postpartum, few studies could be identified that would be suitable for meta-analysis in a future systematic review. As these occur, they are noted, and results on all other factors are presented in narrative format.

Postpartum pudendal pain

Complaint of pain, pressure or discomfort referred to pubic symphysis, labia majora and minora, inferior third of the vagina, urethral meatus, anus, perianal area, lower third of the rectum and buttock (possible inflammation or entrapment of the pudendal nerve and involving its dermatome) during the postpartum period and up to 12 months after delivery (NEW).

Postpartum pubic pain

Complaint of pain in the symphysis pubic area during the postpartum period and up to 12 months after delivery (NEW).

Postpartum coccygeal pain

Complaint of pain, pressure or discomfort felt in the coccygeal region during the postpartum period and up to 12 months after delivery (NEW).

Postpartum pelvic joint, ligament or bone pain

Complaint of joint and/or bony pain described at level of pelvic and perineal area during the postpartum period and up to 12 months after delivery (NEW).

Obstetric pelvic girdle syndrome

A symptom syndrome which involves pain in all three pelvic joints or unilateral/bilateral sacroiliac joint pain, which may also occur before or after childbirth (NEW).

Footnotes for Section Symptoms

1.1: Symptoms are generally worse in situations when gravity might make the prolapse worse (e.g. after long periods of standing or exercise) and better when gravity is not a factor e.g. lying supine. Symptoms may also be more noticeable at times of abdominal straining e.g. defecation or bearing down. Straining is a different manoeuvre to Valsalva and results in different effects on pelvic floor activity and pelvic organ descent. It has been proposed that Valsalva and straining have different PFM activation patterns. The pelvic floor is stiffer with Valsalva resulting in better bladder neck (BN) support whereas straining leads to more puborectalis and bladder neck descent.

### Postpartum septic symphysitis, a rare condition with possible long-term consequences: a cohort study with long-term follow-up [^111Wvqua]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis

In the literature, several conditions causing pain around the symphysis have been described. Inflammatory conditions such as osteitis pubis and postpartum pubic symphysis diastasis must be distinguished from infectious complications such as PPSS. Some conditions similar to PPSS are osteomyelitis of the pubic symphysis, septic arthritis of the symphysis (also called pubic osteomyelitis, osteomyelitis of the pubic bone or pubic symphysis), and rare orthopaedic infections, accounting for less than 1–2% of all haematogenous osteomyelitis. In a review of 100 cases, only two cases of septic arthritis of the pubic symphysis appeared after delivery. Septic arthritis has been described in a fractured pubic bone. The diagnosis of septic arthritis requires a bone scan or radiological signs of engagement of the pubic bone, i.e. oedema or irregular indentations of the adjacent joint surfaces, which are not observed in the very acute phase.

Septic symphysitis has been reported to be related to female incontinence surgery, pelvic surgery, pelvic malignancies, intravenous drug use, trauma, cardiac catheterization, and impaired venous circulation in the pubic vein. The most common pathogens responsible for septic symphysitis are S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and S. mitis.

Initially, it might be difficult to distinguish PPSS from PGP, a pregnancy-related condition present in 20% of pregnant women worldwide. PGP is mainly located between the posterior iliac crest and the gluteal fold, particularly in the vicinity of the sacroiliac joints, separately or in conjunction with pain in the symphysis. PGP most often starts during the second trimester of pregnancy but can also begin after delivery and may persist for a long time thereafter. Other differential diagnoses include neurological damage caused by delivery, resulting in pain and disability during the postpartum period; diastasis symphysis pubis, a non-infectious separation of the symphysic joint; pelvic haematoma or abscess; genitourinary injuries; and insufficiency fractures. Another condition is puerperal endometritis, characterized by pelvic pain, uterine or parametrial tenderness, maternal tachycardia, foul smelling lochia and elevated leucocyte count (≥ 109 g/L).

### Incidence of four syndromes of pregnancy-related pelvic joint pain [^114SRFsg]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

A prospective epidemiologic cohort study.

Objective

To determine the incidence of clearly defined pelvic joint pain in pregnancy based on both history and objective confirmation and to classify pelvic joint pain into four groups and determine their incidence.

Summary and Background Data

Pelvic and low back pain in pregnancy is a substantial problem, and the correct treatment is hampered by several factors, such as the lack of clearly defined clinical conditions, variety of nomenclature, and great variance in reported incidence (range 4–76.4%). This variation in incidence is a problem that calls for a clearly defined criteria and a study design aimed at resolving such varying incidence rates.

Methods

All pregnant women booked for delivery at two Danish hospitals over a 1-year period were offered to participate in the study in week 33 of gestation. Women who reported daily pain from pelvic joints, which could be objectively confirmed, were divided, according to symptoms, into five subgroups: four classification groups (pelvic girdle syndrome, symphysiolysis, one-sided sacroiliac syndrome, and double-sided sacroiliac syndrome) and one miscellaneous. A total of 1460 women formed the incidence cohort based on geographic criteria.

Results

A total of 293 women (20.1%) were found to have pelvic joint pain divided in one of the four classification groups: pelvic girdle syndrome 6.0%, symphysiolysis 2.3%, one-sided sacroiliac syndrome 5.5%, and double-sided sacroiliac syndrome 6.3%.

Conclusion

This study proposes new, more precise procedures for the identification and classification of pregnancy-related pelvic joint pain based on both reports from the women and a physical examination. Presumably, the 20.1% incidence rate, identified in the present study, represents the most precise and reliable information available hitherto, regarding the incidence of pregnancy-related pelvic joint pain.

### Pubic symphysis diastasis with urinary incontinence: collaborative surgical management [^111ZAMTf]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Pubic symphysis diastasis during obstetric delivery occurs rarely. Symptoms usually respond to conservative management. A nulliparous 39-year-old delivered spontaneously with an audible pop noted. Pubic symphysis diastasis of 4.6 cm was diagnosed on pelvic X-ray. She developed severe pain with ambulation and stress urinary incontinence. After neither of these symptoms improved significantly in response to conservative management, the patient underwent open reduction internal fixation with plating of her pubic symphysis, and bladder neck sling placement using autologous rectus fascia. Postoperatively she experienced urinary retention, which resolved with continuous bladder drainage for 1 week. Both her urinary incontinence and pain resolved, and she had resumed normal activities 3 months following her surgery. Pubic symphysis diastasis is a rare obstetric complication with a paucity of literature to guide its management. A coordinated multidisciplinary approach to management is necessary when multiple organ systems are involved.

### Risk factors for pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain: a scoping review [^114sCQsS]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pregnancy-related Pelvic Girdle Pain (PPGP) is a common complaint. The aetiology remains unclear and reports on risk factors for PPGP provide conflicting accounts. The aim of this scoping review was to map the body of literature on risk factors for experiencing PPGP.

Methods

We searched the databases PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, MIDIRS, and ClinicalTrial.gov (3 August 2020). We selected studies with two reviewers independently. Observational studies assessing risk factors for PPGP were included. Studies examining specific diagnostic tests or interventions were excluded.

Results

We identified 5090 records from databases and 1077 from ClinicalTrial.gov. Twenty-four records met the inclusion criteria. A total of 148 factors were examined of which only 14 factors were examined in more than one study. Factors that were positively associated with PPGP included a history of low back or pelvic girdle pain, being overweight/obese, already having a child, younger age, lower educational level, no pre-pregnancy exercise, physically demanding work, previous back trauma/disease, progestin-intrauterine device use, stress, depression and anxiety.

Conclusions

A large number of factors have been examined as potential risk factors for PPGP, but there is a lack of repetition to be able to draw stronger conclusions and pool studies in systematic reviews. Factors that have been examined in more than five studies include age, body mass index, parity and smoking. We suggest a systematic review be conducted to assess the role of these factors further in the development of PPGP.

### The association between pelvic girdle pain and sick leave during pregnancy; a retrospective study of a Norwegian population [^115NFQbJ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pelvic girdle pain (PGP) in pregnancy is an unclear and poorly understood condition. There is no official acknowledged nomenclature, hence an abundance of different terminologies have been used in studies to describe it. The European guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of PGP describe the localization of pain as"… experienced between the posterior iliac crest and the gluteal fold, particularly in the vicinity of the sacroiliac joints (SIJ). The pain may radiate in the posterior thigh and can also occur in conjunction with/or separately in the symphysis".

The incidence of pain in the pelvic girdle region in pregnancy ranges from 4 to 76% depending on the definition, the utilised diagnostic means, and the design of the studies. One review study concludes that approximately 45% of all pregnant women suffer from lumbopelvic pain in pregnancy, and approximately 20% of these have isolated PGP.

PGP accounts for 37–72% of sick-leave in pregnancy and length of the sick leave had been found to be 12–15 weeks on average. Other pregnancy complications may also occur in women with PGP, leading to sick leave. However, women with a high degree of self-reported PGP have longer sick-leave duration than others, and these pain symptoms were in one study reported to bring about 80% of sick leaves during pregnancy. The authors argued that this makes PGP during pregnancy a major public health issue.

Several risk factors for developing PGP during pregnancy have been identified, such as work load, previous PGP, and previous trauma to the pelvis. PGP during pregnancy also has negative effects on activities of daily living (ADL). On average, these women do not experience continuous PGP, but activities of daily living such as walking, standing, sitting, lying down, or changing positions may become painful after some time. There is commonly a difficulty in walking fast or over long distances. Disabling problems among women with lumbopelvic pain during pregnancy range from 21 to 81% (median 28%). A moderate to high Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) in women with pelvic pain during pregnancy has been identified as a risk factor for persistent PGP 3–6 months after birth.

### The lived experience among Somali women of giving birth in Sweden: an interpretive phenomenological study [^1153TrC2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Something naturally becomes unknown and complicated

Nausea, vomiting and symphysis pubis dysfunction made the Somali women experience the pregnancy as strenuous. These symptoms affected their daily lives and were something they did not expect. There was a conception that the birth giving should be the most troublesome situation, and instead the women perceived the pregnancy to be that. The women could not enjoy their pregnancy and feel happiness about it as they expected. Some of the women had to stay at the hospital, receiving infusions. These experiences during pregnancy were presented as shocking and the situation was out of control. That the HPCs were encouraging and informed them that they were "positively ill": some symptoms related to the pregnancy-not to a disease, was something that the woman appreciated afterwards. This information made the new phenomenon understandable to them.

"Yes, the birth giving was supposed to be hard… that's the picture I had,

because if you compare it with pregnancy, I had no idea… I had not thought.

about it" (SW4).

Certain illness conditions, such as diabetes and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, were unknown to the women. The normal course of pregnancy and birth giving were thereby changed and were experienced as dramatic and strenuous by the women.

Birth giving was also experienced as taking longer than expected; staying at the hospital many hours before the child was delivered caused strain and was strenuous. It was a positive surprise that the birth giving was less painful than expected.

After-pains and bleeding a lot for a long time after birth giving were also unexpected experiences for these women.

### Risk factors for pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain: a scoping review [^114HdnMi]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pelvic girdle pain has been described as pain experienced between the posterior iliac crest (inferior to L5) and the inferior gluteal folds, particularly near the sacroiliac joints, and pain may radiate in the posterior thigh and can occur in conjunction with or separate from pain in the symphysis (pp797). Women commonly experience pelvic girdle pain during pregnancy, with reported prevalence of Pregnancy-related Pelvic Girdle Pain (PPGP) ranging from 23 to 65% depending on the study methods used. Women with PPGP often have impaired mobility, with 7 to 12.5% having to use crutches or a wheelchair. PPGP symptoms affect their ability to cope with everyday life for which they feel unprepared and which they feel is not acknowledged. PPGP is also a leading cause of sick leave during pregnancy.

The aetiology of PPGP remains uncertain but hormonal and mechanical factors have been suggested. Regarding hormonal factors, the main focus has been on the hormone relaxin, which is thought to increase pelvic laxity, yet evidence from clinical studies examining the association between relaxin and PPGP is of low quality with inconsistent results. Biomechanically, there is moderate evidence that PPGP is associated with altered motor control, kinetic and kinematic parameters. Knowledge of risk factors for PPGP can guide the development of preventative and management strategies, and can then lead to development of predictive models. Existing narrative reviews, guidelines, background sections of primary studies and patient information vary widely in what they report as risk factors for PPGP and often seem conflicting when compared. In their paper on the clinical presentation of PPGP, Wu et al. included a structured review on risk factors and interpreted evidence as strong, weak, conflicting, or no evidence based on the number of studies, but numerous studies have been published since then.

### Elucidating the cause of pelvic pain [^1112bm2d]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain is a common condition. Establishing a diagnosis can be complicated by the interplay between various organ systems, including urologic, gynecologic, gastrointestinal, neurologic, endocrinological, psychological, and musculoskeletal. Frequently, the patient will have seen multiple providers and undergone multiple tests, as well as invasive procedures, before the musculoskeletal system is even considered in the differential diagnosis. Typically, the musculoskeletal and nervous systems become suspected culprits only once all other potential etiologies have been eliminated.

### Uterine incarceration: a rare diagnosis in non-pregnant women [^111sGX6U]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Background

Uterine incarceration (UI) is a rare complication that occurs when the uterus becomes trapped between the sacral hollow and the pubic symphysis. Patients present with non-specific symptoms, mainly with lower abdominal pain, constipation, urinary frequency, retention or incontinence.UI is mostly recognised as an obstetric complication, described in 1:3000 pregnancies. However, there are only a few case reports in the literature regarding UI in non-pregnant women and the incidence of UI in this population is unknown. We thereby present a rare acute presentation of an incarcerated uterus in a non-pregnant woman and discuss management options.

### Chronic pelvic pain [^1147BJFD]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

As opposed to the satisfying solutions found in the management of acute pain, chronic pelvic pain can be a vexing problem for the patient and physician. Seldom is a single source or cause found, and nearly always the condition is influenced by the broader social and psychological context of the patient. In this article, we discuss the evaluation of chronic pelvic pain, often considering pain as the disease itself, and identify peripheral generators, which gynecologists can address to help reduce their contributions to symptoms.

### Is pregnancy related pelvic girdle pain associated with altered kinematic, kinetic and motor control of the pelvis? A systematic review [^115wHLwV]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the level of evidence for altered mechanical and motor control of the pelvis being associated with pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPGP).

Methods

This systematic review was undertaken by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Six different databases were used for the electronic search. Observational cohorts, cross sectional or case-control studies focused on the association between altered kinematic/kinetic and motor control of the pelvis and PPGP during pregnancy were included. Study selection was conducted by two reviewers who firstly screened for titles, then for abstracts and finally for full articles. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale and the guidelines proposed by the Cochrane back review group were used to assess risk of bias and quality of evidence, respectively.

Results

354 references were identified, and after excluding unwanted articles, 10 studies met the final inclusion criteria. Studies not related to motor control or pelvic mobility were the main reason for exclusion. Seven studies were case-control and three were prospective cohort studies. Seven studies were ranked as high while three were ranked as low quality. Among the high quality studies, six found association between PPGP and altered motor control and mobility of the pelvis.

Conclusions

The level of evidence for an association between PPGP and altered motor control and kinematic or kinetic parameters of the pelvis was found to be moderate.

### "Struggling with daily life and enduring pain": a qualitative study of the experiences of pregnant women living with pelvic girdle pain [^112mYp9M]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Pelvic girdle pain (PGP) during pregnancy is a prevalent condition affecting approximately half of all pregnant women and for 25 to 30% of pregnant women the condition becomes severe. PGP's aetiology is still unknown and the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated although mechanical, traumatic, hormonal, metabolic, and degenerative factors have been proposed. Women who have previously experienced PGP during pregnancy experience a relapse during a subsequent pregnancy in 85 to 95% of cases, making this pregnancy-related complication a significant condition during pregnancy. Also, a significant number of women suffer from PGP after pregnancy European guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of the condition are published in 2008. However, despite the condition affecting a large number of pregnancies, inconsistencies regarding definition as well as treatment of PGP still prevail.

### Imaging of pelvic pain in the first trimester of pregnancy [^114EuLAF]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Pelvic pain during the first trimester of pregnancy can pose a challenge to the clinician. The noninvasive nature, safety, and reliability of ultrasonography make it the diagnostic method of choice for pregnant patients who have pelvic pain. Sonography provides information that allows for diagnosis of both pregnancy-related pain, such as a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, or threatened abortion; and may be useful in the diagnosis of pain unrelated to pregnancy, such as that seen in appendicitis and nephrolithiasis.

### Adherence, tolerance and effectiveness of two different pelvic support belts as a treatment for pregnancy-related symphyseal pain-a pilot randomized trial [^1143W9hu]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The effect of pelvic support belts for pregnancy-related low back pain and/or pelvic pain and more specifically, pubic symphyseal pain (PSP) has been previously investigated but little is known of comfort, and the frequency and length of time pregnant women are prepared to wear belts for. Our study provides novel pilot data indicating that the use of a pelvic belt may improve daily functional activity as assessed by the PSFS over a period of three weeks, and the use of a flexible belt could decrease pain (preceding 24 hours, VAS) more than a rigid belt (p = 0.049), but these findings remain to be confirmed in a larger randomized controlled trial with the inclusion of an appropriate control. On average, women with pregnancy-related PSP wore the belts for approximately 5 hours a day and found the wider, more flexible belt more comfortable than the rigid belt.

Combined data from both groups (flexible and rigid belt) showed an improvement in function (as assessed by the PSFS), and pain (as assessed by the VAS), supporting the carry-forward of pelvic belts for future investigation. This is similar to improvements documented in a previously published randomized controlled trial, observing the effect of a support garment on low back pain and posterior pelvic pain in pregnant women. In the current study, PSFS scores decreased by 36% and 34% for the flexible and rigid belts, respectively, similar to the improvements documented by Depledge et al. (rigid, 30%; flexible, 25%). One of the difficulties in assessing the efficacy or effectiveness of pelvic support belts relates to the fact that they are rarely used in isolation, resulting in contamination of the findings by the additional variables of exercise and advice. In this study, all participants were given the same advice and there was no specific instruction to exercise. The flexible belt produced a mean 2.3-point difference and the rigid belt a mean 2.4-point difference over the intervention period. This change may be deemed to be clinically significant however, it must be confirmed in a larger sample.

### Risk factors for pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain: a scoping review [^111mUe3o]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

The high PPGP prevalence, the increase in published studies on PPGP and the conflicting information in narrative accounts presented a clear need for a scoping review to examine and provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on risk factors for PPGP. A scoping review is a form of knowledge synthesis that maps, summarises and synthesises the evidence on a certain topic. Scoping reviews may also be conducted to determine the value and scope of a full systematic review. Preliminary searches identified a potentially large number of risk factors examined. Hence, a scoping review was perfectly placed for a thorough exploration of the literature to inform future systematic reviews. The aim of this scoping review was thus to map the body of literature on risk factors for experiencing PPGP and to identify research gaps.

### Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain and its relationship with relaxin levels during pregnancy: a systematic review [^114JyoxR]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The present systematic review assessed the level of evidence for the association between relaxin levels and pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPGP) during pregnancy.

Methods

PRISMA guidelines were followed to conduct this systematic review. Electronic search was carried out using six different databases. Observational cohorts, cross-sectional or case-control studies focused on the association between relaxin levels and PPGP during pregnancy were included. Studies selection was conducted by two reviewers who screened firstly for titles, then for abstracts and finally for full articles. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and the quality of evidence by the guidelines proposed by the Cochrane back review group.

Results

731 references were identified. Six articles met the inclusion criteria and were considered for this systematic review. The main reason for the studies exclusion was PPGP related to gynaecological reasons. Five studies were case-control and one study was a prospective cohort. Four studies were ranked as high while two were ranked as low quality. Among the high quality studies, three found no association between PPGP and relaxin levels.

Conclusions

Based on these findings, the level of evidence for the association between PPGP and relaxin levels was found to be low. PPGP assessment and controlling for risk factors were found to increase bias leaving uncertainty in interpretation of these findings and a need for further research.

### Synopsis of the 2023 U.S. department of VA and U.S. DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of pregnancy [^111fHm3Y]. Military Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Pelvic health (floor) rehabilitation — potential indications include pelvic pain with Dyspareunia, Vaginismus, Pelvic organ prolapse, Coccydynia, and Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain, with associated conditions such as Pregnancy-related sacroiliac joint pain, Athletic pubalgia, Sacroiliac pain, dysfunction, or both, Myofascial pain, and Pelvic fracture. Voiding dysfunction includes Incontinence (urinary, fecal, or both), Urgency (urinary, fecal, or both), Incomplete emptying, and Constipation, with related conditions including Obstructed urination or defecation (dysnergia), Bladder or bowel retention, and Overactive bladder. Additional potential indications include Diastasis rectus abdominus, Post-surgical pain, Costochondritis; and Facet arthropathy, Disc pathology, and Radiculopathy with Myofascial pain or Pain during or after pregnancy; and upper extremity presentations such as Carpal tunnel syndrome and Shoulder, hand, wrist, or elbow pain. Referral depends on local availability of rehabilitation resources and patient preference, and these routine orthopedic conditions can be managed by most physical therapy clinics because evaluation and treatment do not require an internal pelvic floor muscle assessment for initial management.

### Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain: an update [^116Jap3L]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The scientific and clinical implications of PPGP require the multidisciplinary interaction of a wide number of health-related specialties, including obstetrics and gynaecology, general medicine, orthopaedic surgery, physiotherapy, rheumatology and clinical psychiatry (Table 1). This important parameter is another strong factor that affects the discrepancy and fragmentation of the reported data between different journals and scientists not directly communicating with each other.

Lately, efforts to establish guidelines and accurate definitions of the manifestations of this clinical syndrome have been ongoing and offer the basis for further international research. Following the publication of the European Guidelines in 2005, the authors of 49 subsequent clinical studies incorporated, to a degree, the recommended methodology. In parallel, the patient community in the modern era of widespread interactive communications has launched a number of websites and forums focusing on the problem and seeking advice and guidance.

The aim of this minireview article is to present in a comprehensive manner the existing consensus regarding the diagnosis, management and prognosis of PPGP. The PubMed search engine was used to set a query on 20 January 2010 with the keywords "pelvic arthropathy" OR "osteitis pubis" OR "pelvic insufficiency" OR "pelvic pain" OR "pelvic instability" OR "pelvic girdle pain" OR "posterior pelvic pain" OR "low back pain" OR "lumbopelvic pain" OR "symphysis pubis dysfunction" in the title, as well as the term "pregnancy" in any of the search fields of the publications. Whenever additional studies were identified from the references of the retrieved publications, they were also included in this review. In total, 209 studies from 1923 to today are presented in this review according to the terminology that was used by the authors, the decade of publication and the origin of the research (Table 1). Further attention and value were given to those of the 209 studies that represent the highest level of evidence, derived their conclusions from large samples (> 30 cases), and took into account contemporary definitions and diagnostic and treatment methodologies. These studies are the ones mostly commented on and presented in this article, as well as in the proposed algorithm of patient management (Figure 1).

### Interventions for preventing and treating pelvic and back pain in pregnancy [^113cqn3X]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

More than two-thirds of pregnant women experience low-back pain (LBP) and almost one-fifth experience pelvic pain. Pain increases with advancing pregnancy and interferes with work, daily activities and sleep.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for preventing and treating pelvic and back pain in pregnancy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (18 July 2012), identified related studies and reviews from the Cochrane Back Review Group search strategy to July 2012, and checked reference lists from identified reviews and studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any treatment to prevent or reduce the incidence or severity of pelvic or back pain in pregnancy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Quality of the evidence for outcomes was assessed using the five criteria outlined by the GRADE Working Group.

Main Results

We included 26 randomised trials examining 4093 pregnant women in this updated review. Eleven trials examined LBP (N = 1312), four examined pelvic pain (N = 661), and 11 trials examined lumbo-pelvic (LBP and pelvic) pain (N = 2120). Diagnoses ranged from self-reported symptoms to the results of specific tests. All interventions were added to usual prenatal care and unless noted, were compared to usual prenatal care. For LBP, there was low-quality evidence that in general, the addition of exercise significantly reduced pain (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.07 to -0.53; six RCTs, N = 543), and disability (SMD -0.56; 95% CI -0.89 to -0.23; two RCTs, N = 146); and water-based exercise significantly reduced LBP-related sick leave (risk ratio (RR) 0.40; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.92; one RCT, N = 241). Low-quality evidence from single trials suggested no significant difference in pain or function between two types of pelvic support belt, between osteopathic manipulation (OMT) and usual care or sham ultrasound (sham US). Very low-quality evidence suggested that a specially-designed pillow may relieve night pain better than a regular pillow. For pelvic pain, there was moderate-quality evidence that acupuncture significantly reduced evening pain better than exercise; both were better than usual care. Low-quality evidence from single trials suggested that adding a rigid belt to exercise improved average pain but not function; acupuncture was significantly better than sham acupuncture for improving evening pain and function, but not average pain; and evening pain relief was the same following either deep or superficial acupuncture. For lumbo-pelvic pain, there was moderate-quality evidence that an eight- to 20-week exercise program reduced the risk of women reporting lumbo-pelvic pain (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.00; four RCTs, N = 1344); but a 16- to 20-week training program was no more successful than usual care at preventing pelvic pain (one RCT, N = 257). Low-quality evidence suggested that exercise significantly reduced lumbo-pelvic-related sick leave (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94, two RCTs, N = 1062), and improved function. Low-quality evidence from single trials suggested that OMT significantly reduced pain and improved function; either a multi-modal intervention that included manual therapy, exercise and education (MOM) or usual care significantly reduced disability, but only MOM improved pain and physical function; acupuncture improved pain and function more than usual care or physiotherapy; pain and function improved more when acupuncture was started at 26- rather than 20- weeks' gestation; and auricular (ear) acupuncture significantly improved these outcomes more than sham acupuncture. When reported, adverse events were minor and transient.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-quality evidence suggested that acupuncture or exercise, tailored to the stage of pregnancy, significantly reduced evening pelvic pain or lumbo-pelvic pain more than usual care alone, acupuncture was significantly more effective than exercise for reducing evening pelvic pain, and a 16- to 20-week training program was no more successful than usual prenatal care at preventing pelvic or LBP. Low-quality evidence suggested that exercise significantly reduced pain and disability from LBP. There was low-quality evidence from single trials for other outcomes because of high risk of bias and sparse data; clinical heterogeneity precluded pooling. Publication bias and selective reporting cannot be ruled out. Physiotherapy, OMT, acupuncture, a multi-modal intervention, or the addition of a rigid pelvic belt to exercise seemed to relieve pelvic or back pain more than usual care alone. Acupuncture was more effective than physiotherapy at relieving evening lumbo-pelvic pain and disability and improving pain and function when it was started at 26- rather than 20-weeks' gestation, although the effects were small. There was no significant difference in LBP and function for different support belts, exercise, neuro emotional technique or spinal manipulation (SMT), or in evening pelvic pain between deep and superficial acupuncture. Very low-quality evidence suggested a specially-designed pillow may reduce night-time LBP. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect and is likely to change the estimates. Future research would benefit from the introduction of an agreed classification system that can be used to categorise women according to presenting symptoms.

### Risk factors for pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain: a scoping review [^114jS34p]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

We searched five electronic databases (3 August 2020) including PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and MIDIRS with no time filters used. We also searched ClinicalTrial.gov (3 August 2020) for relevant registered studies. Only studies reported in English were included, but no language filter was applied to assess publication bias. We inspected reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. The full search strategy is presented in Additional file 1.

Two review authors (FW, DD) independently reviewed all citations by title and by abstract. Where there was a lack of consensus, citations were moved to full-text selection. Any disagreement at full-text selection was resolved by discussion, and if necessary, involving a third reviewer. The selection criteria are presented in Table 1. Data were extracted independently by FW and DD using a piloted review-specific data extraction sheet. Data extracted included the year and country of publication, study design, setting, inclusion and exclusion criteria, number and characteristics of participants, the exposure and outcome measure(s) and how these were assessed, the number of participants with/without a certain exposure and outcome, and the risk estimates. Consensus was sought and, in addition, 25% of data were rechecked. Findings were summarised narratively and we have provided an overview of all factors examined in the literature in Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6. To map the existing literature on risk factors for PPGP, findings were grouped by trimester of pregnancy (first, second, third or any trimester/trimester not specified), by type of factor (physical, psychological, socio-demographic), and by whether they were examined in more than one study or not.

### Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy-association with pelvic girdle pain during pregnancy and 4–6 months post-partum [^1146k8U8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Q2 included a food frequency questionnaire and was answered in mid-pregnancy. Version two of Q2 included detailed questions regarding nausea and vomiting, therefore only women answering this version were included in the sample. While the questions regarding NVP and PGP in Q1 were structured simply as 'yes/no' for the corresponding 4 week intervals in early first trimester, the NVP questions in Q2 probed experiences of nausea or vomiting during pregnancy (yes or no), the gestational week of onset and cessation, and whether women were still experiencing nausea and/or vomiting at the time of answering the questionnaire (around gestational week 20). These NP and NVP answers were cross-checked with answers provided in Q1 to avoid inconsistent responses, as detailed in the 'Study Sample' section below. Prior to calculating the duration of either nausea or vomiting from variables stating the gestational week of onset and the week of cessation of these conditions, recoding for some variables was required, as described in detail previously.

Data from Q3 (gestational week 30) enabled us to differentiate NVP women from women diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), defined as prolonged nausea and vomiting during pregnancy requiring hospitalisation before week 25 of gestation. Q3 also provided comprehensive information regarding pain distribution and pain intensity (none/mild/severe) in the pelvic girdle during pregnancy. We defined PGP as self-reported pain in both the pubic symphysis in the anterior pelvis and bilaterally in the sacroiliac joints in the posterior pelvis (yes or no). Severe PGP (sPGP) was defined as having reported severe pain in all the above pain locations. These conditions are referred to as PGP and sPGP, respectively. We also obtained responses regarding experiences of NP, NVP, and PGP from week 15 to week 29 or more of pregnancy (separated into 4 week intervals; yes or no). All 'yes/no' responses for NP, NVP, and PGP from Q1 and Q3 were cross-checked with identified cases based upon the more comprehensive definitions of NP, NVP, and PGP defined above.

### Adherence, tolerance and effectiveness of two different pelvic support belts as a treatment for pregnancy-related symphyseal pain-a pilot randomized trial [^111zaU1y]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Based on these data we would recommend the PSFS as the primary outcome measure for a larger trial, with the VAS (preceding 24 hours) as a secondary outcome. A 2.3-point difference in PSFS observed in this study is a clinically important change. Based on these pilot data, an adequately powered randomized controlled clinical trial, assuming correlations between baseline and follow-up values of 0.5 or higher (based on the observed correlation in the present study of 0.61), would require approximately 50 participants in each arm with full data to have 80% power to detect a moderate (0.5 SD, equivalent to around a 2.3 difference in PSFS scores based on standard deviations from the current study) difference in PSFS scores, which we consider to be clinically important, using a two-sided test at the 0.05 level. The results of this pilot study support a larger-scale study to determine the functional effectiveness of flexible pelvic belts as a treatment for PSP symptoms.

### Osteomyelitis of the pubic symphysis after spontaneous vaginal delivery [^111FYFfN]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Osteomyelitis ossis pubis is a painful disorder. It is rare following a normal vaginal delivery. In two cases, the diagnosis was verified by an ultrasound-guided needle aspiration postpartum. Both recovered after treatment with relevant antibiotics. The condition is easily misinterpreted as one of more common disorders like pelvic girdle pain, inflammation, diastasis or distortion of the pubic symphysis joint. If not recognised and treated, the condition can have severe consequences.

Methods

Trial design

This pilot study was an unblinded (participants and researchers), single-center, 2-arm, randomized (1:1), parallel-group study conducted in Dunedin, New Zealand. Ethical approval was granted by the New Zealand Upper South A Regional Ethics Committee (reference URA/11/05/012) and registered in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (#ACTRN12614000898651), registered 25th August, 2014.

Participants

Recruitment took place within the community in Dunedin, New Zealand by referral from Leading Maternity Carers (midwives) and advertisements placed in a local newspaper. Women were eligible to take part in the study if they were pregnant, at least 18 years of age, had experienced pubic symphyseal pain for at least two weeks (which was worse than any concurrent posterior pelvic pain), and had a positive response to at least two of three clinical tests: reproduction of pain from palpation, modified Trendelenburg's test, active straight leg raise test (as described in Additional file 1). Women with a known high-risk pregnancy, a history of major systemic bone disease and/or back or pelvic injury, a medical condition which contraindicated the use of a pelvic support belt (e.g. certain types of placenta previa), or those currently taking steroid medication were excluded. Figure 1 shows a flow diagram of the recruitment process.

Flow diagram showing the study recruitment process.

Assessment

After obtaining informed, written consent, participants completed a standardized baseline questionnaire (Additional file 2) which included pain history, a 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to quantify pain intensity over the preceding 24 hours and the preceding week, and the Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (MODQ) to determine the influence of symphyseal pain on activities of daily living. The Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) was then completed in conjunction with the assessing physiotherapist (SW). Participants were tested for joint hypermobility using the nine-point Beighton Hypermobility Score (adapted from) in which hypermobility was defined as a score of ≥ 4 points.

### Reliability of transversus abdominis thickness and inter-recti distance during forced expiration with limb adduction in primiparous women following vaginal delivery [^116aL1q6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

During pregnancy, women experience significant physical, hormonal, and biomechanical changes that can notably affect maternal health. The abdominal wall undergoes substantial stretching, and the inter-recti distance (IRD) increases, contributing to a reduction in trunk flexor strength and increased tendency for abdominal muscle fatigue. This fatigue is characterized by a diminished ability of the abdominal muscles to sustain or repeat contractions effectively, likely due to impaired force transmission across the abdominal wall caused by the separation of the rectus abdominis muscles.

This alteration, along with hormonal changes during pregnancy, such as increased levels of relaxin and progesterone, which affect the elasticity and stability of pelvic connective tissues, predisposes women to potential postural imbalances and disorders in the lumbar spine (such as lower back pain), pain in the sacroiliac joint or in the pubic symphysis and pelvis instability. These conditions are commonly observed in postpartum women, although these associations are still a subject of debate in the literature.

Pregnancy and vaginal delivery are natural physiological processes that, although not pathological, may lead to certain changes, including pelvic floor dysfunctions (PFD), including urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, chronic pelvic pain, or sexual dysfunction. However, pre-existing conditions, such as herniated nucleus pulposus or sciatica, may favor the development or exacerbation of these complications during or after pregnancy. These conditions can often diminish a woman's quality of life. While the direct relationship between increased IRD and PFD in the early postpartum period remains unclear, IRD has been discussed as a potential factor for various postpartum complications, including dissatisfaction with physical appearance and even postpartum depression. The abdominal muscles also undergo morphological and functional changes during and after pregnancy, particularly in the first six months postpartum. The transversus abdominis (TrA) plays a critical role in maintaining trunk stability, contributing to lumbopelvic alignment, and modulating intra-abdominal pressure. Several studies have shown that engaging in global trunk stability exercises positively influences postpartum health by reducing pain and enhancing quality of life. Practices such as Pilates and hypopressive exercises are beneficial for activating deep abdominal muscles, though more targeted strength and stability exercises have proven to be even more effective in restoring abdominal and pelvic floor function, especially when performed during pregnancy and the first year postpartum.

### Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy-association with pelvic girdle pain during pregnancy and 4–6 months post-partum [^116bCdE2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea alone (NP) or nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) affect approximately 80% of pregnancies. Symptoms usually emerge early in the first trimester, around gestational weeks 5–6, peaking around week 9, and subsiding by approximately gestational week 12 or later. Women with a young age, previous deliveries, those overweight or obese, with an early menarche, with premenstrual symptoms, and non-smokers have been associated with symptoms of NP or NVP. In addition, women who experienced symptoms in previous pregnancies seem more susceptible to NP or NVP in following pregnancies.

Pelvic girdle pain (PGP) is a pregnancy-related complication in which women have pain located between the posterior iliac crest and the gluteal fold, particularly close to the sacroiliac joints and the pubic symphysis. The prevalence is estimated at 20%, however some researchers have reported higher prevalence values. The onset of symptoms occur from approximately week 6 of the pregnancy, and reach peak pain intensity between the 24th and 36th week of pregnancy. In previous studies, approximately 10% of women with PGP during pregnancy continued to experience pain up to 18 months after delivery. Known risk factors for PGP are smoking during pregnancy, a high BMI, young maternal age, previous pregnancies, and early menarche.

We recently reported that women with NP and NVP had increased odds for experiencing PGP compared with symptom-free (SF) women. The NP/NVP and PGP conditions share similar risk factors, occur in the first trimester (particularly NP/NVP), and have unknown aetiologies. The current literature suggests that pregnancy hormones are one of the most likely causes of NVP, with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) as the main candidate, although estrogen, progesterone and relaxin have also been discussed. Likewise, PGP aetiology has been linked previously to ovarian hormone levels, since these hormones may influence ligament laxity of the pelvic joints and lead to pain. As so little is understood about NP, NVP and PGP, an investigation of women with both of these conditions may reveal common traits that will provide a better understanding of their nature.

As we have already reported upon the association between NP/NVP and PGP during pregnancy, the aim of the present study was to focus upon women experiencing both NP/NVP and PGP during pregnancy, paying particular attention to the timing of onset for either condition, as well as to investigate PGP prevalence 4–6 months post-partum.

### Knowledge mapping analysis of research on pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPGP) from 2002 to 2022 using bibliometrics [^1149d5WD]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Research Hotspots and Future Trends

As exemplified in Table 5, PPGP encompasses a diverse array of research domains, converging to form a rich biopsychosocial medical paradigm predominantly centered around the field of epidemiology. The prevalence of Pregnancy-related Pelvic Girdle Pain (PPGP) varies greatly, ranging from 4% to 84%, due to the differences in definitions, diagnostic methods, and research designs. The main cause of this large variation is the lack of a standardized PPGP classification index and differing measurement methods, with some studies relying solely on self-reported measures and others incorporating clinical evaluations such as physical exams and imaging tests. After reviewing the literature, Vleeming et al found that the prevalence of PPGP during pregnancy was close to 20%, which provides strong evidence. However, there are notable geographical differences in the incidence and severity of PPGP, with most studies being conducted in Europe (Figure 3). It is important for all regions of the world to pay attention to PPGP research and establish standardized guidelines to reach a consensus on its prevalence.

Numerous factors have been discerned to bear an intimate association with PPGP, encompassing laborious occupational tasks (characterized by repeated torso torsions and flexions within each passing hour), a prior medical history of low back pain, pelvic belt discomfort, previous pelvic injury, and psychological anguish. Other factors, such as smoking during pregnancy, early menarche, body mass index, birth order, age, exercise level, work experience, job satisfaction, education level, and separation of the rectus abdominis, have shown conflicting results in the literature. Family history of PPGP has also been found to increase the risk, with women with a mother or sister who experienced lumbar and pelvic pain during pregnancy being at an increased risk. More recent studies have suggested that nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, sitting breastfeeding posture, and cesarean delivery may also increase the risk of postpartum PGP, but further research is needed. It is important to also consider the impact of maternal functional activities when studying the risk factors of PPGP.

### Burden of pelvic girdle pain during pregnancy among women attending ante-natal clinic, Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study [^116px9Gp]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Definitions

PPGP was defined as 'recurrent pain' or continuous pain' for at least a week between the posterior iliac crest and gluteal folds, particularly in the vicinity of the sacroiliac joints with/without pubic symphysis pain during the current pregnancy. A pregnant woman was considered to be suffering from PPGP if she responded "yes" to the specific question regarding localization of pain, which also included identifying the region on a flashcard shown during the interview.

Physical activity: Was categorized as 'Yes' or No based on the response to three questions: 1) Do you exercise regularly now? 2) If you exercise regularly, how many days a week do you exercise? 3) If you exercise regularly, how many minutes a day, on average, do you exercise? For question no, 1 the response alternatives were 'yes' or 'no' and for question no 2 the respondent has to fill the number of days/week and for question no 3 the respondent had to fill the average minutes of exercising per day. A respondent is defined to be physically active based on ACOG recommendations (1. 'yes', 2. ≥ 3 days, 3. ≥ 20 min).

Self-rated health: The pregnant women were asked to self-rate their health status now and before pregnancy. A '5'category responses were used to differentiate the responses arranged from very good through poor.

### Self efficacy associated with regression from pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain and low back pain following pregnancy [^111uYSg2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Pain assessment

Pregnancy-related back pain was measured using a self-reported numeric rating scale from 0 as " No pain " to 10 as the " Worst possible pain " through an interview (or telephone call, if patient could attend the hospital in person) at two-time points: Time point 1 (T1): in the morning during the third trimester before delivery; Time point 2 (T2): in the morning 6 months after delivery.

Orthopedic testing

During the period of pregnancy and 6 months postnatally, all the women who experienced back pain would be referred to a multidisciplinary team, which included an obstetrician, orthopedist, and physiotherapist. Participants were tested each time they came in for their antenatal appointments (12–14 scheduled appoints throughout the duration of the pregnancy).

Pregnancy-related LBP was determined as continuous or recurrent dull pain for more than 1 week from the lumbar spine, which starts early in pregnancy. Pregnancy-related LBP was characterized as pain above the sacrum, in the lumbar spine, decreased range of motion, tenderness in the erector spine muscle, and a negative result on the posterior pelvic pain provocation test (4P test). Pregnancy-related PGP is experienced between the posterior iliac crest and the gluteal fold, particularly in the vicinity of the sacroiliac joints. The pain may radiate in the posterior thigh and can also occur in conjunction with/or separately in the symphysis. The diagnosis of PGP can be reached after exclusion of lumbar causes. The pain or functional disturbances in relation to PGP must be reproducible by positive results on the 4P test.

Based on the results and discomfort level, individualized treatment plans were developled and included education regarding anatomy and kinesiology, back-strengthening exercises, reducing physical activity, avoiding overloading the pelvis, physiotherapy, manipulation, yoga training, and/or acupuncture.

No regression from pregnancy-related LBP or PGP is defined as a recurrent or persistent pain score ≥ 3 over a week around 6 months postpartum, as the previous research has shown that pregnancy-related back pain significantly improves by this time point. At 6-months following delivery, participants were asked to report to the outpatient clinic for clinical examination involving lumbar spine range of motion, palpation of lumbar paraspinal muscles, and 4P test by an experienced doctor. A flowchart about when each measure was performed is shown in Fig. 1.

### Imaging for acute pelvic pain in pregnancy [^111hPLe9]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Bowel obstruction

In the gravid patient, ultrasound is the first choice in the evaluation of bowel conditions other than appendicitis. Bowel obstruction in pregnancy is fairly uncommon (1 per 2,500 to 1 per 3,500 pregnancies). It is usually due to adhesions (60–70%), less commonly due to volvulus (≈25%). In long-standing or high-grade obstruction, ultrasound may show dilated loops of bowel with fluid levels and aperistalsis, but depiction of the point or cause of bowel obstruction usually remains undetermined. Magnetic resonance studies for bowel obstruction, performed with the use of multiplanar T2-weighted singleshot fast spin-echo (SSFSE) imaging, do not have extensive validation, but can accurately depict the site of small bowel obstruction in approximately 70% of cases.

Infectious diseases

Osteomyelitis in pregnancy is rare and represents a serious threat to the mother and especially to the good outcome of the foetus.

Depending upon the location and degree of disease the patient presents with pubic or back pain, low-grade fever and altered gait, the inflammatory markers are altered in the laboratory tests.

The gold standard for diagnosis is represented by tissue culture and histopathological examination; it is also possible to identify the specific pathogen responsible and set an appropriate treatment.

MRI is currently considered to have the highest sensitivity and specificity of imaging modalities for detecting acute haematogenous osteomyelitis and is able to identify soft-tissue/joint complications.

On MRI, an alteration of the normal marrow signal intensity is valuable; the oedema and exudates appear as defined low-signal intensity areas on the T1-weighted images and a high signal on T2-weighted and STIR images with diffusion restriction.

On MRI, a sequestrum is seen as a low signal intensity structure on T1-weighted and STIR sequences, whereas the surrounding granulation tissue has intermediate to low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity with STIR or T2-weighted sequences (Fig. 10).

Fig. 10
A 35-year-old woman presents with pubic pain, fever and elevated inflammatory markers. Coronal T2–weighted HASTE image (a) and T2–weighted STIR image (b) show fluid collection (arrow) at the level of the symphisis pubic bone with hyperintensity of the pubic bone (short arrow). Contrast T1-weighted image shows the presence of a thick vascularised wall indicative of an abscess with a small abscess at the level of left pubic bone (short arrow). These findings are in agreement with osteomyelitis

### Adherence, tolerance and effectiveness of two different pelvic support belts as a treatment for pregnancy-related symphyseal pain-a pilot randomized trial [^117AtPnD]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Our result showing a reduction in pain for the flexible pelvic belt intervention (preceding 24 hours, VAS) compared to the rigid belt in our preliminary sample is promising in terms of symptomatic management of pregnancy-related PSP. The magnitude of this reduction (40%) is likely to be clinically significant and for a woman with typical baseline scores for pain in the study (overall mean 56.9), this would represent a 0.9 standard deviation relative decrease in the flexible belt group compared to the rigid belt group, greater than the 0.8 standard deviations often regarded as a "large" effect. Furthermore, the women preferred the flexible type of belt to the rigid belt in terms of comfort. The mechanism of this benefit is uncertain. The use of ankle strapping has been shown to improve foot position awareness and may help to prevent ankle sprains in athletes. The same proprioceptive mechanisms may be influencing behavior in individuals with PSP; the presence of an external device (in this case, a pelvic support belt) potentially makes individuals more aware of their activity and consequently modifies behavior to minimize or avoid pain.

Although differences within- or between-group mean values for MODQ were not statistically significant, the noted improvements may still be of clinical significance. Fourteen individuals improved their scores by week 3 and three were unchanged. Four individuals changed from "moderate" to "minimal disability" and two from "severe" to "moderate disability". Further investigation of MODQ as an outcome measure for PSP interventions is therefore warranted in a larger study to obtain more precise estimates of its effect.

The duration that women wore the belts for was highly variable, and the average daily use of five hours was less than anticipated. Depledge et al. recorded 6.5 and 6.1 hours a day for the rigid and flexible belts, respectively. A possible explanation of the low mean daily use may relate to the intermittent nature of PSP symptoms and a tendency for women to wear belts only if they had pain. Our data do not provide an insight into whether the belts were only utilized in response to pain or were worn as a prophylactic measure. We recommended that participants wore the pelvic support belt for as long as they were comfortable, but prescribed no specific duration since there are no existing guidelines on duration of belt use and efficacy. The high proportion of participants that responded to text-messaging suggests that this modality of communication may be a reliable method of self-monitoring when compared to daily self-report diaries.

### Burden of pelvic girdle pain during pregnancy among women attending ante-natal clinic, Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study [^115AijvN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

However, the prevalence of this study is higher than the studies conducted in Netherland (7.3%). This difference observed in the prevalence rate of PGP could be due to the difference in study design, gestational week, and the study participant's characteristics. The Netherland study was a longitudinal cohort study, reporting the prevalence, associated delivery-related and psychosocial factors, and consequences of self-reported pelvic girdle pain during and after pregnancy while the present study is a cross-sectional study.

The present study found that previous history of PGP and back pain has a significant association with the current pelvic girdle pain among pregnant women. The recurrence of PPGP with subsequent pregnancy, unknown risk factors, and lack of preventive measures are reported by several studies. The findings elsewhere also suggest that the relapse of PPGP is usually more prevalent, severe, and chronic, making PPGP a major public health problem and one of the significant maternal morbidity. Other studies, advocate the possible role of hormones like relaxin, progesterone on the pelvic girdle ligaments, and separation of the pubic symphysis. However, there is a lack of consensus in the association of these factors with PPGP. Moreover, potential factors like altered muscle mechanics, strenuous work, history of low back pain, ethnicity, and the number of previous pregnancies are reported to be strongly associated with PPGP. Predictably, having one or more children (multiple pregnancies) was found to be one of the significant predictors of PGP among pregnant women in this study and this finding is worrisome considering the higher (4.2 births per woman) fertility rate of Ethiopia. This finding is consistent with the study done in Australia and another cross-sectional study found that parity was significantly associated with PGP among pregnant women. The possible explanation might be, multiple pregnancies associated with altered musculoskeletal structures, degeneration, and repetitive stress of pelvic structures could result in chronicity and relapse of PGP. The absence of preventive measures, unknown aetiologies, and lack of specific interventions could also possibly result in high prevalence in this subgroup.

### Pelvic ring fracture management and subsequent pregnancy: a summary of current literature [^112xqycV]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

The incidence of pelvic ring injuriesis 34.3% per 100,000 capita. Women account for approximately 69.7% of these injuries, 23% of which occur in women of childbearing age. In this specific patient population, concern is raised about one's future reproductive capability and method of delivery. Hormonal changes in pregnancy alter the laxity and ligament mechanics essential for adaptability during gestation and later birth. The peptide hormone, relaxin, has a collagenolytic effect, resulting in pelvic girdle laxity that increases the mobility of the pubic symphysis and sacroiliac (SI) joints. Surgical fixation of the pelvic ring creates a theoretical risk of decreased pelvic ring mobility during vaginal birth. According to Cannada and Barr, pregnant women who previously sustained a pelvic ring injury are discouraged from a trial of labor from their obstetrician. This has resulted in increased cesarean rates in comparison with 31% as reported by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not clearly define their recommendations for mode of delivery after a pelvic fracture, but instead, cases were managed on a case-by-case basis with the obstetrician's preference. No studies have determined the ability of a female patient to have a vaginal delivery after undergoing pelvic fracture fixation. However, many obstetricians are generally unwilling to have their patients attempt a vaginal delivery in the setting of symphyseal or SI fixation. This concern may be an indication for implant removal in young female patients.

The orthopaedic surgeon can serve as a resource to obstetricians and their patients with a history of pelvic fractures regarding future pregnancies. A majority of the current literature available discusses pelvic fractures sustained during pregnancy and their subsequent management for the duration of gestation, although limited information is available on the long-term consequences of high-energy pelvic ring injuries that have undergone surgical or nonsurgical treatment regarding future pregnancy and vaginal delivery.

The goal of this systematic review was to address the following questions:
What is the overall incidence of a cesarean section in women of childbearing age after a pelvic fracture?
What is the incidence of a new cesarean section in women giving birth after a pelvic fracture?
What are the indications for a cesarean section after a pelvic fracture?
Is there any difference in the cesarean section rates after a pelvic fracture among women who underwent surgical fixation versus those who underwent nonsurgical treatment?

### Updates on evaluation and treatment of common complaints in pregnancy [^111asSzF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients experience many new and concerning symptoms during pregnancy and it is the role of the obstetric clinician to provide appropriate guidance, recommendations, and treatment options. Often times, these symptoms are related to hormonal and physiologic changes that occur and will resolve in the postpartum period. However, clinicians must be able to recognize more concerning pathologic symptoms that require further evaluation and treatment. This review provides updates on the evaluation and management of some of the common symptoms during pregnancy.

### European guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pelvic girdle pain [^115Xk85Q]. European Spine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

A guideline on pelvic girdle pain (PGP) was developed by "Working Group 4" within the framework of the COST ACTION B13 "Low back pain: guidelines for its management", issued by the European Commission, Research Directorate-General, Department of Policy, Coordination and Strategy. To ensure an evidence-based approach, three subgroups were formed to explore: (a) basic information, (b) diagnostics and epidemiology, and (c) therapeutical interventions. The progress of the subgroups was discussed at each meeting and the final report is based on group consensus. A grading system was used to denote the strength of the evidence, based on the AHCPR Guidelines (1994) and levels of evidence recommended in the method guidelines of the Cochrane Back Review group. It is concluded that PGP is a specific form of low back pain (LBP) that can occur separately or in conjunction with LBP. PGP generally arises in relation to pregnancy, trauma, arthritis and/or osteoarthritis. Uniform definitions are proposed for PGP as well as for joint stability. The point prevalence of pregnant women suffering from PGP is about 20%. Risk factors for developing PGP during pregnancy are most probably a history of previous LBP, and previous trauma to the pelvis. There is agreement that non risk factors are: contraceptive pills, time interval since last pregnancy, height, weight, smoking, and most probably age. PGP can be diagnosed by pain provocation tests (P4/thigh thrust, Patrick's Faber, Gaenslen's test, and modified Trendelenburg's test) and pain palpation tests (long dorsal ligament test and palpation of the symphysis). As a functional test, the active straight leg raise (ASLR) test is recommended. Mobility (palpation) tests, X-rays, CT, scintigraphy, diagnostic injections and diagnostic external pelvic fixation are not recommended. MRI may be used to exclude ankylosing spondylitis and in the case of positive red flags. The recommended treatment includes adequate information and reassurance of the patient, individualized exercises for pregnant women and an individualized multifactorial treatment program for other patients. We recommend medication (excluding pregnant women), if necessary, for pain relief. Recommendations are made for future research on PGP.

### Single-leg-stance (flamingo) radiographs to assess pelvic instability: how much motion is normal? [^116jKK6x]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pelvic instability is a relatively uncommon cause of pelvic and low-back pain. Patients present with feelings of instability and mechanical symptoms. Static radiographs are often inadequate to detect abnormal relative motion between the hemipelves consistent with chronic pelvic instability; dynamic views of the pelvis are required. We assessed the amount of physiologic motion present at the pubic symphysis in normal adult men and nulliparous and multiparous women with alternating-single-leg-stance radiographs.

Methods

Forty-five asymptomatic adult volunteers (fifteen in each group) were evaluated with a standing anteroposterior pelvic radiograph as well as with anteroposterior pelvic radiographs made with the subjects assuming both right and left single-leg stance. The subjects completed a questionnaire to determine their eligibility for participation in the study, and an examination was performed to exclude certain physical anomalies that might alter the radiographic findings.

Results

The mean total translation (and standard deviation) at the pubic symphysis, as measured by three blinded observers, was 1.4 ± 1.0, 1.6 ± 0.8, and 3.1 ± 1.5 mm for the men, nulliparous women, and multiparous women, respectively. With the numbers available, we found no significant difference between the translation in the men and that in the nulliparous women (p = 0.63). The multiparous women had significantly more translation than did either the nulliparous women (p = 0.002) or the men (p = 0.0005). There was a significant positive association between the number of pregnancies and the total translation (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

The use of anteroposterior pelvic radiographs made with the subject alternating between right and left single-leg stance demonstrated, with high interobserver reliability, that multiparous women had a significantly different physiologic range of pubic translation as compared with men and nulliparous women. The ranges of physiologic motion at the pubic symphysis measured on the single-leg-stance radiographs in this study can be used to identify pathologic amounts of motion at this site.

Clinical Relevance

This investigation suggests that up to 5 mm of physiologic motion can occur at the pubic symphysis in asymptomatic individuals, as demonstrated by alternating-single-leg-stance radiographs.

### Adherence, tolerance and effectiveness of two different pelvic support belts as a treatment for pregnancy-related symphyseal pain-a pilot randomized trial [^114wDsKb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Results

Recruitment took place in Dunedin, New Zealand from April 2011 to May 2012. Twenty participants were recruited, 10 of whom were randomized to wearing the flexible belt and 10 the rigid belt. All 20 participants were followed up at three weeks, with one participant not providing usable pain VAS scores in each group at follow-up. Three did not complete the phone interview in Week 4; two women had given birth and did not continue with the study and one woman was unable to be contacted. Baseline demographic data for the two belt groups and combined data for all participants are shown in Table 1 showing that the groups were comparable. No participants tested positive for joint hypermobility.

Table 1
Mean (SD) baseline demographic data for all participants

Abbreviations: SD standard deviation.

Patient Specific Functional Scale scores (primary outcome) were not significantly different between the groups at follow up when adjusting for baseline (mean difference for flexible belt compared to rigid belt: −0.1; 95% CI: −2.5 to 2.3; p = 0.94). However, pain VAS scores (preceding 24 hours) decreased in the flexible belt group compared to the rigid belt group (ratio of geometric means 0.6, 95% CI: 0.4 to 1.0, p = 0.049). Scores for the other two measures (VAS preceding week, MODQ) were not significantly different between the groups (both p ≥ 0.454) (Table 2).

### Knowledge mapping analysis of research on pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPGP) from 2002 to 2022 using bibliometrics [^112gKfn4]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

One of the prevailing musculoskeletal afflictions encountered during the gestational and postnatal periods is the insidious onset of pelvic girdle pain (PGP), alternatively known as pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPGP). This condition exerts its grip on a appreciable cohort of women, casting profound and enduring ramifications on their quality of life. In recent times, there has been an increase in research pertaining to PPGP, reflecting a recognition of the need to better understand the risk factors, predictors, and effective treatmentsfor this condition. A body of research refers to PPGP, which signifies pain or discomfort experienced within the pelvic region during both pregnancy and the postpartum period. The pain is usually felt between the gluteal sulcus and the posterior iliac spine, particularly near the sacroiliac joint (SIJ). Occasionally, the pain may radiate to the back of the thigh, either on its own or in combination with the joint. It can also affect the pubic symphysis, or the hip joint.PPGP can be experienced as a dull ache, sharp pain, or grinding sensation, and it can range from mild to severe and decreased tolerance for prolonged standing, sitting, or walking. Studies have shown that Women afflicted with pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain are predisposed to encountering states of despondency, apprehension, and perturbations in their sleep patterns, and are also at higher risk of having a caesarean delivery. This has led to an increased focus on preventing and alleviating pelvic discomfort during pregnancy.

### Persistent postpartum pain – A somatic and psychologic perfect storm [^111xgeWi]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The female reproductive system is evolutionary designed for pregnancy and childbirth. Despite the physiological nature of reproduction, pregnancy induces a myriad of changes in the body that are considered pathological under many other circumstances. For example, the cardiovascular, respiratory, hormonal, gastrointestinal and homeostatic adaptations of pregnancy share similar features with conditions such as liver failure or sepsis (eg, increased cardiac output (CO), decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR), increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and interstitial fluid retention). Some of the previous conditions cause somatic and/or visceral pain. Nerve compression can be caused by retained fluid in tight spaces resulting for example in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Anatomical realignments in the vertebral and thoraco-abdominal regions induce back pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), constipation, pubic symphyseal separation, amongst other conditions. These changes contribute to the symptoms of physical discomfort that are common during pregnancy, such as fatigue, nausea, cramping, back pain, and in some instances, they add to a preexisting pain in the same region. Parturition then further superimposes severe acute pain on those changes. Finally, modern medicine has resulted in the development of several obstetrical interventions, including but not limited to induction of labor, neuraxial anesthesia, and cesarean delivery (CD). A survey of 1123 mothers examined their well-being 9–12 months following childbirth. More than sixty-nine percent of respondents reported a condition that negatively influenced their lives, and 37% reported moderate or major severity of pain in the form or backache, abdominal pain, vaginal pain, or dyspareunia.

Patients may develop persistent postpartum pain (PPP) because of the inherent pain inducing physiological and pathological adaptation to the state of pregnancy, or because of the inherent noxious changes of operative and pharmacological interventions during labor.

As the understanding of chronic pain following medical interventions is growing, the focus has shifted from the observation of pain intensity only to include the impact of pain on the quality of life and functionality. Chronic pain severity is now defined as a more complex entity with three components, including intensity, pain-related distress, and pain-related interference with activities of daily living. Following that approach, more attention has been given to the potential negative impact of pregnancy and childbirth on the woman's peripartum health and wellbeing. In addition to acute pain and its management, the significant incidence of chronic postpartum pain has been recognized in the last two or three decades.

### Adherence, tolerance and effectiveness of two different pelvic support belts as a treatment for pregnancy-related symphyseal pain-a pilot randomized trial [^114TcjAN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

The mean ± SD number of times a participant responded to the daily text message over the 3-week period was 18.9 ± 4.1 (range 14–21; one outlier 3). Pelvic belts were worn for an average of 4.9 ± 2.9 hours per day but there was no significant difference in duration of belt use between the two groups (mean 5.0 ± 2.1 hours for flexible belt and 4.9 ± 3.6 hours for rigid belt, p = 0.973) (Table 2). Analyzing all participants, longer periods of belt use were associated with a greater decrease in pain VAS (preceding week) with a 3.9 mm greater decrease per additional hour worn (95% CI 0.8 to 6.9, p = 0.016) but no difference in PSFS (p = 0.546) or MODQ (p = 0.096). There was considerable variation in duration of belt usage between individuals, ranging between a mean of 12.6 ± 1.9 hours and 0.8 ± 1.4 hours (Figure 3). After wearing the alternate belt for a week, the flexible belt was deemed most comfortable by 14 of the 17 (82%) participants, with reports of the rigid belt tending to "ride up", move out of position when sitting down, and being uncomfortable and "digging in" whilst sitting. No adverse events were reported.

### Effects of pubic symphysis manipulation in patients with… [^112Arg2f]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Sacroiliac joint dysfunction is a degenerative condition that is considered a major cause of low back pain. It has been resulting from abnormal motion of the joint known as SIJ dysfunction. During pregnancy, heightened levels of estrogen and relaxin, coupled with the pressure exerted by a growing fetus, may induce excessive mobility in the SIJs. The pubic symphysis plays a vital role in stabilizing the anterior pelvis while allowing for a limited range of movement. Pubic symphysis dysfunction is characterized by discomfort in the pubic bone region that intensifies during activities such as walking, lifting, or stair climbing, hip abduction, rolling over in bed. Patients often report tenderness over the pubic symphysis. Symptoms include burning, stabbing, or shooting pain that radiates towards the abdomen, back, leg, and perineum. Symphysis pubis dysfunction occurs where the joint becomes sufficiently relaxed to allow instability in the pelvic girdle.

In severe cases of SPD the symphysis pubis may partially or completely rupture. A study conducted by S. Becker et al. investigates whether sacroiliac joint pain is linked to alterations in the pubic symphysis. The findings of this study indicate that changes in the pubic symphysis, along with low back pain and positive provocative tests, could potentially indicate dysfunction in the sacroiliac joint. Purpose of the study was to investigate effects of pubic symphysis manipulation in patients with sacroiliac joint dysfunction.

### Adherence, tolerance and effectiveness of two different pelvic support belts as a treatment for pregnancy-related symphyseal pain-a pilot randomized trial [^117X1ezX]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

During pregnancy women may experience a variety of musculoskeletal complaints including low back pain and/or pelvic girdle pain. Pubic symphysis dysfunction is a distinct subgroup of pelvic girdle pain and during pregnancy causes pain and limits everyday activities in at least 3–8% of women. Symptoms can be very debilitating, do not necessarily resolve after childbirth and often recur in subsequent pregnancies. Despite an adverse impact on quality of life, the cause of pregnancy-related symphyseal pain is poorly understood, with hormonal, genetic and/or biomechanical factors implicated in the pathogenesis of this relatively common but under-estimated problem.

A theoretical model of pelvic function based on biomechanical and clinical research, highlights the interaction of the bony interlocking mechanisms of the joints of the pelvis and the support afforded by surrounding ligaments, fascia and muscles. Insufficiencies in any of these components could result in abnormal pelvic motion, thereby generating pain. Pelvic support belts have been used by physiotherapists to treat symphyseal pain during pregnancy and the postpartum period. It is hypothesized that belts limit excessive motion by exerting an external force which compresses and stabilizes the joint(s), potentially generating a self-bracing effect.

There is little empirical evidence to support the efficacy or effectiveness of pelvic support belts in the management of pregnancy-related symphyseal pain. In clinical practice, pelvic belts are typically used in conjunction with other treatments such as exercise or acupuncture, meaning their individual contribution is unknown. In addition, a variety of belts are available for use, yet it is not certain what type is most beneficial in terms of symptom relief and tolerance. To date, only one study has investigated the effects of a pelvic belt as a primary intervention in pregnant women and one has reported their use in the treatment of symphyseal dysfunction. However, most intervention studies have focused on pregnant women with generalized pelvic girdle pain. In order to better understand the effects of a pelvic belt on pain and function, this pilot, unblinded (participants and researchers), 2-arm, single-center, randomized (1:1), parallel-group trial compared two pelvic support belts to determine effectiveness (symptomatic relief), tolerance (comfort) and adherence (frequency and duration of use) in women with pregnancy-related symphyseal pain.

### Recommendations for physical therapists on the treatment of lumbopelvic pain during pregnancy: a systematic review [^116EaM16]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review of the literature.

Objectives

To review and assess the peer-reviewed literature on the effectiveness of physical therapy interventions in treating lumbopelvic pain during pregnancy.

Background

Current guidelines on interventions for lumbopelvic pain during pregnancy differ in their recommendations for assessment and intervention. Recent publications may allow revising current recommendations for the treatment of this complex problem.

Methods

An electronic search strategy was conducted in PubMed, PEDro, Scopus, and CINAHL of literature published from January 1992 to November 2013. Two authors independently assessed all abstracts for eligibility. Articles were independently rated for quality by 2 authors, using the Cochrane Back Review Group criteria for methodological quality. Where possible, effect sizes were calculated for the different interventions.

Results

A total of 22 articles (all randomized controlled trials) reporting on 22 independent studies were included. Overall, the methodological quality of the studies was moderate. Data for 4 types of interventions were considered: a combination of interventions (7 studies, n = 1202), exercise therapy (9 studies, n = 2149), manual therapy (5 studies, n = 360), and material support (1 study, n = 115).

Conclusion

All included studies on exercise therapy, and most of the studies on interventions combined with patient education, reported a positive effect on pain, disability, and/or sick leave. Evidence-based recommendations can be made for the use of exercise therapy for the treatment of lumbopelvic pain during pregnancy.

### Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain: an update [^113yNUMX]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Contemporary clinical awareness of the PPGP syndrome appears to be increasing because of increased public awareness and the interaction of scientists from different medical specialties. Recently introduced definitions and proposed guidelines on PPGP diagnosis and management represent significant improvements, setting the basis for future comprehensive research on this multifactorial pain syndrome. Different treatment modalities and disease-specific outcome measures need to be investigated in multicentre, randomised clinical trials following the previous initiative of the Research Directorate of the European Commission.
