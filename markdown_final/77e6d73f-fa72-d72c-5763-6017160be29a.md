## Question

A 68-year-old man with severe COPD is being evaluated in the pulmonary clinic for persistent hypoxemia. His oxygen saturation on room air is 86% at rest. He has a 50 pack-year smoking history and admits to continuing to smoke 5–10 cigarettes per day. You are considering prescribing home oxygen therapy. During the consultation, he asks about the benefits of home oxygen and whether he can continue smoking if he starts oxygen therapy.

Based on current guidelines, what advice should you give this patient regarding smoking cessation in the context of prescribing home oxygen therapy?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what advice to give a 68-year-old man with severe COPD, persistent hypoxemia, and ongoing smoking about home oxygen therapy and whether he can continue smoking if he starts oxygen. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether he meets criteria for long-term oxygen therapy and the strength of evidence. Then, I should verify the magnitude of benefit and how it depends on adherence and smoking status. Next, I will examine the fire and burn risks of smoking with oxygen and how guidelines frame this. After that, I need to check what major guidelines say about prescribing oxygen to active smokers and what safety measures are required. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered recommendation with counseling points and documentation needs, making sure I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the indication for long-term oxygen therapy in COPD with severe resting hypoxemia. Severe hypoxemia is defined as PaO2 ≤ 55 mmHg or SpO2 ≤ 88% on room air, or PaO2 56–59 mmHg with edema, hematocrit ≥ 55%, or P pulmonale on ECG; in this case, SpO2 86% at rest meets the severe threshold, so LTOT is indicated if confirmed on repeat testing and after optimizing therapy and excluding reversible causes, with a strong recommendation and moderate-quality evidence supporting survival benefit at ≥ 15 hours per day [^4208640a] [^7cbe5c94] [^a0010f06].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and nature of benefit so I don't overstate it. The classic NOTT and MRC trials showed approximately a 50% reduction in mortality with continuous oxygen use, with a dose–response suggesting benefit when used at least 15 hours per day; contemporary summaries and guidelines continue to endorse this survival benefit in severe resting hypoxemia, while emphasizing that benefits are less clear in moderate hypoxemia or isolated exertional desaturation, which does not apply here given his resting SpO2 of 86% [^29ac9d67] [^52cd4219] [^4208640a].

> Hold on, I should verify how smoking status influences benefit and risk. Guidelines advise that the survival benefit of LTOT is predicated on appropriate use and safety; importantly, the BTS explicitly notes that the benefit of LTOT may be reduced if tobacco use continues, and smoking is the dominant driver of premature mortality and adverse outcomes in COPD, so continued smoking may blunt the net clinical gain even if oxygen is technically indicated [^5509996a] [^66922c49].

> Next, I should review the safety risks of smoking with home oxygen, because this is where patient counseling is critical. The LOTT trial and subsequent analyses documented increased burn injuries and fires among oxygen users, with an odds ratio of 2.43 for emergency department burn visits in oxygen users and specific event rates including burns from smoking around oxygen equipment; BTS and ATS materials similarly emphasize that up to a quarter of oxygen-related domestic fires result in death and a third in serious injury, and that vaping also poses burn risks, so the hazard is real and nontrivial [^8aa50068] [^66922c49] [^0b4fb5f9].

> I need to check what major guidelines say about prescribing to active smokers. The BTS advises advising smoking cessation prior to ordering home oxygen and at each follow-up, and recommends assessing risks case-by-case for active smokers, considering not offering LTOT when risks are too high, especially in households with children or multi-occupancy dwellings; the ATS makes smoking cessation education and fire safety training a best-practice requirement for all patients prescribed home oxygen, without declaring smoking an absolute contraindication, reflecting a harm-reduction approach rather than a categorical denial of therapy [^523bce0a] [^f189dfe7] [^15996d6f] [^4208640a] [^0b4fb5f9].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought some guidelines might label smoking as an absolute contraindication to home oxygen; let me reconsider and correct that. While some regional policies or programs may treat smoking as a barrier to authorization, neither BTS nor ATS lists smoking as an absolute contraindication, and both emphasize individualized risk assessment, mandatory safety education, and strong smoking cessation support rather than withholding indicated oxygen therapy outright [^f189dfe7] [^4208640a] [^0b4fb5f9].

> I should confirm the practical safety steps that must accompany any prescription in a smoker. Mandatory elements include comprehensive education on fire prevention, a signed agreement not to smoke while using oxygen or in the home, a home safety assessment with fire service notification in some systems, provision of fire extinguishers and smoke detectors, and a scheduled home visit within about 4 weeks to reinforce adherence and safety; these steps are consistently recommended in BTS and ATS guidance and should be documented in the chart and oxygen order [^a3ab95fe] [^6e619636] [^0b4fb5f9].

> Let me synthesize the clinical advice to the patient. First, I would confirm the hypoxemia with arterial blood gases and repeat measures to establish chronicity and exclude reversible causes, because LTOT is indicated for severe resting hypoxemia and confers a survival benefit when used at least 15 hours per day. Second, I would explain that continued smoking increases the risk of house fires, burns, and may diminish the benefit of oxygen, so smoking cessation is essential and will be supported with counseling and pharmacotherapy. Third, I would not withhold indicated oxygen solely due to smoking, but I would make continuation contingent on strict safety adherence and rapid cessation progress, with close follow-up and a low threshold to reassess the home environment if risks remain unacceptable [^4208640a] [^523bce0a] [^f189dfe7].

> I should double-check that my counseling aligns with evidence-based smoking cessation in COPD. Smoking cessation is the most effective intervention to slow disease progression, reduce exacerbations, and improve outcomes; combining behavioral support with pharmacotherapy such as varenicline, bupropion, or nicotine replacement increases quit rates, and this should be offered at the same visit and reinforced at every follow-up, given its outsized impact on prognosis in COPD [^4379e9f3] [^5e258a1a] [^8b52ef22].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and follow-up are explicit. I would record the indication for LTOT, the smoking risk discussion, the safety plan and education provided, the smoking cessation plan with pharmacotherapy, and arrange a home visit within 4 weeks to verify safe use, adherence, and smoking status; if the patient cannot commit to safety measures or cessation, I would reconsider the risk–benefit balance and consider deferring oxygen temporarily while intensifying cessation support, recognizing that this is a nuanced, case-by-case decision rather than a blanket rule [^a3ab95fe] [^f189dfe7] [^15996d6f].

---

You should **advise the patient to quit smoking immediately** because continuing to smoke while on home oxygen therapy poses a **significant fire and burn risk** and may reduce the clinical benefits of oxygen therapy [^0b4fb5f9] [^5509996a]. If he cannot quit immediately, **do not prescribe home oxygen** until he commits to smoking cessation and agrees to strict safety measures, including no smoking in the home, fire safety education, and a signed safety agreement [^f189dfe7] [^15996d6f]. Emphasize that smoking cessation is the most effective intervention to improve COPD outcomes and that oxygen therapy is only beneficial when used safely and consistently [^4379e9f3] [^5e258a1a].

## Risks associated with smoking while on home oxygen therapy

Smoking while using home oxygen therapy **significantly increases the risk of fires, burns, and related injuries**. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the British Thoracic Society (BTS) highlight these risks:

- **Fire hazard**: Smoking near oxygen equipment can cause fires, burns, and even fatalities. The ATS reports that patients on home oxygen have a higher risk of burn injuries, with an odds ratio of 2.43 for emergency room visits due to burns [^8aa50068].

- **Burn injuries**: Burns from smoking around oxygen equipment are a documented risk, with reported rates of burns from smoking around oxygen equipment at 0.12 per 100 person-years in the LOTT trial [^8aa50068].

- **Fatalities and serious injuries**: A significant proportion of oxygen-related domestic fires result in death or serious injury, underscoring the severity of this risk [^66922c49].

---

## Clinical benefits of smoking cessation in COPD patients on oxygen therapy

Smoking cessation is the **most effective intervention** for improving outcomes in COPD patients, including those on oxygen therapy:

- **Improved survival**: Smoking cessation reduces mortality in COPD patients, including those on long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) [^notfound].

- **Reduced exacerbations**: Quitting smoking decreases the frequency and severity of COPD exacerbations, which can improve quality of life and reduce healthcare utilization [^5e258a1a].

- **Enhanced oxygen therapy benefits**: The BTS guidelines note that the benefits of LTOT may be reduced if tobacco use is not discontinued, emphasizing the importance of smoking cessation for optimal therapeutic outcomes [^5509996a].

---

## Guidelines and recommendations

Major respiratory societies provide **clear guidance** on smoking cessation in patients prescribed home oxygen therapy:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| American Thoracic Society (ATS) | - Strongly recommend smoking cessation education and support for patients prescribed home oxygen therapy [^0b4fb5f9] <br/> - Emphasize fire safety education, including no smoking in the home and avoidance of open flames [^0b4fb5f9] |
| British Thoracic Society (BTS) | - Advise smoking cessation prior to ordering home oxygen and at each follow-up visit [^523bce0a] <br/> - Consider not offering LTOT to patients who continue to smoke if risks are too high, particularly in multi-occupancy dwellings or when children are present [^15996d6f] <br/> - Inform patients that the benefit of LTOT may be reduced if tobacco use is not discontinued [^5509996a] |
| Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) | - Strongly recommend smoking cessation for all patients with COPD, including those on oxygen therapy [^4379e9f3] <br/> - Emphasize that smoking cessation is the most effective intervention to improve COPD outcomes [^5e258a1a] |

---

## Practical approach to counseling the patient

Given the patient's current smoking status and the indication for home oxygen therapy, the following **practical approach** is recommended:

- **Immediate smoking cessation counseling**: Provide intensive counseling on the risks of smoking while on oxygen therapy, including fire hazards, burn injuries, and reduced therapeutic benefits [^0b4fb5f9] [^5509996a].

- **Pharmacological support**: Offer pharmacological aids such as nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, or varenicline to support smoking cessation efforts [^8b52ef22].

- **Safety agreement**: Require the patient to sign a safety agreement committing to no smoking in the home, adherence to fire safety precautions, and acceptance of regular follow-up visits [^notfound].

- **Alternative arrangements**: If the patient cannot commit to immediate smoking cessation, consider alternative arrangements such as supervised oxygen use in a clinical setting or deferring home oxygen therapy until smoking cessation is achieved [^f189dfe7].

- **Regular follow-up**: Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor smoking status, adherence to safety measures, and the effectiveness of oxygen therapy [^a3ab95fe].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The patient should be **strongly advised to quit smoking immediately** due to the significant fire and burn risks and the potential reduction in therapeutic benefits. If the patient cannot commit to smoking cessation, home oxygen therapy should not be prescribed until he agrees to strict safety measures and demonstrates a commitment to quitting. Smoking cessation is the most effective intervention to improve COPD outcomes and should be prioritized alongside oxygen therapy.

Summary of Recommendations

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

- In adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have severe chronic resting room air hypoxemia, * we recommend prescribing long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) for at least 15 h/d (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). * Severe hypoxemia is defined as meeting either of the following criteria: 1) Pa O 2 ≤ 55 mm Hg (7.3 kPa) or oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (Sp O 2) ≤ 88%; 2) Pa O 2 = 56–59 mm Hg (7.5–7.9 kPa) or Sp O 2 = 89% plus one of the following: edema, hematocrit ≥ 55%, or P pulmonale on an ECG.
- In adults with COPD who have moderate chronic resting room air hypoxemia, * we suggest not prescribing LTOT (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). * Moderate hypoxemia is defined as an Sp O 2 of 89–93%.
- In adults with COPD who have severe exertional room air hypoxemia, we suggest prescribing ambulatory oxygen (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Interstitial Lung Disease

- For adults with interstitial lung disease (ILD) who have severe chronic resting room air hypoxemia, we recommend prescribing LTOT for at least 15 h/d (strong recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).
- For adults with ILD who have severe exertional room air hypoxemia, we suggest prescribing ambulatory oxygen (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).

Liquid Oxygen

- In patients with chronic lung disease who are mobile outside of the home and require continuous oxygen flow rates of > 3 L/min during exertion, we suggest prescribing portable liquid oxygen (LOX) (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).

Education and Safety

- For patients prescribed home oxygen therapy, we recommend that the patient and their caregivers receive instruction and training on the use and maintenance of all oxygen equipment and education on oxygen safety, including smoking cessation, fire prevention, and tripping hazards (best-practice statement).

What is the role of LTOT in COPD?

LTOT, i.e. oxygen administered for ⩾15 h/day for patients who are chronically hypoxaemic, remains the most evidence-based form of domiciliary oxygen in use. The evidence for LTOT centres around two landmark RCTs carried out in the 1980s, which both showed a survival benefit in COPD patients that only became apparent after several years of use. At present, smoking cessation and LTOT are the only two interventions known to improve survival outcomes in COPD.

Should oxygen be used in breathless patients, in the absence of hypoxaemia?

This is a typical COPD presentation, with first symptoms occurring in late adulthood following a significant smoking history and accompanied by supporting changes on spirometry. In this context, patients often experience frightening and debilitating breathlessness. Of note, his saturations remain well preserved on air (i.e. > 92%), demonstrating that he is not hypoxaemic at rest. What is the role, if any, of oxygen in this setting?

The British Thoracic Society (BTS) oxygen guideline summarises the evidence for, and provides recommendation on, the different options for home oxygen therapy (listed in Table 1). Box 1 summarises the key recommendations from the guideline. Previously, both short-burst oxygen therapy (SBOT) and ambulatory oxygen therapy (AOT) have been considered for nonhypoxaemic patients with disabling breathlessness. The evidence to support this, however, is limited.

All panelists agreed on the need for ongoing reassessment of patients' increased or decreased oxygen needs and acknowledged that the frequency would vary by disease characteristics, rate of progression, or posthospitalization status. The high priority for posthospitalization reassessment of the ongoing need for oxygen is in agreement with the ATS/American College of Chest Physicians policy statement and others findings.

ATS Recommendation

For patients prescribed home oxygen therapy, we recommend that the patient and their caregivers receive instruction and training on adherence to their oxygen prescription; the use, maintenance and troubleshooting of all oxygen equipment; and education on oxygen safety, including smoking cessation, fire prevention, and tripping hazards (best-practice statement).

LTOT and smoking

It is not known whether patients who continue to smoke receive any survival benefit from LTOT. As current smoking is the main driver of premature mortality and adverse outcomes in COPD, there are theoretical and physiological reasons why these patients are unlikely to have the same benefit — however, 33–48% of patients included in the original landmark LTOT trials were current smokers at the time of recruitment. Notwithstanding any possible lack of benefit, the main concern over current smoking and LTOT is the potential for great harm, not only to the individual but also to carers, co-habitants and others. Up to 25% of all oxygen- and smoking-related domestic fires result in death and 33% in serious injury.

The current guideline leaves the final decision regarding oxygen prescription with individual clinicians, but it does offer practical advice for home oxygen services around risk estimation and mitigation. Just as prescriptions of nephrotoxic drugs are modified in patients with renal impairment because of the potential for harm, so any decision on home oxygen prescription needs to balance the potential clinical benefit against the risk of harm on a case-by-case basis.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^3249d8d6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and progressive airflow obstruction. Tobacco smoking is the leading cause but not the only one. A postbronchodilator FEV 1 -FVC ratio less than 0.70 is required for a diagnosis of COPD. Inhaler therapy is the backbone of treatment and should be complemented by a multifaceted management strategy that includes counseling and pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation, pulmonary rehabilitation, treatment of comorbidities, administration of influenza and pneumococcal immunizations, and prescription of long-term oxygen therapy in hypoxemic patients.

Clinical scenario 1: the story continues

The same gentleman has been under your care for a further 5 years. During this time, he has become much more limited and now has an exercise tolerance of 100 m. He has experienced several exacerbations and has been admitted twice in the last year. He attends for a routine review 3 weeks after his most recent admission. His spirometry has continued to deteriorate (FEV 1 0.6 l or 23% predicted) and he is now hypoxaemic (saturations 91% on air). Unfortunately, he has also started smoking again

These changes are reflected in detail in the various GRADE domains in the online supplement that have now been updated to reflect serious concerns regarding imprecision and indirectness (almost all studies are crossover trials, and most report effects of oxygen during laboratory tests, not daily life). As such, on page E59, the Certainty of Evidence should be downgraded from "moderate" to "low" for the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). The final recommendation should read, "In adults with COPD who have severe exertional room air hypoxemia, we suggest prescribing ambulatory oxygen (conditional recommendation, low -quality evidence)".

The authors of the document apologize for these oversights. For the convenience of our readers, the Journal is replacing the online version of the article with a corrected version.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^a5fed00b]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Module A: Management of COPD in primary care begins by asking "Is patient having an acute exacerbation? (see Sidebar 1)" and, if yes, directs "Management of an acute exacerbation (see Module B)". Evaluate for other contributing diagnoses and co-occurring conditions and "Obtain diagnostic spirometry if available (see Recommendation 1)". Next, determine "Is there a confident clinical diagnosis of COPD?" with the no branch to "Treat or refer as clinically indicated". For confirmed COPD, "Offer prevention and risk reduction methods including smoking cessation, vaccination, and patient education" and "Suggest spirometry if not already completed", then assess "Is patient chronically symptomatic and/or has patient had a moderate to severe exacerbation in the past year? (see Sidebar 1)". If symptoms persist, "consider need to initiate/adjust medication and assess inhaler technique", "ensure patient is on a SABA (PRN)", and escalate with "First line LAMA", "Add LABA for severe symptoms (preferably combination inhaler)", "Add ICS only for continued moderate to severe exacerbations (see Sidebar 1)", and "Pulmonology referral". For hypoxemia, "Consider need for oxygen if patient has resting hypoxemia (refer to home oxygen clinic if appropriate)". Ongoing care includes "Continue follow-up and monitoring", "Reassess severity periodically", "Consider pulmonary rehabilitation", "Consider medication adjustment if patient is on an inhaled corticosteroid (see Module C)", "Consider offering referral to a pulmonologist or a palliative care specialist as appropriate for patients with persistent refractory dyspnea", and "Carefully consider alternatives to beta blockers for non-cardiac indications (e.g. HTN)".

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for home oxygen, more specifically with respect to follow-up home visits, BTS 2015 guidelines recommend to schedule a home visit within 4 weeks, conducted by a specialist nurse or healthcare professional with experience of domiciliary oxygen therapy, for all patients in whom long-term oxygen therapy is initiated. The visit provides an opportunity to highlight potential risks and should be used to reinforce education and offer support to the patient and carer. Compliance may be checked, along with smoking status, symptoms of hypercapnia and oxygen saturations on oxygen to check that oxygen is therapeutic.

Clinical scenario 1: a 63-year-old man with moderate COPD — is home oxygen indicated?

A 63-year-old retired shopkeeper attends for his annual chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) review. He was diagnosed 3 years ago following a 40 pack-year history of smoking, and since then he has been managed with tiotropium. His exercise tolerance was initially reasonable, but it has recently fallen to 410 m. As a result, he has lost confidence and become less independent. One of his friends suggested that he ask for home oxygen to help with his symptoms. His spirometry shows moderate airflow obstruction (FEV 1 1.5 l or 51% predicted, FVC 2.7 l or 91% predicted and FEV 1 /FVC ratio 56%). His oxygen saturation is 96% on air.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^99db6db5]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Non-pharmacological therapy — smoking cessation, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), and long term oxygen therapy (LTOT) — has evidence of mortality benefit: From the Lung Health Study, a randomized clinical trial that included asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COPD patients treated with a 10-week smoking cessation intervention program and followed up to 14.5 years, the overall mortality rate was reduced in the intervention group versus usual care. A systematic review of RCTs reported a reduction in mortality when PR was initiated during hospitalization or 4 weeks after discharge, and real-world evidence from a large population-based cohort of 190,000 patients showed that initiation of PR within 90 days of discharge was associated with a statistically significant reduced mortality. Survival benefit of LTOT in COPD demonstrated in two studies in the early 1980s laid the foundation for long-term domiciliary management of hypoxemia, including the Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial with ≥ 19 hours of continuous oxygen compared to ≤ 13 hours.

Panel judgments

Desirable consequences and their magnitudes (benefits)

For people with COPD and severe exertional hypoxemia, we did not find consistent evidence that ambulatory oxygen delivered clinically significant improvements in the critical outcome of HRQL, whereas effects generally favored ambulatory oxygen (moderate GRADE evidence). Acute improvements in exercise capacity were seen both in those with isolated exertional hypoxemia and in those eligible for LTOT. The effects of ambulatory oxygen on dyspnea during exercise testing were inconsistent. Mortality risks were not reported. Fatigue and physical activity in daily life were not reported.

Undesirable consequences and their magnitudes (harms)

There is a substantial body of evidence regarding the patient and caregiver burden associated with the use of ambulatory oxygen, including managing the weight and bulk of equipment, embarrassment and perceived stigma, fear of cylinders running out, reduced ability to travel outside the home, equipment noise that may affect social activities, difficulty obtaining POCs, and poor access to information about effective use of oxygen equipment.

Rationale for the recommendation

There is some evidence supporting the use of ambulatory oxygen in people with COPD, which is complicated by the potential burden of this therapy. Effects on the critical outcome of HRQL, which may or may not be clinically significant, tended to favor ambulatory oxygen. Ambulatory oxygen acutely improves exercise capacity and may reduce breathlessness during exercise testing. There is little evidence regarding the effects of ambulatory oxygen when used in daily life. Given this uncertainty, together with the known burden of ambulatory oxygen, it is likely that some patients will choose not to use ambulatory oxygen.

ATS recommendation

In adults with COPD who have severe exertional room air hypoxemia, we suggest prescribing ambulatory oxygen (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).

What others are saying

A 2015 guideline by the BTS states that ambulatory oxygen should not be routinely offered to patients with isolated exertional hypoxemia and should only be offered to those eligible for LTOT if they are mobile outdoors. The 2020 GOLD strategy makes no recommendations regarding ambulatory oxygen.

Background

Exertional hypoxemia is a hallmark of ILD, occurring in more than half of patients evaluated at a tertiary ILD service and in over 80% of patients with an FVC < 50% of that predicted. The magnitude of exertional hypoxemia is generally greater in people with ILD than in people with COPD. People with ILD who desaturate to an Sp O 2 ≤ 88% on a 6MWT have a fourfold greater risk of death than those who do not, after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, respiratory function, and resting saturation. Exertional desaturation is an independent predictor of PH, which is itself a strong predictor of mortality. Greater exertional desaturation is strongly associated with reduced physical activity. These data provide a strong rationale for treatment of exertional hypoxemia in ILD to improve daily functioning and long-term outcomes.

The prespecified critical outcome for this key question was HRQL; important outcomes were dyspnea, fatigue, exercise capacity, physical activity, mortality, healthcare resource use, and safety.

### Health effects of cigarettes: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease… [^8ca7e5c8]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- Cigarette smoking is a common cause of COPD, leading to as many as 8 out of 10 COPD-related deaths.
- Quitting smoking reduces the risk of COPD and also benefits people who have COPD. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overview Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease refers to a group of diseases that cause airflow blockage and breathing-related problems. COPD includes emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and in some cases, asthma. With COPD, less air flows through the airways that carry air in and out of your lungs. This happens because of one or more of the following:

- The airways and tiny air sacs in the lungs lose their ability to stretch and shrink back.
- The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed.
- The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed.
- The airways make more mucus than usual. The mucus can clog airways and block air flow. In the early stages of COPD, there may be no symptoms, or only mild symptoms.

As COPD worsens, the symptoms may become more severe. The severity of COPD symptoms depends on the amount of damage to the lungs. Continued smoking leads to lung damage worsening faster than not smoking. Smoking, secondhand smoke exposure, and COPD Cigarette smoking is a common cause of COPD. Smoking causes as many as 8 out of 10 COPD-related deaths. However, as many as 1 out of 4 Americans with COPD never smoked cigarettes. Smoking and secondhand smoke exposure during childhood and teenage years can slow lung growth and development. This can increase the risk of developing COPD in adulthood. The best way to prevent COPD is to never start smoking. If you smoke, quitting is the most important action you can take. It is also important to avoid secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke is smoke from burning tobacco products, such as cigarettes, cigars, or pipes.

Quitting smoking can protect people from COPD Quitting smoking is one of the most important actions people can take to improve their health. This is true for all people who smoke, regardless of their age, how long they have smoked, or how much they smoke. Quitting smoking also reduces the risk of developing COPD. For patients diagnosed with COPD, quitting smoking slows COPD's progression. It also reduces the loss of lung function over time.

### Home oxygen therapy for adults with chronic lung disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^b6dfbcbd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Research needs

The panel recommends studies on the use of shared decision-making to personalize the use of home oxygen in participants with moderate resting hypoxemia, as well as studies evaluating the discontinuation of supplemental oxygen in patients who previously had severe resting room air hypoxemia but now have moderate resting room air hypoxemia. Confirmatory evidence is needed to determine the effect of LTOT on dyspnea and other outcomes for patients with moderate resting hypoxemia.

Question 3: Should ambulatory oxygen be prescribed for adults with COPD who have severe exertional room air hypoxemia?

Background

Exertional hypoxemia occurs in up to 40% of people with moderate to severe COPD who have normoxemia at rest. It is seen most frequently in those with low lung function (FEV 1 < 45%, D CO < 50%), in those with low resting saturation (< 95%), and in women. The imbalance between oxygen delivery and demand is a major contributor. Exertional hypoxemia is linked to more rapid decline in lung function, worse HRQL, and increased mortality. In 576 people with severe COPD followed for at least 3 years, mortality in those with isolated exertional hypoxemia on a 6MWT was 2.63-fold higher than in those without exertional hypoxemia (95% CI, 1.53–4.51).

"Ambulatory oxygen" is defined as oxygen delivered during exercise or activities of daily living when the individual is walking freely (Table 3). It is prescribed for people with COPD to improve oxygen delivery during exertion, reduce symptoms, and enhance physical capacity. It may be prescribed for individuals using LTOT who require a portable oxygen supply when leaving the house or for those with isolated exertional hypoxemia. Although the beneficial effects of supplemental oxygen during laboratory-based exercise tests have been reported in COPD, clinical trials of ambulatory oxygen used during daily life have had less consistent results. There is variation in prescribing practices and access to ambulatory oxygen across jurisdictions.

The prespecified critical outcome for this question was HRQL; important outcomes included dyspnea, fatigue, exercise capacity, physical activity, mortality, healthcare resource use, and safety.

### Home oxygen therapy for adults with chronic lung disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^450db33e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our systematic review reveals that the quality and quantity of clinical trial evidence is low, thereby leaving significant gaps in available data regarding prescription of supplemental oxygen. The need for guidance is high; the prescription of supplemental oxygen is common. The recommendations in this document reflect an integration of current evidence and clinical experience by a multidisciplinary expert panel.

For patients with severe resting hypoxemia, the prescription of LTOT to improve survival is supported by historical trials in patients with COPD. The panel also strongly recommends prescribing oxygen for patients with ILD with severe resting hypoxemia. Existing evidence and panel consensus suggest not prescribing LTOT for patients with COPD with moderate resting hypoxemia. The practice of initiating short-term oxygen therapy on hospital discharge in patients with severe hypoxemia is based on indirect evidence from the NOTT and MRC clinical trial populations with chronic hypoxemia. The harms and benefits of prescribing short-term oxygen therapy on hospital discharge deserves further study. Further research is needed on the appropriate use of shared decision-making between patients and their clinicians for decisions regarding home oxygen therapy and on approaches to discontinue home oxygen in patients who no longer have severe resting hypoxemia.

This review confirmed scarce and inconclusive data to support the prescription of oxygen in patients who have normoxemia at rest but desaturate (sometimes markedly) with exertion. Emerging evidence suggests that ambulatory oxygen may improve HRQL in patients with ILD in the short term, but longer-term data are needed. This was identified as a critical research need. The urgency is underscored by the treatment's cumbersome nature, associated risks, and complex effects on the patients, families, and caregivers.

No studies met the panel's criteria for the evaluation of LOX in patients who use > 3 L/min of continuous-flow oxygen and spend regular and frequent time outside the home. The panel concluded that although an E tank, or other large metal cylinder, can adequately provide oxygen at up to 5 or 6 L/min, the patient would be restricted by the need to carry multiple E tanks to leave home for anything more than a very short time period. Thus, this population is unintentionally denied the necessary mobility to travel, work, socialize, or attend pulmonary rehabilitation — critical contributors to HRQL. The panel unanimously agreed that LOX should be offered to active patients on high-flow oxygen and that policies to accommodate this subgroup should be moved forward.

Nonpharmacological Therapy

Nonpharmacological treatment is a key part of the comprehensive management of COPD.

Education

All patients should receive basic information about COPD and its treatment (respiratory medications and inhalation devices), strategies to minimize dyspnea, and advice about when to seek help.

Smoking Cessation

Approximately 40% of people with COPD continue to smoke despite knowing that they have the disease, and this behavior has a negative impact on prognosis and progression of the disease. All patients who continue to smoke should be offered help and treatment to quit.

Vaccination

Depending on local guidelines, patients should be offered vaccination against influenza, pneumococcus, COVID-19, pertussis, and herpes zoster, if they have not already received these.

Physical Activity

Physical activity is decreased in COPD patients, so all patients with COPD should be encouraged to keep active. The challenge is promoting and maintaining physical activity. Technology-based interventions have the potential to provide convenient and accessible means to enhance exercise self-efficacy, and to educate and motivate patients to make healthy lifestyle changes.

Pulmonary Rehabilitation

Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), including community and home-based, is beneficial. Accordingly, patients with high symptom burden and risk of exacerbations (GOLD groups B and E) should be recommended to take part in a formal PR program designed and delivered in a structured manner, considering the individual's COPD characteristics and comorbidities.

Tele-rehabilitation has been proposed as an alternative to the traditional approaches. This has become even more relevant in the COVID-19 pandemic era, when in-person PR has not been feasible. However, it is important to distinguish between evidence-based tele-rehabilitation models and pandemic-adapted models. Multiple trials performed in groups and individuals with a large variety of tele-rehabilitation delivery platforms (videoconferencing, telephone only, website with telephone support, mobile application with feedback, centralized "hub" for people to come together) suggest that tele-rehabilitation is safe and has similar benefits to those of center-based PR across a range of outcomes. However, the optimal forms of delivery, content, and duration are not yet established.

Oxygen Therapy and Ventilatory Support

The criteria for prescribing long-term oxygen therapy and ventilator support remain unchanged and are described in detail in the GOLD 2023 report.

### When should I be considering home oxygen for my patients? [^c4847732]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

LTOT assessment and administration

Oxygen is a medicine used to treat hypoxia. Similar to any drug, the appropriate dose for an individual patient needs to be considered, and it can vary. Patients referred to a home oxygen service will undergo a comprehensive assessment including checking blood gases that will determine whether oxygen is required, and at what level it should be administered. The home oxygen assessment service will ensure that the patient does not become hypercapnic on oxygen and will complete the appropriate documentation (e.g. in the UK a Home Oxygen Order Form or HOOF), prescribing the required flow rate for the patient's LTOT. This is typically delivered via nasal prongs for ⩾15 h/day through an oxygen concentrator installed in the patient's home. Patients who use their oxygen for less than this amount are unlikely to see any survival benefits. Those who are mobile outdoors may be offered AOT in addition to LTOT to enable them to accumulate sufficient hours of LTOT usage per day, and will undergo further assessment to determine whether a higher flow rate is needed during exercise.

The home oxygen assessment team will also educate the patient and carers and work with the home oxygen supplier to make sure that a comprehensive risk assessment has been completed in the patient's home. Patients will be informed of their responsibility to use oxygen safely, including abstinence from smoking (at the very least while using the oxygen). The home oxygen team should also identify patients at risk of harm from excessive oxygen, for example, during an ambulance transfer, and ensure that care plans and/or alerts are in place to address this.

Commencing LTOT is a key milestone in any patient's disease trajectory. Not only will the treatment have a huge impact on their life and that of their carers but the need for LTOT also signifies advanced disease — this carries advance care planning implications that may need to be considered.

### Home oxygen therapy for adults with chronic lung disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^bbc97395]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale for the recommendation

The panel concluded that the certainty of evidence was moderate and was based on a single clinical trial that used Sp O 2 of 89–93% to define moderate hypoxemia. Similar results were noted in a trial by Górecka and colleagues, which compared LTOT plus monthly home visits by a nurse versus monthly home visits by a nurse alone in patients with moderate resting hypoxemia as defined by a Pa O 2 of 56–65 mm Hg. There was probably no important uncertainty or variability about how much people value mortality as the critical outcome. Some patients may not experience any value added on additional life years if they are very ill. However, this is less likely in patients with moderate hypoxemia, as they tend to have less severe COPD than those with severe resting hypoxemia. The balance between desirable and undesirable effects does not favor LTOT in those with moderate hypoxemia.

ATS recommendation

In adults with COPD who have moderate chronic resting room air hypoxemia, we suggest not prescribing LTOT (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).

What others are saying

Only one guideline was found that makes recommendations regarding LTOT in patients with moderate resting hypoxemia. The 2020 GOLD document states, "In patients with stable COPD and resting or exercise-induced moderate desaturation, long-term oxygen treatment should not be prescribed routinely. However, individual patient factors must be considered when evaluating the patient's need for supplemental oxygen".

Implementation considerations

On the basis of the LOTT study, we defined moderate resting hypoxemia as an Sp O 2 of 89–93%. The corresponding Pa O 2 was not reported. The costs and burden of the treatment outweigh the minimal benefit of LTOT in adults with COPD who have moderate resting room air hypoxemia. Patients likely would not choose LTOT on the basis of the lack of benefit; they may decide to defer using oxygen at rest until their resting hypoxemia worsens. The LOTT study did not report any data on pulmonary hemodynamics, and it is therefore not possible to conclude whether effects of LTOT in this group of patients differs according to the presence of PH. When patients have moderate resting hypoxemia, it is an opportunity for shared decision-making between the clinician and patient (see Table 2, which discusses the situations that provide an opportunity for shared decision-making).

Values and preferences

This recommendation against LTOT in this setting places a high value on the absence of a mortality reduction and a lower value on short-term improvement in HRQL (which was observed at 4 mo but not at 12 mo).

### Treatment of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the GOLD guidelines [^6ae90a50]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common problem in primary care. COPD is diagnosed with spirometry only in clinically stable patients with a postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity ratio of less than 0.70. All patients with COPD who smoke should be counseled about smoking cessation. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations are recommended for all patients with COPD. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease assigns patients with COPD into four groups based on the degree of airflow restriction, symptom score, and number of exacerbations in one year. Pulmonary rehabilitation is recommended for patients in groups B, C, and D. Those in group A should receive a short-acting anticholinergic or short-acting beta2 agonist for mild intermittent symptoms. For patients in group B, long-acting anticholinergics or long-acting beta2 agonists should be added. Patients in group C or D are at high risk of exacerbations and should receive a long-acting anticholinergic or a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta2 agonist. For patients whose symptoms are not controlled with one of these regimens, triple therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid, long-acting beta2 agonist, and anticholinergic should be considered. Prophylactic antibiotics and oral corticosteroids are not recommended for prevention of COPD exacerbations. Continuous oxygen therapy improves mortality rates in patients with severe hypoxemia and COPD. Lung volume reduction surgery can improve survival rates in patients with severe, upper lobe-predominant COPD with heterogeneous emphysema distribution.

### The 2007 GOLD guidelines: a comprehensive care framework [^0424f736]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Comprehensive management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes proper assessment, monitoring of disease, reduction of risk factors, the management of stable COPD, and the prevention and management of exacerbations. The 2007 COPD guidelines from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease address each of these aspects of COPD management in detail and provide evidence-based recommendations for patients and health-care professionals. Reduction of risk factors emphasizes the importance of smoking cessation and control of environmental indoor and outdoor pollutants. The management of COPD must be individualized. Aerosol administration of bronchodilators is the most effective method of reducing the work of breathing and alleviating dyspnea. Glucocorticosteroid therapy is recommended to reduce the frequency of exacerbations and improve health-related quality of life for patients with stage 3 and 4 COPD. Pulmonary rehabilitation proves effective in relieving symptoms, improving quality of life, and increasing patients' physical and emotional participation in activities of daily life. Oxygen therapy is essential for patients with substantial hypoxia. Patients with COPD and respiratory failure may benefit from noninvasive ventilation. Surgery may play a limited role in the management of selected patients with COPD. Since exacerbations influence lung function and clinical decline in patients with COPD and contribute to the cost of caring for this disease, efforts must be directed at prevention and management of exacerbations. In addition to controlled oxygen therapy, antimicrobials, brief courses of systemic corticosteroids and, on occasion, noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation may play a role. The role of respiratory therapists in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of stable COPD and exacerbations is absolutely essential if the goals of the 2007 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines are to be attained.

### British thoracic society guidelines for home oxygen use in adults [^a0fd5b34]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

The British Thoracic Society (BTS) Home Oxygen Guideline provides detailed evidence-based guidance for the use of home oxygen for patients out of hospital. Although the majority of evidence comes from the use of oxygen in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the scope of the guidance includes patients with a variety of long-term respiratory illnesses and other groups in whom oxygen is currently ordered, such as those with cardiac failure, cancer and end-stage cardiorespiratory disease, terminal illness or cluster headache. It explores the evidence base for the use of different modalities of oxygen therapy and patient-related outcomes such as mortality, symptoms and quality of life. The guideline also makes recommendations for assessment and follow-up protocols, and risk assessments, particularly in the clinically challenging area of home oxygen users who smoke. The guideline development group is aware of the potential for confusion sometimes caused by the current nomenclature for different types of home oxygen, and rather than renaming them, has adopted the approach of clarifying those definitions, and in particular emphasising what is meant by long-term oxygen therapy and palliative oxygen therapy. The home oxygen guideline provides expert consensus opinion in areas where clinical evidence is lacking, and seeks to deliver improved prescribing practice, leading to improved compliance and improved patient outcomes, with consequent increased value to the health service.

### Home oxygen therapy for adults with chronic lung disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^3b7be783]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Evidence-based guidelines are needed for effective delivery of home oxygen therapy to appropriate patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and interstitial lung disease (ILD). Methods: The multidisciplinary panel created six research questions using a modified Delphi approach. A systematic review of the literature was completed, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to formulate clinical recommendations. Recommendations: The panel found varying quality and availability of evidence and made the following judgments: 1) strong recommendations for long-term oxygen use in patients with COPD (moderate-quality evidence) or ILD (low-quality evidence) with severe chronic resting hypoxemia, 2) a conditional recommendation against long-term oxygen use in patients with COPD with moderate chronic resting hypoxemia, 3) conditional recommendations for ambulatory oxygen use in patients with COPD (moderate-quality evidence) or ILD (low-quality evidence) with severe exertional hypoxemia, 4) a conditional recommendation for ambulatory liquid-oxygen use in patients who are mobile outside the home and require > 3 L/min of continuous-flow oxygen during exertion (very-low-quality evidence), and 5) a recommendation that patients and their caregivers receive education on oxygen equipment and safety (best-practice statement). Conclusions: These guidelines provide the basis for evidence-based use of home oxygen therapy in adults with COPD or ILD but also highlight the need for additional research to guide clinical practice.

### Update on the management of COPD [^2b87debe]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

COPD is highly prevalent and will continue to be an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. COPD is now viewed under a new paradigm as preventable and treatable. In addition, it has become accepted that COPD is not solely a pulmonary disease but also one with important measurable systemic consequences. Patients with COPD have to be comprehensively evaluated to determine the extent of disease so that therapy can be adequately individualized. We now know that smoking cessation, oxygen for hypoxemic patients, lung reduction surgery for selected patients with emphysema, and noninvasive ventilation during severe exacerbations have an impact on mortality. The completion of well-planned pharmacologic trials have shown the importance of decreasing resting and dynamic hyperinflation on patient-centered outcomes and the possible impact on mortality and rate of decline of lung function. In addition, therapy with pulmonary rehabilitation and lung transplantation improve patient-centered outcomes such as health-related quality of life, dyspnea, and exercise capacity. Rational use of single or multiple therapeutic modalities in combination have an impact on exacerbations and hospitalizations. This monograph presents an integrated approach to patients with COPD and updates their management incorporating the recent advances in the field. The future for patients with COPD is bright as primary and secondary prevention of smoking becomes more effective and air quality improves. In addition, current research will unravel the pathogenesis, clinical, and phenotypic manifestations of COPD, thus providing exciting therapeutic targets. Ultimately, the advent of newer and more effective therapies will lead to a decline in the contribution of this disease to poor world health.

Non-pharmacological therapy

Non-pharmacological treatment is a key part of the adequate management of COPD and should always be considered in combination with the pharmacologic treatment discussed above. It includes one or more of the following:
Education and supported self-management. All patients should receive basic information about COPD and its treatment (respiratory medications and inhalation devices) and advice about when to seek help. Primary care is the right place to educate COPD patients and health-care professionals should be given the right tools to do that. However, education by itself does not often change behaviour. Education needs to be delivered in the context of a supportive behaviour change intervention that is personalized to the individual and their sociodemographic/cultural context.
Smoking cessation. All patients who continue to smoke should be offered help and treatment to quit. Brief intervention in primary care is effective and pharmacologic treatment should be offered if possible. Likewise, strategies for reducing exposure to indoor air pollution need to be considered too.
Vaccination. Depending on local guidelines, patients should be offered vaccination against influenza, pneumococcus, COVlD-19, pertussis, and herpes zoster.
Physical activity. All COPD patients should be encouraged to keep active. Technology-based interventions have the potential to provide convenient and accessible means to enhance exercise self-efficacy, and to educate and motivate patients to make healthy lifestyle changes.
Nutritional and Psychosocial assessment and support are important aspects to consider and treat if needed. Up to 50% of people with COPD weigh less than 90% of ideal body weight. Dietary advice and oral supplementation have been reported to improve body weight, quality of life, respiratory muscle strength and 6-minute walk distance in patients with COPD. Psychosocial consideration and support is also important in the management of these patients.
Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR). PR, including community and home-based, is beneficial. Accordingly, patients with high symptom burden and risk of exacerbations (GOLD groups B and E) should be recommended to take part in a formal PR program designed and delivered in a structured manner, considering the individual's COPD characteristics and comorbidities –. In some settings, this may be combined with rehabilitation for cardiovascular patients.
Oxygen therapy and ventilatory support. The criteria for prescribing long term oxygen therapy and ventilator support remain unchanged and are described in detail in the GOLD 2023 report.
Surgical and endoscopic lung volume reduction. In selected patients with symptomatic heterogeneous or homogenous emphysema and significant hyperinflation refractory to optimized medical care, surgical or bronchoscopic modes of lung volume reduction may be indicated. The complete GOLD report provides specific recommendations for different procedures. Likewise, younger COPD patients with severe COPD should be considered for lung transplant.
End of Life and Palliative Care. All patients with advanced COPD should be considered for end of life and palliative care support to optimize symptom control and allow patients and their families to make informed choices about future management.

### Optimizing home oxygen therapy. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^29ac9d67]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2018). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) evidence — key trials and research priorities emphasize survival benefit and remaining questions. The Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial Group and the Medical Research Council Working Party published multicenter randomized clinical trials of oxygen in 1980 and 1981, respectively, and results of the two COPD oxygen therapy trials indicated that LTOT reduced mortality in an apparent dose-dependent manner. Prior Oxygen Consensus Conferences in 2000 and 2006 identified research priorities for efficacy of LTOT in COPD with resting, exertional, and nocturnal hypoxemia, concluding that additional investigations were warranted to compare oxygen use versus no oxygen use in patients with mild resting hypoxemia, nighttime-only hypoxemia, exertion-only hypoxemia, or hypoxemia during rest and exercise.

### Home oxygen therapy for patients with COPD: time for a reboot [^584a3017]. Respiratory Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Just over 100 years ago, John Scott Haldane published a seminal report about the therapeutic potential of supplemental oxygen to treat hypoxemia. In the 1980s, a pair of clinical trials confirmed the benefit of long-term oxygen therapy in improving survival in patients with COPD associated with severe resting hypoxemia. This review provides a summary of evidence supporting long-term and short-term oxygen therapy, as well as the various types of oxygen equipment commonly used in homes to deliver supplemental oxygen. Because the majority of orders for home oxygen occur at hospital discharge following acute illness, a typical conversation between a patient and their pulmonologist following a COPD exacerbation is presented. The SHERLOCK Consortium, a multi-stakeholder group established following the publication of the COPD National Action Plan in 2017 is also detailed. Interim results of the SHERLOCK Consortium, which suggest a chain of care involving 9 steps to ensure that patients are successfully initiated on home oxygen therapy during transitions from hospital to home, are presented. Recommendations to support evidence-based policies in this high-risk population are provided.

### Supplemental oxygen in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: evidence from nocturnal oxygen treatment trial to long-term oxygen treatment trial [^ca5c6b99]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Oxygen therapy was the first treatment shown to prolong life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has been joined by lung volume reduction surgery in selected patients with emphysema, smoking cessation, and potentially noninvasive ventilation in chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure. Although there is consensus around the survival-enhancing effect of supplemental oxygen (SupplO2) for patients with chronic severe hypoxemia at rest, the impact of SupplO2 for COPD patients with moderate hypoxemia and exertional desaturation had been less clear.

Recent Findings

The recently published Long-term Oxygen Treatment Trial (LOTT) showed no benefit of SupplO2 for the composite outcome of survival and all-cause hospitalizations, or for component outcomes, severe COPD exacerbations, or quality of life in COPD patients with moderate resting hypoxemia or room air normoxemia with exercise desaturation.

Summary

Results of the LOTT challenge the practice of prescribing SupplO2 for patients with COPD and moderate resting hypoxemia or isolated exertional desaturation. In the context that LOTT may not have recruited patients for whom SupplO2 conferred subjective benefit, there may be a role for short-term trials of SupplO2 with assessment of subjective benefit in such patients.

PICO 1 — smoking cessation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): In patients with COPD, we suggest including smoking cessation counseling and treatment using best practices as a component of a comprehensive clinical strategy to prevent acute exacerbations of COPD (Grade 2C).

### Contemporary management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: clinical applications [^66ce9e99]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

The presentation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) usually is insidious, and many patients are undiagnosed until the disease is far advanced. Therefore, the early use of spirometry is recommended for anyone who is suspected to have COPD. In the early stages of the disease, the patient is only mildly symptomatic (cough and sputum production). As COPD becomes more advanced, functional impairment in the form of chronic dyspnea occurs and acute exacerbations of symptoms become more frequent, contributing to overall morbidity and mortality. The single most important known causative factor of COPD is cigarette smoking. Smoking cessation remains, therefore, the mainstay of COPD therapy. In patients with advanced disease, symptomatic treatment with the regular use of either short- or long-acting sympathomimetic and/or anticholinergic bronchodilators, singly or in combination, should be added to smoking cessation and influenza and pneumococcal vaccination therapies. An inhaled corticosteroid, either alone or more commonly in combination with a long-acting bronchodilator, can further reduce exacerbations and improve the health status of these patients. Furthermore, patients with severe COPD, particularly those who are debilitated, should be considered for pulmonary rehabilitation because these programs have been proven useful in maintaining, or in some cases improving, health status for these patients. Finally, correction of resting arterial hypoxemia with oxygen therapy for more than 15 h/d prolongs survival of COPD patients for those with a resting PaO2 lower than 55 to 60 mm Hg.

Education and Safety Considerations

Panel Discussion

The panel agreed that for all patients receiving home oxygen therapy, there was no acceptable alternative to providing patients and their caregivers appropriate education related to adherence to their oxygen prescription, proper use and troubleshooting of oxygen equipment, oxygen safety education, and education on self-management. These were recurring topics of discussion for all population, intervention, comparison, and outcome questions. The panel agreed that these recommendations applied to patients using LTOT as well as to ambulatory oxygen users. A best-practice statement was included to address these recommendations.

Safety education should be provided to patients and caregivers to avoid tripping and falls and to decrease fire risk by not smoking or allowing smoking inside the home, to avoid the use of inline devices, to avoid activities around an open flame or spark, and to avoid the use of nonpetroleum nasal products. For LOX users, patients should be provided product information that includes instructions on avoiding skin burns from contact with any of the frosted parts on LOX-device connectors. The panel agreed that patients also need guidance on transporting and traveling safely with oxygen.

Access to oxygen for patients who continue to smoke varies globally. In some regions, smoking is an absolute contraindication to home oxygen therapy; the BTS recommends advising the patient that oxygen provides limited clinical benefit for those who continue to smoke. Smoking safety is now inclusive of e-cigarettes, or vaping, on the basis of reported burn accidents in e-cigarette smokers receiving home oxygen therapy. Included in safety concerns is establishment of back-up devices for emergencies or loss of power. Current smokers or caregiver smokers should receive education and support for treatment of tobacco dependence (referral to appropriate resources).

Educational support is necessary for patients and caregivers and should be tailored to patients' health literacy and cultural contexts. Current practice does not consistently include effective evaluation and support of the oxygen-using patient by healthcare providers or oxygen delivery personnel to ensure adequate education and return demonstration of their ability to use their prescribed devices (teaching back) both in the home and ambulatory settings. Other considerations include access to appropriate equipment based on patients' physical, physiologic, and lifestyle and/or mobility needs. Clinical support for monitoring at home by nurses and respiratory therapists is rare in the United States but common in other regions. The panel agreed that patients should be advised to bring their portable device to healthcare visits to assess its effectiveness and to reinforce self-management.

### Diagnosis and outpatient management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a review [^5fa40f2d]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

There are 30 million adults (12%) in the United States who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease accounts for 3.2% of all physician office visits annually and is the fourth leading cause of death (126 000 deaths per year). Most patients are diagnosed by their primary care clinicians who must address the highly variable clinical features and responses to therapy. The diagnosis and treatment of COPD is rapidly changing, so understanding recent advances is important for the delivery of optimal patient care.

Observations

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by incompletely reversible expiratory airflow limitation. Spirometry is the reference standard for diagnosing and assessing the severity of COPD. All patients should be counseled about and receive preventive measures such as smoking cessation and vaccination. Treatment should be guided by the severity of lung impairment, symptoms such as dyspnea, the amount of cough and sputum production, and how often a patient experiences an exacerbation. When dyspnea limits activity or quality of life, COPD should be treated with once- or twice-daily maintenance long-acting anticholinergic and β-agonist bronchodilators. Patients with acute exacerbations may benefit from the addition of inhaled corticosteroids, particularly those with elevated peripheral eosinophil levels. Pulmonary rehabilitation, which includes strength and endurance training and educational, nutritional, and psychosocial support, improves symptoms and exercise tolerance but is underutilized. Supplemental oxygen for patients with resting hypoxemia (defined as Spo2 < 89%) improves survival.

Conclusions and Relevance

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a complicated disease requiring intensive treatment. Appropriate use of long-acting maintenance bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and pulmonary rehabilitation decreases symptoms, optimizes functional performance, and reduces exacerbation frequency. Supplemental oxygen in patients with resting hypoxemia prolongs life, and other advanced treatments are available based on specific patient characteristics.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^810af859]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up assessment — smoking status, measurements, imaging, and comorbidities — includes the following: At each visit, the current smoking status and smoke exposure should be determined followed by appropriate action. Decline in FEV1 can be tracked by spirometry performed at regular intervals (e.g., yearly) and a timed walking test (6-minute walking distance or shuttle-walking test) provides additional information regarding prognosis. Measurement of oxygenation at rest in an arterial blood gas sample may help identify patients who will benefit from supplemental oxygen to improve both symptoms and survival in those with severe resting hypoxemia. If there is a clear worsening of symptoms, imaging may be indicated, and when exacerbations are repeatedly characterized by purulent sputum, patients should be investigated for bronchiectasis. Symptoms that may indicate the development or worsening of a comorbid condition should be recorded and, if present, an appropriate diagnostic work-up should follow.

### Oxygen for breathlessness in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who do not qualify for home oxygen therapy [^9ec96fa5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Breathlessness is a cardinal symptom of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is given to improve survival time in people with COPD and severe chronic hypoxaemia at rest. The efficacy of oxygen therapy for breathlessness and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in people with COPD and mild or no hypoxaemia who do not meet the criteria for LTOT has not been established.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of oxygen versus air in mildly hypoxaemic or non-hypoxaemic patients with COPD in terms of (1) breathlessness; (2) HRQOL; (3) patient preference whether to continue therapy; and (4) oxygen-related adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase, to 12 July 2016, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We handsearched the reference lists of included articles.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs of the effects of non-invasive oxygen versus air on breathlessness, HRQOL or patient preference to continue therapy among people with COPD and mild or no hypoxaemia (partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2) > 7.3 kPa) who were not already receiving LTOT. Two review authors independently assessed articles for inclusion in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently collected and analysed data. We assessed risk of bias by using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias tool'. We pooled effects recorded on different scales as standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects models. Lower SMDs indicated decreased breathlessness and reduced HRQOL. We performed subanalyses and sensitivity analyses and assessed the quality of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

Compared with the previous review, which was published in 2011, we included 14 additional studies (493 participants), excluded one study and included data for meta-analysis of HRQOL. In total, we included in this review 44 studies including 1195 participants, and we included 33 of these (901 participants)in the meta-analysis. We found that breathlessness during exercise or daily activities was reduced by oxygen compared with air (32 studies; 865 participants; SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.21; I² = 37%; low-quality evidence). This translates to a decrease in breathlessness of about 0.7 points on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale. In contrast, we found no effect of short-burst oxygen given before exercise (four studies; 90 participants; SMD 0.01, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.28; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). Oxygen reduced breathlessness measured during exercise tests (25 studies; 442 participants; SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.22; I² = 29%; moderate-quality evidence), whereas evidence of an effect on breathlessness measured in daily life was limited (two studies; 274 participants; SMD -0.13, 95% CI, -0.37 to 0.11; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). Oxygen did not clearly affect HRQOL (five studies; 267 participants; SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.26; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). Patient preference and adverse events could not be analysed owing to insufficient data.

Authors' Conclusions

We are moderately confident that oxygen can relieve breathlessness when given during exercise to mildly hypoxaemic and non-hypoxaemic people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who would not otherwise qualify for home oxygen therapy. Most evidence pertains to acute effects during exercise tests, and no evidence indicates that oxygen decreases breathlessness in the daily life setting. Findings show that oxygen does not affect health-related quality of life.

### Home oxygen therapy for treatment of patients with… [^fa6a8184]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical Scenario A 70-year-old woman has had worsening chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for 20 years. She asks if she would benefit from long-term supplemental oxygen therapy. Her resting arterial blood gases show an oxygen saturation of 91 percent. Clinical Question Should patients with COPD and moderate hypoxemia receive continuous home oxygen therapy. Evidence-Based Answer There is good evidence that the addition of home long-term continuous oxygen therapy for COPD increases survival rates in patients with severe hypoxemia but not in patients with moderate hypoxemia or nocturnal desaturation. Practice Pointers Continuous oxygen therapy is indicated in patients with COPD and severe hypoxemia.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, formerly known as the Health Care Financing Administration, provides guidelines for supplemental oxygen therapy and sets the standard for nearly all adult oxygen prescriptions, whether the patient has Medicare or a managed care provider. 2 According to these standards, oxygen therapy is covered for patients with a documented PaO 2 of up to 55 mm Hg or a saturation of oxygen in arterial blood of up to 88 percent on room air at rest. Most insurers, including Medicare, will allow a prescription for home oxygen therapy for up to 99 months. CMS allows oxygen therapy for patients with an SaO 2 of up to 89 percent if they have a coexisting clinical condition. Cochrane Abstract Background. Domiciliary oxygen therapy has become one of the major forms of treatment for patients with hypoxemic COPD.

Objectives. To determine the effect of domiciliary oxygen therapy on survival and quality of life in patients with COPD. Search Strategy. The authors 1 searched randomized, controlled trials using the Cochrane Airways Group COPD register and the search term "home OR domiciliary AND oxygen". Selection Criteria. RCTs of patients with hypoxemia and COPD that compared long-term domiciliary or home oxygen therapy with a control treatment were included. Data Collection and Analysis. Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers. Primary Results. Five RCTs were identified. Data were aggregated from two trials of nocturnal oxygen therapy in patients with mild to moderate COPD and arterial desaturation at night. Data could not be aggregated for the three other trials because of differences in trial design and patient selection.

In a study of continuous oxygen therapy versus nocturnal oxygen therapy, there was a significant improvement in mortality rates after 24 months. In a study comparing domiciliary oxygen therapy with no oxygen therapy, there was a significant improvement in mortality rates over five years in the group receiving oxygen therapy. Two studies comparing nocturnal oxygen therapy with no oxygen therapy in patients with COPD and arterial desaturation at night found no difference in mortality rates between treated and nontreated groups; this difference was noted in each trial separately and when data from the trials were aggregated. In a study of long-term oxygen therapy versus no oxygen therapy in patients with moderate hypoxemia, no effect on survival was found in up to three years of follow-up.

### Home oxygen therapy for adults with chronic lung disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^8aa50068]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

There was very-low-quality evidence on the effects of LTOT on healthcare use. One retrospective study found fewer hospitalizations over 3 years for participants using LTOT compared with conventional therapy (mean difference [MD], −1.17; 95% CI, −1.73 to −0.59). An observational study did not find a reduction in admission risk once patients began receiving LTOT (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.15 to 3.30). There was a 35% reduction in hospital-bed days per patient year of follow-up in patients receiving LTOT, but this was not statistically significant (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.40 to 1.05).

For the outcome of safety, the systematic review identified cases of fires, burns from smoking around oxygen equipment, nosebleeds, and tripping over the equipment. For all COPD Medicare beneficiaries who used home oxygen (LTOT, exertion only or sleep only), those who had an emergency room visit for a burn injury were twice (odds ratio [OR], 2.43; 95% CI, 1.57–3.78) as likely to be prescribed oxygen in the preceding 90 days compared with those without burn injury. The LOTT trial found that for every 100 person-years the rate of fires was 0.08, the rate of burns from smoking around oxygen equipment was 0.12, the rate of burns from oxygen around an open flame was 0.04, the rate of burns from LOX frost was 0.16, the rate of nosebleeds was 0.35, and the rate of tripping or falling over oxygen equipment was 0.90. These safety data from LOTT were for participants with moderate hypoxemia who were prescribed continuous oxygen or oxygen during both exertion and sleep.

Panel judgments

Desirable consequences and their magnitudes (benefits)

The panel concluded that the size of the desirable anticipated effects on mortality is large. LTOT was associated with decreased 2-year and 5-year mortality (critical outcome). There was insufficient evidence to evaluate the effects of LTOT on healthcare use or other important outcomes.

Undesirable consequences and their magnitudes (harms)

The panel concluded that there is a moderate level of undesirable anticipated effects of LTOT. Patients report a physical and mental burden of using oxygen equipment with reduced ability to travel outside of the home, difficulty obtaining information about appropriate access to oxygen equipment during travel, and equipment noise from the use of stationary oxygen equipment, affecting sleep.

### Home oxygen therapy for adults with chronic lung disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^487bec54]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Five million adults live with chronic lung disease in the United States, with more than one million prescribed LTOT, defined as oxygen prescribed for at least 15 h/d. The rationale for the provision of LTOT in adults is based on the survival benefit reported by two randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published over three decades ago in patients with COPD and severe, chronic hypoxemia. Since then, an additional clinical trial has examined the role of home oxygen therapy in patients with COPD and moderate resting hypoxemia or exertion-only hypoxemia (LOTT [Long-Term Oxygen Therapy Trial]).

Although several professional societies and groups have published clinical practice guidelines for home oxygen therapy, most have not incorporated the recent LOTT results. Recent data highlight significant differences in home oxygen needs and experiences across patients with different lung diseases, lifestyles, and oxygen supply requirements. For example, the physiologic mechanisms of hypoxemia differ between obstructive and restrictive lung diseases. The rapid and steep rate of exertional desaturation for patients with ILD differs from that of those with COPD. These considerations highlight the need for guidelines specific to individuals with COPD and ILD, the two major diagnosis entities for which oxygen therapy is prescribed.

The 2017 American Thoracic Society (ATS) workshop on optimizing home oxygen therapy identified the lack of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for appropriate use of home oxygen as a critical gap in the care of patients. Workshop proceedings suggested a need for additional research on portable oxygen technology, advocacy for improved financing of oxygen therapy, and updated guidelines to guide policy, advocacy, and practice, as none currently exist in the United States.

Our aim was to conduct a rigorous and systematic review and develop clinical guidelines targeting healthcare providers who care for adults living with chronic lung disease who need oxygen in the community outside of inpatient and emergency settings. In applying these guidelines, clinicians should use an interactive, shared decision-making approach to ensure oxygen prescriptions meet the needs of individual patients by considering physiology, lifestyle, and treatment preferences. The systematic review underpinning this guideline did not specifically address supplemental oxygen use for patients with acute hypoxemia or for patients with signs of cor pulmonale, pulmonary hypertension (PH), or polycythemia. However, the panel agreed that clinical guidance related to hypoxemia and PH should be included when pertinent to each question.

### When should I be considering home oxygen for my patients? [^f32a495c]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The ability to provide oxygen in a patient's home can offer enormous benefits, including improvements in life expectancy when given in the appropriate setting. Confusingly, however, home oxygen is available in many forms, including long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT), ambulatory oxygen therapy (AOT), palliative oxygen therapy (POT) and short-burst oxygen therapy (SBOT) — each with varying degrees of supporting evidence. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) has recently published new guidance on home oxygen therapy, after collating the available evidence. This article aims to summarise those guidelines, focusing on who should and should not be considered for oxygen therapy. Although the BTS guidelines target a UK audience, many of the principles covered below are applicable internationally, even if the availability of certain oxygen modalities and supporting service arrangements may vary between different healthcare systems.

### Treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: guidelines… [^0236a95a]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- For stable COPD, LAMAs are the most effective monotherapy.
- For continued symptoms despite LAMA monotherapy, consider adding a LABA, followed by an ICS.
- In COPD exacerbations, adding antibiotics to oral corticosteroids reduces treatment failure but does not reduce repeat exacerbations or mortality.
- Supplemental oxygen is only beneficial for patients with severe resting hypoxemia. From the AFP Editors Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a devastating disease affecting more than 16 million Americans, and the third leading cause of death globally. Mortality from COPD has increased over the past 50 years, and mortality in women has surpassed that in men. The U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs and U. S. Department of Defense published guidelines for the primary care management of COPD. Diagnosis Treatment for COPD can be started based on symptoms. Spirometry can be used later for confirmation of the diagnosis.

Stable COPD Treatment Long-acting bronchodilators are the primary maintenance therapy for stable COPD because they decrease dyspnea and exacerbations while improving quality of life. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists reduce exacerbations and hospitalizations more than long-acting beta agonists, with fewer adverse events, and are the most effective monotherapy. No LAMA formulation appears to be more effective than any other. Monotherapy with an inhaled corticosteroid is less effective than either LABA or LAMA monotherapy and increases the risk of candidiasis, hoarseness, and pneumonia. With continued symptoms despite treatment with a LAMA, consider adding a second medication. This is an individual decision due to a lack of criteria for adding medications. Individuals on LAMA monotherapy with continued symptoms may benefit from adding a LABA without increased harms, although improvements may not be clinically significant.

In contrast, ICS/ LABA combination therapy is less effective than LAMA monotherapy and increases the risk of pneumonia with a number needed to harm of 50 over one year. Adding an ICS to LABA/LAMA combination therapy further reduces exacerbations, with a number needed to treat of 38, but increases pneumonia risk with an number needed to harm of 195. After two years of triple therapy without exacerbations, consider withdrawing the ICS if the peripheral eosinophil count is less than 300 cells per μL. Treating Exacerbations Oral corticosteroids are standard for treating COPD exacerbations, but the benefit of antibiotic therapy is less clear. Although antibiotic therapy reduces treatment failure during the exacerbation, there is no improvement in mortality or reduction of repeat exacerbations. Antibiotic treatment increases the risks of diarrhea and antimicrobial resistance. Using C-reactive protein to guide antibiotic therapy does not improve outcomes.

Supplemental Oxygen Supplemental oxygen reduces mortality in patients with chronic stable resting severe hypoxemia, which is defined as an oxygen saturation of 88% or less or partial pressure of oxygen less than 55 mm Hg. Although effects of supplemental oxygen are less clear in moderate hypoxemia, defined as an oxygen saturation of 89% to 90% or Pao 2 between 56 and 59 mm Hg, supplemental oxygen is recommended if signs of hypoxia such as polycythemia, pulmonary hypertension, or cor pulmonale are present. Supplementary oxygen does not appear to be effective for hypoxemia that only occurs with exertion. Editor's Note: Dr. Buelt is a member of the 2021 VA/DoD Management of COPD Guideline Working Group.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^7cbe5c94]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Prevention and management of COPD — long-term oxygen therapy: In patients with severe resting chronic hypoxemia (PaO2 ≤ 55 mmHg or < 60 mmHg if there is cor pulmonale or secondary polycythemia), long-term oxygen therapy improves survival. In patients with stable COPD and resting or exercise-induced moderate desaturation, long-term oxygen treatment should not be prescribed routinely, and individual patient factors must be considered when evaluating the patient's need for supplemental oxygen.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^d5c2557c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is described as having cost with few adverse clinical effects, with the major hazard being fires or explosions, and prescribing LOTT for current smokers is controversial. We recommend: Studies that measure the effects of LTOT on outcomes in various COPD subtypes. Examples of subtypes that warrant evaluation include patients with mild and moderate hypoxemia, desaturation with exertion, desaturation during sleep, comorbid heart disease, frequent exacerbations, decreased exercise capacity, or pulmonary hypertension. Studies that evaluate the effect of LTOT on physical activity and the relationship of this effect on other outcomes, such as quality of life, frequency of exacerbations, and mortality. Studies that compare the effects of various modalities of LTOT (e.g., continuous, exercise, sleep, combined, with or without flow titration) on outcomes in different patient subtypes.

### Translating new understanding into better care for the patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^606cad99]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

Despite an enormous amount of research and many official statements, the definition, diagnosis, and staging of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remain inconsistent, and we have yet to agree on who should be tested with spirometry or on where and how to do it. We know that inflammation, not just airflow limitation, is important in determining the course of COPD, especially with respect to exacerbations. We can detect and treat alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, an under-recognized condition, but whether alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy affects the disease's clinical course remains unclear. Smoking cessation is the most important of all interventions for COPD, with proven techniques and adjuncts, but implementation remains difficult and success rates are disappointingly low. Similarly, pulmonary rehabilitation has well-documented benefits but is grossly underutilized because it is difficult to pay for and is not made available to most patients. Symptoms, costs, and other outcomes can be improved through comprehensive disease management, including the use of practice guidelines, yet multiple barriers prevent the potential benefits of these interventions to patients from being realized. Many patients who do not meet threshold oxygenation criteria for oxygen therapy during the daytime desaturate during sleep, but evidence that nocturnal oxygen administration benefits these patients is lacking. However, other sleep-related breathing disorders are common in COPD patients. Lung volume reduction surgery has recently been shown to improve function and survival for certain COPD patients, but lung transplantation has generally been disappointing. New pharmaceutical agents are being developed for treating COPD, and at least one of them (tiotropium) should soon be available in the United States. Noninvasive ventilation is effective in treating acute decompensations of COPD and should be the standard of care in that setting; evidence supporting its use in stable patients with end-stage disease is scant. Appropriate palliative care can greatly benefit patients and their families in the terminal phase of COPD and needs to be more widely applied.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: from unjustified nihilism to evidence-based optimism [^9939213f]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been associated with a nihilistic attitude. On the basis of current evidence, this nihilistic attitude is totally unjustified. The disease must be viewed through the lens of a new paradigm: one that accepts COPD as not only a pulmonary disease but also as one with important measurable systemic consequences. COPD is not only preventable but also treatable. Smoking cessation, oxygen for hypoxemic patients, lung reduction surgery for selected patients with emphysema, and noninvasive ventilation during severe exacerbations have all been shown to impact on mortality. In addition, pulmonary rehabilitation, pharmacologic therapy, and lung transplantation improve patient-centered outcomes such as health-related quality of life, dyspnea, exercise capacity, and even exacerbations and hospitalizations. Caregivers should familiarize themselves with the multiple complementary forms of treatment and individualize therapy to the particular situation of each patient. The future for patients with this disease is bright as its pathogenesis and clinical and phenotypic manifestations are unraveled. The advent of newer and more effective therapies will lead to a decline in the contribution of this disease to poor world health.

### Oxygen therapy in COPD [^5a14befc]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is a mainstay treatment for patients with severe resting hypoxemia secondary to chronic respiratory conditions including COPD. The evidence for LTOT is based on two trials that are now several decades old but have been insufficiently revisited. Therefore, many questions remain about precisely which patients experience the most benefit from LTOT, as well as how to define that benefit. Most studies have examined LTOT's effect on longevity rather than its impact on quality of life. In addition, many challenges exist in training both clinicians and patients on best practices for LTOT and associated equipment. Reimbursement policies have reduced the kinds of equipment available to the LTOT patient community, presenting additional challenges. This paper will review the current evidence for LTOT in COPD, the challenges involved with providing optimal therapy, and potential avenues of modernizing this essential intervention.

### Managing COPD exacerbations in primary care [^feb0f551]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common but underdiagnosed lung condition that is frequently managed inappropriately. It impacts poorest communities most, where health inequalities are greatest. New acute symptoms of breathlessness, cough, sputum production and wheeze should prompt clinical suspicion of underlying COPD in someone who is a current or ex-smoker (or has exposure to other risk factors) and be followed by referral for quality-assured spirometry once recovered. Management of COPD exacerbations in primary care includes use of short-acting bronchodilators if mild, and antibiotics and a short course of oral prednisolone if moderate/severe. Hospital at home schemes are safe and effective and should be considered for some patients exacerbating in the community; these are increasingly supported by remote monitoring ('virtual wards'). New or worsening hypoxia is an indication for hospital admission and therefore oxygen saturation monitoring is an important part of exacerbation management; clinicians should be aware of patient safety alerts around use of pulse oximeters. Exacerbations drive poor health status and lung function decline and therefore asking about exacerbation frequency at planned reviews and taking action to reduce these is an important part of long-term COPD care. An exacerbation is an opportunity to ensure that fundamentals of good care are addressed. Patients should be supported to understand and act on exacerbations through a supported self-management plan; prompt treatment is beneficial but should be balanced by careful antibiotic and corticosteroid stewardship. COPD rescue packs on repeat prescription are not recommended.

### Oxygen therapy in COPD [^269f8172]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) at home has been demonstrated to improve survival in patients with COPD and severe resting hypoxemia. Support for LTOT is based on 2 landmark trials published nearly 4 decades ago. These results form the basis for reimbursement and prescription of LTOT to this day. Recent work has demonstrated no outcome benefit of LTOT in stable COPD patients with moderate desaturation at rest or during activity. Oxygen therapy during activity and exercise has been shown to alleviate symptoms and maintain arterial oxygen saturation, but not improve long-term outcomes. Oxygen therapy in COPD has a number of physiologic, functional, and biologic effects, not all of which are completely understood. Oxygen therapy in exacerbations of COPD can be both helpful and harmful. New guidance on the use of oxygen therapy during pre-hospital care has been published in the United Kingdom. Technology for LTOT represents a challenge for physicians writing prescriptions, durable medical equipment suppliers, caregivers, and patients. New technology for automated control of LTOT shows promise but is hampered by regulatory processes and cost pressures. Recent changes in government reimbursement for home oxygen therapy also present challenges. This paper will review the current evidence regarding LTOT in COPD and the impact on mortality and functional outcomes as well as reviewing technological challenges.

Evidence supporting a reduction in mortality with pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacotherapy in COPD patients — randomized clinical trial (RCT) data show that single inhaler triple therapy compared to dual long-acting bronchodilator (LABD) therapy achieved a relative risk reduction with IMPACT: HR 0.72 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.99) and ETHOS: HR 0.51 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.80) in symptomatic people with a history of frequent and/or severe exacerbations. For smoking cessation, the hazard ratio for the usual care group compared to the intervention group was HR 1.18 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.37). Pulmonary rehabilitation showed mortality effects with old trials RR 0.28 (95% CI 0.10, 0.84) and new trials RR 0.68 (95% CI 0.28, 1.67) in patients hospitalized for exacerbations of COPD (during or ≤ 4 weeks after discharge). Long-term oxygen therapy demonstrated NOTT: ≥ 19 hours of continuous oxygen vs ≤ 13 hours: 50% reduction and MRC: ≥ 15 hours vs no oxygen: 50% reduction among patients with PaO2 ≤ 55 mmHg or < 60 mmHg with cor pulmonale or secondary polycythemia. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) reported 12% in NPPV (high inspiratory positive airway pressure [IPAP] level) and 33% control HR 0.24 (95% CI 0.11, 0.49) in stable COPD with marked hypercapnia, and lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) yielded 0.07 deaths/person-year (LVRS) vs 0.15 deaths/ person-year (UC) RR for death 0.47 (p = 0.005).

Smoking cessation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — International organizations recommend tobacco cessation for all adults with COPD, citing it as the most effective intervention in reducing COPD progression and morbidity; smoking cessation is the only evidence-based intervention that improves COPD prognosis by ameliorating the annual decline in lung function, reducing cough and sputum production, improving health-related quality of life, and reducing COPD exacerbations. Programs may include advice to quit, pharmacologic therapies or counseling, and reported smoking cessation rates ranging from 8.8% to 34.5% vary by strategy; exacerbation frequency and active smoking may independently result in lung function decline. We identified two observational evaluations of tobacco cessation effects on COPD exacerbations and two RCTs.

Description of the evidence and its quality

No studies were found that met our inclusion criteria. A 2001 Cochrane systematic review reported the results from one unpublished RCT in which severe resting room air hypoxemia was defined as a Pa O 2 of 45–60 mm Hg (6.0–8.0 kPa), slightly above our prespecified cutoff of Pa O 2 ≤ 55 mm Hg (7.3 kPa) (Table E5). Because no other study was found reporting on our outcomes of interest, we elected to report these results. The study included 62 participants, 49 of whom had IPF. No significant difference in mortality between the LTOT and room air groups was observed after 1 year (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.15–1.61), 2 years (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 0.64–4.86), or 3 years (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.16–6.26). As this is an unpublished RCT, there is a high risk of bias and a very low GRADE quality of evidence for this outcome (Table E5).

No studies reported on dyspnea, fatigue, HRQL, physical activity, or healthcare resource use.

Because of the paucity of any direct evidence regarding patients with ILD, we chose to consider indirect evidence from our first population, intervention, comparison, and outcome question that considered patients with COPD and severe resting room air hypoxemia (,–).

Safety data specific to LTOT in patients with ILD were scarce. A qualitative study reported tripping as a hardship after being on oxygen for 9–12 months. The panel agreed that the safety data for COPD related to risks of tripping, burns, fires, nosebleeds, and transporting oxygen cylinders would also be potential safety concerns for patients with ILD on LTOT.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents a major health issue worldwide. For instance, while 4% of Canadians aged 35 to 79 self-reported being diagnosed with COPD, direct measurements of lung function from the Canadian Health Measures Survey indicate that 13% of Canadians had a lung function score indicative of COPD. Among individuals aged > 40 with a smoking history of at least 20 pack-years visiting a primary care physician for any reason, one in five met spirometric criteria for COPD. COPD represents the fourth leading cause of mortality in Canada. Continuous (i.e. long-term) oxygen therapy (LTOT) is one of the few components of the management of COPD that improves survival and it is only indicated in patients with severe daytime hypoxemia. LTOT is usually provided by a stationary oxygen concentrator and should be used for at least 15 h a day.

In addition, the NOTT and MRC trials used slightly different definitions of "chronic". In the NOTT study, chronic was defined as meeting the definition of severe hypoxemia on "at least two occasions more than 1 week apart over a 3-week observation period" while the patient was free of exacerbations. In the MRC study, chronic was defined as meeting the Pa O 2 -based criteria for hypoxemia on "two repeated measurements at least 3 weeks apart".

For implementation purposes, we define chronic resting hypoxemia as resting hypoxemia in the absence of a reversible cause. Although the NOTT and MRC trials used definitions that required repeated measures 3 weeks apart, this may not be possible or necessary in clinical practice (for instance, for a patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [IPF] who has resting hypoxemia as a result of progressive lung disease, without reversible cause). This differs from the patient who is discharged from the hospital after a COPD exacerbation, in which case resolution of resting hypoxemia may occur over time and reassessment of oxygen needs is important to avoid unnecessary treatment with oxygen.

Reassessment of patients' oxygen needs after an acute exacerbation is critical. Respiratory exacerbations (in some cases accompanied by pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or heart failure) usually increase oxygen requirements (e.g. require higher flows to maintain an Sp O 2 of at least 90%). In addition, the pace at which patients recover partially or fully from their respiratory exacerbations varies and can range from days to months, and their oxygen requirements may therefore vary over time. Moreover, a substantial proportion (perhaps as many as 50%) of patients who are initiated on home oxygen at the time of a respiratory exacerbation may recover sufficiently to no longer have a clinical indication for home oxygen. Patient education (e.g. how to use new equipment, how to titrate oxygen flow to evolving requirements), oxygen prescriptions, and communication with other providers (e.g. primary care and home health agencies) would need to match the requirements for home oxygen after a respiratory exacerbation.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease follow-up and referral considerations — if appropriate, pulmonology referral is listed, and if the answer is "No" to prior steps leading to Box 11, consider need for oxygen if the patient has resting hypoxemia (refer to home oxygen clinic if appropriate). Ongoing care directives state to continue follow-up and monitoring, reassess severity periodically, consider pulmonary rehabilitation, consider medication adjustment if the patient is on an inhaled corticosteroid, consider offering referral to a pulmonologist or a palliative care specialist as appropriate for patients with persistent refractory dyspnea, and carefully consider alternatives to beta blockers for non-cardiac indications (e.g. HTN).

### Home oxygen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^287fdaf5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Two landmark trials conducted more than 35 years ago provided scientific evidence that, under very specific circumstances, long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) may prolong life. These two trials enrolled 290 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and severe daytime hypoxemia documented by direct arterial blood gas measurement. From that time, LTOT became a standard of care, and the indications for oxygen therapy expanded to include nocturnal oxygen therapy for isolated nocturnal oxygen desaturation, ambulatory oxygen to correct exercise-induced desaturation, and short-burst oxygen to relieve dyspnea. In most cases, the rationale for broadening the indications for oxygen therapy is that, if hypoxemia exists, correcting it by increasing the Fi O2 should help. However, with the exception of LTOT in severely hypoxemic patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, randomized controlled trials of oxygen therapy have failed to demonstrate clinically significant benefits. Also, adherence to LTOT is usually suboptimal. Important areas for future research include improving understanding of the mechanisms of action of supplemental oxygen, the clinical and biochemical predictors of responsiveness to LTOT, the methods for measuring and enhancing adherence to LTOT, and the cost-effectiveness of oxygen therapy. A standardization of terminology to describe the use of supplemental oxygen at home is provided.

Home oxygen therapy is supplemental oxygen used outside health care settings. In the US, an estimated 1. 5 million adults are receiving supplemental oxygen for respiratory disorders. 1 COPD and ILD represent the 2 major diagnoses for which oxygen therapy is prescribed in the US. Long-term oxygen therapy is oxygen used for at least 15 hours per day. Ambulatory oxygen is oxygen delivered during exercise or daily activities. The efficacy of home oxygen therapy for persons with chronic lung disease is extrapolated from a few, decades-old randomized clinical trials that were conducted prior to the era of modern bronchodilator pharmacotherapy and reported a survival benefit from long-term oxygen therapy among patients with COPD. 2–4.

### An observational study of the effects of smoking cessation earlier on the clinical characteristics and course of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^e4fe87cf]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

A unique perspective was presented in this study regarding the impact of smoking cessation on AECOPD patients. Furthermore, different smoking cessation time durations led to different clinical characteristics and treatment responses in patients with AECOPD. Symptoms, hypoxemia, CO 2 retention, and lung function impairment were less severe in patients who had stopped smoking for a long period of time as opposed to those who had stopped smoking for a short period of time. In addition, patients who had stopped smoking for a long period of time had a better improvement in phlegm, even with a lower intensity of treatment. Early smoking cessation not only prevents the harms caused by smoking, but also improves patients' health. Even for patients with small amounts of smoking, early cessation was beneficial and necessary.

Smoking cessation

Smoking cessation is one of the few interventions shown to reduce mortality in patients with COPD. However, there are relatively few data showing the benefits of smoking cessation in reducing exacerbations. In the Lung Health Study, there was no significant difference in the risk of hospital admission between current smokers and ex-smokers. Furthermore, Kessler et al. reported that smoking status had no effect on hospitalization risk, and Garcia-Aymerich et al. showed that current smoking was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization in a small cohort of patients with COPD, suggesting that patients with very advanced disease and high risk of hospital admission quit tobacco consumption as a result of their significant symptom load. By contrast, Godtfredson et al. reported that, in a large prospective population study in Denmark, previous smokers had a lower risk of hospitalization for COPD (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.18) compared with current smokers. Interestingly, tobacco consumption (low versus high) had no effect on hospital admission. This study is supported by a population study by Au et al. who reported a reduced risk of COPD exacerbations in ex-smokers compared with current smokers when adjusted for comorbidity, markers of COPD severity, and socioeconomic status (adjusted HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.87). Importantly, the duration of smoking abstinence significantly influenced the magnitude of the reduced exacerbation risk.

Long-term oxygen therapy

Although LTOT is well established as a treatment to improve survival in patients with COPD and hypoxemia, there was no effect on exacerbation or hospitalization rates in early studies. The benefits of LTOT in reducing acute healthcare utilization have been shown in the EFRAM cohort, with appropriate LTOT utilization being associated with lower risk of admission. Further evidence was given by Ringbaek et al. who showed in a Danish COPD cohort that LTOT reduced admission rates and hospital days by 23.8% and 31.2%, respectively.

Smoking cessation is the one of the most important ways to improve the prognosis of patients with respiratory disease. The Task Force on guidelines for smoking cessation in patients with respiratory diseases was convened to provide evidence-based recommendations on smoking cessation interventions in respiratory patients. Based on the currently available evidence and the consensus of an expert panel, the following key recommendations were made. 1) Patients with respiratory disease have a greater and more urgent need to stop smoking than the average smoker, so respiratory physicians must take a proactive and continuing role with all smokers in motivating them to stop and in providing treatment to aid smoking cessation. 2) Smoking cessation treatment should be integrated into the management of the patient's respiratory condition. 3) Therapies should include pharmacological treatment (i.e. nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion or varenicline) combined with behavioural support. 4) Respiratory physicians should receive training to ensure that they have the knowledge, attitudes and skills necessary to deliver these interventions or to refer to an appropriate specialist. 5) Although the cost of implementing these recommendations will partly be offset by a reduction in attendance for exacerbations, etc., a budget should be established to enable implementation. Research is needed to establish optimum treatment strategies specifically for respiratory patients.

(VII) Palliative care

Conventionally, the term 'palliative care' has been associated with end-of-life care for cancer. However, it is now becoming increasingly recognized that palliative care can be delivered to patients with severe COPD and must go hand-in-hand from the point of diagnosis to ensure the best healthcare outcomes. Several studies have pointed out that PR when initiated from the point of diagnosis decreased patient symptom burden, improved quality of life of patients and their caregivers, and reduced hospitalizations.

Symptoms at the end of life in COPD are as severe or even worse than those who have advanced cancer. Palliative care is an important component in the treatment of patients with severe COPD and has been shown to not only reduce the odds of 30-day readmission by up to 50%, but also reduce the odds of heart failure by 73%. Yet, palliative care in patients with COPD remains grossly underutilized. Community-based palliative care provision in COPD has been shown to be associated with lower 30-day readmission rates, but others have reported no benefit. Early integration of palliative care into COPD care models endorsing modern multidisciplinary approaches appears to be essential, but barriers to accessible, open and effective palliative care conversations between patients and healthcare professionals need to be addressed.

Breathlessness is a distressing symptom, uniformly faced at some point in the disease process in all patients with COPD. Although regular low-dose (< 30 mg/day) sustained release morphine is recommended as first-line pharmacological treatment for persistent breathlessness among patients with severe COPD, the results in the recent BEAMS study was disappointing. NIV may be used as a comfort measure for patients by minimizing adverse effects. Use of hand-held fan may offer some relief. The British Thoracic Society have designed and implemented a COPD Discharge Care Bundle, which comprises of the following components: (1) Review patients' medications and demonstrate use of inhalers, (2) Provide written self-management plan and emergency dry pack, (3) Access and offer referral for smoking cessation, (4) Access for suitability for pulmonary rehabilitation, (5) Arrange follow-up call within 72 h of discharge.

Finally, the minimal standard of care for all patients receiving home oxygen therapy must include education and training related to their oxygen equipment, oxygen safety, and self-management.

We urge the research community and funding agencies to work together to develop a stronger evidence base that will guide clinical practice for oxygen prescription. Of critical importance is the involvement of engineers and those in related fields who can combine creativity with applied science to develop methods of raising arterial blood oxygen content to normal levels, even during intense exercise, without the burdens associated with current oxygen delivery systems.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^855085ec]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Recognition that the burden of this disorder will continue to increase over the next 20 years despite medical intervention has stimulated new research into the underlying mechanisms, leading to a rational basis for evaluation of existing therapies, and has suggested novel treatment approaches. Tobacco exposure remains the main but not exclusive cause of COPD. Whether the lung is injured by changes in the balance of proteases and antiproteases, tissue damage by oxidative stress, or a combination of the two is still not known. The genetic basis of susceptibility to COPD is now being studied as is the role of computed tomography in the identification of structural damage in individuals with less symptomatic disease. Clinical diagnosis still relies heavily on an appropriate history confirmed by abnormal spirometry. Smoking cessation is possible in a substantial proportion of individuals with symptoms but is most effective if withdrawal is supported by pharmacological treatment. Treatment with long-acting inhaled bronchodilators and, in more severe disease, inhaled corticosteroids reduces symptoms and exacerbation frequency and improves health status. Rehabilitation can be even more effective, at least for a year after the treatment. Recent guidelines have made practical suggestions about how to optimise these treatments and when to consider addition of oxygen, surgery, and non-invasive ventilation. Regular review of this guidance is important if future management advances are to be implemented effectively.

The panel concluded the quality of evidence for effects on HRQL was moderate. The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) favored the use of LTOT at 4-month follow-up in those with both moderate resting and exertional desaturation (MD, −3.30; 95% CI, −6.50 to −0.10). However, no significant differences were found at 12-month follow-up or in those with only resting desaturation. There were no differences between groups in the Quality of Well-Being Scale.

In the LOTT study, the composite endpoint of time to death or first hospitalization was not significantly different between those in the LTOT group compared with those in the no-LTOT group in those with moderate hypoxemia at rest only (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.79–1.12) or in those with moderate hypoxemia at rest and desaturation with ambulation (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.72–1.27). No study that met our inclusion criteria directly reported on the effects of LTOT on other outcomes considered "important" by the guideline panel (dyspnea, physical activity, fatigue, or healthcare resource use) in participants with COPD and moderate hypoxemia at rest.

The LOTT trial reported fires, burns, nosebleeds, and tripping or falling over oxygen equipment in the study participants prescribed LTOT or oxygen during exertion and sleep; see description of results in question 1.

Panel judgments

### Understanding facilitators and barriers to oxygen therapy for patients with interstitial lung disease [^d11fb31b]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Background

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is comprised of a heterogenous group of pulmonary diseases, often characterised by the development of a progressive parenchymal fibrosis, leading to restrictive ventilatory patterns and, eventually, in the most severe forms, to respiratory failure and death. Management of ILD is complex; patients frequently experience diagnostic and referral delays, and require both pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic approaches. Recent national and international guidelines address the diagnosis and management of this complex condition. Oxygen therapy is used in patients with advanced lung disease with resting hypoxemia; however, there is limited evidence regarding its clinical efficacy for patients with ILD, and often data are extrapolated from studies in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This lack of evidence, particularly related to oxygen therapy in patients with exertional hypoxemia, has created discrepancies in clinical approaches and recommendations, causing a need for evidence-based guidelines focusing on patient-centred outcomes.

A recent modified Delphi survey of ILD experts determined that oxygen therapy should be recommended to patients with ILD who exhibit severe resting hypoxemia or exertional desaturation of SpO 2 to < 85%–89%, especially for those experiencing symptoms or reduced exercise capacity. Research has demonstrated that ambulatory oxygen improves breathlessness and cough symptoms in individuals with ILD that are not hypoxemic at rest, but develop exertional desaturation on exercise. International guidelines suggest that patients with ILD who experience a PaO 2 at or below 7.3 kPa (55 mm Hg), or a PaO 2 below 8.0 kPa (60 mm Hg) with pulmonary hypertension and breathlessness may benefit from at-home/ambulatory oxygen therapy. Moreover, the guidelines suggest that patients who show improvements in breathlessness and hypoxemia through the use of oxygen therapy should be considered for a prescription of supplemental oxygen. However, agencies that fund healthcare implement their own requirements for funding of oxygen therapy, with limited guidance on criteria identifying which patients should be provided oxygen. The process often requires extensive and repeated testing to qualify for and maintain supplemental oxygen therapy funding.

### Optimizing home oxygen therapy. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^b3142223]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2018). Medium credibility.

Table 5 — potential research questions to address gaps and barriers of optimal oxygen therapy identify priority topics with concrete examples. Technology questions include "What other oxygen delivery device options could be developed to raise inspired oxygen in addition to the existing Oxymizer pendant and Oxymizer mustache cannulas?" and "What cloud-based technology will measure effectiveness of oxygen therapy, patient activity levels, and adherence?" Health care resource utilization asks "What interventions would reduce overuse, underuse, and misuse of supplemental oxygen, and reduce the rates of emergency room visits and/or hospital admissions?" Education asks "Can tools for patients and clinicians to understand and interface with CMS and DMEs decrease clinician time, improve time to set up for oxygen patients, and improve adherence to prescribed oxygen therapy?" Reimbursement asks "Would a payment system based on DME quality metrics, results, and patient feedback improve DME oxygen services?" Additional sections include "Risk factors for nonadherence" with "How is successful oxygen adherence defined?" and "Criteria for oxygen in non-COPD populations" with "Investigate factors that determine which patients benefit from supplemental oxygen therapy".

### Four patients with a history of acute exacerbations of COPD: implementing the CHEST / Canadian Thoracic Society guidelines for preventing exacerbations [^78e0672c]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society have jointly produced evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This educational article gives four perspectives on how these guidelines apply to the practical management of people with COPD. A current smoker with frequent exacerbations will benefit from support to quit, and from optimisation of his inhaled treatment. For a man with very severe COPD and multiple co-morbidities living in a remote community, tele-health care may enable provision of multidisciplinary care. A woman who is admitted for the third time in a year needs a structured assessment of her care with a view to stepping up pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment as required. The overlap between asthma and COPD challenges both diagnostic and management strategies for a lady smoker with a history of asthma since childhood. Common threads in all these cases are the importance of advising on smoking cessation, offering (and encouraging people to attend) pulmonary rehabilitation, and the importance of self-management, including an action plan supported by multidisciplinary teams.
